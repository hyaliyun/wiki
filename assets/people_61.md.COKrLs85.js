The different types available include the pill, the patch and the vaginal ring, which are all widely available, and an injection, which is available in only some countries. They work by mainly suppressing luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and in turn preventing ovulation. The pill, patch, and vaginal ring are all about 93% effective with typical use. Beneficial health effects include reduced risks of ovarian, endometrial and colorectal cancers. CHC can also provide improved control of some menstrual problems. Adverse effects include a small but higher risk of venous thromboembolism, arterial thromboembolism, breast cancer and cervical cancer. ==Types== Microgynon - example of oral combined hormonal contraception Combined contraceptive patch NuvaRing - combined contraceptive vaginal ring Types of combined hormonal contraception include: Widely available * Combined oral contraceptive pill * Combined contraceptive patch * Combined contraceptive vaginal ring Available in only some countries * Combined injectable contraceptive,Hassan EO and El-Gibaly OM Combination injectable contraceptives for contraception : RHL commentary (last revised: 1 October 2009). The WHO Reproductive Health Library; Geneva: World Health Organization which is not available in the USA or UK. ==Medical use== Traditionally, to mimic a normal menstrual cycle, CHC is used for 21 consecutive days. For all of these methods (pill, patch, vaginal ring), these 21 days are typically followed by either 7 days of no use (for the pill, patch or vaginal ring) or 7 days of administration of placebo pills (for the pill only). During these 7 days, withdrawal bleeding occurs. For those individuals who do not desire withdrawal bleeding or require bleeding to be suppressed completely, medication regimens can be tailored to the individual with extended periods of use and infrequent hormone-free periods. The efficacy of CHC is the same whether these methods are used continuously or with a 7 day break to allow for withdrawal bleeding. ==Mechanism of action== Combined hormonal contraception works by acting on the hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian axis to suppress luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and in turn prevent ovulation. The addition of progesterone contributes to the contraceptive effect by making changes to the cervical mucus, endometrium and tubal motility. ==Effectiveness== The pill, patch and ring have similar effectiveness and this depends largely on the woman using it in the prescribed way. Other factors affecting effectiveness include drug interactions, malabsorption and body weight. ==Adverse effects== Although the risk of venous thromboembolism, arterial thromboembolism, breast cancer and cervical cancer in CHC users is small, all CHCs are associated with higher risks of these compared to no use. Given that the vast majority of the studies evaluating these associations have been observational studies, causation between CHC use and these conditions is unable to be determined. All CHCs are associated with an increased incidence of venous and arterial thromboembolism. However, those containing higher doses of estrogen are associated with an increase in venous and arterial thromboembolism.WHO  Medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use (2015) p.121-132 In addition, some formulations of progesterone, including gestodene, desogestrel, cyproterone acetate and drospirenone, in combination with estrogen, have been associated with higher rates of venous thromboembolism compared to formulations containing a type of progesterone called levonorgestrel. Other adverse effects include nausea, headaches, breast pain, skin pigmentation, irregular menstrual bleeding, absent periods and irritation from contact lenses. Changes in libido and mood, decline of liver function and raised blood pressure may also occur. ==Drug interactionsLiver enzyme inducing drugs=== Medications that induce liver enzymes increase the metabolism of oestradiol and progestogens and subsequently may reduce the effectiveness of CHC. The advice on CHC also depends on whether the liver inducing drug is used short term, for less than two months, or long term, for more than two months. ===Ulipristal acetate (ellaOne)=== Should a woman have taken ulipristal acetate (ellaOne) for emergency contraception, restarting CHC may reduce ellaOne's effectiveness, hence advice is to wait five days before commencing CHC. ===Antibiotics=== Extra contraceptive precautions are not necessary when using CHC in combination with antibiotics that do not induce liver enzymes, unless the antibiotics cause vomiting and/or diarrhoea. ===Antiepileptics=== Medications used in the treatment of epilepsy can interact with the combined pill, patch or vaginal ring, resulting in both pregnancy and shift in seizure threshold. Lamotrigine Based on a study of 16 women using oral CHC 30 μg ethinyloestradiol/150 μg levonorgestrel and anti-epileptic drug lamotrigine for 6 weeks, it was revealed that the contraceptive effectiveness could be lowered, despite lamotrigine not being an enzyme inducer. An assessment of risks versus benefits of CHC is recommended in women on lamotrigine who are considering CHC, as the seizure threshold in someone on lamotrigine may be lowered by the oestrogen in CHC. In a similar mechanism, stopping CHC in a woman on lamotrigine can cause lamotrigine toxicity. Long-acting reversible contraception instead may be preferable. ==Incorrect usage== If pills are missed or the ring or patch used incorrectly, the chance of pregnancy is increased. In the UK, the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare issue guidance for incorrectly used CHC pills, patches and rings. ==Special populations== Following childbirth, the use of CHC depends on factors such as whether the woman is breastfeeding and whether she has other medical conditions including superficial venous thrombosis and dyslipidaemia.WHO Medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use (2015) p. 7 ===Age=== When considering CHC use by age only, use is unrestricted between menarche and age 40, and can be generally used after age 40. ===Breastfeeding=== CHC should not be used by breastfeeding women in the first six weeks after delivery and are generally not recommended in the first six months after delivery if still breastfeeding. After six months, breastfeeding women may use CHC.WHO Medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use (2015) p. 28 ==Health benefits== CHCs may reduce the risk of ovarian, endometrial and colorectal cancer. Other possible benefits include regular and reduced menstrual bleeding, less pain, and control of premenstrual syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and endometriosis symptoms. ==Epidemiology== In the UK, one survey demonstrated that in 2010–2012, more than 33% of women aged 16–44 years had used oral contraception in the previous year and that it was mostly the combined type. ==History== CHC has been used worldwide for more than 60 years, with the first clinical trials on oral CHC beginning in 1956. The combined injectable contraceptive was developed in 1963 and by 1976, two types of these were in use. The study of CHC vaginal rings began in the early 1970s and the NuvaRing first became available in 2009. In 2003, the contraceptive patch became available, requiring re-application of a new one every week for three weeks, followed by one week without a patch. ==See also== * Progestogen-only contraception ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Skin patch or vaginal ring compared to pills for birth control, Cochrane review (2013) Category:Hormonal contraception Category:Family planning ","title":"Combined hormonal contraception"},{"id":"56809334","text":"is a Japanese football player.

He started practicing again at a ski resort in Slovenia in December 2017. His goal was to be prepared for the 2018 World Cup in Kranjska Gora. The competition was one of seven World Cup races before the season before the Games. He was coached by Roman Podlipnik. He also trained with Slovene deaf skier Anja Drev. His coach was happy in late December. Slivnik was recovering faster than expected from his shoulder injury. At the end of December 2017, he was the only Slovene to have earned the right to compete at the Paralympics. Because his recovery went so fast, he competed at a World Cup in Zagreb, Croatia in early December. This was in addition to the World Cup a week later in Slovenia. After his first run in Zagreb, he was in thirteenth position. He did not finish his second run. His coach was still happy with his performance. At the World Cup in Kranjska Gora, Slovenia, he finished his races. The World Cup was only a few days after the World Cup in Zagreb. While he finished thirteenth, his finishing the World Cup race was very important. It meant he completed all the things required of him to compete at the 2018 Winter Paralympics. After the race, his coach said, \\"\\"I congratulate Jernejo, because I know he has not been able to do it in the last few weeks. He was injured, but he did not finish the race in Zagreb, even though he was skiing well. Depending on the layout and the conditions on the track it worked well. I expect that now the preparations for the Paralympic Games will be relaxed and fully dedicated.\\" Slivnik said after qualifying for the Paralympics, \\"Before the first run there were some problems with the track, but the Kranjska Gora team did a great job and prepared a track that was excellent. In the second, the track was already slightly slapped. I made a little mistake, but I did not want to give in, I wanted to aim. I did it. I am glad that I have confirmed my departure for the Paralympic Games, as this idea of successfully passing the game was a long time in the head.\\" === Schedule and results === The first event on the para-alpine program is the downhill. It starts on 10 March, running from 9:30 AM to 1:30 PM. The second event on the program is Super-G. All skiers will race between 9:30 AM and 1:00 PM on 11 March. The super combined takes place on 13 March. The Super-G part of the event is in the morning. The slalom part is in the afternoon. The slalom event gets underway on 14 March and conclude on 15 March. Women and men both race during the same sessions in the morning. The afternoon sessions start with the women doing their second run. Then the men go.

The southern tip of the street (odd numbers till 9) faces the agreeable Jan Kochanowski Park. ==History== On an 1876 map by Paul Berthold Jaekel, as well as on an 1880 map, the axis is drawn, without any mention of the name. The first map to reference the street dates back to 1908,Pharus- Verlag GmbH, Berlin SW68, Lindenstr.3 where it is named Goethestraße. In Bromberg's address books, the lane is mentioned in 1905 as being under construction. The following year only three edifices are listed in Goethestraße : * the Kreishaus, today's Bydgoszcz Music Academy building, at the corner of Słowackiego Street, then Bismarkstraße; * a house at Goethestraße 8; * a building at Goethestraße 37, today's house at No.2. ===Naming=== Thepathway was known as Goethestraße, from its construction to 1920 and during German occupation (1939-1945). The name referred to the famous German writer and statesman Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832).

It was a commission from Oskar Unverferth, who ran a furniture factory. The designer was Fritz Weidner, a famous city architect in Bydgoszcz. Oskar Unverferth moved there in 1908 and remained landlord till 1922. The villa is characteristic of the Landhaus style that Fritz Weidner more than often applied to his realizations in Bydgoszcz. Myriad of architectural details on tits asymmetrical facades (bow windows, balconies, arches, Art Nouveau motifs), give to the edifice the charm of a country house. The house has been entirely refurbished in 2012.

The portal arch is covered on the inside with coffers and displays oval shaped openings so specific to Art Nouveau features.

He tasked Fritz Weidner, trendy Bromberg architect at that time, to realize a large building for renting purposes. The unbalanced facade, peculiar to Art Nouveau style, is studded with balconies, avant-corps and loggias, but the absence of other detailed motifs challenges the uniformity of the ensemble.

She lives and works in Paris. == Life == Lesueur was born at Cannes. She studied not at a photography academy but at the Villa Arson (\\"École Nationale Supérieure d'Arts à la Villa Arson\\") in Nice. While there she came to the realisation that photography would become her principal artistic medium. Her first personal exhibition took place in 1996. In 2000 she was a winner of the \\"Prix Ricard\\", and she was visual artist in residence at the Villa Medici during 2002/03. She has exhibited in a number of European countries, in the United States of America, South Korea and China. A retrospective of her work was produced by the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Geneva in 2011. Natacha Lesueur teaches at the Cantonal Art College at Lausanne and at the European Academy of Art at Rennes. == Work == Since 1993 the starting point for Natacha Lesueur's artistic output has been photographic. But even if the photography, in the final analysis, determines its own interaction with the finished piece, the structure of the work is built up like a painting in a succession of layers. The photographic image ends up fulfilling the role of a varnish on the totality of the composition. Many of her artistic priorities express themselves through the body, the appearance of its structure, and the intimate association sustained between flesh and food. Lesueur produces a series, whereby her works follow one another but without overtly resembling one another, unfolding in seemingly infinite variety, in terms of themes, trompe-l'œil and optical traps that resonate between each other to create an overall unity. Half of her photographic output juxtaposes the body with food. Examples include \\"aspics en guise de bonnets de bain\\" (\\"Aspics in the form of bathing caps\\" - 1997/98), \\"Peau de saumon comme résille de chignon\\" (Salmon skins as fishing nets), \\"ambes gainées de crépine de porc \\" (\\"Legs wrapped in membranes of pork\\" - 1997/98), \\"bouches dont les dents sont des graines de toutes sortes\\" (\\"human mouths with a diversity of seeds in place of teeth\\" - 2000). In other images women's bodies are marked with pearl imprints (1994–96), with eye-test charts (2000-2001), with a sleeping man's face inscribed with a pen (2004), carved finger nails (1997-2003), or women whose teeth are varnished with red, bursting into laughter. In a series she created between 2009 and 2011 she worked with the same fortyish year old model who was pregnant during (some of) this time, to re-evaluate the figure of the Brazilian actress Carmen Miranda, formerly used by Hollywood as an exotic caricature \\"prototype\\". She uses the body as a \\"writing/drawing surface\\" and a semi-regular backing for images of culinary preparations, footprints and/or portrait-sculptures. == References == Category:French women photographers Category:20th-century French photographers Category:21st-century French photographers Category:People from Cannes Category:People from Paris Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century women photographers Category:21st-century women photographers ","title":"Natacha Lesueur"},{"id":"56809468","text":"Rajpal Singh Shekhawat 12 November 1962 born and birthplace is Pachar, Sikar.

Masha photographed prolifically throughout most of her life, but she hoarded her photo-films in the attic and rarely developed them. Only when her daughter Asya found some 30,000 negatives in their attic in 2017 did Masha's works become public. In this regard, Masha Ivashintsova's work and story have been compared to those of Vivian Maier. Ivashintsova died in 2000 at the age of 58. == Personal life == Masha was born into an aristocratic family whose assets were seized following the Bolshevik Revolution. In Leningrad, Ivashintsova joined the city’s literary and artistic underground. She worked odd jobs as a theater critic, a librarian, a cloakroom attendant, an elevator mechanic, and a security guard, among others. Occasionally, she would visit Asya in Moscow. Masha was heavily engaged in the Leningrad poetic and photography of the 1960−80s.

It regulates the rights and obligations of the Catholic Church in areas of the Palestinian Authority, and reflects Holy See support of Palestinian aspirations for an independent state. ==Historical Background== The Holy See has been an ardent supporter of the Palestinian political struggle for an independent state ever since 1967. This support, in addition to the desire to gain support for the Catholic Church from within the Palestinian community in the Palestinian territories under Israeli control, led to a process of gradually growing cooperation between the Holy See and the PLO, and later also the Palestinian authority. One such step was the meeting of Pope John Paul II and PLO chairman Yasser Arafat in 1987. Following the establishment of the Palestinian Authority under the Oslo Accords, the Holy See embarked on negotiations with the Palestinian leadership in order to regulate Catholic Church activities under Palestinian control. This was done in parallel with negotiations with the Israeli Government to the same effect. Relations of special nature not defined as \\"diplomatic\\" were established between the Holy See and PLO on Oct. 26, 1994. Holy See-Palestinian negotiations have produced a basic agreement signed on Feb. 15, 2000,Text of the agreement in Acta Apostolicae Sedis, vol. 92 (2000) pp. 853-856 which committed the PLO to respect freedom of religion in general, as well as freedom of action for Catholic communities and establishments under Palestinian control. The need for a more comprehensive agreement led to the conclusion of such an agreement on June 26, 2015. The agreement went into effect on Jan. 2, 2016.Text of the agreement in Acta Apostolicae Sedis, vol. 108 (2016) pp. 168-185 ==Provisions of the agreement== The Comprehensive Agreement between the Holy See and the State of Palestine consists of 32 articles dealing with general principles of freedom of religion, organizational rights of the Catholic Church in Palestinian Authority areas, respect for holy places and personal status of Catholics. Its preamble shows support for Palestinian aspirations of independence by recognizing a \\"State of Palestine\\" that consists of all the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, including East Jerusalem. This stipulation has angered the Israeli government, that doesn't recognize the officially proclaimed State of Palestine. ==International reactionsIsrael=== The Israeli government deplored the conclusion of the agreement. Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman termed it as one-sided for not recognizing the rights of the Jewish people in what it termed \\"Land of Israel\\" as well as not taking into consideration the places in Jerusalem holy for Judaism. The Israeli statement also claimed that recognizing the Palestinian Authority as a state damages the peace process by strengthening Palestinian refusal to negotiate.Israeli response to Vatican recognition of PA as a state ==See also== * Holy See–Palestine relations ==ReferencesBibliography== * Leonard Hammer, \\"The 2015 Comprehensive Agreement Between the Holy See and the Palestinian Authority: Discerning the Holy See’s Approach to International Relations in the Holy Land\\" Oxford Journal of Law and Religion, vol. 6 (2017) pp. 162-179 *Comprehensive Agreement between the State of Palestine and the Holy See (2015).

This species is an important component of the diet of many species of fish and of cetaceans. It is taken as a bycatch in fisheries but has the potential to be commercially important if appropriate fishing methods can be developed. ==Description== Ornithoteuthis antillarum has a thin, elongated and muscular mantle which ends in a long, thinly-pointed tail. Its fins are also elongated and are arrow shaped, with sharp tips, concave rear margins and convex forward margins. The largest individual recorded had a mantle length of 300 mm and was from the more northerly extremity of the species' distribution. The length of the fins is more than half that of the mantle. Within the mantle cavity there are three visceral photophores, an oval, anal photophore, a posterior intestinal photophore and an elongated posterior visceral photophore which forms a strip. It has a broad head which is at least as wide as the mantle and there is an elongated photophore patch on the ventral surface of both eyes. The tentacular clubs have a sucker- bearing region which is approximately half of the length of the tentacles with large suckers on the manus with 18-20 widely separated sharp, round and curved teeth on the margin while the suckers on the dactylus are larger in the ventral series and smallest in the dorsal series. The sucker teeth are sexually dimorphic on all of the arms wuth the females having about 8 plate- like teeth in the proximal margin with the teeth becoming more numerous and pointed in the mid-arm while the males have large plate like teeth on the lateral margins of the mid-arm suckers. The fourth right arm is hectocotylised and has small distal suckers with the skin taking the form of a honeycomb on middle of the arm's ventral surface, this consists of 4 or 5 longitudinal lines of depressions each with 20 to 25 pores. ==Distribution== Ornithoteuthis antillarum is found in the tropical and subtropical waters of the eastern and western Atlantic, being found between 20°N and 25°S in the eastern Atlantic and from 40°N to 40°S in the western Atlantic. The type specimen was taken near Basse Terre, Guadeloupe. ==Habitat and biology== Ornithoteuthis antillarum is a pelagic, oceanic species which is thought to be commonest near continental slopes. It is at its most abundant at depths between 100m and 600 m. The paralarvae and adults are relatively common in the Gulf of Mexico, the Straits of Florida and in the Gulf Stream, extending south into the Caribbean Sea and to the waters over the continental slope off Brazil. It does not seem to be a schooling speciesbut sampling suggests that it is common from the middle of the water column to very near the bottom, although it has never been reported to sit on the bottom. In the Caribbean this species has been recorded at the surface at night, with many specimens being captured at night over deep bottom depths in the eastern South Atlantic between 100m and 600m in depth. Sampling also suggests that O. antillarum lives above the seabed during the day, dispersing upwards at night, a partial diel migrant. It is a fast swimmer, which enables it to avoid being caught in nets but it has been observed from submersibles and videoed. . It typically rests in the water column in a posture known as the “J” posture, this involves the squid hanging roughly head-down with its arms and tentacles curled and slightly spread back over the head and nearby mantle. O. antillarum is a fast-growing species and its maximum life span is 182 days. Growth rates, as measured on statolith increments which represent daily growth lines, slow markedly as the animal matures. The sex ratio is 1:1 and as the population matures it is believed that they undergo a spawning migration into areas associated with sea mounts. The earlier life stages are found in midwater in epipelagic to mesopelagic zones over slopes, tops and oceanic depths, then the sexually mature adults migrate waters associated with sea mounts and oceanic ridges to spawn on or near the bottom. The spermatophores are 9.0 mm in length and they are found in relatively low numbers compared to related species, with up to 100 but normally 50-60 present in the Needham's sac for each male. The eggs are very small, being 0.7 to 1.0 mm in diameter. They spawn intermittently in pulses or batches laying several egg masses over an extended time with the frequency of spawning and the amount of eggs per mass being roughly the same over the spawning period. The smaller females from the warmer waters of the tropical central-east Atlantic bear between 50 000 to 220 000 oocytes and eggs are laid intermittently in egg masses of up to 1,500 eggs over a spawning period which last from six weeks to three months. Spawning appears to occur throughout the year and there are peaks of spawning activity in April–May, August–September and December–January in the eastern-central Atlantic. O. antillarum preys on many different types of prey and each individual prey item has a low weight, the most common prey is amphipods but it also eats the larvae and fry of swuid and carnivorous fish. An individual with a mantle length of 140 mm was photographed from a submersible at 684 m in depth and a water temperature of 10.7 °C in the Bahamas eating an adult bristlemouth Gonostoma elongata, a midwater fish. Prey changes as the squid matures, the smaller individuals, with a mantle length of less than 4mm, mainly prey on copepods, however krill are probably are more important energetically but they are less frequently taken. One they attain a mantle length of greater than 4mm decapod crustaceans and cephalopods are the most important prey items. O. antillarum has a number of predators and these include epipelagic and mesopelagic fishes and they have been recorded in the diets of fish such as common dolphinfish (Coryphaena hyppurus), Atlantic sailfishes (Istiophorus albicans), skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamus), white marlin (Tetrapturus albidus), albacore (Thunnus alalunga), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus), swordfish (Xiphias gladius). They are also preyed upon by cetaceans) including the pygmy sperm whale (Kogia breviceps) and orca (Orcinus orca). With bony fish, O. antillarum are the most important component of the winter diet of yellowfin tuna off Brazil. It is parasitised mainly by didymozoid trematodes, however, the intensity of infection is much reduced compared to same-sized specimens of Sthenoteuthis pteropus. ==Fisheries== Ornithoteuthis antillarum is not a target species for fisheries but may be taken as bycatch, however, it could become a quarry species for commercial fisheries if a suitable fishing technique is developed, because this is a common species which could sustain a harvest and its flesh is firm, muscular and palatable. ==References== Category:Squid Category:Molluscs described in 1957 ","title":"Ornithoteuthis antillarum"},{"id":"56809811","text":"Anna Elisabeth Sarauw née Elberling (1839–1919) was a Danish textile artist who collaborated with Kristiane Konstantin-Hansen and Johanne Bindesbøll in running a successful embroidery business in Copenhagen. She designed sewing patterns, with naturalistic motifs and stylized Egyptian, Indian and Pompeiian figures. ==Biography== Born in Frederiknagore (now Serampore) in Danish India, Anna Elisabeth Elberling was the daughter of the Danish government representative Frederik Emil Elberling (1804–80) and Harriet Anna Fjellerup (1821–59). The oldest of nine children, she was brought up in the west of India. She learnt to sew as a child, completing a finely embroidered gown for her mother before she was 10 years old. The family moved back to Denmark in 1851. She helped to bring up her sisters, teaching them embroidery, especially after her mother's early death in 1859. In 1870, she married the estate administrator Carl Harald Sarauw (1839–1909) with whom she had four children. As an embroiderer, Sarauw was noted for her light touch and her talent for creating her own designs, some of which she sold commercially. She befriended Constantin Hansen and his daughters Elise and Kristiane. After they opened a needlework shop and studio together with Johanne Bindesbøll, she joined them to create their Kunstbroderiforretningen Konstantin-Hansen, Bindesbøll & Sarauw, commonly known simply as Boden. It is difficult to know which of the embroiderers created the various items but from Sarauw's sketchbooks it can be seen that many of her designs were inspired by her travels abroad. They include stylized figures from Egypt, Pompeii and India. She also created geometrical designs as well as rosettes and lilies. In 1878, she represented Boden at the Paris World Fair and in 1888 she participated in the Nordic Exhibition in Copenhagen where she received a medal for an embroidered box. In 1881, she left Boden and moved with her husband to Sorø. Anna Sarauw died in Vissenbjerg Sogn near Assens on 11 September 1919 and is buried in Sorø Cemetery. Her family maintains a large collection of her embroidered textiles, drawings and sewing patterns. ==References== Category:1839 births Category:1919 deaths Category:People from West Bengal Category:Artists from Copenhagen Category:19th-century Danish artists Category:Danish embroiderers Category:Danish women artists Category:Danish textile artists Category:19th- century women textile artists Category:19th-century textile artists ","title":"Anna Sarauw"},{"id":"56809815","text":"Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of SARS-CoV-2, speculated in 2020 as being the first real-world virus to create Disease X Disease X is a placeholder name that was adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2018 on their shortlist of blueprint priority diseases to represent a hypothetical, unknown pathogen that could cause a future epidemic. The WHO adopted the placeholder name to ensure that their planning was sufficiently flexible to adapt to an unknown pathogen (e.g. broader vaccines and manufacturing facilities). Director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Anthony Fauci stated that the concept of Disease X would encourage WHO projects to focus their research efforts on entire classes of viruses (e.g. flaviviruses), instead of just individual strains (e.g. zika virus), thus improving WHO capability to respond to unforeseen strains. In 2020, it was speculated, including among some of the WHO's own expert advisors, that COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus strain, met the requirements to be the first Disease X. ==Rationale== Jeremy Farrar, Chair of the WHO R&D; Blueprint Scientific Advisory Group In May 2015, in pandemic preparations prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO was asked by member organizations to create an \\"R&D; Blueprint for Action to Prevent Epidemics\\" to generate ideas that would reduce the time lag between the identification of viral outbreaks and the approval of vaccines/treatments, to stop the outbreaks from turning into a \\"public health emergency\\". The focus was to be on the most serious emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) for which few preventive options were available. A group of global experts, the \\"R&D; Blueprint Scientific Advisory Group\\", was assembled by the WHO to draft a shortlist of less than ten \\"blueprint priority diseases\\". Since 2015, the shortlist of less than 10 EIDs has been updated annually and has consistently included widely known names such as Ebola, Zika and SARS (e.g. cause of large-scale infections), and more geographically specific names such as Lassa fever, Marburg virus, Rift Valley fever, and Nipah virus. In February 2018, after the \\"2018 R&D; Blueprint\\" meeting in Geneva, the WHO added Disease X to the shortlist as a placeholder for a \\"knowable unknown\\" pathogen. The Disease X placeholder acknowledged the potential for a future epidemic that could be caused by an unknown pathogen, and by its inclusion, challenged the WHO to ensure their planning and capabilities were flexible enough to adapt to such an event. At the 2018 announcement of the updated shortlist of blueprint priority diseases, the WHO said: \\"Disease X represents the knowledge that a serious international epidemic could be caused by a pathogen currently unknown to cause human disease\\". John-Arne Røttingen, of the R&D; Blueprint Special Advisory Group, said: \\"History tells us that it is likely the next big outbreak will be something we have not seen before\\", and \\"It may seem strange to be adding an 'X' but the point is to make sure we prepare and plan flexibly in terms of vaccines and diagnostic tests. We want to see 'plug and play' platforms developed which will work for any, or a wide number of diseases; systems that will allow us to create countermeasures at speed\\". US expert Anthony Fauci said: \\"WHO recognizes it must 'nimbly move' and this involves creating platform technologies\\", and that to develop such platforms, WHO would have to research entire classes of viruses, highlighting flaviviruses. He added: \\"If you develop an understanding of the commonalities of those, you can respond more rapidly\\". ==Adoption== Jonathan D. Quick, author of End of Epidemics, described the WHO's act of naming Disease X as \\"wise in terms of communicating risk\\", saying \\"panic and complacency are the hallmarks of the world's response to infectious diseases, with complacency currently in the ascendance\\". Women's Health wrote that the establishment of the term \\"might seem like an uncool move designed to incite panic\\" but that the whole purpose of including it on the list was to \\"get it on people’s radars\\". Richard Hatchett of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), wrote \\"It might sound like science fiction, but Disease X is something we must prepare for\\", noting that despite the success in controlling the 2014 Western African Ebola virus epidemic, strains of the disease had returned in 2018. In February 2019, CEPI announced funding of US$34 million to the German-based CureVac biopharmaceutical company to develop an \\"RNA Printer prototype\\", that CEPI said could \\"prepare for rapid response to unknown pathogens (i.e., Disease X)\\". Parallels were drawn with the efforts by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and their PREDICT programme, which was designed to act as an early warning pandemic system, by sourcing and researching animal viruses in particular \\"hot spots\\" of animal-human interaction. In September 2019, The Daily Telegraph reported on how Public Health England (PHE) had launched its own investigation for a potential Disease X in the United Kingdom from the diverse range of diseases reported in their health system; they noted that 12 novel diseases and/or viruses had been recorded by PHE in the last decade. In October 2019 in New York, the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme ran a \\"Disease X dummy run\\" to simulate a global pandemic by a Disease X, in order for its 150 participants from various world health agencies and public health systems to better prepare and share ideas and observations for combatting such an eventuality. In March 2020, The Lancet Infectious Diseases published a paper titled \\"Disease X: accelerating the development of medical countermeasures for the next pandemic\\", which expanded the term to include Pathogen X (the pathogen that leads to Disease X), and identified areas of product development and international coordination that would help in combatting any future Disease X. In April 2020, The Daily Telegraph described remdesivir, a drug being trialed to combat coronavirus, as an anti-viral that Gilead Sciences started working on a decade previously to treat a future Disease X. ==CandidatesZoonotic viruses=== On the addition of Disease X in 2018, the WHO said it could come from many sources citing haemorrhagic fevers and the more recent non-polio enterovirus. However, Røttingen speculated that Disease X would be more likely come from zoonotic transmission (an animal virus that jumps to humans), saying: \\"It's a natural process and it is vital that we are aware and prepare. It is probably the greatest risk\\". WHO special advisor Professor Marion Koopmans, also noted that the rate at which zoonotic diseases were appearing was accelerating, saying: \\"The intensity of animal and human contact is becoming much greater as the world develops. This makes it more likely new diseases will emerge but also modern travel and trade make it much more likely they will spread\\". H7N9 (2018) In 2018, a new strain of the H7N9 \\"bird flu\\" virus, with a 38 percent mortality rate, was likened to a potential Disease X by some international health authorities (but not the WHO, or the R&D; Blueprint group). China would not share samples of the new H7N9 strain. However, they eventually brought the outbreak under control and the urgency dissipated. COVID-19 (2019–2020) Marion Koopmans, member of the WHO R&D; Blueprint Special Advisory Group From the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, experts have speculated whether COVID-19 met the criteria to be Disease X. In early February 2020, Chinese virologist Shi Zhengli from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, wrote that the first Disease X is from a coronavirus. Later that month, Marion Koopmans, Head of Viroscience at Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, and a member of the WHO's R&D; Blueprint Special Advisory Group, wrote in scientific journal Cell, \\"Whether it will be contained or not, this outbreak is rapidly becoming the first true pandemic challenge that fits the disease X category\\". At the same time, Peter Daszak, also a member of the WHO's R&D; Blueprint, wrote in an opinion piece in the New York Times saying: \\"In a nutshell, Covid-19 is Disease X\\". ===Synthetic viruses / bioweapons=== At the 2018 announcement of the updated shortlist of blueprint priority diseases, the media speculated that a future Disease X could be created intentionally as a biological weapon. In 2018, WHO R&D; Blueprint Special Advisor Group member Røttingen was questioned about the potential of Disease X to come from the ability of gene-editing technology to produce synthetic viruses (e.g. the 2017 synthesis of Orthopoxvirus in Canada was cited), which could be released through an accident or even an act of terror. Røttingen said it was unlikely that a future Disease X would originate from a synthetic virus or a bio-weapon. However, he noted the seriousness of such an event, saying, \\"Synthetic biology allows for the creation of deadly new viruses. It is also the case that where you have a new disease there is no resistance in the population and that means it can spread fast\\". ===Bacterial infection=== In September 2019, Public Health England (PHE) reported that the increasing antibiotic resistance of bacteria, even to \\"last-resort\\" antibiotics such as carbapenems and colistin, could also turn into a potential Disease X, citing the antibiotic resistance in gonorrhea as an example. ==In popular culture== In 2018, the Museum of London ran an exhibition titled \\"Disease X: London's next epidemic?\\", hosted for the centenary of the Spanish flu epidemic from 1918. The term features in the title of several fiction books that involve global pandemic diseases, such as Disease (2020), and Disease X: The Outbreak (2019). ==See also== *Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) *Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPIR-R) *Synthetic virology *Bioterrorism * Planet X ==References *Blueprint priority diseases World Health Organization (6-7 February 2018) *Prioritizing diseases for research and development in emergency contexts World Health Organisation (March 2018) *(Video) What is Disease X World Health Organization (16 March 2018) *The mystery viruses far worse than flu BBC News (November 2018) Category:Pandemics Category:World Health Organization Category:Viruses Category:Disaster management Category:Placeholder names ","title":"Disease X"},{"id":"56809863","text":"Dobhi railway station (DHE) is a passenger rail station serving the village of Dobhi and nearby villages in Dobhi block of Jaunpur.

He entered the Major Seminary of Paris (1941–1944) and after a short period of service in the army (December 1944–August 1945) he began a novitiate with the Dominican friars. After 9 months with the Dominicans he gave up his ecclesiastical career (1946). It was only in the early 1950s that he decided to become a professional singer. He made a career in the 1950s and 1960s during which he explored all repertoires, from medieval musics and troubador and trouvères songs to contemporary creation, through Baroque musicThe \\"baroque phenomenon\\" promoted in the 1970s stems from the research of Antoine Geoffroy-Dechaume, organist and musicologist, who published in 1955 \\"Secrets of Early Music\\": research on interpretation, 16th-17th-18th centuries. With this organist, Rondeleux gave a concert recorded on 23 June 1962 at Saint-Sulpice-de-Favières, and broadcast on 1 October 1962. On the program: Pérotin -Lully and mélodies. From 1970 to 1989 he was a singing teacher. === The lyrical artist (1951–1970) === In the late forties Louis-Jacques Rondeleux was a pupil of Jane Bathori, mezzo- soprano, creator of most of Maurice Ravel's melodies. She will pass on to him her art in the interpretation of melodies. His career as a professional singer began in 1951, as member in the choirs of Élisabeth Brasseur or as a church singer (cantor) (particularly at the Église de la Trinité. In October 1951, he sang for the first time as a soloist under the direction of André Cluytens during a concert in Paris at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées (Duruflé's Requiem Op.9, Florent Schmitt's Psaume XLVII). He soon became acquainted with many composers and conductors with whom he helped to promote contemporary music (Henri Sauguet, Darius Milhaud, Marcel Landowski, Míkis Theodorákis, Henri Cliquet-Pleyel, Manuel Rosenthal, Frank Martin, Henri Tomasi, Pierre Boulez…). In 1954 he took part - still as a chorister - in two musical-theatrical creations of the compagnie Renaud-Barrault: * in Paris, at the Théâtre Marigny, in an adaptation of Le Livre de Christophe Colomb (Libretto by Paul Claudel) on a new music by Darius Milhaud. * as part of the Festival de Bordeaux, in May 1954, in L'Orestie (after Aeschylus) on a music by Pierre Boulez, of whom it will be the only stage music. On 30 July 1954 at Aix-en- Provence, he was soloist at the time of the premiere of Sauguet's Les Caprices de Marianne opera. In 1957, he recorded his first disc with works by Darius Milhaud and Henri Sauguet (Visions infernales). In 1960, he performed two premieres: * On 20 May at the Bordeaux festival an opera by Pierre Capdevielle: Les amants captifs. * On 3 September at the Besançon festival, Henri Sauguet's cantata \\"L'oiseau a vu tout cela\\" . In the same year, he toured Morocco with the Jeunesses musicales de France (JMF). He also made his first televised recording in La Traviata (broadcast on 9 December 1960). In 1963 he collaborated, under the direction of Pierre Boulez, on the homage album to Igor Stravinsky (concerning the whole of the discography see the notice on the BNF website). On 15 June 1963 at the festival de Strasbourg, he performed with the orchestre radio-lyrique de l'ORTF, under the direction of Charles Bruck, Henri Tomasi's le Silence de la mer, after Vercors (cf. Site de l’association Henri Tomasi.) This \\"lyrical drama\\" will give rise to several performances in the theatre as well as a recording for television (broadcast on 7 February 1965). In 1964 he also recorded a disc for the Harmonia Mundi label: Cantigas et Chansons de Troubadours (cf illustration below). In this disc, he inaugurated a revival of interest in medieval music that had not been sung for centuries. In January 1965, Henry Barraud entrusted him with the creation of his motet Pange LinguaHenry BARRAUD : Pange lingua, motet pour soprano, baryton, choeur et orchestre (création) on INA.fr (a tribute to Rameau), a cantata for soprano, baritone, choir and orchestra. Henri Sauguet wrote about Louis-Jacques Rondeleux: Henri Sauguet Paris December 1963.Archives personnelles de l'artiste pour son \\"Book\\" === The pedagogue (1966–1989) === From 1966 Louis-Jacques Rondeleux began a second career, dedicated to teaching. He first worked part-time as a singing teacher at the Montreuil Conservatory (1966–1969). In 1970, he joined Maurice Béjart in Brussels for the premiere of the , a new multidisciplinary training centre for dancers, where he will be responsible for vocal technique. In Belgium, he subsequently worked (in 1973) with Henri Pousseur at the Centre de recherches musicales de Wallonie (now , in Liège. There, he set up vocal workshops specifically oriented towards singing. In 1974, - who has just been appointed to the management of the Conservatoire national supérieur d’art dramatique de Paris - asked him to teach singing to future actors. Louis-Jacques Rondeleux taught there from 1975 to 1989, when he retired. In 1977, in an effort to pass on the fruits of his experience to as many people as possible, he published a book entitled Trouver sa voix at éditions du Seuil. Trouver sa voix is a practical book, in which Louis-Jacques Rondeleux updates a voice work technique essentially oriented towards raising awareness of the body schema and an awareness of the mechanics of breath. But throughout the proposed exercises, even more so than the voice, we construct ourselves because \\"it is through the voice that the conscious opens up to the unconscious, and man to himself and to the Other\\" (Denis Vasse, L'Ombilic et la Voix). Several times reissued, this book was a great success. Between phoniatric and theatrical experience, it is recognized by amateurs and professionals alike. == Writing and Parkinson's disease == In the early 1950s, Louis-Jacques Rondeleux collaborated with the editorial secretariat of the Esprit magazine (1951 to 1953). Very involved in ideological debates within the Catholic Church, he participates in some of these debates through writing. This commitment will lead him to publish two books, Isaïe et le Prophétisme (1961) at Éditions du Seuil and Jean SteinmannJean Steinmann (1969) at éditions Fleurus. Alongside his friend he helped create a magazine, les Mal Pensants which wanted to be a place of expression for \\"left-wing\\" Catholics; he wrote - in the first issue - the editorial under the title \\"Who are we?\\". He will also collaborate in the establishment of a repertoire of songs dedicated to worship. With Marcel Frémiot he published certain liturgical songs on texts taken from the Bible and translated by him. (St Jacques du Haut-Pas); 1965. Excerpts published in Chanter pour Dieu, ed. du Seuil, Paris 1966). With Jean Bonfils and he contributed to the same series Chanter pour Dieu (éd. du Seuil, 1967). His Parkinson's disease, diagnosed at the beginning of the 1980s will profoundly change his last 15 years of existence. In an article published in a specialized journal,Louis-Jacques Rondeleux, La voix, le chant et la maladie de Parkinson, rééducation orthophonique, Vol 30, Sept 1992, n°171, () he explains how certain symptoms of this disease (quakes, muscular rigidity, hyper-emotionality, stuttering...) can be combated by a targeted work on voice and breath, body and mind work. The writing of a third book (Éditions du Seuil) - which remained unpublished - will give him the opportunity to give a personal testimony on the different phases of the evolution of his fight against the Parkinson's disease between 1981 and 2000 unpublished whose title in its latest version was: \\"a God sensitive to the heart\\" - S/title: \\"From the Church to Jesus through India\\". In this latest version, proposed to the editor in August 2000, L-J Rondeleux explains that he began writing about Parkinson in 1995 (family sources). == Bibliography == * Moscou des rêves, Revue Esprit, n°10, October 1957 (archive) * Isaïe et le Prophétisme, Seuil, Collection Maîtres spirituels n°24, 1961 (notice BNF). * Jean Steinmann, ed.

The organization was established in 2017 and co-founded by Dawn McAvoy. Both Lives Matter conducted a billboard campaign in two locations in Northern Ireland in January 2017 featuring the headline: \\"100,000 people are alive today because of our laws on abortion. Why change that?\\". This refers to abortions not performed due to Northern Ireland's exclusion from the Abortion Act, passed in 1967.

In contrast to the widespread taurine, N-methyltaurine has been found in nature only in red algae,B. Lindberg, Methylated Taurines and Choline Sulfate in Red Algae, Acta Chem. Scand., 9, 1955, pp 1323 – 1326. where it is formed by methylation of taurine. It is suitable for esterification (actually amide formation) with long-chain carboxylic acids to taurides (acylaminoethansulfonaten) because of its high polarity and the relatively good solubility of its alkaline earth metal salts, which are also used as mild anionic surfactants.E.W. Flick, Cosmetic Additives: An Industrial Guide, Noyes Publication, Park Ridge, New Jersey, 1991, , S. 352. == Preparation == The synthesis of N-methyltaurine was reported as early as 1878,. with methylamine being reacted with the silver salt of 2-chloroethanesulfonic acid. An obvious modification for this reaction is the replacement of the silver salt of 2-chloroethanesulfonic acid by the sodium salt of 2-chloroethanesulfonic acid.. The addition of methylamine to sodium vinylsulfonate in aqueous solution gives N-methyltaurine in 85% yield after acidification with acetic acid. The purification of the crude product and preparation of the N-methyltaurine can also be accomplished by passage of the sodium salt solution through a cation exchange resin in its H form and then through an anion exchange resin in its OH form. The reaction of sodium isethionate with methylamine in water at high temperature and pressure yields the sodium salt of N-methyltaurine :N-Methyltaurin Syntheseweg which yields pure N-methyltaurine upon saturation with CO2 and removal of the precipitated sodium bicarbonate.Deutsches Patentamt, Auslegeschrift 1 122 540; invent1: E.

N. Sahni, 1916-1990) was an Indian administrator who played an active role in industry., social life, administration, and sports of India for four decades. The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Shri in 1971 for his contributions to trade and industry. ==Early life== Sahni was born on 9 August 1916 in Lahore, British India to Lala Gurdas Ram Sahni an agricultural land holder with substantial land holdings. He was the oldest of three children of Lala Gurdas Ram sahni from his second wife who died within a month of giving birth to his sister, Nando (Nand Rani), eight years younger to him in 1924. P. N. Sahni completed a double Master of Arts degree in political Science as well as History from Government College at Lahore now known as the Government College University (Lahore). He was an enthusiastic hockey player in college and this interest in sports lasted with him through life. Subsequent to college studies in Lahore, he proceeded for doctoral studies in UK but the program was interrupted because of the second world war. == Provincial Transport Controller == Sahni was appointed to the Indian Administrative Service with effect from 25 December 1957 by the President of India through a Gazette notification.https://archive.org/stream/in.gazette.1958.66/O-2061-1958-0051-93212_djvu.txt One of the earliest administrative appointments of P. N. sahni was as the Provincial transport Controller of Punjab, India. During this period he was recognized for his excellent administrative capabilities and compassionate dealing. He introduced a system of concession for financially weak students upon certification by their schools as well as others in need. == Director of Industries == During the sixties P. N. Sahni assumed the role of Director of Industries of Punjab. In 1966 the state of Punjab was divided in two with a new state Haryana being born from it. While the focus of Punjab remained on agriculture due to well irrigated lands, that of Haryana became industrialization. Sahni shifted to this new state and continued to play a prominent role in its industrialization, a role that was recognized later by an award for contributions to trade and industry by the Government of India. == Role in Indian hockey == During the seventies P. N. Sahni was an active participant in the Indian Olympic Association. P. N. Sahni took over stewardship of the Indian Hockey Federation in 1973 at a time when conflicts broke out between its Northern and Southern wings. The Indian Hockey scene was marked by excellence until 1973 when Ashwani Kumar the then president stepped down followed by a spell of chaos in the organization. There was a conflict between the North and South blocs of the federation. P.N. Sahni belonged to the North bloc and that was the heartland of hockey in India. But one M. A. M. Ramaswamy, a rich millionaire from the southern block struggled to capture the presidency and succeeded because of support form the southern lobby in the Union government. . It seems that this feud and the passing of control of Indian hockey to the southern wing led to the downfall of hockey standards in India. It lost its supremacy in the game on the world stage ever since winning a medal only once in the Olympic games in 1980. http://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/columns/views/Un-sporting- fights/articleshow/21353584.cms, P N Sahni remained the President of the Haryana Olympic Association from 1969 to 1978 http://olympicharyana.in/president-secretary/ == Electricity Board == In the early seventies, during his appointment as the Chairman of an Electricity Board in India, P N Sahni had to contend with numerous problems of employees union. He nevertheless managed to steer the board in a way so as to improve overall availability of electricity in the province much needed for the then rapidly industrializing Haryana state of Northern India . Sahni retired from Chairmanship of Haryana State Electricity Board on 5 March 1975, after serving this Organisation for six years. During his tenure, Haryana achieved 100% village electrification ==Death== He died in 1990 in Mumbai from a sudden cardiac arrest while on a brief visit to that city to witness a cricket match. He was survived by a daughter and wife, Vimla Sahnihttps://www.geni.com/people/Prem-Nath-Sahni/6000000019937518086 at that time. == See also == * List of Padma Shri award recipients (1970–1979) * Haryana Olympic Association == References  External Links == * * Category:Field hockey governing bodies in Asia Category:Recipients of the Padma Shri in trade and industry Category:1916 births Category:1990 deaths ","title":"Prem Nath Sahni"},{"id":"56810331","text":"The ÍBV women's football team is the women's football department of the Íþróttabandalag Vestmannaeyja multi-sport club.

Peter Doherty, Omar Rodríguez-López, Faust or Gallon Drunk. == Biography == Johann Scheerer was born on 6 November 1982 to Jan Philipp Reemtsma and Ann-Kathrin Scheerer in Henstedt-Ulzburg, and grew up in Hamburg. At 16, he won a talent contest with his school band \\"Am kahlen Aste\\". The prize was a meeting with the then successful music producers, Berman Brothers (producers) (Caught in the Act, Hanson). This was followed by a recording contract with Epic/Sony and the release of three singles and an album under the band name Score!. The band was not as successful as the record company had hoped, and the contract came to an end. The band subsequently split up some two years later. As a free agent, Johann Scheerer took recording the band into his own hands. This led to the creation of the \\"Rekordbox\\" recording studio in two construction containers stacked on top of each other, located on land occupied by the Garten Art Network in Hamburg’s Eifflerstrasse. In 2004, he moved with Henning Schmidt (Plemo) into the recording studio Phonraum in the building formerly occupied by the Tageszeitung in Chemnitzstrasse in Hamburg. Following numerous smaller and demo productions, he and Schmidt parted ways. In 2006, he began collaborating with Thies Mynther, opening the completely analogue Clouds Hill Recordings studioInterview with Johann Scheerer about the Clouds Hill Studio The Famous Company, October 06, 2017 in Hamburg. National and international productions soon followed and in 2008, Chris von Rautenkranz decided to join Clouds Hill Recordings with the mastering for Soundgarden.

The songs were released as two 10” EPs, Leslie White and Leslie Black. Together with his fellow band member, Sebastian Nagel, Scheerer founded the 7” label Clouds Hill Ltd. in 2009, initially releasing 7” singles, recorded in Clouds Hill Recordings Studio and limited to production runs of 500. After the release of the Fukui album for Hamburg band Stella, and Beauty, from Freiburg band Kraków Loves Adana, the label established itself producing 10” EPs and 12” long players. In 2010, Scheerer took Clouds Hill Ltd. to the internationally based Roughtrade Distribution. In the autumn of 2010, the band Stella reached 7th place in the German Club Charts (Deutschen Clubcharts – DCC) with the 12” remix “Office & Store”. The label received particular attention with its release of a 7” singles box, wrapped in sailcloth (2009), with a limited edition of 100, which sold out in less than 10 days and contained all the singles previously released by Clouds Hill Ltd. This was followed in 2011 by a 200 piece run of the “Analog Love in Digital Times” box, which included three 12” maxis and five 7” singles as well as a polaroid film and an original polaroid photo (in collaboration with Impossible).

Members of this gens are mentioned in the time of Juvenal, but very few appear in history. At least one obtained the consulship some time in the latter part of the third century AD, but little else is known of this family.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 664 (\\"Rubrenus Lappa\\"). ==Origin== The nomen Rubrenus seems to belong to a class of names derived from other gentilicia using the suffix -enus in place of -inus, a Latin ending that would be more typical of cognomina. The name was most likely derived from Rubrius, from ruber, red or ruddy.Chase, pp. 118, 131.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. ruber. The form Rubrenius, found in one inscription, may be an error, or simply an attempt to give the name a more regular ending. ==Branches and cognomina== The only Rubrenus mentioned in ancient authors bore the surname Lappa, a bur, belonging to a large class of cognomina derived from everyday objects, plants, and animals.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. lappa.Chase, pp. 112, 113. The nomenclature of the consul Rubrenus, evidently inherited from a number of other families, included the common surnames Priscus, elder, and Proculus, an old praenomen, said by some of the Roman antiquarians to have been given to a child born while his father was abroad, but perhaps originally a diminutive of Proca, a name known from Roman mythology as one of the Kings of Alba Longa.Chase, p. 111. Magianus, a surname derived from the Magia gens, seems to have been passed down among the Rubreni for several generations. Other surnames, including Phorus and Hylas, were of Greek origin. ==Members== * Lucius Rubrenius Hylas, dedicated a monument at Rome to his friend, Aurelia Gresia.. * Marcus Rubrenus Phorus, the husband of Saturnina, with whom he dedicated a tomb to their children at Rome.. * Rubrenus Lappa, a contemporary of Juvenal, who describes Lappa as a tragic poet of such reduced circumstances that he pawned his cloak in order to sustain himself, while working on a tragedy about Atreus.Juvenal, Satirae, vii. 71–73. * Rubrenus, held a number of magistracies, including praefectus frumenti dandi, tribune of the plebs, quaestor urbanus, tribune of the second legion, and one of the decemviri stlitibus judicandis. He married Triaria Magia Secundilla, and was the father of Marcus Rubrenus Magianus, who dedicated a monument to him at Antioch in Syria, in the late first or early second century AD.. * Marcus Rubrenus Magianus, the son of Rubrenus and Triaria Magia Secundilla, dedicated a monument to his father at Antioch. * Marcus Rubrenus Virius Priscus Pomponianus Magianus Proculus, held a number of important magistracies in the mid third century. He was one of the salii collini, patron of the colony at Atina, and curator of the colonies at Formia and Minturnae in Latium, held the consulship in an uncertain year, and was proconsul of Africa. His daughter, Junia Arria Rufina, dedicated a monument to him at Atina.. ==FootnotesSee also== * List of Roman gentes ==ReferencesBibliography== * Decimus Junius Juvenalis, Satirae (Satires). * Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, William Smith, ed., Little, Brown and Company, Boston (1849). * Theodor Mommsen et alii, Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum (The Body of Latin Inscriptions, abbreviated CIL), Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften (1853–present). * René Cagnat et alii, L'Année épigraphique (The Year in Epigraphy, abbreviated AE), Presses Universitaires de France (1888–present). * George Davis Chase, \\"The Origin of Roman Praenomina\\", in Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, vol.

This theory concerns the occurrence of invariant tori in dynamical systems depending on parameters, that carry multi- or quasi-periodic motions. This both goes for the conservative setting — like in celestial mechanics — and for the dissipative setting where families of quasi-periodic tori may form the transitional interface between regular and chaotic dynamics. In the former context he worked on the Laplacian resonance in the motion of the Galilean satellites of Jupiter. In the latter he contributed to a better understanding of the topological and measure theoretical aspects of the Hopf-Landau-Lifschitz-Ruelle-Takens scenario for the onset of turbulence upon variation of parameters. The general non- degeneracy condition behind this theory is named after him and two of his colleagues. He also contributed lto the general theory of bifurcations, for instance related to periodic motions that go through a resonance, thereby branching off subharmonic motions. Here both covering spaces and the corresponding equivariant singularity theory were introduced into the field of dynamical systems. Here also parametrised KAM theory comes into play. Apart from developing theory, together with colleagues, he also worked on applications in the fields of classical and quantum mechanics, population dynamics and climate modelling. Here often computational tools were employed, which sometimes led to experimental mathematics. Broer was granted a doctorate in the faculty of mathematics and natural sciences in 1979 under the supervision of Floris Takens for a thesis entitled Bifurcations of singularities in volume preserving vector fields. He was a professor at the University of Groningen, the Netherlands, from 1981 till his retirement in 2015. In 1985 he spent a semester as a guest professor of Boston University, Massachusetts. == Awards and honors == In 2008 Broer became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences and in 2015 he was made a Knight of the Order of the Netherlands Lion. == Selected publications == * with G.B.

She has worked on the design, construction, and international governance of several radio telescopes including the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). She is director of the Murchison Widefield Array and a professor at the Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy at Curtin University and the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research. ==Early life== Johnston-Hollitt was born on 8 September 1974 in Darwin, Australia. She was born shortly before Cyclone Tracy destroyed the city after which she and her mother were evacuated to Brisbane on December 29, 1974 en route to Townsville. During her early life she lived in various parts of Queensland before her family returned to Darwin in 1979. In 1986 her family moved to Adelaide where she completed high school. Johnston-Hollitt attended the University of Adelaide, where she graduated with two degrees in theoretical and experimental physics and pure mathematics. She also completed a BSc with honors in astrophysics under the supervision of Roger Clay, and a doctorate in radio astronomy jointly with the University of Adelaide and the CSIRO Australia Telescope National Facility under the supervision of Ron Ekers and Richard Hunstead. ==Career== Johnston-Hollitt moved to Leiden Observatory at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands as the inaugural LOFAR Fellow, joining the group of George Miley to work on the design of the LOFAR telescope. In 2004, she took up a continuing faculty position at the University of Tasmania. In January 2009 she moved to Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand to establish and lead a new radio astronomy group. Johnston-Hollitt worked on NZ's engagement with the Square Kilometre Array, and she has served in an advisory role for the New Zealand Government on the project since April 2009. Shortly after commencing her term advising the NZ Government, it was announced that NZ would join Australia in bidding to host the SKA telescope. Johnston-Hollitt was subsequently an author of the Australia-New Zealand bid to host the SKA, responsible for identifying possible SKA station sites in New Zealand. From 2011, she was a government- appointed member of the preparatory group set-up to establish the SKA, and then director for the SKA from December 2011 to January 2018. For her scientific leadership she was appointed by the SKAO as founding co-chair of the SKA Cosmic Magnetism Science Working group in March 2013, and along with her co-chair, Federica Govoni, defined the early SKA requirements associated with cosmic magnetism, editing the magnetism sections of the SKA Science Case and writing the cosmic magnetism scientific summary paper. Johnston-Hollitt led the 2011 bid for NZ to join the Murchison Widefield Array, a low frequency precursor to the SKA. She joined the MWA Board in 2012, became vice-chair in 2013, and held the position of chair from January 2014 to January 2018. In early 2017 she became founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of Peripety Scientific, an independent research organisation specialising in radio astronomy research and consultancy based in Wellington. She resigned from Victoria University of Wellington in September 2017 and became a professor of Radio Astronomy at Curtin University and director of the Murchison Widefield Array. ==Research career== Johnston-Hollitt's primary research interests are cosmic magnetism and observations of galaxy clusters, primarily through the use of radio telescopes. She has authored over 230 publications. She has served on the Editorial Board of Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia since January 2015, commencing a 3-year term as Editor-in-Chief from January 2018. Johnston-Hollitt has gained funding for design, construction and exploitation of radio telescopes across Europe, Australia and New Zealand. She has held several visiting positions as a guest professor at the Excellence Cluster Universe in Munich, Germany, the Sophia Antipolis University in Nice, France, the University of Bologna, Italy, and the University of Malaya. ==Awards== * 2002: Union of Radio Scientists International (URSI) Young Scientist Award * 2006: Faculty Early Career Research Award – University of Tasmania * 2010: Hudson Lecturer – Royal Society of New Zealand == See also == * List of female scientists in the 21st century * List of University of Adelaide people ==References== Category:Australian astrophysicists Category:Australian women scientists Category:University of Adelaide alumni Category:University of Tasmania faculty Category:Victoria University of Wellington faculty Category:Leiden University faculty Category:1974 births Category:People from Darwin, Northern Territory Category:Curtin University faculty Category:Living people Category:Women astrophysicists Category:21st- century Australian scientists Category:21st-century physicists Category:21st- century women scientists ","title":"Melanie Johnston-Hollitt"},{"id":"56811055","text":"The 2018–19 Texas Longhorns men's basketball team represented the University of Texas at Austin in the 2018–19 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.

In 1969, she joined the faculty of the Department of Linguistics at University of Texas at Austin, where she served for the remainder of her life. She was department chair from 1981-1985. She was named the Dallas TACA Centennial Professor in the Humanities in 1991. During her long career, she made important contributions to three areas of linguistic research. Her early work examined English syntax and child language acquisition. (Shipley et al. 1969 was an influential paper in this area.) She wrote a number of papers and a widely cited book (Smith 1991) on grammatical aspect. A final research interest involved the analysis of discourse units above the level of the sentence, which she categorizes, in Smith (2003) into five ‘discourse modes’ (narrative, report, description, information, and argument). She spent many years doing linguistic research on Navajo and became a member of the Navajo Language Academy. == Selected publications == *Elizabeth F. Shipley, Carlota S. Smith and Lila R.

Sufferers exhibit a tendency to actively push away from the unweakened side, thus leading to a loss of postural balance. It can be a result of left or right brain damage. In contrast to most stroke patients, who typically prefer more weight-bearing on their non-hemiparetic side, this abnormal condition can vary in severity and leads to a loss of postural balance. The lesion involved in this syndrome is thought to be in the posterior thalamus on either side, or multiple areas of the right cerebral hemisphere. ==Signs and symptoms== In people with acute stroke and hemiparesis, the disorder is present in 10.4% of patients. Rehabilitation may take longer in patients that display pusher behaviour. The Copenhagen Stroke Study found that patients that presented with ipsilateral pushing used 3.6 weeks more to reach the same functional outcome level on the Barthel Index, than did patients without ipsilateral pushing. Pushing behavior has shown that perception of body posture in relation to gravity is altered. Patients experience their body as oriented \\"upright\\" when the body is actually tilted to the side of the brain lesion. In addition, patients seem to show no disturbed processing of visual and vestibular inputs when determining subjective visual vertical. In sitting, the push presents as a strong lateral lean toward the affected side and in standing, creates a highly unstable situation as the patient is unable to support their body weight on the weakened lower extremity. The increased risk of falls must be addressed with therapy to correct their altered perception of vertical. Pusher syndrome is sometimes confused with and used interchangeably as the term hemispatial neglect, and some previous theories suggest that neglect leads to pusher syndrome. However, another study had observed that pusher syndrome is also present in patients with left hemisphere lesions, leading to aphasia, providing a stark contrast to what was previously believed regarding hemispatial neglect, which mostly occurs with a right hemisphere lesion. Karnath summarizes these two conflicting views, as they conclude that both neglect and aphasia are highly correlated with pusher syndrome possibly due to the close proximity of relevant brain structures associated with these two respective syndromes. However, the article goes on to state that it is imperative to note that both neglect and aphasia are not the underlying causes of pusher syndrome. ==Cause== The underlying pathology is thought to affect the posterior thalamus which is the fundamental brain structure that controls body upright posture. ==Pathophysiology== With a diagnosis of pusher behaviour, three important variables should be seen, the most obvious of which is spontaneous body posture of a longitudinal tilt of the torso toward the paretic side of the body occurring on a regular basis and not only on occasion. The use of the nonparetic extremities to create the pathological lateral tilt of the body axis is another sign to be noted when diagnosing for pusher behaviour. This includes abduction and extension of the extremities of the non-affected side, to help in the push toward the affected (paretic) side. The third variable that is seen is that attempts of the therapist to correct the pusher posture by aiming to realign them to upright posture are resisted by the patient. ==Treatment== Physical therapists focus on motor learning strategies when treating these patients. Verbal cues, consistent feedback, practicing correct orientation and weight shifting are all effective strategies used to reduce the effects of this disorder. Having a patient sit with their stronger side next to a wall and instructing them to lean towards the wall is an example of a possible treatment for pusher behaviour. A new physical therapy approach for patients with pusher syndrome suggests that the visual control of vertical upright orientation, which is undisturbed in these patients, is the central element of intervention in treatment. In sequential order, treatment is designed for patients to realize their altered perception of vertical, use visual aids for feedback about body orientation, learn the movements necessary to reach proper vertical position, and maintain vertical body position while performing other activities. ==History== It was first described by Patricia Davis in 1985. ==References== Category:Neurological disorders ","title":"Pusher syndrome"},{"id":"56811369","text":"Angela Grauerholz (born January 10, 1952) is a German-born Canadian photographer, graphic designer and educator living in Montreal.

It is a tropical and sub-tropical species which is widely distributed in the Indo-Pacific oceans. It is slightly larger than the closely related species Ornithoteuthis antillarum of the Atlantic Ocean. ==Description== Ornithoteuthis volatilis has a broad head and it has a very narrow muscular mantle which tapers into a long pointed tail, the head is markedly wider than the mantle. It has long fins which are arrow-shaped and sharply lanceolate towards the tail with the rear edges of the fins being concave. The length of the fins is equal to approximately 55% of the mantle length and the fin width is circa 47% of the mantle length. The first to third arms have at least 50 suckers each while each fourth arm has 75, with the suckers on the second and third arms being larger than those on the first and fourth arms. The suckers near the base have severely closely set teeth, of which the middle 1-3 are much more slender and sharply pointed. The largest suckers have 10-14 teeth all of which are sharply pointed and closely set, with long teeth and short teeth set alternately and with the 2 or 3 lowest (i.e. ventral) on either side being the widest and being obliquely pointed. The suckers towards the tip have less than 7 teeth which are separated, slender triangular and sharply pointed except ventral-most on either side which has a wider and less quadrangular shape. Males have a hectocotylus on the fourth right arm. The basal two thirds of this arm have 14 large, basal suckers followed by 20 reduced suckers with the ventral series is much reduced and some of these suckers are not true suckers but have a nipple like form. The outer third of the arm has 25 pairs of suckers which have their bases swollen into transverse, membranous papillae. These are closely set in two series, the ventral series is comb-like with much smaller rudimentary suckers on tips of papillae, separated by a membranous ridge along middle line. The dorsal protective membrane is absent from the tip of the arm while on the ventral side the protective membrane is normal in basal third of the arm then it broadens and becomes very thick. There is a \\"honeycomb region\\" which has 14 pores and a number of grooves and ridges. The pores are arranged in longitudinal series, each having two grooves across them which extend towards the membrane margin, the ridges lie opposite the grooves and connect with one another, where they are edged with numerous small, roundish depressions. The tentacular clubs are around half of the length of the tentacles, they have 12 suckers in the carpal region each of which has 8–12 conical teeth set on its distal margin with more closely set, broader, more triangular and more oblique teeth set on the proximal margin. The manus has four series of suckers each with 7-9 suckers of which the central two series are much larger; the largest being around 3 times larger than the marginal suckers. These large suckers are wide and deep while the other club suckers are broader than they are deep. The inner margin of the large manus suckers is completely toothed with sharply pointed, slightly curved teeth which alternate with small, plate-like, semicircular teeth, although these teeth are almost absent in the largest suckers. The rings of the suckers on the margins of the club and the dactylus have the sharp, pointed teeth on the proximal margin but these are broader, oblique, triangular and more closely set than similar teeth in the large suckers, the teeth on the distal margin are slender, conical and separated. There are four series of suckers on the dactylus arranged in 27 transverse rows with the dorsal suckers being smaller than those in more ventral sitings. There is a carpal locking apparatus which has 1 or 2 low knobs, no smooth- ringed suckers; this apparatus is rather indistinct in some individuals. Photophores are distributed in a similar way to O. antillarum, i.e. there are three visceral photophores, an oval, anal photophore, a posterior intestinal photophore and an elongated posterior visceral photophore which forms a strip of pinkish bioluminescent tissue extending from the small photophore to the posterior tip of the mantle cavity. The maximnmim reported size is 250mm mantle length for females and 310mm for males. ==Dsitribution== Ornithoteuthis volatilis is found in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-Pacific. Its latitudinal range in the western Pacific lies between 36°N to 38°S and it extends as far east as the Line Islands, while in the Indian Ocean it ranges from the Arabian Sea south to Madagascar and east to the Timor Sea, south to the waters off eastern Australia. It has been recorded in the Atlantic Ocean off Namibia. ==Habitat and biology== Ornithoteuthis volatilis inhabits tropical slopes and oceanic waters where the adults range from the surface waters at night to moderate depths. They occur near the botton in the bathyal zone but in midwater above the continental slope and above sea mounts and ridges. The paralarvae and juveniles can also be found in midwater above great depths at the equator. It has very small eggs less than 1mm in diameter and spawning is intermittent with several egg masses laid over an extended period. The spermatophores of mature males have a length equivalent to 10.3% of mantle length and the number of spermatophores is around 100 as the male matures tha volume of the Needham's sac and of the seminal reservoirs of the spermatophores increases. O. volatilis is a nerito-oceanic species which lives near or over slopes; the non adults are found in midwater in the epipelagic and mesopelagic zones above the tops and slopes of sea mounts and midocean ridges as well as over the continental slopes and oceanic depths. They spawn near the sea bed near sea mounts and mid ocean ridges, and they may make long migrations to these areas. off eastern Australia spawning takes place in the deeper shelf and upper continental slope waters that sit within the warm East Australian Current which originates in the tropics, the size distribution of paralarvae and adults suggests that spawning in occurs throughout the year in this area. In the northern South China Sea spawning runs is from June through to October. In the western North Pacific Ocean this species spawns in the summer and its paralarvae are found in the Kuroshio Current off Japan. O. volatilis is an actively browsing predator which preys on many different, relatively small animals. Its predators include numerous species of tropical and subtropical pelagic fish such as yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), longnose lancetfish (Alepisaurus ferox), dolphinfish (Coryphaena hyppurus) and swordfish (Xiphias gladius). Sperm whales hunt this species extensilvely and it is heavily preyed on by the South African fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus). It is also an important food item for several shark species including the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier), the scalloped hammerhead shark (Syphrna lewini) and the smooth hammerhead shark (Syphrna zygaena). They are capable of short glides in a similar manner to flying fish. ==References== Category:Squid Category:Molluscs described in 1915 ","title":"Ornithoteuthis volatilis"},{"id":"56811394","text":"List of people from the region of Calabria: ==Notable Calabrians== * Achille Falcone (16th-century composer) * Acrion (Pythagorean philosopher) * Ada Dondini (actress) * Adele Cambria (actress, journalist and writer) * Agostino Li Vecchi (Member of Italian Basketball Team at 2000 Olympics) * Alcmaeon of Croton (ancient philosopher/medical theorist who pioneered anatomical dissection) * Alessandro De Rose (Champion Italian Cliff Diver) * Alessandro Longo (19th-century composer and musicologist) * Alexis (ancient comic poet) * Alfonso Rendano (19th-century pianist and composer who invented the \\"third pedal\\") * Alfredo Costanzo (Australian motor racing driver born in Calabria) * Aloysius Lilius (16th-century astronomer who created the Gregorian Calendar) * Amyris of Sybaris (consulted the Delphic oracle) * Annalisa Insarda (Italian film, television, theatre and voice actress) * Andy Varipapa (professional bowler called \\"the greatest one-man bowling show on Earth\\") * Angelo Arciglione (international prize-winning pianist) * Angelo Maria Mazzia (19th- century artist and Knight of the Order of the Crown of Italy) * Anna Maria Maiolino (Italian-Brazilian artist) * Anselmo Lorecchio (lawyer, journalist, politician, poet, writer & newspaper founder) * Antonio Cantafora (film and television actor) * Antonio Diego Voci (figurative artist and sculptor) * Antonio D'Oppido (Champion Swimmer) * Antonio Fava (actor/director, comedian, musician & Maestro of Commedia dell'arte) * Antonio Fuoco (motor racing driver) * Antonio Maria Magro (actor, director & screenwriter) * Antonio Porchia (poet) * Antonio Pujía (Italian-Argentine artist and sculptor) * Antonio Rodotà (former Director General of the European Space Agency) * Antonio Serra (late 16th-century philosopher and economist) * Antonio Siciliano (film editor) * Antonio Strati (Italian organizational theorist & artist) * Antonio Tallura (Actor and Writer) * Antony Carbone (film and television actor) * Arignote (pythagorean philosopher) * Aristomachus of Croton (ancient party leader of Croton during the Hannibalian war) * Aroldo Tieri (actor) * Astylos of Croton (ancient olympic athlete) * Autoleon (ancient war hero) * Baldassarre Squitti (teacher of law and politician) * Barlaam of Seminara (14th-century humanist Greek teacher to Petrarch and Boccaccio) * Benito Carbone (football manager) * Bernardino Telesio (16th- century philosopher and first of the modern scientists) * Blessed Camillus Costanzo (16th-century Jesuit missionary & Roman Catholic martyr) * Blessed Elena Aiello (founder of \\"Sister Minims of The Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ\\") * Blessed Francesco Maria Greco (co-founder of \\"Little Workers of the Sacred Hearts\\") * Blessed Maria Candida of the Eucharist (Discalced Carmelite nun and mystic) * Bohemond I of Antioch (Prince of Taranto and Antioch) * Bruno Chimirri (Equestrian who competed in the 2004 Olympic Games) * Brunori Sas (Singer/Songwriter) * Calliphon of Croton (pythagorean physician) * Carlo Carlei (Italian film director) * Carmelo Zito (journalist & newspaper editor) * Carmine Abate (writer and novelist) * Cassiodorus (founder of the Vivarium Monastery who put together the first western bible) * Cesare Lanza (Italian journalist & author) * Charles Atlas (bodybuilder) * Cicco Simonetta (Renaissance statesman who composed a treatise on cryptography) * Clearchus of Rhegium (ancient sculptor) * Clinomachus (Megarian philosopher) * Corrado Alvaro (writer and journalist) * Cylon of Croton (led a revolt against the Pythagoreans) * Damo (Pythagorean philosopher) * Democedes (ancient physician that Herodotus called \\"the most skillful physician of his time\\") * Dick Danello (Singer & Composer) * Diego Carpitella (Professor of ethnomusicology) * Diognetus of Croton (ancient athlete) * Domenico Berardi (Youngest footballer to score 4 goals in a \\"Serie A\\" match since 1931) * Domenico Caruso (writer, poet and scholar of Calabrian dialects) * Domenico Siciliani (Italian General and Deputy Governor of Cyrenaica) * Domenico Spanò Bolani (Historian and Writer) * Domingo F.

The headquarters were located in Vologda (September 1918 - February 1920) and later Arkhangelsk (March - April 1920). It was part of the Northern Front which fought against Entente troops and the White Northern Army which were based in Archangelsk and Murmansk. In September-October 1918, the Sixth Army operated on the routes leading from Arkhangelsk to Vologda and the Northern Dvina to Kotlas and Vyatka, preventing the unification of anti-Soviet forces operating in the European North and those under command of Alexander Kolchak in Siberia. In January 1919, the Sixth Army fought the Battle of Shenkursk and in April-November 1919, tried to liberate the railway line Vologda-Arkhangelsk, the Pechora River, Northern Dvina River Pinega River and Mezen River. After the withdrawal of the British and US Troops from Northern Russia in October 1919, the defeat of the White Northern Army and the conquest of Archangelsk and Murmansk in February and March 1920, the 6th Army was disbanded on 10 April 1920.

The army was included in the newly formed Southern Front against General Wrangel. The headquarters were located in Kremenchuk (September), Berislav (September - November), Chaplynka (November) and Kherson (December 1920 - May 1921). In September-October 1920, the 6th Army fought defensively, holding the Kakhovka bridgehead and stopping the White forces' attempts to force the Dnieper. It also supported the 2nd Cavalry Army in defeating the Zadneprovsky group of Wrangel's forces. During the counter-offensive of the Southern Front in Northern Tavria, the army occupied Perekop and facilitated the advance of the 1st and 2nd Cavalry armies. In the Siege of Perekop (1920) (November 7-17, 1920), the 6th Army inflicted the main blow on the night of November 8, in crossing the Syvash and capturing the Perekop Isthmus. After the end of the hostilities in the Crimea, the 6th Army protected the Black Sea coast and fought against rebels in the Kherson and Odessa provinces.

She has been the singer of the feminist pop-punk band Tacocat since 2007. She is also the music editor for Bust Magazine, and the former music editor at The Stranger from 2012 to 2015. == Early life == Nokes is from Butte, Montana and started writing songs when she was a child. She moved to Seattle when she was 19 to become a graphic designer. She attended The Seattle Art Institute where she met the bandmates who would later form Tacocat. == Career  Music === Nokes is the lead singer, tambourine player and a songwriter for Tacocat. Her creative process involves writing down snippets of ideas in a notebook and workshopping them with other bandmates into full songs. > When it’s time to start making new music, my bandmates usually get together > and hash together instrumental ideas that they’ll show me via phone > recording or practice jam. I then just start thinking about melodies and > seeing if any of the lyrics fit, keeping the feeling of the music versus the > feeling of the lyrics in mind, though I don’t mind (and sometimes prefer) > sad-sounding music paired with silly lyrics or upbeat music paired with > darker lyrics. It’s a fun little jigsaw puzzle for each song! Sometimes it > snaps together right away, sometimes you have to tinker with it for weeks. As part of Tacocat, Nokes has received recognition from peers and critics alike, including The Seattle Times, Pitchfork and the AV Club. La Sera's Katy Goodman has called Tacocat \\"the best band in the world.\\" === Politics === Nokes identifies as a feminist and her songs address topics from catcalling to menstruation. She is an activist for queer, anti-racist, and anti-transphobic causes, especially with regards to art: > We need to demand more from everything all the time — for women, for queer > folks, for trans folks, for people of color, and for everyone else who lives > outside of the standard-issue, mostly-white/mostly-male representation > across all platforms of expression. == Personal life == She is a Libra, has a grey cat named Tinsel, and lives on Capitol Hill, a neighborhood in Seattle, Washington. She has said that if she weren't in a band, she would want to be a candy taster. == References == Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:American magazine editors Category:American music critics Category:American punk rock singers Category:American women artists Category:American women writers Category:Feminist musicians ","title":"Emily Nokes"},{"id":"56812049","text":"Mitromorpha hernandezi is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Mitromorphidae.MolluscaBase (2018).

She is a co-opted member of the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) and a trustee in Maneka Gandhi's People for Animals. She has been part of and has led successful campaigns for animal rights such as the campaign against the practice of sacrificial slaughtering of cattle. She is also a consultant with Humane Society International, one of the world largest animal protection groups.ANIMAL LAW TRAINING PROGRAMhttp://www.hsi.org/assets/pdfs/hsi_india_law_announcement.pdf She is a protege of Maneka Gandhi (an Indian politician and India's leading animal rights crusader). == Background == Gauri Maulekhi started working for People for Animals in Lucknow in 1995 as a volunteer where she played a vital role in setting up the first animal shelter in the city. She also helped raise funds for the shelter, conduct programmes for the finding homes for dogs and coordinate the ambulance service for animals in distress. She then worked with the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) in Noida from 2004 to 2008. She helped run the animal shelter and was part of raids related to cruelty to animals. This is where she also stepped into the legal area of animal rights and welfare. In 2008 she joined PFA Dehradun. In 2010 she set up the Uttarakhand unit of People for Animals, People for Animals Uttarakhand. She currently is part of the team in New Delhi of People for Animals India. Maulekhi is active internationally. She lobbied in Nepal to end the huge mass religious animal slaughter at Gadhimai festival. Back in India in 2013 there was a climate disaster when the North India floods were created by unusual torrential rain. Maulekhi helped evacuate more than 6,000 animals from the flooded Kedarnath region. Saving these animals influenced future national policy for dealing with disasters. The plans now incorporate a consideration of animal welfare. Maulekhi also helped the campaign to end the (illegal) wildlife trade at the Sonepur Animal Fair. These acts earned Maulekhi the Nari Shakti Award. In 2019 Maulekhi began a campaign to get the government to realise its past commitments to improve animal welfare. She wrote to each of India's states regarding a ten year old directive to form State Animal Welfare Boards. These boards were requested by the Supreme Court and although some were created, others were not. Those that were formed were there in name only as they lacked staff or a budget. In 2020 Maulekhi asked India's Supreme Court to issue a writ to require states to create State Animal Welfare Boards. == Awards and honours == * 8 March 2018: Nari Shakti Puraskar (Women Power Award), highest civilian award for women in India. == See also == * People for Animals * Animal Rights and Welfare in India == References == Category:Animal rights activists Category:Animal welfare and rights in India Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Gauri Maulekhi"},{"id":"56812266","text":"National Route 4 is a national highway in South Korea connects Gunsan to Gyeongju.

Tactics used to achieve this goal among community groups include direct action and Internet activism. It is also a method used by social media and other technology companies to selectively suspend, ban, or otherwise restrict access to their platform by users who have allegedly violated the platform's terms of service, particularly terms regarding hate speech. Banking and financial service providers, among other companies, have also denied services to controversial activists or organizations, a practice known as financial deplatforming. The term deplatforming also refers generally to tactics, often organized using social media, for preventing controversial speakers or speech from being heard. Deplatforming tactics have included disruption of speeches, attempts to have speakers disinvited to a venue or event, and various forms of personal harassment including efforts to have an individual fired or blacklisted. == Invited speakers == In the United States, banning of speakers on University campuses dates back to the 1940s. This was carried out by policies of the universities themselves. The University of California, for example, had a policy known as the Speaker Ban codified in university regulations under President Robert Gordon Sproul, mostly, but not exclusively, targeting Communists. One rule stated that \\"the University assumed the right to prevent exploitation of its prestige by unqualified persons or by those who would use it as a platform for propaganda.\\" This rule was used in 1951 to block Max Schachtman, a socialist, from speaking at the University of California at Berkeley. However, it was not always used against Communists (or socialists): in 1961, Malcolm X was banned from speaking at Berkeley as a religious leader, whereas the white Protestant evangelist Billy Graham spoke the next year. In 1947, former U.S. Vice President Henry A. Wallace was banned from speaking at UCLA because of his views on U.S. cold war policy. Controversial speakers invited to appear on college campuses have faced deplatforming in the form of attempts to disinvite them or to prevent them from speaking. The British National Union of Students established its No Platform policy as early as 1973. In the United States, recent examples include the March 2017 disruption by violent protestors of a public speech at Middlebury College by political scientist Charles Murray. In February 2018, students at the University of Central Oklahoma rescinded a speaking invitation to creationist Ken Ham, after pressure from an LGBT student group. In March 2018, a \\"small group of protesters\\" at Lewis & Clark Law School attempted to stop a speech by visiting lecturer Christina Hoff Sommers. Adam Carolla and Dennis Prager documented their disinvitation, and others, in their 2019 film No Safe Spaces. , the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a speech advocacy group, documented 440 disinvitation or disruption attempts at American campuses since 2000. Graduation speakers, in particular, have often been disinvited or forced to withdraw in the face of protests and other efforts to deny the opportunity to speak. According to Inside Higher Ed, \\"Planned commencement speakers have been disinvited from or backed out of various talks in recent years amid pressure from campus groups – usually students\\", as with Haverford's cancellation of a planned 2014 address by former Berkeley chancellor Robert Birgeneau. Birgeneau's replacement as speaker, former Princeton president William Bowen, responded in his own address by calling the suppression of speech \\"a defeat, pure and simple, for Haverford – no victory for anyone who believes, as I think most of us do, in both openness to many points of view and mutual respect.\\" In addition to Birgeneau, other notably deplatformed commencement speakers in 2014 included International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde, who withdrew after students circulated a petition at Smith College, and former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice at Rutgers University. After Rice was announced as commencement speaker, a student group staged a sit-in and Rutgers' faculty council passed a resolution that labeled Rice a \\"war criminal\\", causing Rice to withdraw from the ceremony. In some cases, opposition to a commencement speaker arises primarily from faculty members, as with Ursinus College's 2017 disinvitation of journalist Juan Williams, a political analyst for Fox News. Deplatforming efforts have also extended to corporate invitations. On March 26, 2019, Google announced an external advisory board to consider ethical issues around its artificial intelligence projects. The board's eight appointed members included Kay Coles James, president of the Heritage Foundation. Within days, 1,600 Google employees had signed an open petition seeking to remove James from the board. Employees had stated on Google's internal message boards that a person with James' conservative views about climate change policy, immigration, and LGBT rights \\"doesn't deserve a Google-legitimized platform.\\" On April 4, Google dissolved the advisory board, stating, \\"It's become clear that in the current environment, [the board] can't function as we wanted.\\" == Social media == As early as 2015, platforms such as Reddit began to enforce selective bans based, for example, on terms of service prohibiting \\"hate speech\\". According to technology journalist Declan McCullagh, \\"Silicon Valley's efforts to pull the plug on dissenting opinions\\" began around 2018 with Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube denying service to selected users of their platforms, \\"devising excuses to suspend ideologically disfavored accounts.\\" Law professor Glenn Reynolds dubbed 2018 the \\"Year of Deplatforming\\", in an August 2018 article in The Wall Street Journal. According to Reynolds, in 2018 \\"the internet giants decided to slam the gates on a number of people and ideas they don't like. If you rely on someone else's platform to express unpopular ideas, especially ideas on the right, you're now at risk.\\" Reynolds cited Alex Jones, Gavin McInnes, and Dennis Prager as prominent 2018 victims of deplatforming based on their political views, noting, \\"Extremists and controversialists on the left have been relatively safe from deplatforming.\\" Deplatforming has typically targeted individuals or organizations who use free accounts on social media platforms. In February 2019, McCullagh predicted that paying customers would become targets for deplatforming as well, citing protests and open letters by employees of Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Google who opposed policies of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and who reportedly sought to influence their employers to deplatform the agency and its contractors. Supporters of deplatforming have justified the action on the grounds that it produces the desired effect of reducing what they characterize as \\"hate speech\\". Angelo Carusone, president of the progressive organization Media Matters for America and who had run deplatforming campaigns against conservative talk hosts Rush Limbaugh in 2012 and Glenn Beck in 2010, pointed to Twitter's 2016 ban of Milo Yiannopoulos, stating that \\"the result was that he lost a lot.... He lost his ability to be influential or at least to project a veneer of influence.\\" === Twitter === Twitter has been described as vulnerable to manipulation by users who may coordinate in large numbers to flag politically controversial tweets as allegedly violating the platform's policies. The platform has been criticized over a long period for its failure to provide details of underlying alleged policy violations to the subjects of Twitter suspensions and bans. In July 2018, Twitter was accused of \\"shadow banning\\" prominent Republican politicians and conservative users, as a result of its implementation of a \\"quality filter\\" to hide content and users deemed \\"low quality\\" from search results and to limit the visibility of their tweets. Twitter later acknowledged the existence of the problem and characterized it as a software bug that it was working to correct, stating that its \\"behavioral ranking doesn't make judgements based on political views or the substance of tweets\\". In February 2019, Canadian journalist Meghan Murphy filed a lawsuit against Twitter for permanently banning her in 2018 based on its policy against misgendering, which Murphy called \\"viewpoint-based censorship\\". === Facebook and Instagram === On May 2, 2019, Facebook and the Facebook-owned platform Instagram announced a ban of \\"dangerous individuals and organizations\\" including Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, Milo Yiannopoulos, Alex Jones and his organization InfoWars, Paul Joseph Watson, Laura Loomer, and Paul Nehlen. Unlike the personal bans that removed the accounts of the named individuals, the ban on InfoWars as an organization extends to all users by prohibiting any content that contains or quotes material from InfoWars. Facebook and Instagram stated that such content would be removed, regardless of who posts it, unless the post is made to explicitly condemn the content. == Financial services == Financial service providers have deplatformed controversial speakers and organizations by denying them business services such as credit card payment processing, effectively limiting their ability to raise funds, accept payments, or sell items online. Retailers associated with the Seneca Nation of Indians and other native tribes in the state of New York were financially deplatformed during Eliot Spitzer's time as Attorney General of New York in 2006, as the state successfully ordered credit card companies and delivery services to refuse service to tobacco retailers on the Seneca Nation's reservations.\\"Attorneys General And Philip Morris USA Reach Landmark Agreement To Reduce Illegal Internet Cigarette Sales\\", Office of the NY Attorney General The deplatforming was part of a broader attempt to eliminate a price disparity between native tribes, which do not charge excise taxes on tobacco or gasoline sold by their members and have blocked state efforts to collect the taxes on their reservations (but have prosecuted non- native persons on the reservations for attempting to secure the same price protections), and the rest of the state, which charges high excise taxes, particularly on tobacco. In 2018, Visa and MasterCard stopped processing donations to the David Horowitz Freedom Center at the request of the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), an advocacy group which had listed the organization as a hate group. Robert Spencer, editor-in-chief of the publication Jihad Watch, had previously been deplatformed from Patreon under pressure from MasterCard. PayPal, an online payment and funding platform, has terminated accounts of organizations that were accused of advocating racist views or promoting \\"hate, violence and intolerance.\\" According to The Washington Post, PayPal banned at least 34 alleged hate groups in August 2017, after more than two years of lobbying by the SPLC. In February 2019, PayPal terminated the account of activist Laura Loomer, who stated that she had also been banned from using GoFundMe and Venmo to raise funds, and from using Uber and Lyft. In February 2018, First National Bank of Omaha became the first of several companies to cut ties with the National Rifle Association. A month later, on March 22, 2018, Citigroup announced that it would turn away business customers and commercial partners based on a new Citigroup policy restricting sales of firearms, applying the policy to clients seeking to \\"borrow money, use banking services or raise capital through the company\\". Chase Bank closed the accounts of alt-right activist Enrique Tarrio in February 2019, after which Tarrio was also deplatformed by credit card payment processors First Data, Square, Stripe, and PayPal, in addition to being banned from social media platforms. == Harassment and threats to employment == Deplatforming tactics have also included attempts to silence controversial speakers through various forms of personal harassment, such as doxing, the making of false emergency reports for purposes of swatting, and complaints or petitions to third parties. In some cases, protesters have attempted to have speakers blacklisted from projects or fired from their jobs. In 2019, for example, students at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia circulated an online petition demanding that Camille Paglia \\"should be removed from UArts faculty and replaced by a queer person of color.\\" Paglia, a tenured professor for over 30 years who identifies as transgender, had long been unapologetically outspoken on controversial \\"matters of sex, gender identity, and sexual assault\\". According to Conor Friedersdorf, writing in The Atlantic: Friedersdorf pointed to evidence of a chilling effect on free speech and academic freedom. Of the faculty members he had contacted for interviews, a large majority \\"on both sides of the controversy insisted that their comments be kept off the record or anonymous. They feared openly participating in a debate about a major event at their institution—even after their university president put out an uncompromising statement in support of free speech\\". == Other examples  Ravelry === Ravelry, a site that describes itself as a \\"place for knitters, crocheters, designers, spinners, weavers and dyers to keep track of their yarn, tools, project and pattern information, and look to others for ideas and inspiration\\", announced a ban on \\"support of Donald Trump and his administration\\" on June 23, 2019. As its stated rationale for the ban, which extends to forum posts, projects, patterns, profiles, and all other content, Ravelry took the position that \\"Support of the Trump administration is undeniably support for white supremacy\\", and stated, \\"We cannot provide a space that is inclusive of all and also allow support for open white supremacy.\\" === In print media === In December 2017, after learning that a French artist it had previously reviewed was a neo-Nazi, the San Francisco punk magazine Maximum Rocknroll apologized and announced that it has \\"a strict no-platform policy towards any bands and artists with a Nazi ideology\\". ==See also== *No Platform *Freedom of speech *Censorship *Post-World War II anti- fascism *Online shaming ==References== Category:Social media Category:Web 2.0 neologisms Category:New media Category:Social networks Category:Revolutionary tactics Category:Blacklisting Category:Censorship Category:Political repression Category:Ethically disputed political practices Category:Internet manipulation and propaganda Category:Internet-based activism ","title":"Deplatforming"},{"id":"56812366","text":"The Department of Youth Development (যুব উন্নয়ন অধিদপ্তর) is a government department of Bangladesh responsible for the development of the youth population.

She has taught at Emily Carr University of Art and Design, and as an educational programmer at the Contemporary Art Gallery in Vancouver. == Select projects  All the Trees === In Fall of 2018, Holly instigated a tree mapping project by tagging 30 trees with ID and an email address in the West Point Grey Community Centre and Jericho Park area. Inspired by the City of Melbourne tree mapping project in which the purpose of labelling trees so that residents could report tree damage or disease by email, the project was hijacked by citizens sending personal notes of their admiration for the trees. Schmidt opened up the same opportunity for Vancouver trees, and with a response email back it will also educate about the different species of deciduous and coniferous trees located in the parks. Schmidt worked with historian John Atkin, poet Rahat Kurd, horticulturalist Egan Davis, and indigenous herbalist Lori Snyder as a part of the Artist in Communities program through the Vancouver Park Board. === Lost Lessons (Midnight Picnic) === Since 2014, Schmidt has employed her father's (a former professor in the sciences) astronomy slide collection that spans over thirty years of diagrams, illustrations, NASA and other observatory photographs and various technical capacities to document the universe. Caitlin Chaisson has described the ongoing series as \\"stargazing events that explore what it means to be tethered to the Earth\\". Continuing and supported by a Canadian Council for the Arts grant, a new iteration expanding on the work collaborates with the theatre company Boca Del Lupo. === Grow: An Art + Urban Agriculture Project === In a public intervention project with Other Sights for Artists' Projects between May to November 2011, Schmidt harvested and engaged local community in a living ecological laboratory in the middle of the city that she called Grow. In a vacant industrial lot near Vancouver's Olympic Village, Schmidt occupied the space with a living garden that brought people together to share their knowledge and experience in sustainable design and Eco-philosophy. Activated by activities such as the Grow Seed Exchange, walking dialogues with disciplinary experts on sustainability including Designer Duane Elverum and Trudeau Scholar Rajdeep Singh Gill, and drop-in workshops on urban farming, visitors practiced new potentials for growing food against the backdrop of high-end condos that mark Vancouver's notorious housing market. Using social practice methods, the events create collaborative, informal, grassroots interaction that model an alternative social structures in contrast to industrial food systems. The work evolved into other participatory and collaborative events, such as Moveable Feast at Burnaby Art Gallery which featured foraged food and locally found ingredients, honey, spiced mead, fermented beverages, simple cheese making and pickled vegetables. The series provided workshops with underground chefs including Fermented Beverages == Residencies == Schmidt has engaged in participatory projects on food and food mobility through various residencies, such as the Santa Fe Art Institute Food Justice Residency, Mess Hall at the Banff Centre, Lore Residency at Zocalo Organic Farm in Guelph Ontario, Woodland School with Duane Linklater at Artscape in Toronto, among others. == References == Category:Artists from Vancouver Category:Emily Carr University of Art and Design alumni Category:Canadian women artists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ","title":"Holly Schmidt"},{"id":"56812385","text":"John Brampton Gurdon, known as Brampton Gurdon, (25 September 1797 – 28 April 1881) was a British Liberal Party and Whig politician. ==Family== Born in 1797, Gurdon was the son of Theophilus Thornhagh Gurdon and Anne Mellish.

From a geomorphological point of view, it represents a residual ridge that has been formed by weathering and erosion over millions of years. == Formation == The Pfahl consists of quartz that was deposited as a hydrothermal vein about 275 million years ago within the existing fault structure.http://www.lfu.bayern.de/geologie/geotope_schoensten/1/index.htm The Pfahl was probably active as a fault several times. Because the rock of the Pfahl was harder than the surrounding rock, it was left standing like a wall as softer rocks were eroded. Today the Pfahl forms a residual ridge 150 kilometres long and 10 to 40 metres high. The shining white quartz of the Pfahl consists of up to 98% silicic acid; any yellowish to reddish or grey coloration is caused by iron compounds and impurities (Pfahlschiefer). The interpretation of the actual Pfahl fault as a suture is disputed; but it has been confirmed that it separates various magmatic rocks.Shang, C.K., Siebel, W., Rohrmüller, H. (2008) The Bavarian Forest basement: geochemistry and Sr-Nd isotope signature and implications for Bavarian granite sources. Journal of Alpine Geology 48 p.99http://petrology.oxfordjournals.org/content/50/4/591.full.pdfhttp://homepages.uni- tuebingen.de/wolfgang.siebel/pdffiles/siebel_JPET_reply_2009.pdf == Course == The Pfahl begins in the northwest in the Upper Palatinate, southeast of Schwarzenfeld, passes the town of Cham to the southwest and runs in a southeasterly direction via Viechtach, Regen, Grafenau and Freyung and into Upper Austria's Mühlviertel. The quartz only outcrops in a few places (and not at all southeast of Freyung); otherwise the Pfahl is only recognisable as a ridge. In Weißenstein near Regen it reaches a height of 758 metres above sea level; on this summit stand the ruins of Weißenstein Castle. The quartz formations are most easily visible near Viechtach (west of the town) and here they rise up to 30 metres above the ground. With a few exceptions the Pfahl has survived as a continuous geological formation. Through the Zellertal valley between Bad Kötzting and Bodenmais another Pfahl-like slate zone runs parallel to the actual Pfahl and in which the quartz does not immediately outcrop. This 'secondary pfahl' is called the Rundingen Pfahl Zone (Rundinger- Pfahlzone). Its southeastern outcrop lies near Bettmannsäge southwest of Zwiesel. There is another secondary pfahl in the southeast of the Bavarian Forest, the Aicha-Hals Secondary Pfahl (Aicha-Halser-Nebenpfahl), which is responsible for the double bend on the Ilz near Hals as well as a bend in the River Danube to the north just behind Passau. There is yet another one between Kirchberg vorm Wald and Gerlesberg. == Natural region divisions == The longest section of the Pfahl runs through the Regen Depression. Here there are several, individual, southeast-running residual ridges that are repeatedly interrupted by basins and transverse valleys. From a natural regional perspective, the Pfahl is divided into the following sub-divisions as follows (from NW to SE): * to 404 Regen Depression (Regensenke) ** 404.2 Pfahl *** 404.25 Thierlstein Pfahl (Thierlsteiner Pfahl), SW of Cham; on the main chain up to 448.9 m, on its southwest uplands up to 469.9 m *** 404.24 Moosbach Pfahl (Moosbacher Pfahl), up to 639 m *** 404.23 Viechtach Pfahl (Viechtacher Pfahl), up to 583 m *** 404.22 Patersdorf Pfahl (Patersdorfer Pfahl), up to 648 m *** 404.21 March Pfahl (Marcher Pfahl), on its southwest highlands up to 784.6 m *** 404.20 Weissenstein Pfahl (Weißensteiner Pfahl), at Weißenstein Castle 758 mThe 758 m height is taken from Sheet 174 Straubing. Southeast and on the far side of the Regen Depression, in the Abteiland, the sections of the Pfahl are geomorphologically less obvious and do not form their own natural regions. One notable geotope there is the Buchberger Leite. === National geotope === In 2006 the Pfahl was added to the list of 77 outstanding national geotopes in Germany.Stefan Glaser: Ein langer Schnitt in der Erdkruste Bayerns - Der \\"Bayerische Pfahl\\".

He was highly rated as a juvenile and showed promise by winning the Clearwell Stakes on the second of his two starts. He recorded his biggest when winning the 2000 Guineas on his debut as a three-year-old. Clarissimus went on to finish second in the Newmarket Stakes and a substitute St Leger before winning the Champion Stakes on his final appearance. After his retirement from racing he became a breeding stallion and had considerable influence as a sire of broodmares. ==Background== Clarissimus was a chestnut horse bred in the United Kingdom by his owner Evelyn Boscawen, 7th Viscount Falmouth. He was foaled on 15 January 1913. The colt was sent into training with William Waugh at the Kingsclere stable in Berkshire. He was probably the best horse sired by Radium, a slow-maturing stayer whose wins included the Jockey Club Cup, Goodwood Cup and Doncaster Cup. The most notable of Radium's other progeny was Night Raid, who was exported to Australia where he sired Phar Lap and Nightmarch. Clarissimus' dam Quintessence was an unbeaten mare whose six wins included the 1000 Guineas in 1903. Clarissimus's racing career took place during World War I. Many racecourses were closed for the duration of the conflict and all five of traditional British Classic Races were run at Newmarket. ==Racing career1915: two-year-old season=== Clarissimus showed very promising form on the training gallops and was highly regarded by his trainer, but on his racecourse debut he was well beaten by the fillies Telephone Girl and Fifinella in the Bibury Stakes ant Newmarket. At the same track in October he recorded his first success in the Clearwell Stakes. ===1916: three-year-old season=== Clarissimus' owner 7th Viscount Falmouth Clarissimus performed well in training in the spring of 1916 although his trainer's confidence was somewhat dented when his galloping companion, a filly named Angelina, ran poorly in the Greenham Stakes. On 3 May Clarissimus, ridden by Jimmy Clark, started at odds of 100/7 (approximately 14/1) for the 108th running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket. The race was run in \\"hazy\\" conditions and the early stages were not clearly visible from the stands although it was clear that the horses had split into two groups on either side of the wide straight. When the field emerged into clear view Clarissimus was towards the front of the group on the stands-side and won \\"pretty comfortably\\" by three quarters of a length from Kwang-Su with Nassovian half a length away in third place. The favourite Figaro, who raced up the opposite side of the track, finished fourth of the seventeen runners. In the Newmarket Stakes over ten furlongs on 17 May, Clarissimus was beaten half a length by Figaro. He had a particularly bad race and did not recover sufficiently to take part in the \\"New Derby\\". After a break of almost four months, Clarissimus returned for the September Stakes at Newmarket, a substitute race for the St Leger. He proved to be no match for the favourite Hurry On but took second place, five lengths clear of Atheling in third place. In October the colt was matched against older horses in the Champion Stakes and started the 6/4 favourite after the late withdrawal of Pommern. Ridden by the Australian jockey Frank Bullock, he had \\"no difficulty\\" in winning from the four-year-old filly Silver Tag. ==Assessment and honours== In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Clarissimus an \\"average\\" winner of the 2000 Guineas. ==Stud record== At the end of his racing career Clarissimus was retired to become a breeding stallion in England where he stood for three years before being exported to France. Although his offspring had little success on the track his daughters had considerable success as broodmares. He was the damsire of Pharis, Brantome, Donatello (sire of Crepello and Alycidon) and Crudite (Grand Prix de Paris). His last foals were born in 1933. ==Pedigree== *Clarissimus was inbred 4 × 4 to Galopin, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree. ==References== Category:1913 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 2-s Category:2000 Guineas winners ","title":"Clarissimus (horse)"},{"id":"56813023","text":"Maria L.

The San Juan 34 design is a development of the 1975 Crown 34. ==Production== The Crown 34 was first built by Calgan Marine in North Vancouver, BC, Canada, with 30 examples completed between 1975 and 1979. After production of the Crown 34 ended in 1979, the molds were sold to GlassFab of Monroe, Washington, United States. That company only built five examples, under the name Sun 1020.

Her father worked as an architect. She grew up with her family in Berlin's Weissensee quarter, ending up after the war in the Soviet occupation zone, which would be relaunched in October 1949 as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). She studied fashion and design at the Berlin-Weißensee Visual and Applied Arts academy. At the end of the course students were required to submit a dissertation. Voigt completed her degree in 1960 with a dissertation that was savagely critical of East Germany's popular fashion magazine, \\"Sibylle\\" which had been founded in 1956, a few years earlier: she was repelled by the publication's staid fashions, its pathetic poses and its housewifely approach. Margot Pfannstiel, editor-in- chief at \\"Sibylle\\", became aware of Dorothea's dissertation and spotted an opportunity. The women met: \\"I've read your work: it's most interesting. If you know it all with such clarity, then start here. Do [the fashion section] yourself, and make it better\\" (\\"Ich habe Ihre Arbeit gelesen, ist ja interessant. Wenn Sie alles so genau wissen, dann fangen Sie mal hier an. Und machen das mal, und zwar besser.\\") In 1961 the 23-year-old was recruited to the magazine, mandated to create a modern socialist image for women. === Sibylle === Dorothea Voigt married the graphic artist and illustrator Axel Bertram in 1957. By the time the marriage ended in 1961 it had produced a son who stayed with his mother after the parents parted. By the time she died Dorothea would also be a grandmother. It was as Dorothea Bertram that she headed up Sibylle's fashion department between 1961 and 1970. Recruiting a new generation of photographers such as, most notably, Arno Fischer, Günter Rössler and Roger Melis, she worked to define a new concept in fashion, based around the theme of a modern, self-assured, educated working woman, integrated into contemporary culture. Sources credit her with having introduced the mini- skirt to the German Democratic Republic in 1967. Despite her iconic status the head of fashion at Easy Germany's fashion magazine was still subject to some of the usual constraints. When she turned up to work wearing an elegant pair of jeans, the editor in chief asked her firmly not to wear \\"these American pants ... for work\\" (\\"... bitte nicht im Betrieb, mit diesen amerikanischen Hosen\\"). Towards the end of the decade there was a change at the top of Sibylle, when Margot Pfannstiel moved on, succeeded as editor in chief by Yvonne Freyer, \\"a party loyalist\\", in October 1968. Ingeburg Lange, as chair of Women's Commission of the powerful Party Central Committee (\\"Frauenkommission des Zentralkomitees\\") was by now speaking out in favour of a switch to a \\"more popular approach\\" for the magazine, and the pages increasingly prioritised \\"arts and crafts\\" and folkloric themes. The \\"advice column\\" section expanded. As the fashion photographer Ute Mahler later recalled, there was nothing so simple as state censorship. \\"We always did what we wanted. The trouble came afterwards, if we had not aligned our ideas of beauty and fashion with those of the Women's Commission of the Central Committee.\\" The result was a growing level of self-censorship and frustration. Dorothea Bertram left \\"Sibylle\\" in 1970. === VEB Exquisit === Dorothea Bertram was a huge admirer of the work of the fashion photographer Roger Melis, and in 1970 the two of them were married. Between 1970 and 1990 – now with her considerable reputation secured in the East German fashion world – Dorothea Melis worked for the upmarket clothing retail chain VEB Exquisit. The business had been established in 1962 by order of the Council of Ministers, through a conviction, they said, that East German citizens should be able to obtain luxury goods without being forced to involve themselves (illegally) in using western money (known colloquially as \\"Westgeld\\"). Dorothea Melis was responsible for press and public relations. This also involved organising fashion shows. The company sold high-quality modern clothing, much of it imported, which was differentiated from more mainstream \\"off-the-peg\\" fashion products through its sophisticated design concepts and its insistence on high- quality manufacturing. In some ways the business expanded beyond its original niche: sources claim that at its peak, with 44 outlets, it accounted for almost 30% of East Germany's clothing sales by value. === Beyond the change === After several years during which the winds of Glasnost blowing across from, of all places, Moscow, found a growing resonance in East German cities, in November 1989 street protestors broke through the Berlin Wall. It very quickly became obvious that the Soviet troops had received no instructions to intervene, as they had back in 1953, and the self-confidence of the political establishment rapidly crumbled. A succession of further events led, in March 1990, the East Germany's first (and, as matters turned out, last) free election. reunification took place a few months later, formally in October 1990. VEB Exquisit failed to compete effectively with western retailers from, which quickly bought up most of its well positioned city centre retail outlets. Some of those who had worked for it proved themselves more adaptable to the changing times, however. Dorothea Melis's East German reputation initially counted for little in the new Germany, but it soon became obvious that not everyone wanted to forget the \\"socialist\\" version of Germany. In 1992 the first edition of Dorothea Melis' book \\"Sibylle. Modefotografien 1962–1994\\" appeared, and very quickly became acknowledged as the standard work on Fashion Photography in the German Democratic Republic. She was able to organise exhibitions of the work of photographers who had worked with her for \\"Sibylle\\", such as Sibylle Bergemann. She gave lectures on fashion in the German Democratic Republic at the art colleges, wrote more books about the past and wryly observed the present. Dorothea Melis was predeceased by her second husband. In June 2015 she herself died, on a Monday, in Berlin aged 77, following a long illness. == Output (selection) == * Sibylle.

Successful candidates could register with the General Medical Council (GMC) and practise medicine in the United Kingdom. It was a route used by international medical graduates and those unable to gain entry to university medical schools, which included women in the late 19th century and refugee medical students and doctors throughout the 20th century. ==Origins== Before the Medical Act (1858) medical practitioners in the British Isles could acquire their qualifications from a number of institutions including universities, medical and surgical colleges and from the Apothecaries' Halls in London and Dublin. The 1858 Act established the General Medical Council and the Medical Register, and began the process of standardising medical education, qualification and registration. The Medical Act (Amendment Act) of 1886 required qualification in both medicine and surgery for entry to the Medical Register and the three Scottish medical royal colleges set up a combined medical and surgical qualification called the Triple Qualification (TQ). This was approved by the GMC in 1884, and in the same year the Royal College of Physicians of London and the Royal College of Surgeons of England set up a similar joint qualification known as the Conjoint Diploma. Anderson's College Medical School, Glasgow, showing the tower and the plaque with the College name engraved ==Teaching and training== The TQ examination regulations required candidates to present proof of having attended approved lectures and approved clinical teaching placements. In Edinburgh and Glasgow private anatomy schools and small private medical schools had been a key feature of medical education since the late 18th century. These were known collectively as extramural schools. In Glasgow these included Anderson’s College Medical School and the Glasgow Royal Infirmary School of Medicine, which in 1888 became St Mungo's Medical School. The Queen Margaret College Medical School for Women merged with the University of Glasgow in 1892. In Edinburgh many university lecturers and professors also gave extramural classes including John Barclay, Robert Knox, Robert Liston and James Syme. The first school to offer lectures on a range of subjects was Queen's College, established in 1841. Two medical schools for women latterly formed part of the extramural school in Edinburgh. In 1885 Sophia Jex-Blake founded the Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women,(which closed in 1896) and in 1889 Elsie Inglis and her father John Inglis founded the Edinburgh College of Medicine for Women. One of the effects of the GMC regulation was the consolidation of most of the extramural schools in Edinburgh into a formal School of Medicine of the Royal Colleges, founded in 1895. This school of medicine had a charter, a board of governors from the three colleges and provided a comprehensive lecture course equivalent to that of a university medical school, and became the principle teaching institution in Edinburgh for TQ students. == Curriculum == Candidates for the TQ were first required to pass a preliminary entrance examination or show evidence of an approved university degree. The former School of Medicine of the Edinburgh Royal Colleges They were then required to complete a curriculum as follows:In addition to the above, many candidates took voluntary additional courses which included sanitary science, histology, botany, psychiatry, dermatology, ophthalmic surgery, diseases of the ear, nose and throat and therapeutics. These regulations were rigorously enforced and exceptions were rarely granted. Doctors who had qualified elsewhere in the world, often with years of experience were still required to complete the clinical elements and in many cases the basic science elements. == Examinations == The examinations were very similar to those taken in university medical schools. Basic sciences and basic anatomy were examined at the end of the first year, anatomy, physiology and materia medica at the end of the second year with clinical examinations being taken in the final year. The examinations changed with time to take account of advances in medicine and medical education. They came to include anaesthetics, paediatrics, psychiatry, ophthalmology, diseases of the ear, nose and throat, forensic medicine, and venereal disease. From 1968 international graduates from approved medical schools could be admitted directly to the final examination.RCSEd TQ archive 1980 ref6/1/11/2 In 1975 the GMC set up the Temporary Registration Assessment Board (TRAB) , which conducted its own structured examination for international medical graduates, which included an assessment of English language skills. TQ candidates were required to pass this before being granted temporary GMC registration. From 1978 this became the Professional and Linguistic Assessments Board (PLAB). Candidates who successfully completed the course and passed the examinations could place the post-nominals LRCPE, LRCSE & LRCPSG after their names and could apply for provisional registration with the GMC. After completion of one year of pre-registration house officer posts, they could apply for full registration. == Candidates == The total number of candidates obtaining the TQ qualification between 1894 and 1993 has been calculated to be 10,246, of whom 9.3% were women. The pass rate has been estimated at 48% in 1890-99 down to 21% in the last examination to be administered by the TQ board in 1993. Many of the candidates came from countries of the former British Empire, many came from Europe and others from Russia, China, Japan, South America and the United States. Scottish qualification regulations were simpler than those in England. The examination therefore proved to be a popular route to British medical practice for international medical graduates whose degrees were not recognised in the UK, for refugee doctors or aspiring doctors and for those unable to gain entry to university medical schools. In the latter years of the 19th century, this included women whose entry to British university medical schools began in 1892. Between 1884 and 1909, 7% of those qualifying with the TQ qualification were women, a higher percentage than qualified from university medical schools at that time. Among the women to qualify with the TQ were Elsie Inglis, who went on to found the Scottish Women's Hospitals in WW1 and Dagmar Berne. who became the second woman to register as a doctor in Australia. Between 1933 and 1938, some 25% of the successful candidates were of European Jewish origin, a reflection of Nazi persecution. Some of these Jewish refugees who qualified with the TQ went on to academic careers in the UK, like Hans Kosterlitz, who fled from Berlin to Aberdeen where he worked with J J R MacLeod, who had, jointly with Frederick Banting, won the Nobel Prize for the discovery of insulin. Kosterlitz qualified with the Triple Qualification in 1938, and eventually became Professor of Pharmacology at Aberdeen University in 1968. He went on to discover endorphins and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society who awarded him their prestigious gold medal. Following the unilateral declaration of independence by the then Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) in 1965, many of the candidates came from that country. == Controversies == Throughout its lifetime, controversy was never far away from the TQ, the conjoint examination and the LMSSA (Licence in Medicine and Surgery of the Society of Apothecaries). The TQ had been created out of a concern felt by the Scottish medical colleges that they might lose their status as licensing bodies in favour of the universities and the London Colleges. The universities from the outset regarded the TQ as inferior to their examinations. In 1870, Edinburgh University told Parliament that it had a ‘fully equipped medical school which was operating to higher standards than any of the other award bodies’.Edinburgh University Library (EUL) Da31.5, Minutes of the Senatus Academicus, 24 June 1870, 14 June 1872. Most doctors who had qualified with the TQ pursued a career in general practice rather than a hospital speciality, and many felt that there was discrimination against them entering hospital medicine as they had what was regarded by many as an 'inferior qualification'. Until the 1960s many university medical students would take the TQ or the Conjoint final exams as practice for university finals or as a fall back in case of failure in finals. It was common for those who did fail university final to then sit the TQ, conjoint or LMSSA. In 1982, seven out of ten Cambridge University medical students who had failed university exams immediately sat and passed the Apothecaries examination, further strengthening the view that non-university exams were set at a lower standard. The view that the three non-university medical qualifications constituted an inappropriate and easy \\"back door into medicine\\" was regularly voiced in the medical press. Despite being regarded as an inferior qualification and in the face of repeated unfavourable GMC inspections, there was pressure on the GMC for its retention, on the grounds that it offered international graduates, and in particular refugee doctors, a British medical qualification. ==Demise == The Goodenough report (1944) concluded that \\"...the extra-mural schools [are] of a lower standard than other schools in the country\\" and recommended that all undergraduate medical education and qualification in the UK should be administered by universities.Goodenough W. Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Medical Education [Goodenough Report]. London: HMSO; 1944. As a result, the Edinburgh School of Medicine of the Royal Colleges closed in 1948. Yet the Colleges continued to offer the TQ qualification. In the 1950s many candidates were British students whose studies had been interrupted by war service, while from the early 1960s the vast majority of candidates were international medical graduates or medical students. From 1979 the GMC required prospective international candidates for the TQ to sit and pass the PLAB examination. Freedom of movement of workers within the European Union from 1973 began the process of EU qualified medical practitioners practising in the UK without any examination. This was eventually enshrined in UK law by European Directive 2005/36/EC in 2005. A GMC inspection in 1985 found the TQ examination 'old-fashioned'Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, TQ minutes, 7 March 1986 and from 1994 the Triple and the Conjoint examinations, together with the LMSSA were combined and came under the aegis of the United Examining Board(UEB) which had been set up to by the GMC to oversee non-university medical qualifications. Candidates now sat the same examination, held in turn by each of the three licensing bodies. At the same examination diet they sat written, oral and clinical examinations and, if successful, were awarded the qualification of the centre where they sat. Candidates who sat in Edinburgh were still awarded the Triple Qualification. Inspections by the GMC from 1998 reported doubts about whether successful candidates had the 'breadth and depth of knowledge, the clinical skills and the professional attitudes and values expected by the GMC of UK- qualified doctors'. They concluded that the examination was not fit for purpose and recommended its abolition. The final diet of the TQ examination was held in 1993. In 2000 the GMC decided that all UEB candidates should be assessed by universities. The last LMSSA diploma was awarded in 2003 and the UEB was dissolved in 2007. ==References Further reading == * Bell, E. M. (1953). Storming the citadel: The rise of the woman doctor.

It was first recognized as a group containing multiple genera by Hoffstetter in 1955. The group has sometimes been given a formal taxonomic name as the family Sapheosauridae, although in some analyses this group belongs to the family Sphenodontidae (which also contains the tuatara, the only living rhynchocephalian) and thus cannot be assigned its own family. They were fairly advanced rhynchocephalians which may have had semiaquatic habits. == Classification == The most well-known members of the group are Sapheosaurus and Kallimodon, and most phylogenetic analyses on rhynchocephalians only study these two genera as representatives of sapheosaurs. Although a few early phylogenies in the 1990s did not find that these two formed a natural clade, the relation between these two is now considered to be more stable, and has been found in practically every major analysis of rhynchocephalians since Apesteguía & Novas (2003). Sapheosaurus laticeps (=Piocormus) However, the relation between sapheosaurs as a whole and other rhynchocephalians is less clear. Although they are clearly members of the group Sphenodontia like almost all other rhynchocephalians, the construction of their jaw joints means that they were unable to move their jaws in a front-to-back chewing movement. This excludes them from the clade of sphenodonts which are capable of such movement, the so-called \\"eupropalinal sphenodonts\\" such as the tuatara, (formally known as Sphenodon), its close relatives, and the herbivorous opisthodonts. They are also generally considered to be more derived (as in closer to Sphenodon) than clevosaurs and basal genera such as Godavarisaurus and Sphenocondor. The in-group relations of sphenodonts are inconsistent between analyses, so although sapheosaurs may be the sister group of eupropalinal sphenodonts under some methodologies, other potentially more derived taxon include Homoeosaurus, Pamizinsaurus, Ankylosphenodon, the Sphenovipera+Theretairus clade, and pleurosaurs. A 2017 study utilizing both parsimony and bayesian analyses found some support for a clade including sapheosaurs, Vadasaurus, and pleurosaurs. Although the bayesian analysis placed this clade in a large polytomy with various other rhynchocephalian groups and genera, the parsimony analysis actually placed it among the eupropalinal sphenodonts. If this phylogeny is accurate, this would mean that an ancestor of this clade lost front-to-back chewing which was present in an even earlier ancestor, rather than never having it in the first place. == Description == All known members of the group lived in coastal environments of the late Jurassic in what is now Germany and France. They are very similar to each other, only noticeably differing in certain proportions of the skull. Evans (1988) and Ahmad (1993) have even considered that they may all belong to a single species, although a shortage of good studies and descriptions focusing on this group in particular means that any conclusions on the relationships between different sapheosaurs are uncertain at best. === Skull === The postorbital region of the skull (behind the eyes) is lengthened and expanded in this group to such a point that it is longer than the preorbital region (in front of the eyes). Although clevosaurs also had skulls which were largest in the postorbital region, they evolved such a feature through different means, namely the preorbital region being shortened. The upper temporal fenestrae (a pair of large holes on the top of the rear part of the skull) are long but fairly thin, a feature also known in Vadasaurus and Palaeopleurosaurus, potential relatives of the group. Each upper temporal arch, which separates the upper temporal fenestrae from the lower temporal fenestrae (on the sides of the skull), is broad. Sapheosaurs, like other sphenodonts, had acrodont teeth which grew directly from the bone and could not be replaced. At least one known sapheosaur specimen (the holotype of Sapheosaurus) had its teeth completely worn away so that it was functionally toothless. === Other features === The centra (main body) of each caudal (tail) vertebra is flattened from the side in sapheosaurs. Sapheosaur vertebrae also had swollen neural arches (the area above the spinal cord) and zygapophyses (connecting joint plates), features also present in Ankylosphenodon. Some have proposed that sapheosaurs were at least partially aquatic due to some similarities and/or possible close relations to Ankylosphenodon (now believed to be convergently evolved) or Vadasaurus and pleurosaurs. However, they do not share many of the adaptations that these other taxa possess, and some researchers are not convinced by this hypothesis. ==References== . .

MAP was established in 2015 by a group of retired detectives, investigative journalists, homicide scholars, and a forensic psychiatrist. MAP has assembled records on most criminal fatalities, including case-level details on many thousands of homicides that local police failed to report to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s voluntary Uniform Crime Report program. At its website, the group also provides access to an interactive computer algorithm that has identified homicides committed by known serial killers and suspicious clusters of murders that might contain serial killings. MAP is an outgrowth of a 2010 national reporting project led by Scripps Howard News Service reporter Thomas Hargrove, who wanted to know if FBI computer files could be used to detect previously unrecognized serial killings. The project took first place in the 2011 Philip Meyer Journalism Award offered by the National Institute of Computer Assisted Reporting for outstanding journalism using social science techniques. Hargrove developed an algorithm that organizes homicide reports into groups based on the victims’ gender, geographic location, and method of killing. The algorithm searches for murder clusters with extremely low clearance rates. The algorithm’s identification of 15 unsolved strangulations in Gary, Indiana, was validated with the October 18, 2014, arrest of Darren Deon Vann by the Hammond Police Department. Vann confessed to multiple homicides and took police to abandoned properties in Gary, where the bodies of six previously unknown female victims were recovered. MAP personnel warned police and local journalists about larger clusters of suspicious female homicides committed in Cleveland and Chicago. The Cleveland Police Department assembled a small task force to review the area’s unsolved homicides following release of the group’s analysis. Chicago Police Department officials told reporters it had found no evidence of serial murders in a wave of unsolved female strangulations committed since 2000. MAP filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the Illinois State Police on December 3, 2015, to compel the state to release homicide data it “no longer reports to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report and Supplementary Homicide Report.” The case was settled when Illinois agreed to release data on hundreds of cases it hadn’t provided to the federal government. After determining Illinois State Police were not counting how often Illinois police solve homicides through arrest, MAP sent Freedom of Information Act data requests to 102 Illinois law enforcement agencies and determined the state suffered the lowest clearance rate in the nation in 2015. The MAP Board of Directors includes: Eric Witzig, a retired homicide detective and former FBI intelligence analyst, Enzo Yaksic, director of the Northeastern University Atypical Homicide Research Group, and Michael Arntfield, a professor at the University of Western Ontario where he runs a cold-case society. == References == Category:Non-profit organizations based in the United States Category:Murder in the United States ","title":"Murder Accountability Project"},{"id":"56813509","text":"Gillian Docherty is a British computer scientist and CEO of The Data Lab, which helps Scottish industry innovate through data science and artificial intelligence. == Education == Docherty completed a computer science degree at the University of Glasgow.

Bernhard Grueber and Adalbert Müller described it in 1846 as the äußern Wald ('outer forest') \\"named the Regen Mountains by the geographers\\".Bernhard Grueber, Adalbert Müller: Der bayrische Wald (Böhmerwald), 1846, Reprint 1993, p. 8. Others chose the name Danube Hills (Donaugebirge) instead. Frequently this region was even equated with the Bavarian Forest and contrasted with the Bohemian Forest. Beer, in his work Der Böhmerwald und Bayerische Wald in 1925, talked of a \\"major prelude to the Bohemian Forest“.K. Beer: Der Böhmerwald und Bayerische Wald, Monographien zur Erdkunde, Bd. 34, Bielefeld 1925, p. 4. Even today, many maps only label the lower forest as the Bavarian Forest.http://img226.imagevenue.com/img.php?image=22491_B01_122_461lo.jpg In 1951, the Bavarian Office of Regional Studies (Amt für Landeskunde) described this region as the Anterior Bavarian Forest (Vorderer Bayerische Wald) and gave its central highlands the name High Bavarian Forest (Hoher Bayerischer Vorwald).A. Schramm: Wie heißt unser Heimatgebirge?, in: Der Bayerwald, 1952, pp. 140–143. As part of the regional division of Germany the term Anterior Bavarian Forest was even exclusively restricted to this area which covered 376 km², which only covered the higher parts of the Vorderer Forest. It became major unit 405 in the natural region major unit group, the Upper Palatine- Bavarian Forest (40). English sources variously use the names Vorderer Forest,Vorderer Forest at www.britannica.com. Retrieved 11 Mar 2018.

Tree damages in the vicinity of mobile phone base stations by Cornelia Waldmann-Selsam and Horst Eger. Retrieved 11 Mar 2018. Regardless of this, the part designated as the Falkensteiner Vorwald in regional studies is also called the Vorderer Bayerischer Wald in German sources used for tourism purposes.http://www.vorderer-bayerischer- wald.de/Ferienregion/%C3%9Cbersichtskarte/tabid/4662/language/de-DE/Default. aspx However, the following description is based on the regional structure. == Description == The natural region of the Danube Hills is only 8 kilometres wide on average. It runs in the typical Hercynian direction from southeast to northwest between the Danube water gap (Donaurandbruch) in the south and the Pfahl in the north. The low mountain range consists mainly of granitised gneisses and reaches heights of over one thousand metres. Its highest point is the Einödriegel at 1,121 metres. Other important mountains are the Pröller, Hirschenstein, Vogelsang, Dreitannenriegel, Breitenauriegel, Geißkopf and Brotjacklriegel. The mountainous region is dominated by woods as well as agriculture and forestry. At the foot of the Pröller lies the winter sports resort of Sankt Englmar. Kalteck, near Langfurth and the Geißkopf and Einödriegel are also important for winter sports. The region is administered by the municipalities of Gotteszell, Grafling, Schöfweg and Zenting. On the Rusel the state road S 2135 crosses the range, whilst the B 11, which originally ran over the Rusel, now bypasses this pass and follows the Bavarian Forest Railway along the Bogenbach. The railway line crosses the Danube Hills at Gotteszell, but needs the 569-metre-long Hochbühl Tunnel to do so. == Literature == *Ulrich Pietrusky, Donatus Moosauer: Der Bayerische Wald – im Fluge neu entdeckt, Verlag Morsak, Grafenau, 1985, . == References  External links == * Der Vordere Bayerische Wald laut Landschaftssteckbrief des Bundesamtes für Naturschutz Category:Bavarian Forest Category:Regions of Bavaria Category:Natural regions of the Upper Palatine-Bavarian Forest ","title":"Danube Hills"},{"id":"56813731","text":"The 2018 Tour de Romandie was a road cycling stage race that took place between 24 and 29 April 2018 in Romandie, Switzerland.

German retribution against Poles who helped Jews were repressive measures taken by the German occupation authorities against non-Jewish Polish citizens who helped Jews persecuted by Nazi Germany during the Holocaust in Poland, 1939 to 1945. The orders of the occupation authorities, and in particular the ordinance of the general governor Hans Frank of October 15, 1941, provided for the death penalty for every Pole who would provide shelter for a Jew or help him in any other way. In practice, the range of penalties applied to those helping Jews was wide, including fines, confiscation of property, beatings, imprisonment, deportation to Nazi concentration camps and the death penalty. Due to the principle of collective responsibility applied by the Germans, families of those who helped Jews and sometimes entire local communities were subjects to retribution. The exact number of Poles executed by the Germans for helping Jews has not yet been precisely determined. The most cautious estimates give the number of around a few hundred people executed, and the high-end estimates, several thousand. == German anti-Jewish policy in occupied Poland == In the first years of the Second World War, German policy in relation to the \\"Jewish question\\" in occupied Poland was not coherent and consistent. Nevertheless, its fundamental aim was to isolate Jews, loot their property, exploit them through forced labour and, in the final stage, remove them completely from the land under the authority of the Third Reich. An initial plan for dealing with the Jewish population in Poland was adopted already on September 21, 1939, i. e. before the end of the September campaign. On that day, a meeting was held in Berlin led by SS-Gruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich, attended by the chief heads of the main departments of the General Security Police Office and commander of Einsatzgruppen operating in Poland. It was then established that all Jews living in the lands, which were to be incorporated into the Reich, would be resettled in central Poland. Mass deportations were to be preceded by removal of the Jewish population from rural areas and its concentration in larger urban centers. In the remaining occupied areas, it was also intended to forcibly resettle Jews to larger towns, especially to those located near railway lines. Moreover, during the meeting, a number of recommendations were adopted, including the creation of \\"Jewish Elder Councils\\", the establishment of a census of the Jewish population, as well as its marking and taking up forced labor. Jewish men marked with bands and Stars of David. Łódź, 1940 Ordinance of the German President of Warsaw of December 18, 1939 ordering Jews to register their property. Construction of walls around the Jewish quarter in Warsaw, 1940 The need to isolate Jews from the rest of the inhabitants of occupied Poland was emphasized by the Memorial on the treatment of people in former Polish territories from a racial and political point of view, drawn up in November 1939 by the NSDAP Office of Racial Policy. Among other things, its authors wrote that \\"the task of the German administration will be to differentiate and win Poles and Jews against each other\\". Recommendations concerning the fuelling of antagonisms between Poles and Jews and other national minorities are also included in the Memorial on the legal position of German policy towards Poles from a national and political point of view, prepared in January 1940 for the Academy of German Law.The anonymous author of this memorial assumed that for economic and logistic reasons it would be impossible to fully isolate Jews from the Polish element. For this reason, he recommended the occupation authorities to create mixed settlement districts (Polish-Jewish, Polish-Ukrainian, etc.) in order to fuel antagonisms on the grounds of nationality. See Eisenbach 1961?, pp. 171–172. From the first days of the occupation, the Germans treated the Jewish population in the spirit of the racist Nuremberg laws. From September 1939, the occupying authorities at various levels issued orders ordering Jews to wear special bands or identification marks, as well as to mark their apartments and businesses. On the territory of the General Government, this policy was sanctioned by the ordinance of Governor General Hans Frank of 23 November 1939, which required all Jews over ten years of age to wear Star of David armbands. The marking of Jews was also introduced on the territories incorporated into the Reich, but this was usually done on the basis of secret instructions, since the relevant law was introduced in Germany only in the autumn of 1941. Moreover, in the first months of the occupation almost all towns of the General Government and the Warta Country introduced far-reaching restrictions on the freedom of movement of Jews. To this end, measures such as curfew, a ban on leaving the place of residence and a ban on using different means of transport were used. According to a decree by Hans Frank of 26 January 1940, Jews were prohibited from travelling by train. Over time, this ban has been extended to other means of transport. Strict criminal sanctions, up to and including capital punishment, were imposed on those who would violate these provisions. Germans also took actions aimed at the pauperization of Jews and their exclusion from the economic life of the occupied country. Industrial, trade and service enterprises owned by Jews were confiscated in large numbers. Extensive restrictions have also been introduced in the areas of handicraft production, small-scale trade, property management and money transfer. The legally sanctioned \\"aryanization\\" of Jewish property was accompanied by individual (\\"wild\\") looting. Contributions and special taxes were also imposed on Jews. Representatives of the Jewish intelligentsia were deprived of the right to pursue liberal professions and were dismissed from work in public institutions. The decree issued by Hans Frank on October 26, 1939 included forced labor for the Jewish population in the General Government. Two years later, forced labor for Jews was introduced in the territories incorporated into the Reich, however, only by sanctioning the state of matters that had existed there since the first months of the occupation. The next stage of the anti-Semitic policy of the occupier was ghettoisation of the Jewish population, officially justified by economic, sanitary or political reasons. As an excuse to isolate Jews in closed districts, among other things, Germans used the \\"Easter pogrom\\" of March 1940, arranged from German inspiration by Polish extreme nationalists. The first Jewish ghetto was established in October 1939 in Piotrków Trybunalski. Over the next few months several more ghettos were created in the General Government and Warta Country, including the ghetto in Łódź (February 1940). Beginning in September 1940, the ghettoisation process became more organized. In October of this same year, it was decided to establish a \\"Jewish quarter in Warsaw\\". In March 1941 the ghettos in Kraków and Lublin were established. The process of ghettoisation in the Radom district of the General Government was rather at the latest in December 1941. After the outbreak of the German-Soviet War, the organizing of ghettos on Polish lands previously annexed by the USSR took place. The creation of closed Jewish communities was accompanied by a progressive reduction in the number of smaller ghettos. The concentration and isolation of the Jewish population was also to be served by an unrealized project of creating a great \\"reservation\\" for Jews in the Lublin region. The persecution of the Jewish population was accompanied by a large-scale anti- Semitic propaganda campaign aimed at the \\"Aryan\\" population – first of all at Poles.Barbara Polak. Biedni Polacy patrzą i ratują. Z Grzegorzem Berendtem, Markiem Wierzbickim i Janem Żarynem rozmawia Barbara Polak. „Biuletyn IPN”. 3 (98), 2009–03. Using the \\"gadzinowa\\" press, cinema or poster, the occupying forces tried to deepen anti-Semitic attitudes and stereotypes, which were already widespread in some parts of Polish society before the war. The German propaganda attempted, among other things, to blame Jews for the outbreak of the war and the occupational shortages, as well as to dehumanize them in the eyes of Polish society, e. g. through accusations of spreading infectious diseases (e. g. poster \\"Jews – lice – typhoid typhus\\"). After the beginning of the war with the USSR and the discovery of the Katyn graves, the slogan of \\"Judeo-Communism\\" was also intensively used. In many cases, anti-Semitic propaganda has found its way into fertile soil and influenced Poles' attitudes towards Jews, even after the \\"final solution\\" was initiated. After the invasion of the USSR started (June 22, 1941), the anti-Jewish policy of the invader was violently radicalised. East of the Ribbentrop-Molotov line, German Einsatzgruppen started its operations, which by the end of 1941 killed from 500 thousand to one million Polish and Soviet Jews. In December 1941, extermination of Jews from the Warta Country began in the extermination camp in Chełmno nad Nerem. By the summer of 1942, all the ghettos in that region had ceased to exist, except for Łódź ghetto. On the other hand, during the night of 16 to 17 March 1942, deportations of the inhabitants of the ghetto in Lublin began to the death camp in Bełżec. The closing of the Lublin Ghetto initiated the mass and systematic extermination of Polish Jews living in the areas of the General Government and Białystok district, which the Germans later baptized with the cryptonym \\"Aktion Reinhardt\\". Moreover, starting from mid-1942 the extermination camps created by the Germans on occupied Polish lands became a place of execution of Jews deported from other European countries. By November 1943, \\"Action Reinhardt\\" had claimed nearly 2 million victims. Although in the second half of the year the extermination camps organized for this operation were closed down, the mass extermination of Polish and European Jews was continued, mainly in the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp. In August 1944, the liquidation of the last ghetto in the occupied Polish lands – the Łódź Ghetto took place. As a consequence of the German policy of extermination on occupied Polish lands, the majority of about 5.5 million Holocaust victims, including at least 2.8 million Polish Jews, were murdered. == Retribution against Poles helping Jews  Criminal penalties for helping Jews === The bones of those murdered at the Treblinka extermination camp. Photograph taken in summer 1945. In 1941, the rapid spread of infectious diseases in overpopulated ghettos and the general radicalisation of German anti-Jewish policy resulted in tightening of the isolation restrictions imposed on Polish Jews. While the Second Restriction of Residence in the General Government on April 29, 1941 provided for prison sentences and fines for non-compliance with the \\"residence restrictions\\" regulations, since the middle of that year Jews captured outside the ghetto were usually executed on the spot – usually based on an alleged \\"attempt to escape\\". The third regulation on the restriction of residency in the General Government of October 15, 1941 provided for the death penalty for all Jews who \\"leave their designated district without authorisation\\", but its sentencing would be the responsibility of the German Special Courts. Finally, in November 1941, the German police authorities issued the so-called Schießbefehl order, which authorised police officers to shoot all Jews who were outside the ghetto (including women and children). After the start of \\"Aktion Reinhardt\\" the German gendarmerie supported by collaborative police forces systematically tracked, captured and murdered refugees from ghettos, transports and camps. This stage of the Holocaust, called Judenjagd by the Germans (the \\"hunt for Jews\\"), lasted until the last days of the occupation. SS-soldiers and policemen posing among the bodies of refugees hunted down in forests Historians estimate that in occupied Poland from 100 thousand to 300 thousand Jews attempted to hide \\"on the Aryan side\\". The Germans undertook a number of actions aimed at discouraging Poles from providing any kind of assistance to the Jews. In order to achieve this goal, the occupation authorities skillfully managed to administer rewards and penalties. On one hand, the \\"Aryan\\" population was encouraged to denounce and track Jews in return for money or other goods. In Warsaw, denunciators were rewarded with 500 zlotys and officers of the \\"blue police\\" were promised to receive 1/3 of his cash for capturing a Jew hiding \\"on the Aryan side\\". In the rural areas of the Warsaw district, a prize in the form of 1 metre of grain was awarded. The award for the denunciation could also include several kilograms of sugar, a litre of spirit, a small quantity of wood or food or clothes belonging to the victim. It is known that in the vicinity of Ostrołęka rewards for denunciators amounted to 3 kilograms of sugar, in Western Małopolska – 500 PLN and 1 kilogram of sugar, in Kraśnik County – from 2 to 5 kg of sugar, in Konin County – property of the victims and 0.5 kg of sugar, in the vicinity of Sandomierz – litre of spirit and 0.5 kg of sugar, in Volhynia – three litres of vodka. These techniques did not go without results. In the Polish society there were individuals who, motivated by profit or anti-Semitism, were actively pursuing and then handing over, robbing or blackmailing Jews who were hiding. In Warsaw, the number of \\"szmalcownik people\\", blackmailers and denunciators, often associated in well-organized gangs, was calculated at 3-4 thousand. In rural areas there were gangs - usually made up of criminals, members of the social margin and declared anti-Semites \\\\- who tracked the fugitives and then gave them away to Germans or robbed them on their own, often committing murders and rape. Announcement on the \\"resettlement\\" of Jews from Bochnia informing Poles about the death penalty for helping Jews. The Germans used Polish Blue Police officers to participate in roundups and Judenjagd (search operations). Some police officers attended to these duties zealously, including participating directly in the murder of Jewish escapees. Polish foresters, members of voluntary fire brigades and members of rural guards also took part in the activities. Moreover, Polish village heads, mayors and civil servants were obliged to enforce German regulations concerning the capture of Jews and preventing them from receiving aid. At the same time, the occupation authorities imposed draconian penalties for hiding Jews or providing them with any assistance. According to Sebastian Piątkowski and Jacek A. Młynarczyk, \\"a milestone on the road to complete isolation of the Jewish community from the rest of the conquered population\\" was signing by Hans Frank of the aforementioned Third Ordinance on Restrictions on residence in the General Government (October 15, 1941). This was the first legal act providing for the death penalty for Poles who \\"knowingly give shelter\\" to Jews residing outside the ghetto without permission. This document also announced that \\"instigators and helpers are subject to the same punishment as the offender, the attempted act will be punished as a committed act\\", but stated that in lighter cases a prison sentence may be imposed. The aim of the regulation was clear – discourage Jews from seeking rescue outside the ghetto and discourage Polish people from helping them. Soon afterward, orders with similar content were issued in all districts of the General Government, signed by local governors or SS and police leaders. In many cases, similar orders and announcements were also published by the lower administrative authorities. The announcement issued on November 10, 1941 by the governor of the Warsaw district, Dr Ludwig Fischer, was even more restrictive than Frank's regulation, as it provided for the death penalty to every Pole who \\"consciously grants shelter or otherwise helps the hiding Jews by providing accommodation (e. g. overnight accommodation, subsistence, by taking them to vehicles of all kinds\\". Announcement of September 5, 1942 by the SS Commander and the Police in Warsaw District, threatening capital punishment for supporting Jewish escapees After the launch of \\"Aktion Reinhardt\\" Jews escaped from the liquidated ghettos or from transports to death camps. This led the German authorities to issue another series of orders reminding the Polish population of the death penalty for trying to help Jewish refugees.In most cases, the Third Order limiting residence in the General Government of 15 October 1941 was cited as the legal basis for these provisions; see Bartoszewski i Lewinówna 2007?, pp. 652–654. In this context, one can mention, among others, the announcement of SS Commander and Police Commander of the Warsaw district SS-Oberführer Ferdinand von Sammern-Frankenegg of 5 September 1942 and the announcement of the district chief administrative officer of Przemyśl County Dr Heinischa of July 27, 1942, police decree of the Starosta of Sanok County, Dr Class of 14 September 1942, announcement of the City Starosta in Częstochowa E. Franke of September 24, 1942, order of the Starosta of the Kraśnik County of October 23, 1942, and the announcement of the Starosta of the Dębica County Schlüter of November 19, 1942. On September 21, 1942, SS-Standartenführer Herbert Böttcher, SS and Police Leader of the Radom district, issued a circular to the local administrative and police authorities, which contained the following provisions: Announcement of the occupation authorities of Częstochowa on September 24, 1942 reminding of the death penalty for those who help Jews. On October 28, 1942, the Supreme Commander of SS and the Police in the General Government SS-Obergruppenführer Friedrich Wilhelm Krüger (HSSPF \\"Ost\\") issued a regulation on the creation of so-called remnant ghettos in selected cities of Lublin and Warsaw districts. On November 10, 1942, a similar decree was issued for the districts of Kraków, Radom and Galicia. In § 3 of these regulations, the threat of the death penalty is repeated for people providing shelter or food to Jews who hide outside the designated housing districts. At the same time, unspecified police sanctions (sicherheitspolizeiliche Maßnahmen) were announced against people who do not inform the occupation authorities about the known fact of Jewish presence outside the ghetto (in practice, this meant deportation to a concentration camp). At the end of 1942, a similar decree for the Białystok district was announced by gauleiter of East Prussia Erich Koch. Strict penalties for helping Jews were also imposed in the Warta Country. === Enforcement of German ordinances === According to the provisions of the Third Ordinance on Restrictions on Residence in the General Government and lower- ranking acts, the death penalty was aimed at both Poles who provided shelter to Jews,On July 18, 1943, the head of the Chief Justice Department of the \\"Government\\" of the General Government, Kurt Wille, issued a circular addressed to the \\"District Justice Offices\\", in which he noted that in the event \\"when it is not possible to state, whether a Jew has left the district designated to him in an unauthorised manner, and it is merely stated that he has not been allowed to enter the district outside his housing district\\" there is no direct legal basis for punishing the person who gave shelter to such a Jew. However, he ordered that when dealing with cases of aid to Jews, one should also take into account in such cases \\"the basic idea contained in § 4b, point 1, sentence 2, of combating the political, criminal and health dangers emanating from Jews\\". In particular, he recommended that the death penalty be imposed on Poles assisting those Jews who did not comply with the order to settle in ghettos from the very beginning. See Datner 1968?, p. 18. as well as those who offered money, food, water, or clothing to escapees, provided medical assistance, provided transport or transferred correspondence prepared by the Jew. The highest penalties were imposed on people who helped Jews for altruistic reasons, as well as those who helped Jews for compensation or who were involved in commercial transactions with them. As a result of the invader's principle of collective responsibility, the families of carers and sometimes even entire local communities were threatened with retribution. Moreover, in the occupied Polish lands, the Germans created a system of blackmail and dependence system, obliging Poles, under the threat of the most severe punishments, to report every case of hiding Jewish fugitives to the occupation authorities. In particular, Poles holding positions at the lowest levels of administration (village heads, commune heads, officials). Announcement of November 16, 1942 on the creation of six remnant ghettos in the Warsaw district, reminding of the punishments for helping Jews and for not reporting the fact that such aid has been provided. In practice, the regulations prohibiting aid to Jewish refugees have not always been enforced with the same severity. The “2014 Record of the facts of repression against Polish citizens for the help of the Jewish population during World War II” indicates that those accused of supporting Jews were also punished with punishments such as beatings, imprisonment, exile for forced labor, deportation to a concentration camp, confiscation of property, or fines.Aleksandra Namysło, Grzegorz Berendt (red.): Rejestr faktów represji na obywatelach polskich za pomoc ludności żydowskiej w okresie II wojny światowej. Warszawa: Instytut Pamięci Narodowej i Instytut Studiów Strategicznych, 2014. . Sebastian Piątkowski, relying on preserved documents of the special court in Radom, pointed out that especially in the case of small and disposable forms of assistance – such as providing food, clothing or money to the escapees, indicating the way, accepting correspondence – the punishment could be limited to imprisonment or exile to a concentration camp.Sebastian Piątkowski. Za pomoc Żydom osadzeni w więzieniu radomskim. „Biuletyn IPN”. 3 (98), 2009–03. However, there are also numerous cases where the detection of the fugitive resulted in the execution of the whole Polish family, who took him under their roof, and the robbery and burning of her belongings. The Frank's decree of October 15, 1941 stipulated that cases concerning the cases of aid to Jewish refugees would be dealt with by German special courts. Until 2014, historians were able to identify 73 Polish citizens, against whom special courts of the General Government conducted cases in this respect. Many times, however, the Germans refused to carry out even simplified court proceedings, and the Jews captured together with their Polish caregivers were murdered on the spot or at the nearest police station or military police station. Such a course of action was sanctioned, among other things, by a secret order of the SS Commander and the Police for the Radom district, ordering the extermination of captured Jews and their Polish caregivers on the spot, as well as the burning of buildings where Jews were hidden. At the same time, the Germans took care to give proper publicity to their retribution, so as to intimidate the Polish population and discourage it from providing any aid to Jews. For this purpose, the victims' burials were prohibited in cemeteries, instead, they were buried on the scene of the crime, on nearby fields or in road trenches. An announcement by the SS Commander and Police Head of the Kraków District announcing that 73 Poles were sentenced to death, including four who were accused of helping Jews. 1944 Historians point out that Polish blackmailers and denunciators posed a very serious threat to people helping Jews, and in the Eastern Borderlands – additionally collaborators and confidants of Ukrainian, Belarusian or Lithuanian origin. Barbara Engelking emphasizes that due to the relatively weak saturation of rural areas with German police and gendarmerie units, a large part of the cases of exposing Poles hiding Jews had to be the result of reports submitted by their Polish neighbours. Dariusz Libionka reached similar conclusions. However, the actual scale of denunciation has still not been thoroughly investigated. There were also cases when the captured Jews – under the influence of torture or false promises to save their lives – gave out aiding Poles to the German authorities. Jewish people were also among the informants of German police. === Number of Poles murdered === The number of Poles murdered by the Germans for helping Jews has not yet been precisely determined. One of the reasons may be that people helping Jewish refugees were often murdered with whole families and hidden Jews. Moreover, in the times of the People's Republic of Poland, no in-depth research was conducted into the problem of Polish aid to Jews. The first major publications on this subject appeared only in the 1960s. According to Grzegorz Berendt, the communist authorities did not, for various reasons, care about comprehensive examination of the phenomenon of aid or, more broadly, about Polish-Jewish relations during the Second World War. The official historiography focused rather on the search for positive behavioural examples, which could then be used for propaganda on internal and international level. The remains of Michał Kruk and Alexander Hirschberg, supported by him, hung in public view on the streets of Przemyśl, September 1943. Szymon Datner, the director of the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw, made the first to attempt to compile a list of Poles murdered for helping Jews.Wacław Bielawski: Zbrodnie na Polakach dokonane przez hitlerowców za pomoc udzielaną Żydom. Warszawa: GKBZH-IPN, 1987. In 1968 he published a brochure \\"Forest of the Righteous. A charter from the history of rescuing Jews in occupied Poland\\", in which he presented 105 documented cases of crimes committed by Germans against Poles who saved Jews. Datner established that 343 Poles were murdered because of the help given to Jews, and in 242 cases the victim's name was established. Among the identified victims were 64 women and 42 children.Datner also established that 248 Jews and four Soviet escapees were murdered together with 343 Poles. See Datner 1968?, p. 115. Datner's estimates also showed that as much as 80% of executions took place in rural areas. About 65% of the victims were executed and another 5% were murdered by burning alive. The largest number of documented crimes took place respectively in Kraków Voivodeship, Rzeszów Voivodship, Warsaw Voivodeship, Warsaw, and Lublin Voivodeship. In addition, the largest number of victims died in the following voivodships: Kraków, Rzeszów, Lublin, Kielce and Warsaw. Datner also stated that these estimates were preliminary and incomplete, covering only cases examined up to April 1968. On behalf of the Main Commission for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes, Wacław Bielawski was investigating cases of crimes committed by Germans due to aiding Jews. The archive of the Institute of National Remembrance in Warsaw contains a separate set of over 2,000 folders containing his materials. Based on the findings of the investigation, Bielawski developed a brochure entitled \\"The crimes committed on Poles by the Nazis for their help to Jews\\", which in the second edition of 1987 contained the names of 872 murdered people and information about nearly 1400 anonymous victims. In subsequent years this list was verified by the employees of the Main Commission for the Investigation of Crimes against the Polish Nation, which resulted in its partial reduction. The third edition of the publication entitled “Those Who Helped: Polish Rescuers of Jews During the Holocaust” (Warsaw, 1997) included the names of 704 Poles murdered for helping Jews.The list includes both Poles murdered by the Germans and a few cases in which people hiding Jews were murdered by Ukrainian nationalists or common bandits. See Walczak et al. 1997 ↓, s. 52,61,96. The findings of the Commission's employees showed that 242 inhabitants of the Kraków District, 175 inhabitants of the Radom District, 141 inhabitants of the Warsaw District and 66 inhabitants of the Lublin District were among the victims. The number of 704 murdered did not include Poles murdered in villages, which were to be destroyed by the Germans due to support for Jews. In 2014, INR historians estimated that Bielawski's brochure and the preparation of Those Who Helped.... are \\"archaic\\", but they remain \\"still representative of the topic discussed\\". On the basis of data collected until 2000, the Yad Vashem Institute identified over 100 Poles murdered due to the fact that they helped Jews. However, Israel Gutman estimated that the actual number of victims was \\"certainly expressed in hundreds\\". In 2005, the community gathered around the foundation Institute for Strategic Studies initiated a research project entitled \\"Index of Poles murdered and repressed for helping Jews during World War II\\". The Institute of National Remembrance, as well as the Head Directorate of State Archives, the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, the Yad Vashem Institute, the German Historical Institute in Warsaw and the Jewish Historical Institute were invited to cooperate in the project. Researchers involved in the project conducted research in Polish and foreign archives (including church archives), as well as in museums, research institutions, press and Polish and foreign-language literature. As a result of these works, the Institute of National Remembrance and ISS Foundation published the \\"Facts of repression against Polish citizens for their help during World War II\\" (Warsaw 2014). It lists the names of 508 Polish citizens (both ethnic Poles and representatives of national minorities) who were repressed for helping Jews. According to the findings of the Registry it is clear that 221 of the 508 victims were executed or died in prisons and concentration camps. A further thirteen have been sentenced to death, but there is no information on the execution of the sentence. Moreover, it was not possible to establish the fate of several dozen people who were sent to concentration camps or imprisoned in detention centers and prisons. The Register is open and the information contained therein will be verified and supplemented. Furthermore, the first edition of it describes mainly those cases of retribution, the circumstances of which were usually not described in more detail before. For this reason, the list of 508 repressed people does not include the victims of some known crimes committed against Poles who helped Jews (including the Ulma family from Markowa, the families of Kowalski, Kosiors, Obuchiewiczs and Skoczylas from Stary Ciepiełów and Rekówka, the guardians of Bunker \\"Krysia\\" in Warsaw, Henryk Sławik). Other attempts were also made to establish the number of Poles murdered by the Germans for helping Jews. The Polish Association of Former Political Prisoners estimated the number of victims at ca. 2500. Wacław Zajączkowski in his work entitled \\"Martyrs of Charity\\" (edited by the Maximilian Kolbe Foundation, Washington 1988) mentioned the names of 2300 Poles who were to be executed for helping Jews.In 2011, the Institute of National Remembrance indicated that Wacław Zajączkowski's book \\"has no scientific character and contains numerous errors\\". However, the Institute said that \\"the number of Poles being persecuted for helping Jews may turn out to be a short way from the truth\\". See Korboński 2011?, p. 69. Anna Poray-Wybranowska in her work entitled \\"Those Who Risked Their Lives\\" (Chicago, April 2008) included surnames of over 5 thousand victims.Anna Zechenter. Jedenaste: przyjmij bliźniego pod swój dach. „Biuletyn IPN”. 3 (98), 2009–03. === Examples of retribution === Józef and Wiktoria Ulma – murdered together with six children for hiding Jews The fate of the Ulma family from Markowa near Łańcut became the symbol of martyrdom of Poles murdered for helping Jews. In the second half of 1942 Józef Ulma received eight Jews from the Goldmans/Szall, Grünfeld and Didner families. A year and a half later, the Ulmas were denounced by Włodzimierz Leś, a \\"blue policeman\\" who took possession of the Szall family's property and intended to get rid of its rightful owners. On March 24, 1944, German gendarmes from Łańcut came to Markowa. They shot Józef Ulma, his wife Wiktoria (which was in an advanced pregnancy) and six children, the oldest of whom was eight years old and the youngest one and a half years old. Together with the Ulmas, all the Jews in hiding, including two women and a child, died. In the winter of 1942 and 1943, the German Gendarmerie carried out a large-scale repressive action in the region of Ciepiełów, aimed at intimidating the Polish population and discouraging it from helping Jews. On December 6, 1942, 31 Poles were shot or burnt alive in the villages of Stary Ciepielów and Rekówka, mostly from the families of Kowalski, Kosior, Obuchiewicz and Skoczylas. There were also two Jewish escapees killed. Twenty children under the age of 18 were murdered. The youngest victim of the massacre was 7 months old, the oldest one was about 70 years old. Two days later, gendarmes murdered Marianna Skwira, who was involved with her husband in the campaign to help Jewish refugees. A distinctive culmination of the action was the murder carried out around January 11, 1943 in the village of Zajączków. The widow Stanisława Wołowiec, her four daughters aged from 6 months to 12 years, her brother-in-law Józef Jelonek and the farmstead Franciszek Zaborski were murdered there. The crimes were committed in retaliation for helping the Jewish refugees by the Wołowiec family. A series of executions against residents of the village near Ciepielów was one of the greatest crimes committed by Germans on Poles who helped Jews. At least six repressive actions targeted at Poles helping Jews were carried out by gendarmes from neighbouring Lipsko during the same period. On December 14, 1942, Franciszek Osojca, his wife Aniela and their two-year-old son Zdzisław, were murdered in the village Okół. In December 1942 and January 1943, the Lipsko Gendarmerie carried out three repressive actions in the colony of Boiska near Solec nad Wisłą, during which they murdered 10 people from the families of Kryczek, Krawczyk and Boryczyk and two Jews hidden in the grove of Franciszek Parol (wife of the latter was imprisoned in Radom). The large-scale repressive action against Poles supporting Jews was also carried out in the vicinity of the Paulinów village in the Sokolowski County. The immediate cause of the repressive action was the activity of a provocateur's agent, who pretending to escape from the transport to Treblinka camp, gained information about the inhabitants of the village who helped Jews. On February 24, 1943, the Paulinów village was surrounded by a strong penal expedition from Ostrów Mazowiecka. As a result of the pacification 11 local Poles were murdered. Three of the refugees who benefited from their assistance were also killed. The repressive action against Poles supporting Jews was also carried out in Pantalowice in Przeworsk County. On December 4, 1942, a group of gendarmes and Gestapo members from Łańcut came to the village with a young Jewish girl, who was promised to save her life in exchange for naming Poles helping Jewish refugees. Six people identified by the girl were shot in the courtyard of one of the farms. In the house of Władysław Dec, who was murdered, the gendarmes found a picture of his three brothers, who were also identified by the Jewish woman as being food-suppliers. As a result, that same night the Germans went to the nearby village of Hadle Szklarskie, where they arrested and shot Stanisław, Tadeusz and Bronisław Dec. In retaliation for supporting the Jewish escapees, the village of Przewrotne was pacified, or rather its neighborhood of Studzieniec. On December 1, 1942, a unit of the German gendarmerie arrived there, which surrounded the buildings and nearby forest. The Zeller family, hiding in Studziec, fell into the German hands. Four of its members were killed on the spot, and the temporarily spared Metla Zeller was tortured to give up her help. Despite the torture, the woman did not point anyone out. Therefore, she and six Polish men from the families of Dziubek, Drąg, Pomykała and Żak were shot. Moreover, the following people died for helping Jews: * The Baranek family – on March 15, 1943 in Wincenty Baranek's farmhouse in the village of Siedliska near Miechów German policemen showed up, who found four Jewish men in a hiding-place between the house and the farm buildings. The escapees were shot on the spot, and soon afterwards Wincenty Baranek, his wife Łucja and their two underage sons (9-year-old Tadeusz and 13-year-old Henryk) were murdered. The execution was avoided by the stepmother of Wincenty Baranek, Katarzyna Baranek née Kopacz, who on the next day, however, was handed over to the Germans and shot in Miechów. * Anna and Wincenty Buzowicz – the Buzowicz couple helped the Jews Sala Rubinowicz and Else Szwarcman in their escape from the ghetto in Kozienice, and then gave them shelter. Their cousin or friend Maria Różańska was supposed to give an identity card to a Jewish fugitive. All three of them were arrested and sentenced to death by a sentence of the Special Court in Radom on 3 April 1943. The Buzowicz family were executed, there was lack of information about the fate of Różańska. * Karol and Tekla Chowaniakowie, Piotr and Regina Wiecheć, Karolina Marek – the families hid the Jewish couple in their farms in Zawoja for many months. The information on this matter reached the Germans after the refugees had moved to another place. In May 1943, the Gestapo arrested Karol Chowaniak, his son Stanisław, and Karolina Marek, who worked in their house. A month later, Tekla Chowaniak was arrested and in October 1943 Piotr and Regina Wiecheć were arrested. The Wiecheć couple were murdered at the Gestapo headquarters in Maków Podhalański, while the Chowaniak couple and Karolina Marek were murdered in the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. The son of the Chowaniak family was deported to forced labour in the Reich. * Apolonia and Stanisław Gacoń – a couple from Januszkowice, hid a ten-year-old Jewish girl in their house in the Jasielsk County, they did not turn her down even though they were warned that this fact had become known to the Germans. On May 28, 1943, a group of Gestapo members from Jasło came to the house of the Gacoń, and shot the two spouses and the Jewish girl. * Katarzyna and Michał Gerula, Roman Segielin – the Gerula family from Łodzinka Górna had been hiding seven Jews on their farm for several months, who were brought by Roman Segielin, their acquaintance. On 1 January 1944, officers of the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police arrested Michał Gerula and Roman Segielin, and two days later also Katarzyna Gerula. Three Poles were soon executed. Three Jews found in the Gerula farm were shot on the spot by Ukrainian police officers. * Marianna and Mieczysław Holtzer – owners of the land property of the Celestynów in the Tomaszów Lubelski County. On October 2, 1942, they were shot dead by German gendarmes, as they defended the Jews who worked in their property. * Helena, Krzysztof and Genowefa Janus, Zofia and Mieczysław Madej – about 6 or 7 Jews were hiding in the Dzwonowice lodge belonging to the Janus family near Biskupice near Pilica. Notified by a denunciation, the Germans appeared there on January 12, 1943. 3 members of the Janus family (woman and two children) were killed, Mieczysław Madej and his wife Zofia née Janus, as well as several hidden Jews. Among the caregivers, only Stanisław Janus and his son Bronisław, who lived outside the house at that time, survived. * Katarzyna and Sebastian Kazak – the Kazak family from Brzóza Królewska, have repeatedly granted temporary shelter to Jewish refugees. On March 23, 1943, German gendarmes appeared on the Kazak farm with the assistance of \\"blue policemen\\". They found three Jews who were shot on the spot. The spouses Sebastian and Katarzyna Kazak were also murdered. Only two daughters of Kazaks avoided the deaths. * Maria and Zygmunt Kmiecicik, Adam Czajka – in the summer of 1942 the Czajka family from Libusza accepted a Jewish man under their roof for some time. Less than one and a half years later, he fell into the hands of the Germans and revealed the identity of his guardians during the interrogation. In March 1944, the German police arrested Stanisław and Adam Czajka, as well as Zygmunt Kmiecik and his wife Maria née Czajka. Stanisław was released after some time, but his brother and sister were murdered in Montelupi prison in Kraków. Zygmunt Kmiecik was sent to a concentration camp where he probably died. * Franciszka and Stanisław Kurpiel – the Kurpiel family lived in Leoncina, near Krasiczyn, where Stanisław was a warden. At the turn of 1942/43, the Kurpiel family hid 24 escapees from the Przemyśl ghetto in the farm buildings. As a result of the denunciation on May 21, 1944, officers of the Ukrainian Auxiiary Police arrived in Leoncin, arrested the Kurpiel family, their three daughters and four members of the Kochanowicz family, who also lived in the farm. 24 Jews captured were shot on the spot. Kochanowicz and Kurpiel's daughters were released after some time, but Stanisław and Franciszek were shot after a hard investigation. * Władysław Łodej and his family – the Łodej family lived in the village of Lubienia, near Iłża. Władysław helped nearly 40 Jews to escape from the Iłża ghetto and then supplied them with food and supported them in other ways. In mid-December 1942, the Germans arrived in Lubenia for his arrest. They did not find him in his home, but murdered his parents Wojciech and Marianna Łodej. They also detained Wiktoria, the wife of the one wanted, and their four children, the oldest of whom were fourteen years old and the youngest six. All five were executed on 21 December in the forest inspectorate of Marcule. Władysław Łodej survived his loved ones for ten days. On December 31, 1942, he was arrested and murdered by a \\"blue policeman\\". * Ludomir Marczak and Jadwiga Sałek-Deneko – Marczak, composer and socialist activist, was involved in underground activities during the occupation. Together with his wife Marianna Bartułd, was hiding escapees from the Warsaw ghetto in an apartment on Pańska Street and in the shelter on Świętojarska Street. On November 25, 1943, notified Germans sized the second hiding place mentioned above, where they arrested Marczak, his co-worker Jadwiga Sałek-Deneko ps. \\"Kasia\\" and thirteen Jews. After a heavy investigation, Marczak was executed, \\"Kasia\\" and captured escapees were also executed. * The Olszewski family – in the autumn of 1942, the Olszewski family from Skórnice near Końskie received ten Jews from the Wajntraub family under their roof. On 16 April 1943, probably due to denunciation, Germans arrived on the farm. Eight Jews hiding in the dugout were slaughtered with grenades. Janina Olszewska, her four children aged between one and eight years (Krystina, Jan, Bogdan, Zofia), as well as Maria Olszewska and her eleven-year-old son Marian, were shot. Henryk Olszewski (husband of Janina) and Leon Olszewski were deported to concentration camps, where they died. Only those who survived from the Olszewski family were Władysław and Wojciech Olszewski (stepson and son of Maria) as they were not in the house. * Helena and Jan Prześlak – teachers and social activists from Jaworzno, who in July 1942 helped a dozen or so escapees from the local ghetto to hide in the school in the Jaworzno's district of Stara Huta. On the night of 12/13 July 1942, most likely due to denunciation, the couple were arrested by the Gestapo. After a short stay in the prison in Mysłowice, they were sent to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, where they died in September 1942. * Zofia and Wojciech Puła from Małec helped the Jewish refugees. On November 8, 1942, together with their son Władysław and daughters Janina and Izabela, they were arrested by the Germans. All five were imprisoned in the prison in Brzesko, and then transferred to the Montelupi prison in Kraków, after which they were deported to the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp. Only Władysłąw Puła survived. * Franciszek Paweł Raszeja – orthopaedic doctor, professor of medical sciences, head of the surgical department of Warsaw's Polish Red Cross Hospital. He went to the Warsaw Ghetto many times for consultations. On July 21, 1942, he was murdered by the Germans in his apartment at Chłodna Street, where he helped a Jewish patient[186]. Kazimierz Pollak and Jews who were in the apartment were probably killed with him. * The family of Rębiś, Feliks Gawryś and Zofia Miela – the family of Rębiś from the village of Połomia in the Dębica County took at least ten Jews under their roof in 1942. Moreover, the Rębiś family helped to prepare a hiding place for the Jewish Buchner family in the neighbouring farm belonging to Zofia Miela. On September 9, 1943, Germans appeared in the village with the assistance of \\"blue policemen\\". They murdered Anna and Józef Rębiś, their daughters Zofia and Victoria, son Karol, as well as Feliks Gawryś (a fiancée of Victoria), who lived in their house. Hidden Jews were also murdered (only one survived). Five days later the Germans returned to Połomia and murdered Zofia Miela. * Maria Rogozińska and her three-year-old son Piotr – in the Rogoziński farmstead in Wierbka village in Olkusz County (present Zawiercie County) Jews and members of the underground were hidden. Around January 11, 1943, German gendarmes appeared there, and shot two hiding Jews on the spot, as well as two Polish men.One of the murdered Poles was Piotr Podgórski. He was to be shot dead because he did not inform the German authorities about the hiding of Jews in Wierbce, although as a village guard he was obliged to do so. See Namysło 2009?, pp. 126 and 128. On the same day Marianna Rogozińska and her three- year-old son Peter fell into the hands of the Germans. Both of them were taken to the German Gendarmerie headquarters in Pilica Castle, where they were murdered after a brutal interrogation. * Adam Sztark – a Jesuit priest serving in Słonim. During the occupation, he called to help the Jews from the pulpit, collected money and valuables for them, organized \\"Aryan\\" documents, and helped hide and save an orphaned Jewish child. He was executed by the Germans in December 1942. * Mieczysław Wolski and Janusz Wysocki – caretakers of the so-called \\"Krysia\\" bunker in Warsaw's Ochota district, where in 1942–1944 about 40 Jews were hiding, including the historian Emanuel Ringelblum with his wife and son. On March 7, 1944 the hiding place was discovered by the Gestapo, and Mieczysław and Janusz together with those under their care were arrested. A few days later, all of them were shot in the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto. Some authors consider helping Jews as the reason of pacification of such villagesIn a few cases, in addition to the aid given to Jews, assistance provided to the Soviet escapees and partisans was considered to be a cause of pacification. See Fajkowski and Religa 1981?, pp. 57–60, 322. as: Bór Kunowski (3/4 July 1943, 43 victims), Cisie (28 June 1943, 25 victims), Krobonosz (26 May 1942, 15 victims), Liszno (18 May 1942, 60 victims, Obórki (November 1942, at least several dozen victims), Parypse (22 May 1942, 8 victims), Przewrotne (14 March 1943, 36 victims), Staw (26 May 1942, 8 victims), Tarnów (May 1942, 40 victims), Widły (26 May 1942, several dozen victims), Wola PrzybysławskaDariusz Libionka pointed out that the investigation into the pacification of Wola Przybyrosławska by the District Commission for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes in Lublin did not confirm the thesis that the cause of the crime was aid provided by the villagers to Jews. Of the thirteen witnesses questioned, only two connected the death of three of the nineteen victims with the aid given to Jews. See Libionka 2004?, pp. 323–324. (10 December 1942, 19 victims).Józef Fajkowski, Jan Religa: Zbrodnie hitlerowskie na wsi polskiej 1939–1945. Warszawa: Książka i Wiedza, 1981. == Repercussions == Analysing the impact of the German acts of retribution on the attitude of Poles towards Jewish refugees, one should take into account the fact that decisions on the possible granting of aid were taken in a situation where significant parts of the Polish nation were exterminated, and the entire ethnic Polish population remained under threat of Nazi terror. The first months of the German governments have already made Polish society aware that even minor violations of the occupation order will be punished with absolute and cruel punishment. In addition, the Germans deliberately tried to publicise the retribution meted on people supporting Jews, thus intimidating Polish society and discouraging them from taking any support measures.In the Nazi reality, information about the crimes perpetrated by the Germans on people helping Jews was often exaggerated, which had an even greater impact on social sentiments. For example, rumours were circulating in Warsaw about the alleged burning of whole tenement houses, where Jewish escapees were found. See Ringelblum 1988?, p. 116. Many historians believe that the fear of German retribution was one of the most important factors discouraging Poles from helping Jewish refugees (other important factors are: significant number of Jewish minority and its low assimilation rate, anti-Semitism, war poverty and demoralisation). Some historians have come to the conclusion that the main motivation of those helping Jews was the desire for profit, Jan Tomasz Gross came to the conclusion that hiding the fugitives could not be a particularly risky occupation, because in his opinion few people would endanger their own lives and those of their loved ones only for the sake of income. Gunnar S. Paulsson compared the minimum number of Poles involved in rescuing Jews (160,000) with the number of about 700 people reported killed by GKBZpNP-IPN, and concluded that the probability of death for this reason was between 1 and 230. Taking into account the remaining threats to which Poles under German occupation were exposed, he decided that helping Jews in practice was only to some extent more risky than other offences against the occupation order. In his assessment: Other historians have estimated however that the percentage of Poles acting solely on financial grounds was only from several to twenty percent. Marcin Urynowicz points out that German terror was very effectively intimidating wide circles of Polish society, hence the real threats faced by the person to whom assistance was requested did not have a direct connection with the level of fear she felt. In conclusion, he states: Barbara Engelking points out that the fear of German repression grew, especially when there were cases of executions of Poles suspected of supporting Jewish refugees in a certain area. Such events often had a major impact on the situation of Jews in hiding. There are known cases where the demonstrative repressive actions carried out by the Germans, and even the threat of severe punishments themselves, have reached the goal of intimidating the local population and significantly reducing aid to Jews.Przemysław Kucharczak. Życie za Żyda. „Gość Niedzielny”. 49 (2007), 2007-12-09. In some cases, the fear of denunciation and severe penalties resulted in the expulsion of fugitives into the hands of Germans. It also happened that Poles who, for various reasons, could not or did not want to hide Jewish fugitives, preferred to murder them instead of allowing them to seek refuge elsewhere. According to one of the Jewish survivors the story of the massacre of the Ulma family made such a shocking impression on the local population that the bodies of 24 Jews were later found in the Markowa area, where Polish caregivers murdered them because of fear of denunciation. However, according to the historian Mateusz Szpytma, this crime took place in the neighbouring Sietsza village – in addition, most probably two years before the Ulmas' death.Mateusz Szpytma. Sprawiedliwi i inni. „Więź”. 10 (2011), 2011–10. === Numbers of those who helped and survivors === Marek Arczyński believed that \\"in the conditions of the Nazi occupation terror, unprecedented elsewhere, saving Jews in Poland grew to an act of special sacrifice and heroism\\". However, in Polish society there were people willing to take such a risk. Gunnar S. Paulsson estimated that there were 280,000 to 360,000 Poles involved in various forms of aid to Jews, of which about 70–90,000 in Warsaw alone. Teresa Prekerowa estimated the number of helpers at 160–360 thousand, Marcin Urynowicz at 300 thousand, and Władysław Bartoszewski at \\"at least several hundred thousand\\". According to Jan Żaryn, the number of Poles participating directly or indirectly in the rescue of Jews could reach even one million, and according to Richard Lukas – at least from 800,000 to 1.2 million. It is difficult to determine the number of Jews who survived the German occupation, hiding among Poles. Shmuel Krakowski claimed that not more than 20 thousand people survived on the Aryan side. Israel Gutman estimated that about 50 thousand Jews survived in the occupied territory of Poland, of which between 30 thousand and 35 thousand survived thanks to the help of Poles. According to estimates by Teresa Prekerowa, between 30 thousand and 60 thousand Jews survived by hiding among the Polish population (\\"with or without their help\\").Prekerowa estimated that 380 thousand to 500 thousand Polish Jews survived the war. In addition to those who survived while hiding among Poles, she included the number of Jews who found themselves in the unoccupied territory of the USSR (over 200 thousand), they survived the war, protecting themselves in forest \\"survival camps\\" or in the ranks of partisans (from 10 thousand). They managed to survive in German concentration camps (from 20,000 to 40,000) and they also served in the ranks of the Polish Armed Forces in the West and fled to other countries. See Prekerowa 1993?, p. 384. Grzegorz Berendt estimated that in occupied Poland about 50 thousand Jews \\"on the Aryan side\\" survived. Gunnar S. Paulsson, on the other hand, estimated that about 100 thousand Jews were hiding in occupied Poland, of which nearly 46 thousand managed to survive the war. According to him, 28 thousand Jews were hiding in Warsaw alone, of which nearly 11.5 thousand were saved. === Comparison with the situation in other occupied countries in Europe === Marek Arczyński pointed out that \\"in no occupied country did the Nazis use such far-reaching repressive and cruel terror for the help of the Jewish population as in Poland\\". Other historians also formulated similar opinions. Contrary to the widespread stereotype, Poland was not, however, the only occupied country in Europe, where any aid to Jews was threatened by the death penalty. The principle of collective responsibility for helping Jews in hiding was introduced by the Germans in the occupied territories of the USSR and in the occupied Balkan states, i. e. in countries where under the pretext of fighting against partisans they abandoned the observance of the rules of humanitarian law. On the other hand, much less risk was associated with helping Jews in the occupied countries of Western Europe or in states allied with the Third Reich. The granting of aid to Jews was usually punished there by confiscation of property, imprisonment or deportation to a concentration camp. For example, two Dutchmen were arrested for helping Anna Frank's family, none of whom were executed.These were Viktor Kugler and Johannes Kleiman. Both of them were arrested on August 4, 1944 and after a few weeks stay in Amsterdam prisons, they were transported to the labour camp in Amersfoort (September 11). Kleiman has been released on 18 September due to ill health. Kugler, on the other hand, was imprisoned until 1945, when he fled from the camp, thus avoiding deportation to Germany for forced labour. See Frank 2015?, p. 313. Stefan Korboński claimed that in Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, there was not a single case of death sentence imposed on a person helping Jewish fellow citizens. Only in Denmark there was an incident when a man was shot dead when he was helping Jews to get on a ferry to neutral Sweden. However, the Yad Vashem Institute points out that there are known cases of deaths of Western European citizens in concentration camps, to which they were deported due to aiding Jews. Nevertheless, the difference between the reality of occupied Poland and the situation in Western European countries may be measured by the fact that in Holland it was possible to organise public protests against deportations of the Jewish population. Calculations by Teresa Prekerowa show that only 1% to 2.5% of the adult Polish population was involved in helping Jews. In Western Europe the number of helpers was similarly small, though the risk associated with these activities was incomparably lower. Assuming the percentage of the population of European countries, which in 1945 was made up of Jews who survived the Holocaust, Poland did not differ from the average in other occupied states. On the other hand, in the Netherlands, where few Jews lived and anti-Semitic sentiments were much weaker than in Poland, the losses of the Jewish population were, in percentage terms, comparable with the losses of Polish Jews. Gunnar S. Paulsson estimated that among the Jews that attempted to hide on the Aryan side in Warsaw and Holland, the percentage of survivors was almost identical. Moreover, his calculations show that the \\"loss ratio\\" of Warsaw Jews and Danish Jews was almost identical. Paulsson stated, however, that for various reasons Jews who attempted to hide in the rural areas of occupied Poland had much less chance of survival. === Commemoration === By 1 January 2016, the number of Poles honored with the medal \\"Righteous Among the Nations\\" was 6620. The Honoured are, in most cases, people who are not connected with the broadly understood resistance movement and who provided help to Jews on their own account. Among the honored were a number of Poles who died as a result of helping Jews, including five members of the Baranek family, Michał and Katarzyna Gerula, Sebastian and Katarzyna Kazak, Henryk, Janina, Maria and Leon Olszewski, prof. Franciszek Paweł Raszeja, Maria Rogozińska, Jadwiga Sałek-Deneko, Fr Adam Sztark, Józef and Wiktoria Ulma, Mieczysław Wolski and Janusz Wysocki. Monuments commemorating Poles who saved Jews during World War II were erected in Kielce (1996) and Łódź (2009). On March 24, 2004 in Markowa, a monument commemorating the Ulma family was unveiled. In addition, on March 17, 2016, the Museum of Poles Saving Jews during the Second World War named after Ulma family in Markowa was opened. In 2008, the Institute of National Remembrance and the National Cultural Centre initiated an educational campaign \\"Life for life\\" aimed at showing the attitudes of Poles who risked their lives to save Jews during the Second World War. In March 2012, the National Bank of Poland introduced coins commemorating three Polish families murdered for helping Jews – the Kowalski family from Stary Ciepiełów, the Ulma family from Markowa and the Baranek family from Siedliska. The stories of Poles murdered by the Germans for providing help to Jews were presented in documentaries entitled \\"Price of Life\\" from 2004 (dir. Andrzej Baczyński), \\"Righteous Among the Nations\\" from 2004 (dir. Dariusz Walusiak), \\"Life for Life\\" in 2007 (dir. Arkadiusz Gołębiewski)[273], \\"Historia Kowalskich\\" 2009 (dir.

Norman gained a name during that time as Christie's disliked her. She asked awkward questions about secret practices within the industry. She continued her inquisitive nature when she uncovered that 13 drawings by the 19th-century artist Samuel Palmer were forgeries. On 16 July 1976 she published a sensational article in The Times claiming they were modern forgeries and later identified that they had been created by an artist called Tom Keating. She has also investigated authenticity of Van Goghs. In 1987 she left The Times as she had objected to the Murdoch takeover. Norman joined The Independent newspaper as Art Market Correspondent eventually leaving in 1995 to focus on writing.

It was the last major military engagement during the Muscovite–Lithuanian War (1500–1503). Smolensk, a strong and strategically important fortress, was a part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania since 1404. Ivan III of Russia launched the second Muscovite–Lithuanian War in 1500 and Lithuanians suffered a great defeat in the Battle of Vedrosha. Stanisław Kiszka became regent of Smolensk in 1499 and ordered improvements to Smolensk Kremlin. By the time the Russian army, commanded by Ivan's son , reached Smolensk in June 1502, Smolensk was well- prepared for the siege. The Russian army plundered Orsha and Vitebsk and attacked Smolensk with artillery. Their assault on 16 September was not only repelled but the defense grew into a counterattack. The indecisive but bloody Battle of Lake Smolino in September as well as Lithuanian reinforcements brought by Great Hetman (commander of the army) Stanislovas Kęsgaila, forced the Russians to retreat. Peace negotiations began while the army was still at Smolensk. A six-year truce was concluded on the Feast of the Annunciation (March 25) in 1503. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania lost approximately , or a third of its territory: Chernihiv, Novhorod-Siverskyi, Starodub, and lands around the upper Oka River. In recognition of his defense of Smolensk, Kiszka was promoted to Great Hetman in 1503.

Her abstract portraits of memories, situations, events, and people are inspired by the unconscious, dreams, journals, and nature. She has worked in Vancouver, Victoria, Toronto, Banff, Minnesota, and New York, where she has lived for more than thirty years. == Background == Lodge was one of four daughters born to Jean Lodge in St. Paul, Minnesota. Her father, James, was a chemist at 3M who enjoyed throwing pots in his free time and built a tiny studio in the basement of their home. From as early as the fourth grade, she would bring a large pad of paper to class and tell people, \\"You make a mark, I’ll make a drawing from it.\\" She completed a Bachelor of Science at Macalester College in St. Paul (1963). She received a Master of Fine Arts from Cranbrook Academy of Fine Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan (1965), where she was the only woman in a class of 12. In the summer following her MFA graduation, Lodge made numerous trips to New York City, where she attended large Alberto Giacometti and Francis Bacon retrospectives. These exhibitions were greatly influential on Lodge as they exposed her to approaches in art practice which were not being taken up by the Cranbrook school at that time. == Artistic career == In 1972, Lodge moved to Vancouver, where she would spend the next decade, and began to work less figuratively than in earlier years. In Vancouver, she was friends with many women who were active in the women’s movement. She had her first entirely non-figurative solo exhibition in 1977 at the Surrey Art Gallery. At some point, Lodge expected to return to figurative work but became preoccupied by the technical and aesthetic possibilities of the abstract format. Her inspiration from nature is greatly credited to time spent on an island off the coast of Vancouver, which was partly owned by a friend. Here, she explored landscapes and notions of water. Although Lodge returned to the United States in 1980, moving to New York after finding Vancouver a discouraging place for artists, she continually aims to recreate the feeling of nature in British Columbia. Lodge notes how dreams and unconsciousness bring things to one’s attention, and claims she began making painted mandalas out of nowhere before finding out she had cancer. Following her diagnosis, chemotherapy, and surgery, Lodge became attracted to photographing trees which had been struck by fire yet were still alive, stating that she felt akin to them. These damaged arbutus trees can be seen in the series Trees Hit by Lightening and Other Fires. == Style == Lodge’s monumental abstract works, sometimes as large as 10’x16’, partially derive from 1950s abstract expressionism. She typically utilizes a painterly style where thick layers and ropes of acrylic paint are built up in an almost three- dimensional topography, reminiscent of veins or sinews upon the surface of skin. The texture is built up in three or four steps and certain areas may be reworked in the process. Lodge often uses metallic gold, significantly in works from the \\"Life Jackets\\" and \\"Walls of Eden\\" exhibitions, symbolic of incorruptibility and sacredness, and confronting its audience rather than receding. She also tends to employ a strong sense of grid organization, as seen in the enormous works from \\"Walls of Eden.\\" == Themes == > \\"As a kid in a museum it looks like there is everything to talk about and > paint, but it turns out that there are really only a few things. The > seductive part about being a painter, I find, is that life is not a candy > jar but rather there are a few central issues toward which one directs one’s > life. I can remember being in high school when I first saw a reproduction of > the Gauguin, […] Where Do We Come From? What Are We?

Certainly, the notion that there are major primal subjects to be > dealt with in the subconscious, in myth, in dreams, etc. is part of my > painting heritage\\" - Judith Lodge Lodge’s paintings demonstrate how the boundary between conscious and unconscious can be a permeable membrane. Along with the world of nature and recalling images from life and the unconscious, other topics Lodge addresses in her work include, concerns with intersecting and overlapping areas of change; the eternal and the intangible; documentation of life energies, of what is seen, felt, and remembered; the notion of beauty as not fixed; and beauty tinged with terror and decomposition. == Professional activity == * 1969-1972 - Instructor: Painting and Drawing, Skidmore College, Saratoga Springs, New York * 1969- Instructor: Painting and Drawing, Vancouver School of Art Summer School * 1970-1971 - Instructor: Painting and Drawing, Skidmore College, Saratoga Springs, New York * 1972-1977 - Instructor: Painting and Drawing, Banff School of Fine Arts, Banff, Alberta * 1975-1976 - Visiting Artist: Banff School of Fine Arts, Banff, Alberta (to 1980), Visiting Artist: Minneapolis School of Art, Visiting Artist: Macalester College, Visiting Artist: University of Victoria, Victoria, British Columbia * 1976-1977 - Instructor: Painting and Drawing, University of Victoria, Victoria, British Columbia, Instructor: Painting and Drawing, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia * Assistant Professor: Painting and Drawing, College of St. Rose, Albany, New York * Instructor, Lecturer, Visiting Artist: Emily Carr University of Art and Design, Vancouver, British Columbia * Visiting Artist: York University, Toronto, Ontario * 1993–2006 - Associate Chair: Illustration, Parsons School of Design, New York == Exhibitions == * 1971 - Hathorn Gallery, Skidmore College, Saratoga Springs, New York * 1972 - Wheelock College, Boston, Massachusetts * 1973 - Bau-Xi Gallery, Vancouver, British Columbia * 1974 - Bau-Xi Gallery, Vancouver, British Columbia * 1975 - Bau-Xi Gallery, Vancouver, British Columbia * 1977 - Surrey Art Gallery, Surrey, British Columbia * 1977 - \\"Walls of Eden\\" - Pender Street Gallery, Vancouver, British Columbia * 1977 - \\"From This Point of View\\" (Group Show), Vancouver Art Gallery, Vancouver, British Columbia * 1978 - \\"Targets\\" - Victoria Art Gallery, Victoria, British Columbia * 1978 - \\"Fire, Smoke, Water, Ice\\" - Art Core, Vancouver, British Columbia * 1979 - \\"Rites of Passage\\" - Art Core, Vancouver, British Columbia * 1984 - \\"Recent Drawings and Paintings\\" - Peter Whyte Gallery, Banff, Alberta * 1986 - \\"Life Jackets\\" - University of British Columbia Fine Arts Gallery, Vancouver, British Columbia == Grants/awards == * Canada Council Grant == Collections == * Canada Council Art Bank * Canadian Broadcasting Corporation * National Gallery of Canada * Vancouver City Collection * British Columbia Provincial Collection * Private Collections in New York City * Citibank Collection * Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery == References  Further reading == * \\"This Gathering,\\" Jane Rule, Canadian Fiction Magazine, Autumn 1976. * \\"Eve at the Walls.\\" Jane Rule, Vanguard, March 1977. * \\"Eden Walls.\\" David McWilliam, Criteria, November 1978. * \\"Recent Drawings.\\" Capilano Review, No. 12, 1977. *YVR—Vancouver in Review, No. 2, March 1978. == External links == * * National Gallery of Canada * Works in the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery * The Capilano Review * UBC Medicine Category:20th-century American artists Category:20th-century Canadian artists Category:Artists from New York (state) Category:University of British Columbia faculty Category:Artists from Minnesota Category:Artists from Vancouver Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian women photographers Category:American women photographers Category:21st-century American artists Category:21st-century Canadian artists ","title":"Judith Lodge"},{"id":"56814029","text":"Business machine is a somewhat obsolete term for a machine that assists in the clerical activities common in business companies.

The vast majority of these sorties were flown at night. After suffering heavy losses attempting daylight bombing raids over the Heligoland islands in the North Sea and over France during the first half of 1940, Bomber Command had largely withdrawn its aircraft from daylight attacks. Bomber Command, however, was still willing to risk aircraft to attack targets in daylight on occasion. These were usually targets that required highly precise delivery of bombs, such as warships or small factories. Industries located in occupied territories were another group of targets that required a high degree of accuracy when attacked to avoid casualties among the civilians of the occupied country. In addition, after winning the Battle of Britain, Fighter Command went over onto the offensive. Fighter Command conducted provocative missions in what they termed the \\"Circus\\" operations. These missions were various fighter sweeps over northern France and Belgium conducted to engage the Luftwaffe. The Ramrod type raid was a Circus offensive operation where a small number of bombers were escorted to a target with a very large fighter escort. Bomber Command supported the effort by assigning No. 2 Group to work with Fighter Command. No. 2 Group squadrons were equipped with faster, more manoeuvrable medium bombers, and as a group it was set apart for conducting daylight raids against near targets. Except for occasional diversionary efforts, No. 2 Group did not participate in the Bomber Offensive over Germany. ==Missions== { class=\\"sortable \\" - !Name of mission!!Squadrons involved!!Date of mission!!Target!!Location of target!!class=\\"unsortable\\"Objective -  Operation Margin Augsburg Raid44 Squadron 97 SquadronMAN plantAugsburg, southern GermanyDestroy the MAN U-boat diesel engine factory -  Operation Pandemonium 218 Squadron 15 SquadronLubecker Flender Werk AG plantLübeck, GermanyDestroy the U-boat assembly plant -  Oslo RaidNo. 105 SquadronOslo Gestapo headquarters Oslo, NorwayDestroy the Gestapo headquarters in Oslo -  Operation RobinsonNo. 5 GroupSchneider WorksLe Creusot in south central FranceDestroy the Schneider steel and armaments plant -  Operation OysterNo. 2 GroupPhilips Electrical WorksEindhoven, the NetherlandsDestroy the Philips electronics factory and radar research centre in Eindhoven -  Ramrod No. 16 No. 107 Squadron RAF 487 (New Zealand) Squadron (plus 5 fighter squadrons)  Steelworks  IJmuiden, the Netherlands Together with diversion raid attack on the Hemweg power station near Amsterdam. -  Operation JerichoNo. 140 Wing 21 Squadron RAF, 464 (RAAF) Squadron and 487 (RNZAF) Squadron.Amiens Gestapo Prison Amiens, FranceBreach the prison walls to allow French resistance fighters to escape } After the Allied invasion of the continent Allied control of the airspace over Europe was widespread, and daylight raids became much more common for Bomber Command crews.

It is composed of two sun like stars in an eclipsing binary with a 2.5-day period, which is in turn orbited by an A-type main-sequence star with a 185-year orbital period. There is also HD 236848 which is a distant proper motion companion. ==Visual binary== The visual binary was discovered by Sherburne Wesley Burnham at Dearborn Observatory in Chicago in 1880. A first preliminary orbit was calculated in 1971 by astronomer Georgije Popović using observations from 1880 to 1967. Improved orbits were calculated in 1995, 2009 and 2017. The two stars were separated by when they were discovered, but only in 2010. The orbit has a high eccentricity and the separation of the two stars varies between about and . ==Eclipsing binary== ADS 1359 was discovered by the Hipparcos spacecraft to be a detached eclipsing binary and given the variable star designation V773 Cassiopeiae. The derived period of variability was 1.29 days, exactly half the orbital period of the inner pair since each orbit produces two almost-identical eclipses. The eclipsing stars are the inner pair of the system. The two stars combined are still about eight times fainter than the third star and so the eclipses decrease the overall brightness of V773 Cas by less than 0.1 magnitudes. ==HD 236848== The Washington Double Star Catalog lists a 16th magnitude companion as component C and a 10th magnitude companion as component D. Component D is HD 236848 and it shares the same space motion and distance as the inner three stars. ==References== Category:Cassiopeia (constellation) Cassiopeiae, V773 10543 8115 499 Category:Durchmusterung objects Category:Spectroscopic binaries Category:Eclipsing binaries Category:G-type main-sequence stars Category:A-type main-sequence stars ","title":"ADS 1359"},{"id":"56814115","text":"Boháč () (feminine Boháčová) is a Czech surname.

The White City track was grassed over and Major Percy Brown was installed as Racing Manager. On 20 June, a greyhound called Charlie Cranston won the first ever race there and with club house accommodation for over 1,000 people, and a 500-yard track circumference with wide sweeping turns and fast times the venue was an immediate hit with the public. Early visitors included Edward VIII and Prince George, later King George VI. The GRA also moved its headquarters to White City Stadium from Belle Vue Stadium at the same time. Harringay Stadium was the third greyhound racing stadium to be bought by the GRA. It was constructed by Messers T.G. Simpson of Victoria Street, London, at a cost of £35,000. The 23-acre site was formerly the Williamson's Pottery Works from the late 18th century through to the early 1900s. On completion the stadium had a capacity of 50,000. When it opened on the 13 September it was originally called Harringay Park. The GRA's finances were helped with the use of a sophisticated automatic totalisator betting system. By the end of the year GRA had ownership or shares in no less than 19 tracks that were already operating or due to open in the near future. Two of the planned tracks failed to go ahead. Despite the trustees allowing the Crystal Palace site to be used for greyhound racing it never got off the ground. A Protestant church petition of 43,434 signatures helped the National Anti-Gambling League prosecute the trustees and the racing proposals failed. In addition the £60,000 proposal for the Isle of Man race track, at Onchan Head Bay, with a bathing pool and changing facilities failed. A bill was put before Tynwald (Isle of Man parliament) to prohibit betting and gaming except on the existing horse racing activities and it was passed. The 17 tracks remaining was a remarkable achievement due to the fact that GRA had only come into existence as a company the previous year. Other companies began to rival the GRA and there were well publicised disputes between the GRA and these companies. A National board of control of canine and greyhound racing held a meeting in Manchester to form a control board for greyhound racing (a short lived organisation for tracks outside of the GRA). ===Ireland and Scotland=== Ireland had been a hot bed of coursing for many years and was also subjected to the new version of track racing. A greyhound called Mick the Miller had been born in June 1926 and the brindle dog was named after Michael Greene, who was the odd-job man at the vicarage and Millbrook house where the dog was born and raised. One of his duties was looking after the dog and the other eleven in the litter when they were puppies. Bred by a parish priest called Father Martin Brophy, Mick the Miller was sent coursing and was actually beaten in his first course against a greyhound called Hidden Jew. A quartet of Irish enthusiasts Hugh McAlinden, Joe Shaw, Jim Clarke and Paddy O'Donoghue introduced track racing to Ireland at Celtic Park in Belfast when the first Irish track was built and opened on 18 April. This was followed by Shelbourne Park in Dublin one month later on the 14 May. Shelbourne employed four track trainers in their kennels, Mick Horan, Paddy Quigley, Billy Donoghue and Ben Scally. Scotland opened Powderhall Stadium (North Edinburgh) located in Beaverhall Road on 3 August. This was a track with easy bends and long straights and over 10,000 attended the first meeting. ===Competitions=== The GRA introduced the first major races to be held on an annual basis, including 1927 English Greyhound Derby held at White City. They also created the Champion Hurdle (later to be named the Grand National) for hurdlers and the Oaks for bitches (both at White City), these races were named after the big horse races. Belle Vue introduced the Northern Flat as their first major event. The meetings at the tracks would be managed by the Racing Manager and stewards who would normally be selected from prominent military backgrounds. In addition the GRA purchased the Hook estate at Northaw, 13 miles from the centre of London. It was the base for GRA trainers to train greyhounds for White City and Harringay and later other London tracks. The 140 acres of park and grassland would become famous within the industry. The estate at this time was solely for racing hounds and puppies over nine months old and could house 600 dogs. The pups under nine months were reared under the supervision of William Skerratt on farms in and around Blythe Bridge near Stoke-on-Trent before graduating to Northaw. ===Wembley=== Wembley Greyhounds opened on the 10 December and although the venue will forever be known for football, the irony is that it was greyhound racing that had kept the stadium afloat in its early days. The stadium on the verge of bankruptcy and closure was bought by Arthur Elvin who brought in greyhound racing which saved the stadium from being demolished. Elvin had secured Wembley Stadium by putting a 10% deposit down for a total of £122,500. He had originally won the contract to demolish the site for owner James White who died shortly after leaving the stadium in the hands of the receivers; Elvin set up a new company and he became the Managing Director. The Director of Racing was Captain Arthur Brice, a well known judge at the Waterloo Cup. On the 30 December the National Greyhound Racing Society (NGRS) was formed to represent the commercial interests of the racecourse promoters. ===News=== Bookmaker Joe Coral took a pitch at Harringay and then White City; the Coral Empire was born and would go via Clapton and Walthamstow greyhounds before branching into betting offices. In the Oaks heats were held at various tracks within the GRA with the winner representing the track in the Grand Final at White City. The home representative Peach Blossom II started as hot favourite after taking the White City qualifying final two days previous in a smart 29.58. However it was the Harringay hound Three of Spades that took the honours defeating the Scottish challenger by two lengths. Although Bonzo is listed as winner of the first Grand National in 1927, the title of the event he won was the Champion Hurdle Race, the culmination of a competition organised by the GRA on the same lines as the inaugural Derby. A North vs. South affair, restricted to greyhounds racing on tracks owned by the company. Northern zone dogs, from Belle Vue, Liverpool and Powderhall, took part in a qualifying competition called the Westmorland Cup, while their Southern counterparts at Hall Green, Harringay and White City were sorted out in the Chesham Hurdle. Jumps races on GRA tracks were then confined to four runners, so only the first two qualified for the final. ==Tracks opened== {  style=\\"text- align:center\\" + - !width=120Date !width=250Stadium/Track !width=150Location !width=350Operator -  18 April  Celtic Park  Belfast  National Racing Greyhound Company -  23 April  Breck Park Stadium  Liverpool  Liverpool Greyhound Club Ltd (LGC) -  14 May  Shelbourne Park  Dublin  National Greyhound Racing Company (Ireland) -  21 May  Kings Heath Stadium  Birmingham  British Greyhound Sports Club -  23 May  Darnall Stadium  Sheffield  Associated Greyhound Racecourse Ltd (AGR Ltd) -  20 June  White City Stadium  London  GRA -  2 July  The Boulevard  Hull  Associated Greyhound Racecourse Ltd (AGR Ltd) -  16 July  Elland Road Greyhound Stadium  Leeds  Leeds Greyhound Association Ltd (LGA) -  23 July  Knowle Stadium  Bristol  Bristol Greyhound Club -  27 July  The Kursaal  Southend-on-Sea  Electric Hare Company -  30 July  St Annes  Blackpool  British Greyhounds Sports Club (Blackpool) Ltd -  1 August  Henlow Stadium  Bedfordshire  Independent (unlicensed) -  3 August  Powderhall Stadium  Edinburgh  GRA -  17 August  Stanley Greyhound Stadium  Liverpool  GRA -  24 August  Hall Green Stadium  Birmingham  GRA -  1 September  Shebbertown Racecourse  Nr Bideford  Independent (unlicensed) -  3 September  Towneley Stadium Burnley Associated Greyhound Racecourse Ltd (AGR Ltd) -  13 September  Harringay Stadium  London  GRA -  17 September Carntyne Stadium  Glasgow  The Scottish Greyhound Racing Company Ltd -  24 September  Aylestone Road  Leicester  GRA -  4 October Fullerton Park  Leeds  GRA -  8 October  Greenfield Stadium  Bradford  GRA -  10 October  Mount Vernon Sports Stadium  Glasgow  Independent (unlicensed) -  15 October  Coalville Greyhound Stadium  Coalville  Independent (unlicensed) -  31 October  Greenford Park Trotting Track  London  Independent (unlicensed) -  10 December  Raikes Park Greyhound Stadium  Bolton  Independent (unlicensed) -  10 December  Wembley Stadium  London  Wembley Stadium Ltd } ==Competitions inaugurated == * English Greyhound Derby at White City Stadium - see 1927 English Greyhound Derby * Champion Hurdle/Grand National at White City Stadium * Oaks at White City Stadium * Northern Flat at Belle Vue Stadium ==Roll of honour== {  - !colspan=\\"2\\"Major Winners - !width=300 Award !width=300 Name of Winner - -align=center !1927 English Greyhound Derby  Entry Badge } ===Principal UK races=== {  - !colspan=\\"6\\"Champion Hurdle/Grand National Heat Chesham Hurdle (Southern Championship), White City (Oct 1, 500y hurdles) - !width=30Pos !width=120Name of Greyhound !width=120Trainer !width=50SP !width=50Time !width=150Notes - !1st  Jasserand Godfrey Hyde-Clarke (White City)  5-2 32.01 qualified - !2nd  Billows  Jack Kennedy (Harringay)  8-1  32.05 qualified - !3rd  Ejector Breech  7-4f 32.69  - !4th  Cheerful Billy  R Davenport (Birmingham)2-1  - } {  - !colspan=\\"6\\"Champion Hurdle/Grand National Heat Westmorland Cup (Northern Championship), Belle Vue (Oct 1?, 500y? hurdles) - !width=30Pos !width=120Name of Greyhound !width=120Trainer !width=50SP !width=50Time !width=150Notes - !1st  Bonzo  J Buck (Belle Vue)  qualified - !2nd  Fanny's Chum C Habin (Liverpool)  qualified - !3rd      - !4th      } {  - !colspan=\\"6\\"Champion Hurdle/Grand National Final White City (Oct 10, 500y hurdles) - !width=30Pos !width=180Name of Greyhound !width=250Trainer !width=50SP !width=50Time !width=30Trap - -align=center !1st Bonzo  J Buck (Belle Vue)13-8f 31.12 1 -align=center !2nd Jasserand  Godfrey Hyde-Clarke (White City)  5-2 31.16 2 -align=center !3rd Fanny's Chum C Habin (Liverpool)  2-1  4 -align=center !4th Billows Jack Kennedy (Harringay)  8-1  3 } {  - !colspan=\\"6\\"Oaks Final White City (Oct 12, 500y) - !width=30Pos !width=180Name of Greyhound !width=250Trainer !width=50SP !width=50Time !width=30Trap - -align=center !1st Three of Spades  Sid Jennings5-1 29.96  -align=center !2nd Western Lass  Powderhall  5-1 30.12  -align=center !3rd Peach Blossom II W Smith (White City)  6-4f   -align=center !u Annual Payment Belle Vue  4-1   -align=center !u Hope Again Birmingham  5-1   -align=center !u Wily Jess Liverpool  20-1   } Note Distances were recorded as 0.06 sec for one length (until 1950) and in Ireland 0.07 sec for one length (until 1990). == References == Category:Greyhound racing in the United Kingdom Category:Greyhound racing in the Republic of Ireland Category:1927 in British sport Category:1927 in Irish sport ","title":"1927 UK &amp; Ireland Greyhound Racing Year"},{"id":"56814130","text":"The 1983 Giro del Trentino was the seventh edition of the Tour of the Alps cycle race and was held on 2 May to 5 May 1983.

While both are from opposing tribes - they ultimately fall in love! Fearing that their union could unite two tribes, the head of the third tries everything to stop this from happening. The Drama was a tale of unrequited love and parental opposition while the culture, thinking and issues of tribes in Balochistan served as sidelines of Shahtaaj(Atiqa Odho) and Balaaj(Nauman Ejaz) story of two youngsters from rival tribes who fall in love..

Divided in two volumes, the work has four sections documenting the history and chronicles from 8th century Gujarat (now in India) to arrival of British and folk literature of Gujarat as well as an historical account of the place and people he came to know during his stay in Gujarat. It was later translated into Gujarati in 1869. == Origin == Alexander Kinloch Forbes (1821–1865), a British colonial administrator, appointed in 1842 came to Ahmedabad as an assistant judge in 1846 where he began to learn Gujarati language first from Bhogilal Pranavallabh, and then from Dalpatram, a Gujarati poet. Forbes also had a deep interest in archaeology, ancient monuments and manuscripts, which made him intensely interested in the old archaeological and historical remains of Gujarat. Forbes, along with his colleagues, established Gujarat Vernacular Society in 1848. Dalpatram was associated with Forbes since the establishment of Gujarat Vernacular Society and they became close friends. Dalpatram became instrumental, assistant guide and interpreter for Forbes in his attempt to draw the history of the province. Forbes furnished Dalpatram with necessary assistance to travel extensively and collect the chronicles and inscription from different parts of the province. Dalpatram had profound knowledge of Braj Bhasha and Charani dialect, which were popular languages in poetry gatherings at that time. Thus, Dalpatram helped Forbes to map the province and to give an outline of native world view, life style of local people. Forbes arranged a Kavi Melo (a gathering of poets) at the court of Maharaja Yuvansinha of Idar State in the month of Dussera festival in 1852, and invited bhats, Charans and other local bards. He inquired of these poets about the history, life practices of the people, language, different rulers, great people of the past, traditions of their region, and recorded it for Ras Mala. He also visited many Jain libraries in search of bards who told the stories of history of Gujarat. == Publication history == In 1854, Forbes left for England, and returned to India in 1856 and published Ras Mala. In the subtitle of the work Forbes uses the word annals, in a fashion that is used by James Tod in his Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan (1829 and 1832). A brief memoir on Forbes, prepared by A. K. Nairne, appeared in the 1878 edition of Ras Mala. Ras Mala was translated by Ranchhodbhai Udayaram Dave into Gujarati, and was published by Forbes Gujarati Sabha in 1869. as Gujaratna Ketlak Aitihasik Prasango Ane Vartao. == Content == The Ras Mala has two volumes; each volume is divided into two books. The text contains illustrations, principally architectural, prepared by Forbes himself. The first book gives an account of the rise and fall of the Chavada and Vaghela dynasties. It covers the period from about the eighth to thirteenth century. The second book gives an account of the conquest of Muslims over Anhilwad, a capital of Chavda and Vaghela kings, and the political conflicts between Muslims and Hindu rulers. The third book describes the rise of Maratha power in the province and its fall with the arrival of the British. The fourth book gives an outline of the life practices of the people of the province: it describes the Hindu castes, Hindu beliefs, religious services and festivals, land tenures under Muslim rulers, Marathas and the British rule, marriage institution, funeral rites, etc. ==Reception and criticism == H. G. Rawlinson, an historian who introduced a new edition of Ras Mala in 1924, called the book \\"a work for all time\\". Ras Mala is often compared with James Tod's Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan and James Grant Duff's A History of the Mahrattas. == References  External links == * (Volume I) * (Volume II) * (Gujarati translation) Category:19th-century history books Category:Cultural history of Gujarat Category:1856 books ","title":"Ras Mala"},{"id":"56814300","text":"Manuel Alejandro García (born 25 April 1985) is a Chilean footballer who plays as a midfielder.

Since then the (PSD) moved further to Euroscepticism. Victor Ponta, who was expelled from the PSD in 2017, said \\"The PSD unfortunately has turned to a very populist, very nationalistic, demagogic party,\\" he said. === National Liberal Party === Three days after the 2014 election, on 28 May 2014, National Liberal Party president Crin Antonescu announced that the party would change European affiliation from ALDE to EPP, and it has started negotiations for the merger with the Democratic Liberal Party. The newly created party would still be called National Liberal Party, and be a member of the EPP. Democratic Liberal Party president Vasile Blaga later that day confirmed the merger of the two parties. MEP Norica Nicolai, first candidate on the National Liberal Party list refused to join the European People's Party group, and continued to stay a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group. After the 2014 presidential election, MEP Renate Weber, second candidate on the National Liberal Party list, resigned the European People's Party group, and joined the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group. After the completion of the merger of the two parties, the two MEPs were given an ultimatum to join the European People's Party group or face party exclusion. They failed to fulfill the request and thus were expelled from the National Liberal Party, and currently stand with the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group. Later, MEP Norica Nicolai joined the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats. In late August 2017, MEP Ramona Mănescu, third candidate on the National Liberal Party list, resigned the party, but continued to stand with the European People's Party group. In May 2018, People's Movement Party MEP Siegfried Mureșan, spokesman of the European People's Party, announced he is leaving the party to join the National Liberal Party. Journalist Rareș Bogdan, formerly a staunch opponent to the liberals, was officially nominated as head of the PNL list for the European Parliament elections, which also contains, among others, former co- president of PNL Vasile Blaga, MEPs Siegfried Mureșan, Adina Vălean, Daniel Buda, Cristian Bușoi, Marian-Jean Marinescu and Mihai Țurcanu, and mayors Mircea Hava and Gheorghe Falcă. === Democratic Liberal Party === Three days after the 2014 election, on 28 May 2014, Democratic Liberal Party president Vasile Blaga confirmed the announcement made by National Liberal Party president Crin Antonescu, that the two parties were to merge into a new party, that would retain the name of the latter and international affiliation of the former. To express discontent with this decision, and the lack of a PDL candidate to the presidential election, MEP Monica Macovei, second candidate on the Democratic Liberal Party list resigned the party in September 2014, and competed in the 2014 presidential election as an independent. Following the presidential election, she joined, as an independent politician, the European Conservatives and Reformists. === People's Movement Party === In September 2014, following some declarations, Cristian Preda, first candidate on the People's Movement Party list, was expelled from the party. He continued to stand in the European People's Party group. In 2016, the People's Movement Party merged with (absorbed) the National Union for the Progress of Romania, but the later's MEPs did not join the People's Movement Party. In May 2018, MEP Siegfried Mureșan, spokesman of the European People's Party, announced he is leaving the People's Movement Party, to join the National Liberal Party. As a result, the People's Movement Party lost both its MEPs. === Conservative Party === The Conservative Party ran with the National Union for the Progress of Romania on a common list headed by the Social Democratic Party at the previous election. This electoral alliance was supposed to be called \\"Social Democratic Union\\" (\\"Uniunea Social Democrată\\"), but, due to the Romanian legislation (this name was taken by a 1990s alliance between the Democratic Party and Romanian Social Democratic Party), they ran as \\"PSD-UNPR-PC\\". In 2015, the party merged with the Liberal Reformist Party, to form the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats Members displeased with this decision, headed by MEP Maria Grapini (first Conservative Party candidate, and fifth on the PSD-UNPR- PC list), founded a new party, Humanist Power Party (Social-Liberal) (). She continues to stand with the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, as a member of PPU-SL. Laurențiu Rebega, second Conservative Party candidate and fourteenth on the PSD-UNPR-PC list, sat as an independent politician in the Non-Inscrits group, before joining PRO Romania and the ECR. === National Union for the Progress of Romania === The National Union for the Progress of Romania ran with the Conservative Party on a common list headed by the Social Democratic Party at the previous election. This electoral alliance was supposed to be called \\"Social Democratic Union\\" (\\"Uniunea Social Democrată\\"), but, due to the Romanian legislation (this name was taken by a 1990s alliance between the Democratic Party and Romanian Social Democratic Party), they ran as \\"PSD-UNPR-PC\\". In 2016, the National Union for the Progress of Romania merged with (was absorbed by) the People's Movement Party, but the former's MEPs did not join the People's Movement Party. Both its two candidates continue to stand with the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats: Damian Drăghici (first National Union for the Progress of Romania candidate and sixth on the \\"PSD-UNPR-PC\\" list) as an independent member, and Doru Frunzulică (second National Union for the Progress of Romania candidate and thirteenth on the \\"PSD-UNPR-PC\\" list) joined the Social Democratic Party. == Opinion polls == {class=\\" sortable \\" style=\\"text-align:center; font- size:90%; line-height:16px\\" - style=\\"height:42px; background-color:#E9E9E9\\" ! style=\\"width:150px;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Date ! style=\\"width:100px;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Polling Firm !

In Haarmanns oscillation theory \\"geotumors\\" came to protrude from Earth's surface as result of a drag force in space. These vertical movements resulted in radial forces with gave way to phenomenons like mountain building.

He founded Adelaide's first German School. ==History== Schleinitz was born in Germany the only son of an Oberfurstmeister (forestry supervisor) and cousin of Baron Alexander von Schleinitz. He was educated at the universities of Leipzig and Greifswald, and was himself an officer in the Forestry Service. After the failed students' revolt of 1848, in which he took the liberal side, he found his politics detrimental to his career prospects, and emigrated to South Australia, arriving in Adelaide aboard Pauline from Bremen in December 1849. For several years he was clerk to C. Schilling, landbroker of Gawler Place. In 1851 he founded a German School in Freeman Street (now the stretch of Gawler Place between Grenfell and Wakefield streets), catering to boys and girls, both native-born English and German speakers, English classes being taken by Henry Nootnagel. In March 1852 he was naturalized as a British subject; that same year had J. C. Hansen took over his school \\"during Mr. Schleinitz's temporary absence.\\" The Deutsche Schule moved to Flinders Street and was still in operation under Hansen in 1857. Johann Christian Hansen (c. 1814 – 10 May 1885) was one of the first teachers licensed in South Australia, was born in Prussia. He emigrated to South Australia aboard Australia, arriving in May 1849. He ran the German School on Freeman Street during von Schleinitz's absence, later ran schools in Pirie Street and at his home in Arthur Street, Unley. He also excelled as an organist, composer, chess player and composer of mathematical puzzles. He returned to Germany c. 1877 and died in Jardelund, close to his birthplace Osterby, both near Flensburg in Schleswig-Holstein. Schleinitz's whereabouts from 1852 have yet to be discovered; he reappeared in 1863 in his previous role as a commission agent in Gawler Place. Between 1864 and 1873 he took French and German classes at Adelaide Educational Institution, St Peter's College and Norwood Grammar School, then, finding the constant travelling a strain on his incipient lameness, restricted his teaching to classes at his North Terrace, east, home, where he had been taking evening classes from July 1866. His successor at St. Peter's College was (Karl or Carl) Emil Jung LLD (1833–1902), formerly of Tanunda, and later Inspector of Schools. He returned to Germany around 1875 and there published Der Welttheil Australien, \\"The Australian region\\", (four volumes), English abridgement published in one volume as Australia: The Country and its Inhabitants. By 1876 he was advertising for employment: anything, anywhere.

The song “Bones” is produced by Symphonics International, who were behind Bulgaria's 2016 and 2017 Eurovision entries, placing 4th and 2nd respectively. The song is composed by Borislav Milanov, Trey Campbell, Joacim Persson and Dag Lundberg. The project Equinox was created specially for the Eurovision Song Contest 2018, spearheaded by composer Borislav Milanov. Speaking of this project, he noted that, \\"Initially I had different plans for this song, but for the longest time I wasn't able to find suitable artist for it. Everything changed in 180 degrees, when Georgi Simeonov - JJ, called me to ask if I had suitable song for Eurovision, as he wanted to take part in the BNT selection. When he recorded parts of the song, I realized that something unique can come out of this if I include different voices. Every new artist that joined the project brought some new emotion and history, which upgraded that song more and more. From that point there was not turning back - without any of the artists, 'Bones' lost its charge, emotion and feeling. That is why they stayed together, so we won't sacrifice the way the song sounded. This is the first project of this kind that we have ever done, group is created for the song and the opposite. That song is the proof that the music is bigger than any of us, bigger than any ego, because this project combined people from different cultures with different worldview\\". Days after the Eurovision Song Contest finals, the group announced that it would 'continue to exist' after signing with Universal Music Group. ==DiscographySingles=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:12em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:1em;\\" Year ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Peak chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Album - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\\" BUL ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\\" SWE Heat. - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Bones\\"  2018  3  4  } ==References External links == Category:Bulgarian musical groups Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants for Bulgaria Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants of 2018 Category:Musical groups established in 2018 Category:Universal Music Group artists ","title":"Equinox (Bulgarian band)"},{"id":"56814621","text":"\\"I Won't Break\\" is a song performed by Russian singer Yulia Samoylova.

They played in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA), the defunct development league for the National Basketball Association (NBA). ==HistoryCincinnati Slammers relocation=== The franchise was purchased for an undisclosed amount by Krause Gentle, the parent company of Kum & Go convenience stores. The company announced their intentions to relocate the team to Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The team's 1988-89 schedule was printed on soda cups that were sold at Kum & Go locations. The name \\"Silver Bullets\\" was chosen because the team was sponsored by Coors Light, which marketed the \\"silver bullet can\\". ===Cedar Rapids (1988–1991)=== The Silver Bullets played their home games at the 7,200 seat Five Seasons Center (now U.S. Cellular Center). Kevin Krause, whose father owned the team through their parent company Krause Gentle, served as the team's president. Lewis Lloyd, who was banned from playing in the National Basketball Association (NBA) due to a violation of their drug policy, sought a court injunction in 1988 to allow him to play in the CBA after his contract with the Cedar Rapids Silver Bullets was rejected by CBA commissioner Jay Ramsdell. Lloyd had been participating in the league's rehabilitation program and qualified for reinstatement on March 19. 1989, but through his lawyer challenged the legality of the CBA's drug policy. On December 21, 1988 Linn County, Iowa District Judge William Thomas ruled that the CBA had a right to bar players who had a history of drug use. Ramsdell testified at the hearing that the CBA did not test for cannabis during their drug screenings. John Starks (pictured in 1996) was a CBA All-Star with the Silver Bullets during the 1989–1990 season. On December 30, 1989, Rockford Lightning head coach Charley Rosen was arrested in Cedar Rapids for assaulting Silver Bullets head coach George Whittaker. Rosen was restrained from attacking Whittaker on the court by referees and ejected from the game. After Cedar Rapids posted a 119–98 victory over the Lightning, Rosen met Whittaker in the hallway outside of the Silver Bullets locker room and struck him in the neck and shoulder. According to the Associated Press, Rosen was angry that Whittaker's team was running up the score. As a result of the altercation, the CBA suspended Rosen eight games and fined him an undisclosed amount. In April 1990, Rosen plead guilty to the misdemeanor assault charge. The 1990 CBA All-Star Game was held in Cedar Rapids, Iowa on January 18. The game was sponsored by LA Gear, who announced on the broadcast that they were the official shoe of the CBA. John Starks appeared in the 1990 CBA All-Star Game as a member of the Silver Bullets. During a game late in the season, Starks pushed a referee which led his suspension from the CBA. Starks would eventually become an NBA All-Star with the New York Knicks in 1994. Bimm Ridder Sportswear, an athletic apparel manufacturer, got its start making products for the Silver Bullets and the Minor League Baseball team, the Cedar Rapids Reds. ===Relocation to Tri- Cities, Washington=== In June 1991, the CBA approved the re-location of the Cedar Rapids franchise to Tri-Cities, Washington. The team would later be known as the Tri-City Chinook who played their home games at Tri-Cities Coliseum in Kennewick, Washington. ==Season-by-season records== {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !

It was built in the 14th century by Bernabò Visconti and used as a hunting lodge by him and other members of his family. The castle underwent significant changes in the Renaissance period. Today it is in a state of neglect. ==History== Bernabò Visconti was lord of Milan between 1354 and 1385. He ordered the construction of the castle of Cusago in 1370. It had a quadrilateral plant, with a single tower over the entrance. It was created as a country residence and connected to a hunting park. The most extended side measured 96 meters. The court of Bernabò Visconti frequently attended the castle. After the dethronement of Bernabò, the building passed to his nephew Gian Galeazzo, the first duke of Milan. Between 1425 and 1440, the Duke Filippo Maria Visconti took great care of the castle and the surrounding park. His mistress Agnese del Maino occasionally lived there. In 1438 a little canal (the naviglietto) was excavated to connect the castle to the nearby Naviglio Grande. After the Ambrosian Republic (1447-1450), the castle was abandoned, and part of the lands was sold. In 1496, Ludovico il Moro expanded the castle, restoring its function of a country villa for hunting and parties. A portico with eight arches was added to the entrance side towards the courtyard. A loggia was inserted in the north-eastern corner. The tower assumed the shape with the overlapping volumes, typical of the Sforza architecture, as it appears at the Castello Sforzesco in Milan. In 1496, Ludovico il Moro hosted in the castle the emperor Maximilian I. Later, and until the 20th century, it was used as an agriculture warehouse and home for the farmers. The loggia was closed by a wall. ==Today== Ceased its agricultural use, the castle was abandoned. Today it is in a poor state of repair, awaiting restoration. The castle stands as a backdrop to the Cusago central square. It is faced, on the opposite side, by the church of Saints Firmus and Rusticus.

The airfield was created when the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) commandeered the southern half of Ripon Racecourse in 1916. After the end of the First World War, the airfield was returned to horse-racing. ==History== In 1916, the southern part of Ripon Racecourse, only south-west of the city of Ripon, was pressed into service as a base for No. 76 Squadron RFC. No. 76 Squadron was employed on Home Defence duties and had individual flights located at Catterick, Copmanthorpe and Helperby, with Ripon acting as the headquarters. Other landing grounds could be used in an emergency (RAF Manywells Height), though in practice, lesser used locations saw very little activity (if any). As with the other landing grounds in Yorkshire, the site at Ripon was quite compact, covering only with basic facilities. The role of 76 Squadron at the base was in countering any German threats from air, most notably the Zeppelin airships that would try bombing runs across the north. In 1917, No. 189 Squadron formed at RFC Ripon as a night training squadron and its stay at the airfield was short (only 5 months) before moving south to Suttons Farm. On 1 April 1918, the Royal Air Force was formed from the RFC and the Royal Naval Air Service. RFC Ripon was changed to Royal Air Force Ripon, though this name would only exist for 11 months. No. 76 Squadron moved to Tadcaster in March 1919 and was disbanded there just three months later. The airfield at Ripon was returned to the racecourse owners. Even after this, the portion of the racecourse to the south was used to land civilian flights including Sir Alan Cobham's Circus in the 1920s. The site was re-used during the Second World War as a Prisoner of War (PoW) camp. During the Second World War, RAF Dishforth, some to the east of Ripon was also commonly known as RAF Ripon due to its proximity to the town, but this was a purely unofficial name. The town also had another civilian airfield, due south of the city, that existed briefly in the 1920s. ==ReferencesSources=== * Category:Military units and formations established in 1916 Ripon Category:World War I airfields Category:Royal Flying Corps airfields RAF Category:World War I sites in England ","title":"RAF Ripon"},{"id":"56814770","text":"Sawi language may refer to: * Sawi language (Papuan), a language of West Papua, Indonesia * Sawi language (Dardic), an Indo-Aryan language of Afghanistan == See also == * Shawi language, spoken in South America ","title":"Sawi language"},{"id":"56814776","text":"Joseph Phan (born August 4, 2001) is a Canadian figure skater. At the 2018 World Junior Championships, he won a small bronze medal for his free skate and placed fourth overall. He is the 2017 JGP Croatia Cup silver medalist, the 2018 JGP Czech Skate bronze medallist and 2016 Canadian national junior champion. == Personal life == Phan was born on August 4, 2001, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and is ¾ Vietnamese and ¼ Chinese. He lived in Outaouais and attended École Internationale du Mont-Bleu before moving, in September 2012, to Saint-Leonard, where he attended École primaire Pie-XII. He moved to Laval, Quebec in 2013. He enrolled at École secondaire St-Gabriel. == Career  Early years === Phan began learning to skate in 2006. As a young child, he trained at CPA Asticou in Gatineau, Quebec. In the 2012–2013 season, he was coached by Jocelyne Leduc, Nathalie Martin, and Sylvie Fullum in Saint- Leonard, Quebec. The 2013–2014 season was his first as a member of École Excellence Rosemère, a club led by Yvan Desjardins in Rosemère, Quebec. After winning the national novice men's title at the 2014 Canadian Championships, Phan moved up to the junior level and placed fifth at the 2015 Canadian Championships. Later in 2015, he struggled due to a growth spurt of five inches. He became the national junior men's champion at the 2016 Canadian Championships. === 2016–2017 season === Competing in September 2016 at his first Junior Grand Prix (JGP) assignments, Phan placed sixth in Ostrava, Czech Republic, and fifth in Ljubljana, Slovenia. In December, he won the senior men's event, ahead of Bennet Toman, at the Skate Canada Challenge and qualified to compete on the same level at the 2017 Canadian National Championships in January. He finished 11th in his senior nationals debut. === 2017–2018 season === Phan began his season in August at the 2017 Junior Grand Prix in Brisbane, Australia; he placed second in the short program, seventh in the free skate, and fourth overall. In September, he won silver at his next JGP assignment, in Zagreb, Croatia, where he finished second to Alexei Krasnozhon of the United States. Competing as a senior domestically, Phan finished first, ahead of Nicolas Nadeau and Nam Nguyen, in December at the Skate Canada Challenge. The following month, he placed eighth in the short, fifth in the free, and sixth overall in the senior men's category at the 2018 Canadian Championships. Phan placed fourteenth in the short program, third in the free skate, and fourth overall at the 2018 World Junior Championships in Sofia, Bulgaria. He was awarded a small bronze medal for his free skate. In the off-season Phan landed his first quadruple Lutz. === 2018–2019 season === Phan received a Petro-Canada FACE grant in 2018. In August 2018, it was confirmed that Phan had begun training under coach Brian Orser at the Toronto Cricket, Skating and Curling Club. At his first JGP assignment in Lithuania he placed fifth in the short program, but had a very poor free skate, placing ninth overall. Three weeks later in Slovenia, Phan won the bronze medal. Following this, he commented on Instagram that the transition from training in Montreal to training in Toronto had been difficult initially, but that he now felt things had improved. At the 2019 Canadian Championships, Phan placed sixth in the short program after falling on his opening quadruple toe loop attempt, though he succeeded in executing his planned combination near the end of his program on his final jump. In the free skate he was more successful, landing both of his planned quads, and placed fourth, to finish in fourth place overall, moving ahead of teammate Conrad Orzel. He was named alongside Stephen Gogolev to compete at the 2019 World Junior Championships. Competing at Junior Worlds, Phan set a new personal best in the short program, despite putting a hand down on his triple Axel. He dropped to twelfth place after struggling in the free skate. === 2019–2020 season === Given two assignments on the Junior Grand Prix, Phan placed sixth in Latvia and fifth in Poland, before making his senior debut on the Challenger series at the 2019 CS Warsaw Cup, where he placed fifth. Phan placed fourth at the 2020 Canadian Championships, and was assigned to compete at the 2020 World Junior Championships in Tallinn, Estonia. He placed eighth in the short program in Tallinn, his only error being a two-footed landing on his triple Axel. Phan performed poorly in the free skate and was fifteenth in that segment, dropping to twelfth place overall. === 2020–2021 season === Phan was assigned to make his Grand Prix debut at the 2020 Skate Canada International, but the event was cancelled as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. == Programs == {class= style=text-align:center !

Daly Building (previously known as the Municipal Center and also referred to as 300 Indiana and the Daly Building) is located at 300 Indiana Avenue, NW, and 301 C Street, NW, in the Judiciary Square neighborhood of Washington, D.C. The administrative building is owned by the government of the District of Columbia and has served as the home of various city offices since it opened in 1941 as a unified location for previously-dispersed municipal functions. Currently, the building is primarily occupied by the Metropolitan Police Department; although the District of Columbia Department of Corrections, the District of Columbia Office of the Chief Financial Officer and the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA) also maintain offices in the building. ==Background, 1790–1926== In his 1791 plan for the federal city, Major Pierre (Peter) Charles L’Enfant had intended the area known as Judiciary Square to be the conglomerated home of the federal judiciary, however by 1840 the square was home to a number of city functions, and by the close of the nineteenth century featured a mix of federal and local government offices. At the start of the twentieth century, this mixture of federal and local government offices was true for much of the city, and this dispersion started to create problems for both as the federal workforce and city population expanded with the United States' entrance onto the world stage. The federal government was first to attempt a concentration of its administrative functions in the district with the planning of Federal Triangle during the Calvin Coolidge administration. The massive complex of seven buildings situated along Pennsylvania Avenue downtown was not completed until the New Deal in the 1930s, but, once finished, achieved its goal of unifying a number of federal government offices. Calls for a similar solution to crowded and dispersed municipal functions resulted in Congressional approval in 1926 (the same year Federal Triangle was funded) of an idea to unify municipal courts at Judiciary Square. Eventually, these plans also called for the unification of other municipal functions at Judiciary Square to absorb overcrowded city offices, particularly those of the police department. Juciciary Square, the Henry J. Daly Building is at the bottom right corner ==Planning and construction, 1926–1941== The proposed concentration of so many city courts and services at Judiciary Square would require a host of new buildings to fill a campus, which municipal architect Albert I. Harris started to plan in 1926. However, years of trouble slowed Harris's plans as numerous battles with the federal government and Commission of Fine Arts erupted over various issues, including; funding and cost; the specific site of buildings; the architectural relationship with nearby Federal Triangle and the Mall; the specific location of courts and offices; the number of buildings; the demolition of neighborhood buildings; and especially the financial difficulties and priorities of the Great Depression. Along with the staff of the Office of the Municipal Architect, Harris continued to work through these issues and design the campus, until he died in 1934. Upon the death of Harris, Nathan Corwith Wyeth became Municipal Architect. Wyeth, a native of Chicago and an accomplished architect, was associated with the Washington firm Allied Architects and was a close advisor to Harris. According to the National Register of Historic Places nomination for the Daly Building, “[i]t is impossible to identify any architect’s personal design contributions” to the complex, as almost “all known plans, drawings, and blueprints...are attributed to ‘the Office of the Municipal Architect’.” However, “...Wyeth was the key influence in shaping the Municipal Center Campus.” Yet the ultimate success of the project also depended on Wyeth’s fellow partners at Allied Architects and from the staff of the Office of the Municipal Architect, whose expertise was essential to the process. And it continued to be a frustratingly slow process. But, finally, between 1936 and 1938, a series of Congressional appropriations and Public Works Administration loans finally allowed construction of the Daly Building to begin in 1938. Washington Post reporter James D. Secrest summed it up well, writing on September 4, 1938 that \\"Washingtonians, who have followed the National Capital's progress for the past decade, rubbed their eyes and muttered incantations at the press announcement last week that construction of the Municipal Center finally had been assured.\\" It was complete by 1941. Yet, original plans had called for a number of other municipal buildings to be built to form a campus around the completed Daly Building in Judiciary Square. But the rest of the intended campus of municipal buildings was never completed, except for the Recorder of Deeds building and a portion of the Central Library office (referred to as the “Library Annex,” it was later demolished to make space for the Canadian Embassy). Land intended for a Municipal Auditorium later hosted the E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse, and a plot set aside for the West Building of the Municipal Center became the home of the D.C. Superior Court. South side ==Opening and use, 1941–present== The first city employees moved into the Daly building on May 19, 1941. However, they were only allowed to use half the structure, as wartime needs prompted the city to allow the federal government to temporarily take over the other half. City offices located in the building initially included the Police Department, Traffic Department, Refuse Department, Fire Department, and Health Laboratory. Currently, the building hosts the Metropolitan Police Department and the Department of Motor Vehicles. In the years that followed, the building was never a favorite of the citizens, considering that the only reason most residents entered the building was for the Department of Motor Vehicles. A 1983 Washington Post article noted that \\"[f]or many people, merely the mention of the place is enough to conjure up chilling visions of bottomless file cabinets, brusque government clerks and a twilight zone of bureaucratic runarounds.\\" One person even called the 576,000 square foot building \\"the pinnacle of bureaucracy.\\" And recently, in 2016, Mayor Muriel Bowser, as quoted in the Washington Business Journal, opined that \\"[s]ometimes people exaggerate, but it’s probably the worst building in [in the city's] entire portfolio,\\" when she talked about updating the building. The building witnessed a very unfortunate incident on November 22, 1994. Two FBI agents, Martha Dixon Martinez and Michael J. Miller, and Metropolitan Police Sergeant Henry J. Daly, were shot and killed by a murder suspect who had entered the building. A third FBI agent and a civilian were also wounded. The shooter committed suicide. The Washington Post described \\"Hank\\" Daly as \\"a storied homicide detective with nearly three decades on the D.C. police force\\" and \\"a dogged investigator who loved his work and a hero and mentor to younger detectives.\\" According to the MPD website, Sergeant Daly, aged 51, left behind a wife and two children. The following year the Municipal Center was renamed the Henry J. Daly Building in his honor. One of the bas reliefs next to the plaza staircase ==Art and architecture== Like many other civic buildings constructed during the New Deal, the Daly Building is an example of the Classical Moderne style. The National Register of Historic Places nomination for the Daly Building notes that “[a]mong the defining Classical Moderne features of the building are its ziggurat configuration achieved through the progressive setback of its upper stories and its use of the abstracted classical form.” Although some had originally called for a Colonial Revival design, the architects of the Municipal Center wanted its design to complement the nearby Hadfield Courthouse and Federal Triangle. To make up for its overall, spartan appearance (keeping with New Deal ideals), the building contains a good deal of public art, including bas reliefs next to the plaza staircase by Lee Lawrie and John Gregory. There are also murals made from ceramic tiles in the interior courtyards by Hildreth Meiere and Waylande Gregory. A tile mosaic on the C Street lobby floor depicting a map of the District of Columbia by Eric Menke was described by Alexander M. Padro in a January 2000 letter to the Washington Post as a \\"...giant, brilliantly colored and detailed map of the city...made from tens of thousands of tiny pieces of colored stone.\\" On the Indiana Avenue side is the Police Memorial Fountain by John J. Earley, built in 1942 with Italian marble at the hands of Italian immigrants. The idea for such a memorial had been simmering for years, but it finally received funding in 1940. It honors all District police officers killed in the line of duty. ==Significance== According to the National Register of Historic Places nomination, the Municipal Center is historically significant because it \\"represents...urbanization and the expanding role of government, especially in the areas of public safety and social welfare services, as well as the development of modern municipal administration for the District.\\" In addition, it sits as a physical manifestation of the New Deal in the city, as PWA grants helped fund its construction and it showcases the Classical Moderne style often associated with public buildings from that program. And, on a local level, the idea behind the building's conception, the unification of city services, represents the district's long history of gaining political autonomy from the federal government. The Municipal Center is a tangible landmark on the long road to the District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973. In February 2018, thanks to efforts by the D.C. Preservation League, the Daly Building was officially designated a District of Columbia historic landmark. ==References *DC Metropolitan Police Department *DC Preservation League Category:Government buildings in Washington, D.C.

The Hawkeyes played their home games at Kinnick Stadium in Iowa City, Iowa and competed in the West Division of the Big Ten Conference. They were led by Kirk Ferentz in his 20th season as head coach. Iowa began the year with six wins in their first seven games, with their sole loss during that span coming in their conference opener against Wisconsin. The Hawkeyes rose to 18th in the AP Poll, but lost three consecutive games to knock them from the polls. They ended the regular season with two more wins to finish tied for second in the West Division with a conference record of 5–4. They were invited to the 2019 Outback Bowl, where they defeated Mississippi State. Iowa finished with a record of 9–4 and were ranked 25th in the final AP Poll, their first ranked finish and highest win total since 2015. Quarterback Nate Stanley led the team in passing with 2,852 yards and 26 touchdowns, good for second in the Big Ten Conference in the latter category. The Hawkeyes featured two standout tight ends, with Noah Fant and T. J. Hockenson both earning first-team all-conference honors. Hockenson was awarded the John Mackey Award as the nation's top tight end. Iowa became the first school to have two tight ends chosen in the first round of an NFL Draft when Hockenson and Fant both were both selected in the first 20 picks of the 2019 NFL Draft. Defensive end A. J. Epenesa led the Big Ten in both sacks and forced fumbles. He was joined on the all-conference first-team by safety Amani Hooker, who was named the Big Ten's Defensive Back of the Year. ==Previous season== The Hawkeyes finished the 2017 season 8–5, 4–5 in Big Ten play to finish in a tie for third place in the West Division.

The win was the 144th for head coach Kirk Ferentz, making him the all-time winningest coach in Iowa football history. After an opening drive 3 and out for the Hawkeyes, NIU blocked the punt and had the ball at the Iowa 20. However, a missed field goal swung momentum back to the home team. The only first half points came on a 33-yard field goal from Hawkeye kicker Miguel Recinos. After a slow 3rd quarter, Heisman hopeful Nate Stanley threw his first touchdown of the year, a 1-yard pitch-and-catch to tight end Noah Fant. On the ensuing drive, running back Ivory Kelly-Martin barreled in on a 3rd and goal play to make it 17–0 going into the 4th quarter. After another short field, Toren Young found pay dirt on a 6-yard effort, and it was 24–0 Iowa. After a great punt by Colton Rastetter, NIU got the ball inside their own 1 yard line. on 2nd down, the Hawkeyes forced a safety, and after getting the ball back off the safety punt, backup quarterback Peyton Mansell got his first career touchdown on a quarterback sneak. After Iowa put their 2nd team defense in, the Huskies marched down the field in an impressive 11 play, 75 yard drive to put some late points on the scoreboard. Iowa shook off the slow 1st half and routed NIU 33–7 inside of Kinnick Stadium during the annual Gold Game. ===Iowa State=== *Source: Box Score {  - align=\\"center\\" - align=\\"center\\"  43–22  2017  W 44–41 OT } Neither offense could get going in this in-state rivalry contest. Iowa was the only team to find the endzone and with only a few minutes left in the fourth quarter. An A. J. Epenesa strip-sack sealed this low-scoring affair to keep the Cy-Hawk trophy in Iowa City for a fourth straight year. ===Northern Iowa=== *Source: Box Score {  - align=\\"center\\" - align=\\"center\\"  16–1  2014  W 31–23 } The Panthers were able to play with the Hawkeyes for a while but Iowa's depth proved to be ultimately overwhelming for FCS opponent Northern Iowa. Iowa ended the game with nearly 550 yards of total offense and the final score wasn't indicative of how one-sided this match-up was as the Hawkeyes played their second string for most of the fourth quarter. Iowa's defense had a relentless effort holding Northern Iowa to minus-2 rushing yards in the first half. ===Wisconsin=== *Source: Box Score {  - align=\\"center\\" - align=\\"center\\"  43–46–2  2017  L 14–38 } ===at Minnesota=== *Source: Box Score {  - align=\\"center\\" - align=\\"center\\"  47–62–2  2017  W 17–10 } The Hawkeyes spoiled the Gophers' homecoming in this high-scoring rivalry game. A signature play of the game came on a fake field goal trick play in which T. J. Hockenson took a lateral pass in for a touchdown which helped Iowa secure a lead going into halftime.

The rebuilding apparently took place in 1801. The British government hired a number of transport vessels to support Major- General Sir David Baird's expedition in 1801 to the Red Sea. Baird was in command of the Indian army that was going to Egypt to help General Ralph Abercromby expel the French there. Baird landed at Kosseir, on the Egyptian side of the Red Sea. He then led his troops army across the desert to Kena on the Nile, and then to Cairo. He arrived in time for the battle of Alexandria. Captain Hardie of Shah Kaikusroo was appointed Commodore of the fleet of country ships, Auspicious among them. In 1803 Auspicious was recorded as being registered at Calcutta. Her master was John Barker, and her owner Robert Lawson. Captain John Baker sailed from Calcutta on 26 March 1803, bound for England. On 21 May Auspicious was at Sagar Island, and on 29 June Penang.

He was drafted in the seventh round, 211th overall, in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft by the Los Angeles Kings. ==Playing careerJunior=== Ebert was drafted in the first round, 17th overall, by the Windsor Spitfires in the 2010 OHL Draft. Ebert was named to the OHL First All-Rookie Team at the conclusion of the 2010-2011 season. Originally considered to be a top draft pick, a poor sophomore season led to Ebert dropping to the seventh round of the 2012 NHL Entry Draft where he was picked by the Los Angeles Kings as the last pick in the draft. On December 3, 2013, he was traded to the Guelph Storm along with captain Kerby Rychel in exchange for Brody Milne and eight OHL Draft picks. Ebert was assigned to the Ontario Reign after the conclusion of the 2012–13 OHL season to help them compete in the playoffs. Ebert was returned to the OHL for the following season where he helped Storm win the J. Ross Robertson Cup as OHL Champions. ===Professional=== Ebert signed a three- year entry-level contract with the Kings on May 28, 2014. He won the Calder Cup with the Manchester Monarchs the following season. In June 2016, Ebert was traded by the Los Angeles Kings to the Dallas Stars in exchange for Jack Campbell. In the 2016–17 season, after attending the Dallas Stars training camp, Ebert was assigned for the duration of the year to AHL affiliate, the Texas Stars. In solidifying a top-four role on the blueline with Texas, Ebert produced a career-best 9 goals and 16 assists for 25 points in 68 games. As an un-signed free agent over the summer, Ebert paused his North American career by agreeing to sign with HC Slovan Bratislava of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) on August 7, 2017. In February 2018, Ebert extended his European career by leaving out-of-contention Bratislava after 44 games to sign with Örebro HK of the Swedish Hockey League (SHL). In his first full season with Örebro in 2018–19, he led the team in average time-on-ice and with 33 points in 49 games. His 33 points ranked fourth among league defenseman. In June 2019, Ebert, with hopes of revitalizing his North American professional hockey career, used his NHL out-clause to secure his release from Örbero in signing a one-year, two-way contract with the Ottawa Senators of the NHL. After participating in the Senators training camp, Ebert was re-assigned to begin the 2019–20 season with AHL affiliate, the Belleville Senators. After just one game in Belleville, on October 7, 2019, Ebert was traded by the Senators, along with a fourth-round pick in the 2021 NHL Entry Draft, to the New York Rangers in exchange for Russian forward Vladislav Namestnikov. Ebert played out the remainder of the season in the AHL with the Hartford Wolf Pack, compiling 5 goals and 16 points in 46 games before the season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. As an impending free agent from the Rangers, Ebert opted to return to Sweden and rejoin his former club, Örebro HK of the SHL, on a two-year contract on June 24, 2020. ==Career statistics== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:60em\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

His family's influence in Kaohsiung began with his own political career. Yu's daughter in-law Yu Chen Yueh-ying succeeded his daughter Huang Yu Hsiu-luan in the Legislative Yuan. Yu Teng-fa played a large role in Yu Chen's political career, and his grandchildren Yu Lin-ya, Yu Jane-daw, and Yu Cheng- hsien have also served in the Legislative Yuan. Born to a family of wealthy farmers, Yu Teng-fa began his political career in 1947, when he was elected a Kuomintang member of the National Assembly. He left the KMT in 1948, though he remained friends with party members, namely Chen Hsin-an. Yu succeeded Chen Chieh-hsing as Kaohsiung County magistrate in 1960. That same year, he founded the China Democratic Self Government Research Association. His followers were known as the \\"black faction.\\" Yu was invited to join the tangwai movement for democratization, and he did so. However, he remained opposed to Taiwanese independence, preferring unification with China. Yu yielded the Kaohsiung magistracy to Tai Liang-chin of Kaohsiung's \\"red faction\\" in 1963. The Kuomintang charged Yu with embezzlement, and he was jailed. Elections to the National Assembly and Legislative Yuan were scheduled for December 1978, but postponed after the United States announced that it would soon diplomatically recognize the People's Republic of China. Yu protested the postponement of the elections, stating that the decision was unconstitutional, exposing the Kuomintang's penchant for relying on martial law. In January 1979, he and his son Yu Jui-yen were arrested prior to a demonstration against the postponement of elections and formally charged with \\"knowing a Communist and not reporting it.\\" Yu's arrest led to a large protest organized by Hsu Hsin-liang. The event became known as the and was the first political demonstration since martial law was enacted in May 1949. The January 1979 protest prompted Hsu's impeachment by the Control Yuan, which in turn contributed to December's Kaohsiung Incident. Yu's alleged collaborator, Wu Tai-an, also known as Wu Chun-fa, went to trial shortly after Yu's arrest. Proceedings against Yu Teng- fa and Yu Jui-yen began in March 1979, and were overseen by a military court of the Taiwan Garrison Command. During his trial, Yu Teng-fa was represented by Yao Chia-wen. On 16 April 1979, Yu was sentenced to eight years imprisonment. In her memoir, Annette Lu wrote that the charges against Yu were \\"an elaborate frame up.\\" Three years later, Yu was released on medical parole. In 1986, while serving as magistrate of Kaohsiung, Yu Teng-fa's daughter in- law Yu Chen Yueh-ying merged the \\"black faction\\" with the Democratic Progressive Party. On 13 September 1989, Yu Teng-fa was found dead at his home in Kaohsiung. He had been injured in the back of the head, and was lying in a supine position. In 1995, Kao Ming-hui, a retired deputy chief of the Investigation Bureau based in Kaohsiung, wrote that charges against Yu were fabricated by Kao's agency, additionally stating that Yu was mentally unstable and could not recognize the flag of the People's Republic of China when questioned. ==References== Category:1904 births Category:1989 deaths Category:Magistrates of Kaohsiung County Category:Kuomintang politicians in Taiwan Category:Taiwanese prisoners and detainees Category:Prisoners and detainees of Taiwan Category:Yu family of Kaohsiung Category:Politicians convicted of embezzlement ","title":"Yu Teng-fa"},{"id":"56814921","text":"Shepherd Kofi Agbeko (born 11 October 1985) is a Ghanaian sprinter who specializes in the 200 metres.

It was published in 1834 and is one of the Études philosophiques of La Comédie humaine. ==Plot summary== The story is told in the first person by a young writer named Louis Lambert. He and his lover Pauline are holidaying in the coastal town of Le Croisic. They meet a poor fisherman, and ask him to guide them to a local landmark on the coast. On the way they pass a small cave where a man lives in isolation. Louis and Pauline ask the fisherman to tell them the story of the man in the cave. The man is named Pierre Cambremer. He was a fisherman with a wife and a son named Jacques. Jacques was a young man who liked to drink and gamble, and had one day stolen a gold coin which his mother had sewn into a quilt. His father discovered this, and punished the son by tying him up, and throwing him into the sea. Pierre's wife died shortly afterwards. Pierre in his grief left his home, and eventually settled in the cave by the sea. His only contact is with his young niece who brings him food. The other locals avoid him. Louis and Pauline are so affected by this story, that they abandon their holiday, and Louis writes to his uncle telling him the story. At the start of the story Louis had felt happy and optimistic, but at the end he starts to feel the onset of mental health issues. ==Recurring characters== Louis Lambert is also the title character of the novel Louis Lambert. ==Adaptations== The story was adapted into a French 1920 silent movie directed by Marcel L'Herbier called L'Homme du large. ==References *\\"A Drama on the Seashore\\", translation (by Katharine Prescott Wormeley) at Project Gutenberg (full text) Category:1834 short stories Category:French short stories Category:Books of La Comédie humaine Category:Short stories by Honoré de Balzac ","title":"Un drame au bord de la mer"},{"id":"56815040","text":"Lucinda Cisler (born October 30, 1938) is an American abortion rights activist, Second Wave feminist, and member of the New York-based radical feminist group the Redstockings.

Cisler attended the University of Pennsylvania on a Sears-Roebuck Foundation Fellowships. During her years at Yale she designed the Residence Hall at Vassar College. She wrote “A place where a student lives can challenge and welcome her as much as her books and teachers can.” == Activism == Lucinda Cisler has been a part of the feminist movement since 1968. Initially, she was highly concerned about women in the design field. She also became an abortion rights activist, advocating for women to have complete freedom to abortion and to deciding whether and when to terminate a pregnancy.As a member of the Redstockings, Cisler participated in the 1968 picketing of the Miss America pageant that introduced the women's liberation movement to mainstream media. She marched with a sign that read: \\"women are enslaved by beauty standards.\\" She contributed a chapter, \\"Unfinished Business : Birth control and women's liberation\\", to Sisterhood is Powerful : An Anthology of Writings from the Women's Liberation Movement, edited by Robin Morgan. Lucinda Cisler helped produce and annotate the book, Rebirth of Feminism. The book is made up of ten sections of topics including early feminist writings, history and literary criticism. == Abortion Rights Activism == Cisler devoted majority of her time to writing and taking part in political activity for the annulment of all laws related to abortion and contraception. Cisler's essay on anti-abortion tactics appeared in the publication Notes from the Second Year: Women's Liberation, edited by Shulamith Firestone. \\"Abortion law repeal (sort of): a Warning to Women,\\" argued that settling for reform to existing abortion law would result in a world \\"in which abortion is grudgingly parceled out by hospital committee fiat to the few women who can 'prove' they’ve been raped, or who are crazy, or are in danger of bearing a defective baby.\\" Cisler claimed justice for women would come only when they are one hundred percent free from any restrictions regarding abortions. This comes from the idea that while change is happening in policies regarding abortion, supporting little changes rather than waiting for a drastic turn around is only making it harder to throw them out later. Cisler advocates for no restrictions on abortions. Typical legal restrictions include abortions only being allowed to be performed in licensed hospitals by a licensed physician, not being permitted after a certain stage of pregnancy (unless there is a risk to the women's life), and with a husband or parent's consent. “Steps in the right direction” are an insult and reform is only dividing women not bringing them together, Cisler wrote in an early essay. In 1972, she joined the Ms. magazine campaign, “We Have Had Abortions,” which called for an end to \\"archaic laws\\" limiting reproductive freedom, and encouraged women to share their stories and take action. Cisler wrote a discussion paper with James Clapp called “Abortion Ruling: Some Good News… and Some Bad News” discussing the outcomes of the United States ruling in relation to pro-abortion. The paper discussed what the court said on the issue, the idea of rights to life and protection as well as alternative strategies. The paper was written in order to help educate women on what the ruling meant in regards to them and the policy makers, as well as encourage independence and publicize the women's movement occurring. Lucinda also wrote the article, \\"Abortion: A Major Battle is Over- - But The War Isn’t.\\" This article examines the Supreme Court's pro abortion ruling. ==References== Category:1938 births Category:Living people Category:University of Pennsylvania School of Design alumni Category:Yale University alumni Category:American feminists Category:Radical feminists Category:Vassar College alumni Category:Redstockings members ","title":"Lucinda Cisler"},{"id":"56815083","text":"Several vessels have been named Auspicious: * was launched at King's Lynn, was burnt in 1797 but rebuilt in 1801, made several voyages for the British East India Company, and was sold in 1821. * was launched at Newcastle and was wrecked at Heneaga on 16 August 1801 in an incident in which strong currents at night claimed five other merchantmen and one of their escorts, .

Like her father, she was fond of historical and genealogical matters. One of her paintings hangs in the rooms of the Chicago Historical Society, being a portrait of the early explorer, Samuel de Champlain. ==Early years and education== Harriet Persis Hurlbut was born in Racine, Wisconsin, February 26, 1862. She was the youngest child and only daughter of Henry Higgins Hurlbut, the author of several works, among them Chicago Antiquities and Hurlbut Genealogy. Through her mother, Harriet Elizabeth Sykes Hurlbut, she traced her ancestry back to four of the Mayflower pilgrims, among them Priscilla Mullins and her husband, John Alden. The line of descent through their daughter, Ruth, included the names of Deacon Samuel Bass, his daughter, Mary Bass Bowditch, Abigail Bowditch, Jeremiah Pratt, and Harriette Partridge Pratt, who married Dr. Royal S. Sykes, of Dorset, Vermont, and was the grandmother of Miss Hurlbut. She had two brothers, Sidney Sykes Hurlbut and Jonathan Henry Hurlbut (died 1871). With her family, she moved to Chicago in the winter of 1873, and resided in that city ever since. She was graduated from Park Institute, Chicago, it June, 1880. An early fondness for drawing turned her attention to art, and she entered the studio of Professor Peter Baumgras, with whom she pursued her studies in sketching and oil painting almost continuously for eight years. ==Career== Her first venture was in connection with Mrs. Mary B. Baumgras. Together, they opened a studio in Chicago. Hurlbut's best known picture was the life-size portrait of Samuel de Champlain, which forms part of the Chicago Historical Society's collection. Always of a serious cast of mind, Hurlbut passed her later years in retirement, with her brother, in the paternal home in Chicago, where she devoted herself to the completion of a family record book, which her father began long before. ==ReferencesAttribution=== * * ===Bibliography=== * ==External links== * Category:1862 births Category:19th- century American artists Category:Artists from Wisconsin Category:People from Racine, Wisconsin Category:19th-century American painters Category:American women painters Category:Year of death missing Category:19th-century American women artists ","title":"Harriet Persis Hurlbut"},{"id":"56815238","text":"Ronda E.

This was the seventh consecutive Triplemanía to be held at the arena, and marks the 26th year in a row that AAA had held a Triplemanía show, and the 32nd show held under the Triplemanía banner since 1993. The annual Triplemanía show is AAA's biggest show of the year, serving as the culmination of major storylines and feature wrestlers from all over the world competing in what has been described as AAA's version of WrestleMania or their Super Bowl event. The announced feature match of the show was billed as Póker de Ases or \\"Poker Aces\\", a four-way match held under Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", rules where one of the competitors was forced to unmask as a result of the loss. Via AAA's partnership with the American Impact Wrestling and Major League Wrestling promotions, wrestlers from both companies appeared on the show, including Andrew Everett, DJZ, Brian Cage, ACH, Shane Strickland and Rich Swann. ==ProductionBackground=== Outdoor view of the Arena Ciudad de México building. 2018 marked the 26th year since 1993 that the Mexican professional wrestling company Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA) or Triple A held their annual Triplemanía show and the 31st Triplemanía show promoted by AAA, as they held multiple Triplemanía shows over the summers of 1994 to 1997.

This was the seventh consecutive Triplemanía (XX, XXI, XXII, XXIII, XXIV and XXV) held at the venue. AAA's Triplemanía is their biggest show of the year, AAA's equivalent of the WWE's WrestleMania or New Japan Pro-Wrestling's Wrestle Kingdom event. ===Storylines=== The Triplemanía XXVI show will feature an undetermined number of professional wrestling matches, with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers portray either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (técnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they follow a series of tension-building events, which culminate in wrestling matches. On February 2, AAA director Dorian Roldan and AAA's talent director Vampiro announced a meeting entitled Poker of Aces. This encounter will be one of Fatal 4-Way bets in a Steel Cage Match, where until now the only confirmed are Psycho Clown and the AAA Latin American Champion El Hijo del Fantasma.

His father was named Ioannakes.Argyritzos 10101 at the Prosopography of the Byzantine World. When the Normans besieged Bari in 1068–71, Argyritzos led the faction that favoured seeking terms. On 18 July 1070, the leader of the opposite faction, Bisantius Guirdeliku, was assassinated through the \\"treachery\\" of Argyritzos, according to the Annales Barenses and the Annales Lupi Protospatharii.William J.

Still, the city held out for another nine months. Argyritzos appears to have inherited a leading position following its surrender on favourable terms to the Norman leader Robert Guiscard. According to the chronicler William of Apulia, Robert \\"entrusted the city\\" to Argyritzos. If he did, it was short-lived. By 1075, the city's governors were one Lizius the viscount, probably a Norman, and Maurelianus the catepan, a local with the imperial rank of patrikios.G. A. Loud, The Age of Robert Guiscard: Southern Italy and the Norman Conquest (Routledge, 2013), p. 136. In 1078, Argyritzos arranged the marriage of his daughter to Abelard, Robert's nephew, who was planning a rebellion.Loud, Age of Robert Guiscard, p. 242. The revolt broke out on 3 February 1079. Robert re-captured Bari the following year and in April 1081 Argyritzos fled to the court of King Mihailo Vojislavljević of Duklja, a Byzantine vassal.

Piancastelli's first project at Volkswagen in 1969 was to facelift the Volkswagen Type 3 for the Brazilian market. The next project he took on was designing a car to compete with the Brazilian made Puma while still using the already existent Volkswagen Type III platform. The result was the Volkswagen SP2. The original car used an existing 1600cc Volkswagen engine but that model was quickly discontinued and all later models used an upgraded 1700cc engine. Piancastelli's next big project was to build an economy car off of the Volkswagen Beetle chassis that would be a successor to the Beetle.

In reference to his artistic cooperation Swordfishtrombones album cover production, singer Tom Waits commented on Russ' work: “His approach to photography is with the eyes of a painter working with light. This technique is what drew me to Michael’s work in the beginning”.Tom Waits, “Letter to Michael Russ”, website The Mule. Retrieved 2018-03-11. Russ' career as a photographer began in New York in the late 1960s where he photographed his fellow acting students. Self-taught, evolving his own style: 'The grainy picture appearing horizontally in subtle motion as though it came of the silver screen'. A black and white photograph by Russ, inspired by an Ingmar Bergman film was published on the cover of “Art Direction, The Magazine of Visual Communication” with a Gertrude Stein quotation: “The composition in which we live makes the art which we see and hear”.Art Direction Magazine of Visual Communication, May 1973 He eventually moved to his own studio off Union Square, Manhattan and connected with the local underground art scene. In his early years Russ focused on men's fashion magazines and erotic sequential photographic scenes for Playboy Press books. He soon experimented with distinctive photographic techniques, turning 35mm black and white film into chemically toned, masked, solarized and hand colored, 'one of a kind' silver gelatin prints. These 'TinTones' as Russ would call them were to become the trademark of his work. They were published in popular fashion and lifestyle magazines and brought him international recognition among peers in the art world.

They resided in Denver, Colorado. While still in high school he took ballet (Lillian Cushing School of Ballet) and acting lessons and performed locally. On his 17th birthday he enlisted in the US army and spent 2.1/2 years stationed in Bamberg, Germany. After his discharge he moved to New York City in 1965 where he attended Renate Mannhardt acting workshop and began taking pictures of his fellow acting students. Encouraged by Wilhelmina Cooper of Wilhelmina Models to pursue a career in fashion photography she sent him models on Go-Sees for test shoots and thus helped him to make his entry into fashion photography.Hillebrand, Rudolf. “Portfolio Michael Russ”, Fine Art Photo, Neuss (Germany)2005, No. 1, pp. 42-49.

By the early seventies Russ' work had been published with major fashion and lifestyle magazines like Mens Wear, Esquire, GQ, True Magazine and contributed erotic fantasy images to three Playboy Press books: \\"Love Games\\", \\"Sexy Ladies\\" and \\"Ecstasy\\". == Developing a unique photographic approach == In 1976 Michael Russ moved to Paris and continued with artistically manipulating his silver gelatin prints. Adding hand coloring and masking and solarization to his black and white, or chemically toned images. Applying these photographic techniques lends a painterly aspect to the grainy black and white images as though they come off the silver screen.

The battle took place on 18 November 1918 during the Ukrainian Civil War, and resulted in a major victory for the Directorate. The battle resulted in the eventual collapse of the Ukrainian State in December 1918. == Background == Following the Russian Revolution and the breakup of the Russian Empire, an extended period of social and political unrest erupted in the former Russian Ukraine. With the First World War raging in Europe, the Central Power member nations of Germany and Austria Hungary sought to take advantage of the civil discord in the former Russian Empire by gaining control of the Ukraine's reserves of wheat. A joint German-Austrian army invaded the Ukraine in February 1918, defeated a disorganized force of Bolshevik soldiers and militia units, and forced the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Among other conditions, the treaty placed the Ukraine in Germany's political and economic orbit. The acting government of the Ukraine, the Ukrainian People's Republic, acquiesced to the German terms, though a number of small militant groups actively resisted the Germans. However, none of the various militant groups operating against the Germans were capable of effectively holding territory in the face of the overwhelmingly superior German army. On 29 April 1918 a former General of the Imperial Russian Army, Pavlo Skoropadskyi, orchestrated a coup that succeeded in dissolving the Central Council of the republic and enthroning himself as the Hetman of the new Ukrainian State. The new government was supported by Germany, which desperately needed Ukraine's food supplies and sought to create a postwar buffer state between Germany and any nation-states that would arise in Russia. In addition to tying the new Ukrainian monarchy to the German Empire, Skoropadskyi also repealed a number of the Central Council's socialist policies, actions which in turn caused a number of pro-Bolshevik factions to revolt against the government. These factions gained momentum when the First World War came to an end on 11 November 1918, depriving the Ukrainian State of the majority of Germany's support. On 13 November a number of rebel factions formed the Directorate of Ukraine (also referred to as the Ukrainian National Union) to oppose the weakened Skoropadskyi government. The Directorate formed an army and moved against Kiev. The majority of the Directorate's forces were peasant militia from pro-Bolshevik or anti-Hetman Green armies. These militias were supplemented by the Sich Riflemen, a unit of professional Ukrainian soldiers that had formerly been disarmed and disbanded by the Skoropadskyi regime. The forces of the Ukrainian State were made up of former Russian troops, anti-Bolshevik militia, and a small contingent of German military advisers. == Battle == On 15 November 1918 advance forces of the Directorate's army began to move towards Kiev from the southwest. To counter this action, a force of 700 Hetman soldiers moved to intercept the Directorate forces near the town of Vasylkiv. The Hetman forces deployed themselves near a train station at Motovilivka. Intelligence of the Hetman deployment at Motovilivka made its way to forward elements of the Sich Riflemen under the command of Captain Fyodor Chernik. In response, Chernik launched an immediate attack against the Hetman forces, hoping to punch through their defenses and take Vasylkiv. His detachment of 300 men attacked the left, right, and center of the Hetman force early on the morning of 18 November. The Hetman army counterattacked, pinning down the Directorate army's left flank. The Directorate forces held, but sustained several dozen casualties, including Chernik. On the Directorate's right flank, a force of 50 Sich Riflemen took cover in a wooded area from which they repelled several attacks by a large force of several hundred Hetman soldiers. In addition, both sides utilized armored trains during the battle to provide fire support for their respective forces. By midday the Hetman army's attack had begun to weaken, and Directorate reinforcements began to arrive on the field. Soon the Directorate left was able to outflank the Hetman right flank, sending the army into a retreat. The Hetman army counterattacked with their reserve forces and with an armored train, but one of the Directorate's armored trains landed an artillery shot on the Hetman train, forcing it to withdraw. The Hetman counterattack failed, and by 3:00 PM in the afternoon the Directorate forces held the field. === Casualties === The Directorate forces suffered 17 killed and several dozen wounded in the battle, while the Hetman forces sustained 700 casualties. == Aftermath == Following their victory at Motovilivka, the Directorate forces advanced on and captured Vasylkiv. The Hetman force retreated to Darnytsia. Over the next several weeks the Directorate forces moved closer to Kiev, and on 14 December Skoropadskyi fled to Berlin. This flight marked the end of the Ukrainian State. ==References== Category:1918 in Ukraine Category:Conflicts in 1918 Category:History of Kiev Oblast Category:Ukrainian People's Republic Category:Ukrainian War of Independence ","title":"Battle of Motovilivka"},{"id":"56815624","text":"Moilin Jean Ah-Chuen image on 25 Mauritian rupee. Sir Jean Etienne Moilin Ah- Chuen (Chinese: 朱梅麟; 1911-1991) was a Sino-Mauritian politician and business man from Mauritius. He became First Chinese Cabinet Minister from 1967–1976 and First Chinese Member, Legislative Council in 1949. He was decorated by Pope John Paul II and knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. He is also the founder of what is known as ABC Group, a diversified conglomerate with investmenrs banking, foods industry, automobile, and shipping in Mauritius. ==Family Background and History== His father, Chu Wei Chuen, arrived in Mauritius from Meizhou, Guangdong, China on 1887. In the late 19th century during the Qing dynasty, many Hakka Chinese went abroad in search of a better livelihood. He was 14 years old. His dream was simple - start a business, make a fortune and return home. He did start a humble grocery store in the vicinity of one of the sugar cane factories. By the time he died, he was the owner of three shop in the country. Jean Moilin was the second son of Chu Wei Chuen. He learned how to manage the family's shop from his father. Jean was an active person, he gave his time to the community and worked with several associations. He was the co-founder of the Chinese Daily News, a chinese newspaper outlet in Mauritius. ==Career== In 1931, at the age of twenty, Jean set up his own convenience shop in Port-Louis at 18 Queen Street. The store was called ABC, which stands for 'Au Bazar Central'(At the central market place) because it was situated opposite the central market. He was later joined by his sons in the business. The ABC Group he took over the small business and expanded it into a highly diversified company now includes departments dedicated to car imports, banking, financial and insurance services, foods production and distribution, and shipping and freight. In 2017, ABC Group that he had founded was named as one of the leading business organizations in Mauritius from Forbes Magazine with his son was named as one of the multi-millionaire businessmen in Mauritius. Moilin Jean Ah-Chuen, became one of the most successful entrepreneurs in Mauritius. He was also one of the founding member of the Mauritius Union Assurance in 1948, a company specialising in insurance, pension scheme and investments that is now listed on the Stock Exchange or Mauritius under the symbol MUA. The group now has operations in several countries across East Africa. ==Politics== At the age of 31, he became the youngest president of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce . This position marked the start of his political career. Under his charge, the chamber later played an important role in providing food to the Chinese community in Mauritius during World War II when Japanese warships and submarines disrupted the food supply to the island nation. As an influencer in the community, he was asked in 1948 by the British Colonial Government to sit as a member of the Legislative Assembly as a representative of the Chinese community. He eventually turned politician and became the Minister of Local Government after Mauritius became independent in 1968 when Seewoosagur Ramgoolam was the Prime Minister. The Ministry of Local Government is responsible for local government matters in Mauritius and Jean Ah-Chuen played a key role in the industrialisation of the country after independence. He was instrumental in establishing the Mauritius free-trade zone. Through his connections the first investors from Taiwan and Hong Kong came to Mauritius to set up textiles operations which helped to reduce unemployment in the country. In 1980, Moilin Jean Ah-Chuen is knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. == Legacy == He passed away in October 1991, and left a legacy to his 11 children. In 1992, his daughter, Marie Madeleine Lee, became the first Mauritian ambassador to China. In honor of his contribution to the country, Sir Jean Moilin's portrait was printed on the 25-rupee banknotes in Mauritius in 1998. In 2007, his children decided to transform the family's old residence in Rose-Hill into a museum and memorial center. The museum would open to the public two years later in 2009. His biography was written by Lilianne Berthelot, a mauritian author, and was published in 2008. In 2011, the Mauritius Post also issued a postage stamp to commemorate his birth centenary. ==References== Category:1911 births Category:1991 deaths Category:Mauritian people of Chinese descent Category:Mauritian politicians ","title":"Moilin Jean Ah-Chuen"},{"id":"56815629","text":"Xiao Yufeng (; born 23 January 1995) is a Chinese footballer who currently plays for Changchun Yatai in the China League One. ==Club career== Xiao Yufeng joined Chinese Super League side Changchun Yatai's youth academy in 2006.

The convoy assembled off Port Antonio and got under way on 27 July. The escorts consisted of , , the sloop Bonetta, and the schooners (or Muskito), and Sting. On 8 August the convoy was off Môle-Saint-Nicolas and set off for the Caicos Passage. Two days later they sighted Great Inagua. That night a strong current was noted on Lowestoffe. Despite efforts to steer her taking the current into account and dropping her anchors to keep her from grounding, she struck. Her crew cut away masts, threw guns overboard, but the inflow of water overwhelmed the pumps. Her crew took to her boats and landed on the shore. Daybreak revealed that Lowestoffe had been wrecked on Heneaga, and that several merchantmen too had been wrecked. Five men on Lowestoffe were lost when a boat capsized in the surf. None of the merchantmen suffered any fatalities. The merchantmen that were wrecked were:Lloyd's List №4190.Lloyd's List №4197. { class=\\"sortable \\" - ! Vessel ! Year launched ! Burthen ! Master !

She is portrayed by Pollyanna McIntosh. Anne is an original character in the television series and has no counterpart in the comics. ==AppearancesPersonality=== Anne is the oddly-spoken and enigmatic leader of the Scavengers. She is calm and collected, but also very cunning and sly. Though she originally only speaks in contrived broken English (and complains that others talk too much), she reverts to full sentences following the deaths of the Scavengers. Anne, as a fully accepted member of the Alexandria community beginning in season 9, begins a relationship with Fr. Gabriel Stokes, which does not last the full run of the season. ===Season 7=== In the mid-season premiere \\"Rock in the Road\\", Jadis's group kidnapped Gabriel and then ambushed Rick's team as they searched for him. In the episode \\"New Best Friends\\", when asked by Rick to join forces to defeat the Saviors, Jadis is reluctant but takes it into consideration after being told that they could gain more supplies. Jadis tells Rick he needs to prove his worth and she pushes him down a trash heap into a pit of trash and metal. After watching Rick kill a heavily armored walker, she tells him that she and her people will help him, but that they need a lot of guns. In the episode \\"Say Yes\\", when Rick's group delivers 63 guns to her, she tells him that it is not enough, claiming they need nearly twice as many guns. Rick and Jadis renegotiate and agree that he will keep 20 of the guns while he searches for more. He finds the needed guns at Oceanside in the episode \\"Something They Need\\", seemingly clinching the Scavengers' support. In the season finale \\"The First Day of the Rest of Your Life\\", on the day of the battle, she crudely propositions Rick upon arrival at Alexandria. Together, the Scavengers and the Alexandrians wire up bombs at the gates ready for the enemy. When the explosion fails as Negan and his men wait by the gates, Jadis pulls a gun on Rick and the Scavengers follow suit with the rest of the Alexandrians. She reveals that she told Negan of Rick's plan and was offered a \\"better deal\\" by the Saviors. When the Saviors get distracted by the re- animated Sasha, Rick attempts to make another deal with her, but Jadis refuses and shoots him in the abdomen; she pushes him off the platform. During the battle, she flees with her group through smoke bombs. ===Season 8=== In the episode \\"The King, the Widow, and Rick\\", after the war between the Saviors and the banded survivors has begun, Rick again attempts to get Jadis on his side. She imprisons him in a shipping container. In the episode \\"Time for After\\", Jadis releases him to fight with another armed walker. He decapitates the walker and disarms her men, giving her new terms which she appears to accept. In the mid-season finale \\"How It's Gotta Be\\", Rick is abandoned by Jadis and her Scavengers when they discover the aftermath of Daryl's attack on the Sanctuary and are fired on by Savior soldiers. In the episode \\"The Lost and the Plunderers\\", Simon, not pleased with Negan's approach and knowing the Hilltop has the rest of his 38 men in captivity, goes to the Scavengers' junkyard and accuses Jadis of going back on their deal with the Saviors, but gives her Negan's offer of returning to the original terms of their deal and giving over all their guns. Jadis agrees, but Simon does not believe Jadis is showing enough remorse and kills her two lieutenants, Tamiel and Brion, in cold blood. She punches him, causing Simon to then order his men to kill the rest of the Scavengers. By the time Rick and Michonne arrive at the junkyard, all of the Scavengers but Jadis have reanimated. They find Jadis alone, having dropped her aloof nature. She explains that she had been an artist before the outbreak, having used the junkyard for materials, but afterwards, she and the Scavengers saw the junkyard as a way to keep themselves isolated from the rest of the world while using the entire yard as their canvas. Rick, tired of Jadis' double-crosses, decides to abandon her as he and Michonne escape. Jadis lures the remaining walkers into an industrial shredder to protect herself, crying to herself as she watches her former friends be destroyed. In the episode \\"The Key\\", Jadis captures Negan at gunpoint. In the episode \\"Still Gotta Mean Something\\", in flashback, Jadis plays dead to save herself from the massacre of the Scavengers by Simon and the Saviors. In the present, she takes time to compose herself before collecting a captive Negan and carrying his modified baseball bat, \\"Lucille\\", and a suitcase. Negan tries to apologize for what happened to her people, recognizing that Simon had went against his orders in wiping out the Scavengers, but Jadis is steadfast and still threatens to kill him. While she is out of sight, he is able to access her suitcase, containing a gun and pictures from her past, convincing her to talk lest he destroy them with a flare. He reveals that he named his bat after his late wife, Lucille, and, like Jadis' pictures, his bat is the last thing he has to remember his previous life. Jadis suddenly rushes him, more to get at the flare, but it is knocked out of their hands into a puddle, and extinguishes. She runs off to get another flare as a helicopter hovers briefly overhead before disappearing, too late to see Jadis' second flare. Jadis breaks down into tears. Jadis lets Negan go; he offers her to come with him and follow a new path, but she refuses. In the season finale \\"Wrath\\", Jadis tells Morgan that he can call her \\"Anne\\". Morgan comes to the junkyard and tells her she can go anywhere she wants now that Negan has been defeated, so she leaves, but he stays in her place. ===Season 9=== In the season premiere \\"A New Beginning,\\" Anne, now a fully accepted member of the Alexandria community, joins a supply run into Washington, D.C. Having visited the Smithsonian Museum once with her class when she was still a teacher, Anne is able to lead the group to a cache of supplies in the basement of the museum. On their return, they find the bridge to Hilltop is out, and Rick develops a plan to rebuilt it. In the episode \\"The Bridge\\", Anne helps with this reconstruction, during which she and Father Gabriel start to discover feelings for each other. However, while on watch one night, she spots a helicopter flying overhead. In the episode \\"Warning Signs\\", the next day she departs from the construction camp, unaware Gabriel is following her. Back at the scrapyard, she recovers a walkie-talkie and talks to an unidentified man on the other end. The man tells her she missed her pickup and they will only pick her up if she brings an \\"A\\" with her. Anne discovers Gabriel and subdues him. In the episode \\"The Obliged\\", she prepares to feed Gabriel to a walker but cannot come to do it, but she still tells the man on the other end of the walkie-talkie that she has his \\"A\\". Gabriel recognizes that Anne has been engaging in human trafficking, but she lets him go while she flees to meet with the helicopter. In the episode \\"What Comes After\\", she races to the meeting point, insisting to the man she still has her \\"A\\". While waiting at the site, she witnesses the smoke set up by Rick's destruction of the bridge, and among the various walker bodies that float down river, she finds a heavily-wounded Rick washed ashore. She reports to the landing helicopter that she has a \\"B\\" and he needs their help. Anne and Rick are loaded on the helicopter and taken away. ==Development and reception== Pollyanna McIntosh portrays Jadis/Anne Pollyanna McIntosh appears as Jadis in what was initially just a recurring role in 3 episodes of The Walking Dead's seventh season.

The artist included the dog in several works, including his 1745 self-portrait Painter and his Pug, held by the Tate Gallery. In the words of the Tate's display caption, \\"Hogarth's pug dog, Trump, serves as an emblem of the artist's own pugnacious character.\\"The Painter and his Pug, Tate Gallery ==History== Hogarth owned several different pugs through his life. For example, in December 1730, he placed an advertisement offering a half guinea reward for the return of a dog named \\"Pugg\\".William Hogarth: A Life and a World, Jenny Uglow, p.268 Pugs appear in several of Hogarth's paintings. An early example is his 1730 group portrait of The Wollaston Family, on loan to the New Walk Museum in Leicester since 1943.The Wollaston Family, ArtUK In the fifth scene of Hogarth's 1732–1734 series A Rake's Progress, a scene known as Married To An Old Maid which is held by Sir John Soane's Museum, a pug appears to be marrying a one-eyed dog, mirroring the wedding scene depicted behind in which the spendthrift Tom Rakewell is marrying a rich old maid. Trump is believed to be the puppy in the Hogarth's 1730 group portrait The Fountaine Family, held by the Philadelphia Museum of Art, whose sitters include Andrew Fountaine.The Fountaine Family, Philadelphia Museum of Art The adult pug in the 1738 The Strode Family, held by the Tate Gallery, may also be Trump, although some sources indicate that this pug belongs to one of the subjects, Colonel Strode.The Strode Family, Tate Gallery Louis-François Roubiliac sculpted Trump in terracotta, c. 1741, to accompany a terracotta bust of Hogarth.Terracotta bust of Hogarth, by Louis François Roubiliac, National Portrait Gallery The reclining terracotta figure of Trump was reproduced in Chelsea porcelain in the late 1740s. Plaster casts were sold with Hogarth's possessions after his death in 1762. The Staffordshire potter Josiah Wedgwood made a version in his Black Basalt ware, using a cast bought in 1774 from the London plaster shop of Richard Parker. The original terracotta sculpture was inherited by Hogarth's widow and retained until her death in 1790.Porcelain figure of Hogarth's Dog, Trump, Victoria and Albert Museum It was recorded in 1799 an engraving by Samuel Ireland, but the original is now lost.How Much Is That Doggy in the Window?, Los Angeles Times, 15 June 1986Engraving of busts of Hogarth and Trump, published by Samuel Ireland in 1799, British Museum Trump was approaching old age when he was included in Hogarth's 1745 painting The Painter and his Pug, sitting next to a self-portrait of the artist, along with an easel bearing Hogarth's symbolic line of beauty and works by Shakespeare, Swift, and Milton. (Hogarth had begun the work around 1735, but it originally appeared somewhat different, with Hogarth more formally dressed and wearing a wig, and without Trump.\\") According to Hogarth's biographer Ronald Paulson the painting contains many visual puns, with the dog alluding to Hogarth's own pugnaciousnesss; the allegorical fidelity of the dog to its master paralleling Hogarth's artistic fidelity of presentation; and Hogarth's portrait being (literally) supported by the English literary canon.Hogarth: High art and low, 1732–1750, Ronald Paulson, 1992, p.262 Hogarth also included Trump in the 1746 portrait of Captain Lord George Graham in his Cabin, at the National Maritime Museum, along with Lord George Graham's own dog, which is sitting at the captain's feet and apparently joining in the singing. Trump sits on his haunches on a chair to the right of the painting, wearing Graham's wig, apparently reading from a sheet of music resting against a wine glass.Captain Lord George Graham, 1715–47, in his Cabin, Royal Maritime Museum Hogarth was disparagingly nicknamed the \\"Painter Pugg\\", but Hogarth continued to use the dog as his trademark in a satirical 1763 engraving The Bruiser, based on his 1745 self-portrait with Trump. The Bruiser (a copy of which is held by the United States' National Gallery of Art) replaces Hogarth's portrait with the satirist Charles Churchill, lampooned as a drunken bear, while the dog urinates on a copy of the Epistle published by Churchill in support of John Wilkes, which criticised Hogarth.The Bruiser, C.Churchill, Sanders of Oxford Hogarth's strong identification with his dog led Paul Sandby to caricature Hogarth as a pug in his 1753 engraving Puggs Graces. In 2001, a statue of Hogarth with Trump, made by Jim Mathieson, was unveiled by Ian Hislop and David Hockney on the Chiswick High Road, close to Hogarth's House, the artist's residence from 1749 until his death in 1764.Obituary of Jim Mathieson, The Guardian, 24 April 2003 The Painter and His Pug by William Hogarth.jpgPainter and his Pug, William Hogarth, 1745, Tate Britain William Hogarth 023.jpgFifth painting of A Rake's Progress: Married To An Old Maid, 1732–1734 William Hogarth - Portrait of Sir Andrew Fountaine with other people.jpgThe Fountaine Family, 1730/1735, Philadelphia Museum of Art William Hogarth - The Strode Family - WGA11468.jpgThe Strode Family, 1738, Tate Britain Captain Lord George Graham, 1715-47, in his Cabin.jpgCaptain Lord George Graham in his Cabin, 1746, National Maritime Museum Captain Lord George Graham, 1715-47, in his Cabin - servant.jpgThe black servant on the right of Lord George Graham painting plays a pipe and tabor.

He was appointed to Adelaide Teachers College in 1961 after three years teaching at Lefevre Boys Technical High School. The University of Adelaide physical education diploma course was transferred to the College in 1968 and Daly designed and headed a four-year degree course. Daly took leave to complete a master's degree and PhD in history and sociology of sport at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. Daly was a Principal Lecturer and Head of Department at the Adelaide College of the Arts and Education, which later became part of the University of South Australia, for 20 years. He retired from academic life in 1996. After his retirement, he returned to his love of drawing and painting and exhibited his works of art. ==Coaching career== Before moving into coaching, Daly was a member of the Adelaide Harriers Club where he competed in sprint events. Daly was a prominent Australian athletics coach and official. Major athletics appointments included: * Olympic Games - 1976 (Head Coach), 1980 (Head Coach), 1984 (Head Coach), 1988 (Section Manager), 1992 (Section Manager) * Commonwealth Games - 1974 (Coach) * IAAF World Champiionships - 1983, 1991 (Manager) * IAAF World Cup - Coach for Oceania Team 1975, 1979, 1981, 1989 He was Glynis Nunn's coach when she won the Women's heptathlon at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.

He was a member of the Australian Government's Sport Advisory Council from 1979 to 1984. In 1981, he was appointed as an inaugural member of the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) Board and held this position until 1985.

Division Street in the Near North Side community area of Chicago, Illinois. Built in 1930 by developer Fred Becklenberg, the hotel was one of several residential hotels built to house the influx of labor to Chicago in the late 1920s. Most of the hotel's residents were permanent; according to 1940 census records, the majority had been at the hotel for over five years. Architect Harry Glube designed the hotel in the Art Deco style, a departure from the revival styles normally used for residential hotels. The brick building features extensive terra cotta detailing, including an elaborate cornice and stringcourse above and below the fourth floor. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 8, 2017. ==References== Category:Hotel buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Chicago Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1930 Category:Art Deco architecture in Illinois ","title":"Mark Twain Hotel (Chicago)"},{"id":"56815914","text":"Dasytinae is a subfamily of soft-wing flower beetles, beetles of the family Melyridae. == Description and distribution == Dasytinae are typically small (<8 mm) and parallel-sided, with brownish to blackish integument (rarely metallic), and with or without a covering of short pubescence.

Each of these components is clear as the midday sun on Rain or Shine, a well-designed studio session\\".Bowers, J. All About Jazz Review accessed March 12, 2018 In JazzTimes, Thomas Conrad wrote: \\"In the liner notes, Houston Person says, “Few people get into this kind of groove these days.” So true. It is the sensual, slightly sweaty, blues-based groove they used to call soul-jazz. It was central to the jazz art form (and to its commercial viability) in the 1960s. But in our current eclectic, experimental era, it is a quaint niche. When you hear an authentic voice of the genre like Person, you remember how easy it is to like this music ... The program contains standards, old R&B; hits and lost gems ... The members of Person’s sextet all speak this rich musical language as their native tongue\\".Conrad, T. JazzTimes Review accessed March 12, 2018 In The Observer, Dave Gelly said \\"Although he doesn't attract much critical attention, Houston Person must have a large and loyal following, judging by the number of albums he's made over the years. They’re a discriminating crowd, too, if this latest example is anything to go by. Ballads, blues, R&B; classics – gently but unerringly his soulful tenor saxophone brings out their beauty, enhancing a melody with a few deft strokes. He can pick a good band, too\\".Gelly, D.

She later became a Korean human rights activist who campaigned against sexual slavery and war rape. She was one of many young women who were forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese military; a military that systematically recruited girls between the ages of 10 to 18 years of age from colonized and occupied countries from the 1930s until the end of World War II. From age 14, she was imprisoned in comfort stations for eight years across different countries in Asia. Her experiences evoked in her a feminist consciousness and led her to become a strong activist, advocating the end of war-time sexual violence, anti- imperialism, workers' rights, and inter-Korean reconciliation. Along with the other so-called \\"comfort women\\", she has made the three-fold demand from the Japanese government: a formal state-level apology, reparations, and correction of Japanese history (including amending Japanese history textbooks to include the truth of the \\"comfort women\\" issue). In addition, Kim Bok-dong herself also supported other \\"comfort women\\" to step forward, and was a leader and spokesperson in the \\"comfort women\\" movement. Kim Bok-dong died in Seoul, South Korea, in hospital, on January 28, 2019. ==Background== Kim Bok-dong was born in Yangsan, Gyeongnam, South Korea in March 1926. She was the fourth of six daughters. Her family was wealthy when she was young. However, later her family struggled economically and faced poverty. As a result, she had to put an end to her education. Bok-dong's father died when she was eight years old. Her three older sisters married to escape the hard times. Kim Bok-dong remained at home with her two younger sisters. Until at age 14~15 in 1941, Kim Bok-dong and her mother were cheated by Japanese authorities. Kim Bok-dong was told that she was to support the war efforts by working in a military clothing factory and would return in three years. If not, her family would be considered traitors. The Japanese authorities did not just take Kim Bok-dong away but demanded that her mother sign a document. Her mother could not read so she conceded to the demand, believing that her daughter would work in a factory in Japan. Instead, she was forced into militarized sexual slavery in Japanese occupied territories for eight years, including Guangdong, Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Kim Bok-dong had to have sex every day, especially from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sundays. She tried to commit suicide with two other girls by alcohol poisoning, but Japanese found them unconscious. The army took them to the hospital and the medics revived them by pumping their stomachs, hurting them permanently. Ten days later, she finally woke up and decided to live to tell what happened. She said if her father had been alive, she might not have been helplessly taken away. At age 21 and after the war, Kim Bok-dong finally returned to her hometown. She did not tell her family what she had suffered, except her mother. Unfortunately, her mother became very distressed and died from a heart attack. After her return, she began to visit a temple. After the Korean War, she owned and operated a successful restaurant in Busan where her older sisters lived. Kim Bok-dong eventually met a man whom she fell in love with. Despite having this love, she suffered throughout her life because she was never able to have a child. She believes this was a result of the sexual abuse she endured. Along with this, the man whom she married later died, not knowing her story. It was not until after her husband died that she began to speak about her experience. ==Activism== Kim Bok-dong stated, \\"Even as I returned to my homeland, it was never true liberation for me.\\" After her husband died she began to speak out, and later joined another woman seeking official recognition as victims of Japanese sex slavery. In 1992, a year after Kim Hak-sun first broke silence on the issue, Kim Bok-dong finally publicly began to share her experience and detail what happened to her during her time as a sex slave. This was also the year in which she began to participate in the weekly protest, the Wednesday Demonstration, in front of the Japanese Embassy. Then in 1993, Kim Bok-dong attended and testified at the \\"World Human Rights Conference\\" in Vienna, Austria. She has since testified during other events in Japan and the United States. Kim Bok-dong has traveled around other parts of the world to tell her story and continues to participate in weekly protests. In an interview, Kim Bok-dong states, \\"by presenting my testimony, I regain my sense of self and feel supported and connected with other women.\\" Networking and connecting with other women has allowed her to recognize that there are many people who suffered like she did and given her a sense of community, that she is not alone; nor are they. Kim Bok-dong has been attending the Wednesday rallies to demand a formal apology from Japan and legal reparations from the Korean women who were forced into sexual slavery during the war, for more than 20 years now. Kim Bok-dong acknowledges and recognizes that she has gained a platform where she is able to receive support from both ordinary people and the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan (KCWD). She emphasizes to her supporters and the public at large that they should do the right thing not just for her but for those without a voice, who have gone through similar struggles she has faced as well as for the next generation. ===The Butterfly Fund=== Standing in solidarity with other ‘comfort women’ and wartime rape victims, Kim Bok-dong and Gil Won-ok, established The Butterfly Fund, in efforts to help female victims of sexual violence in armed conflicts around the world. The name, \\"The Butterfly Fund\\" has meaning. Kim Bok-dong states that the symbolic meaning behind the name is that, \\"We as activist would like the victims to be free from their hurtful past, like a butterfly that has just come out of its cocoon.\\" The fund was started with money from personal donations. In the early stages of the fund, Kim Bok-dong and Gil Won- ok declared that they would donate all the money they received as reparations from the Japanese to other women as reparation to those who suffered from war just like they had. Eventually, the KCWD formally established the \\"Butterfly Fund\\" in order to accomplish Gil Won-ok and Kim Bok-dong's objective. The fund began to provide support in the form of $500 per month to a victim support group in Congo in July 2012. This amount would then be expanded once the Japanese governments pays reparation. The first beneficiary of the fund was Rebecca Masika Katsuva, who now runs a shelter for victims like herself. Kim Bok-dong states, \\"It will fly high as emancipatory butterfly to many women war victims with the name of the halmeon.\\" The overarching idea behind the fund was to help and network with sexual violence victims in other countries, not only women in the same geographic space as the founders. For example, the fund has been used to aid Vietnamese women who were raped by Korean Soldiers from 1964 to 1973 during the Vietnam war. Kim Bok-dong also highlights that Korea too should make efforts to acknowledge war crimes committed by its own people. ===Artwork=== In addition to sharing her stories to the public verbally, Kim Bok-dong also created art to share with the public. In 1992, Kim Bok-dong began to live in the House of Sharing due to living a lonely life in Busan. During her time at the House of Sharing, she participated in an art therapy program in which she grabbed the brush and began painting. Her artwork tells her history to future generations. Artwork from the House of Sharing has been included in campaigns to raise awareness and educate the global public on the 'comfort women' issue. Her artistic themes include: childhood memories, the experience of Japanese military slavery, and her present life and feelings. She works in paint, woodblock print, and pencil. Her works include The Day a 14 year old Girl is Stolen Away (1998), As Youth Slips Away, and Suddenly I am Old and Grey (1998), Japan Do Not Trespass - Dok Island is Our Land (1998), and The Leaves of that Gaunt Tree will Blossom Someday (1998). ==References== Category:1926 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Comfort women Category:South Korean activists Category:South Korean women activists Category:People from Yangsan ","title":"Kim Bok-dong"},{"id":"56816128","text":"Michael George Glen WaltzVMI Grad Elected to Florida Congress (born January 31, 1974)https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/416745-florida-new-members-2019 is a U.S. Army officer and American politician serving as the U.S. Representative for Florida's 6th congressional district.

The Longhorns played their home games at Darrell K Royal–Texas Memorial Stadium in Austin, Texas, and competed as members of the Big 12 Conference. They were led by second-year head coach Tom Herman. Texas, coming off a 7–6 season in Herman's first year, began the year ranked 23rd in the preseason AP Poll. In the first game of the year, the Longhorns were upset by Maryland in a game played at FedExField in Landover, Maryland. The team won its next six games, including a dramatic win over No. 7 Oklahoma in the 113th Red River Showdown. The Longhorns rose as high as sixth in the AP Poll, but fell in consecutive weeks to Oklahoma State and West Virginia. At the end of the regular season, Texas had a record of 7–2 in Big 12 play, good for second in the standings and earning them a spot in the Big 12 Championship Game against Oklahoma. The Sooners won the rematch by a score of 39–27. Texas was invited to the Sugar Bowl to play SEC runner-up No. 5 Georgia, which Texas won in an upset by a score of 28–21. They finished with an overall record of 10–4 and were ranked 9th in the final AP Poll, the most wins and highest ranked finish for the school since 2009. The team was led on offense by sophomore quarterback Sam Ehlinger, who finished with 3,292 passing yards, 25 passing touchdowns, and a Big 12-leading 16 rushing touchdowns. His 41 total touchdowns was third in the conference and seventh nationally. Wide receiver Lil'Jordan Humphrey led the team with 1,176 receiving yards. On defense, the team had three first-team all-conference members in defensive lineman Charles Omenihu and defensive backs Kris Boyd and Caden Sterns. ==Previous season== The Longhorns finished the 2017 season 7–6, 5–4 in Big 12 play to finish in four-way tie for fourth place.

But the travel games (especially in this series) have not been in the Longhorn's favor. The home team has won last six games between the two teams and Texas has not won in Manhattan since 2002. Texas was the only team to score in the first half of play, with two touchdowns, a field goal, and a safety. Kansas State had a chance to score a touchdown on the final play of the first half when Alex Delton threw a pass to Adam Harter that was dropped in the end zone. The score at the half was Texas 19, Kansas State 0. Kansas State fared better in the second half, holding Texas scoreless and replacing Alex Delton with Skylar Thompson. Thompson led Kansas State to score two touchdowns in the second half with 14 points. In the end, Texas held the lead with a final score of 19-14. For the next week Texas plays Oklahoma after stopping the second-half comeback by Kansas State. ===vs Oklahoma=== {  - align=\\"center\\" ! style=\\"\\"Overall record ! style=\\"\\"Last meeting ! style=\\"\\"Result - align=\\"center\\"  61–46–5  2017  OU, 29–24 } The 2018 edition of this classic rivalry matchup was pivotal for both the Longhorns and the Sooners, as both had something to prove; OU was playing its first ranked opponent of the season, and Texas was trying to show that it could once again compete with the elite of the NCAA after years of very average performances. This year's game, which ended in a Longhorn victory, was the highest-scoring Red River Showdown game in history, with a combined score of 93. A memorable aspect of this game was Texas' dominance until midway through the fourth quarter, only to eventually surrender a 21-point lead to the Sooners late in the game; Heisman candidate Kyler Murray put on an incredible performance, showcasing his superior speed and accuracy. This comeback, however, did not come to fruition, as Texas kicker Cameron Dicker made a 40-yard field goal with approximately 9 seconds remaining on the clock to win the game for Texas. ===Baylor=== {  - align=\\"center\\" - align=\\"center\\"  76–26–5  2017  TEX, 38–7 } ===at Oklahoma State=== {  - align=\\"center\\" ! style=\\"\\"Overall record ! style=\\"\\"Last meeting ! style=\\"\\"Result - align=\\"center\\"  24–8  2017  OKST, 13–10 } ===West Virginia=== {  - align=\\"center\\" - align=\\"center\\"  3–4  2017  TEX, 28–14 } ===at Texas Tech=== {  - align=\\"center\\" ! style=\\"\\"Overall record ! style=\\"\\"Last meeting ! style=\\"\\"Result - align=\\"center\\"  50–17  2017  TTU, 27–23 } ===Iowa State=== {  - align=\\"center\\" - align=\\"center\\"  13–2  2017  TEX, 17–7 } ===at Kansas=== {  - align=\\"center\\" ! style=\\"\\"Overall record ! style=\\"\\"Last meeting ! style=\\"\\"Result - align=\\"center\\"  14–3  2017  TEX, 42–27 } ===vs Oklahoma (2018 Big 12 Championship)=== {  - align=\\"center\\" ! style=\\"\\"Overall record ! style=\\"\\"Last meeting ! style=\\"\\"Result - align=\\"center\\"  62–46–5  2018  TEX, 48–45 } ===vs Georgia (2019 Sugar Bowl)=== {  - align=\\"center\\" ! style=\\"\\"Overall record ! style=\\"\\"Last meeting ! style=\\"\\"Result - align=\\"center\\"  3–1  1984  UGA, 10–9 } ==RankingsPlayers drafted into the NFL== {  style=\\"text- align:center\\" - style=\\"text-align:center; \\"  Round  Pick  Player  Position  NFL Club -  5  161  Charles Omenihu  DE  Houston Texans -  7  217  Kris Boyd  CB  Minnesota Vikings } ==References== Category:2018 Big 12 Conference football season 2018 2018 Category:2018 in sports in Texas ","title":"2018 Texas Longhorns football team"},{"id":"56816162","text":"Margret Grebowicz (born 1973) is a Polish philosopher, author, and former jazz vocalist.

After obtaining his propedeuse, he initiated his education in Biomedical Sciences at the same university. In 1991, he received his MSc (cum laude). He started working towards his PhD at the Department of Public Health at Erasmus MC. His thesis, titled ‘Prognostic Modeling for Clinical Decision Making: Theory and Applications’, was completed in 1996. Subsequently, Steyerberg held a position at Erasmus Medical Centre. He spent sabbaticals at Duke University (Durham, NC: 1996) and Harvard University (Boston, MA: 2003 and 2005). In 2006, he was appointed professor at Erasmus MC, where he has been the chair of the Medical Decision Making group till the end of 2016. In 2017, Steyerberg was appointed as Chair of the Department of Biomedical Data Sciences at Leiden University Medical Center. ==Research findings== Steyerberg’s methodological research is mainly focussed on clinical prediction modeling. He has developed and applied advanced regression modeling and related statistical techniques for prediction in many medical domains. Other areas of interest include design and analysis of randomized clinical trials, cost-effectiveness, decision analysis, and quality of care research, all with the aim to make better decisions in health care. Contemporary research themes have his attention, including Comparative effectiveness research, Big data, Machine learning, Value-based Healthcare and Precision medicine. Medical fields of application include oncology (e.g. testicular, bladder, prostate, esophageal, colorectal, lymphomas, and hereditary cancers); cardiovascular disease (e.g. acute myocardial infarction, heart valve replacement, limb ischemia, primary and secondary prevention of CVD); internal medicine (e.g. renovascular hypertension, osteoporosis); pediatrics (e.g. triage systems); infectious diseases (e.g. leprosy, chlamydia trachomatis screening); neurology (Guillain Barré syndrome, stroke); and traumatic brain injury (prognosis and efficiency of trial design, comparative effectiveness research, new biomarkers). ===Achievements=== Steyerberg is known for his tremendous contribution to the field of statistical methods for prediction research. Among his most-cited articles are several methodological papers on the development and validation of clinical prediction models. In 2009, he published his book ‘Clinical Prediction Models: A Practical Approach to Development, Validation, and Updating’. The book provides insight and practical illustrations on how modern statistical concepts and regression methods can be applied in medical prediction problems, including diagnostic and prognostic outcomes. It has become both a practical guide and reference work for anyone involved in prediction research in medicine. A second edition was published in 2019. Steyerberg received a fellowship from the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences and the John M. Eisenberg Award for Practical Application of Medical Decision Making Research by the Society for Medical Decision Making in 2016. In 2019 Steyerberg was elected as member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. ==Personal life== Steyerberg currently lives in Rotterdam, in the neighborhood Hillegersberg, with his wife, Aleida Steyerberg-Sluijk, a manager, and their three children Matthijs, Laurens, and Suzanne.

The statue is located in Central Park near the Glendale Public Library in Glendale, California, United States. The Glendale Peace Monument was funded and built in 2013 by the Korean American Forum of California, a non-profit human rights organization. The installation of the memorial happened shortly after Toru Hashimoto, former major of Osaka, Japan, expressed that comfort women were necessary to maintain discipline within the Japanese army during World War II. The unveiling of the statue was also considered a celebration due to the passing of a 2007 United States House of Representatives resolution, which urged the Japanese government to accept responsibility for their wartime crimes. == Appearance == The 1,100 pound bronze statue monument is a replica of the original comfort women statue located in Seoul, South Korea. It depicts a girl sitting in a chair, with an empty chair beside her. The chair represents aging survivors who have not yet received justice, as well as space for people to sit and reflect on how women and girls were subjected to become sex slaves during the Japanese wartime. The statue of the girl herself represents many different aspects and effects of the violence and exploitation experienced by comfort women. For example, the statue portrays a girl with unevenly cut hair due to it being torn off. The unevenness and rough appearance of the hair represents the suffering comfort women endured as a result of being taken from their homes and forced into sex slavery. Her clenched fist represent her resolve for justice, as well as her resolve for endurance and defiance against her injustice. Her bare unsettled feet represent being abandoned by the world, along with her inability to ground and settle herself, unable to completely trust her environment. The bronze bird located at the top of her left shoulder symbolizes not only the connection between the living and the deceased, but as a symbol of freedom and peace. The shadow behind the young girl is of an elderly woman, fragmented pieces of painful memories symbolizing the passing of time with her trauma left unspoken. Finally, is the butterfly located at the center of shadow's body, right at her heart. This butterfly depicts the hope to be reincarnated with a new life in a different world, but also that one day, whether in this life or the next, the sexually exploited victims of Japanese colonial rule, comfort women, will receive their apology. == Controversy == After Glendale City Councilman Frank Quintero announced plans for an identical Statue of Peace to be installed the Central Park of Glendale, it was met with particular opposition from Japanese entities. Dozens of Japanese-Americans filled the City Hall chamber in opposition to the installation of the statue, with some claiming the comfort women narrative depicted by Koreans as manufactured or exaggerated. Ultimately, however, the Glendale City Council agreed 4 to 1 to become the first United States city on the west coast to install a memorial to commemorate comfort women. A lawsuit was then filed by two Glendale residents, Michiko Shiota Gingery and Koichi Mera together with the Global Alliances for Historical Truth-US Corp, a non- profit organization dedicated to “defending the honor of Japan”. They claimed the memorial would cause “irreparable injury” and cause discomfort to Japanese-American citizens who would be seen with disapproval and prejudice. The plaintiffs also argued that the installation of the statue exceeds the power of Glendale, and infringes on the U.S. government's ability to handle foreign affairs. Other opponents of the statue expressed the idea that comfort women were being hailed as prostitutes. Another point brought up by many opponents was the 2015 agreement between the South Korean and Japanese governments. The agreement stated that both governments would refrain from criticizing or accusing the other in the international community over the topic concerning comfort women. Under the agreement, Japan took responsibility for the issue of comfort women, but South Korean activists claimed the apology was vague and did not explicitly state that Japan took \\"legal\\" responsibility over the enslavement of comfort women. An additional point raised by activists states that Japan and South Korea made the agreement because of pressure from the U.S. government to form a united front for national security reasons. Other organizations known as the San Fernando Valley Japanese American Citizens League, Japanese American Bar Association and the Nikkei for Civil Rights and Redress came out in defense of the statue. The coordinator of the Korean American Forum of California, Won Choi expressed the importance of the statue because it reminds people of the rights that were violated, and to warn others about the vulnerability women face in time of war. The U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the case against the statue, validating its right to remain in the park. Julie Tang, chairwoman of the Comfort Women Justice Coalition, views this ruling as a victory for comfort women, as well as giving a green light for future statues to be placed all over the United States. ==See also References == Category:Works about comfort women Category:Monuments and memorials in Los Angeles Category:Outdoor sculptures in Greater Los Angeles Category:Glendale, California Category:Monuments and memorials to women ","title":"Peace Monument of Glendale"},{"id":"56816417","text":"Gianfranco Rosi could refer to: *Gianfranco Rosi (boxer) (born 1957), Italian boxer *Gianfranco Rosi (director) (born 1963), Italian film director ","title":"Gianfranco Rosi"},{"id":"56816437","text":"Bruce Saville (born December 5, 1944) is a Canadian businessman and philanthropist who currently lives in Edmonton, Alberta. He is former shareholder of the Edmonton Oilers before the Edmonton Investors Group was sold. == Career  Early career === Saville started his career working in the Sales and Service division of Goodyear in Ontario. As part of his job, he was required to create 10 page summary reports using a manual calculator and data from a 4-foot thick computer printout generated each month. Saville sought to computerize this process. He brought the idea of computerization to Goodyear's IT department; they replied they were too busy. At Saville's next hockey game he then approached a member of his hockey team who was a systems analyst. At the following hockey game, his teammate came with five volumes of Cobol programming manuals. Saville read the manuals, then developed a system which he took to the Goodyear IT department, who ran it and it worked. This was Saville's first entry into the computer industry. He then proceeded to work as a systems analyst at Goodyear and then Canada Systems Group. In 1974, Saville was hired at Northern Telephone as Manager of Computer Programming. === Saville Systems === In Edmonton in 1982, he established BASA which provided billing solutions to telecommunication companies.

In October 1999, the company was bought by ADC Telecommunication. ADC was eventually bought by Intec Telecom Systems of Great Britain. == After Saville Systems == With the money from the sale, Saville established the Saville Interest Group. He is president. From 1998 to 2008 he was one of three senior investors in the Edmonton Oilers. During this time he also billeted a Czech Oilers player. On April 5, 2010 it was announced that Saville would join the board of Serenic Corporation. === Philanthropy === Before selling Saville Systems, Saville decided to hire a president to reduce his work load.

In 1864, Joe Herring, Timothy Lee, and Ned Jordan built the first bridge over the Spokane River and called it the Pioneer Bridge. The bridge was built about east of the heavily used Plante's Ferry, and subsequently people began using the bridge instead of the ferry because it cost less and was closer to the famous Mullan Road. The first settlement in the region, which came to be known as Spokane Bridge, began to build up near the bridge, and included the first store, the first house, the first hotel, and the first post office in the region. It became a stop on the Pony Express in 1871. M. M. Cowley bought out Charley Kendall in 1872, after AC Kendall became sick, which included the bridge, a store and other out buildings totaling 13.

The show is itself based on the characters created by DC Comics set in the Batman mythology. The episode was written by consulting producer Charlie Huston and directed by main cast member Ben McKenzie. It was first broadcast on March 29, 2018. In the episode, Jerome Valeska, Jervis Tetch, Jonathan Crane and 80 inmates escape from Arkham Asylum to wreak havoc on Gotham. Tetch orchestrates a gigantic hypnosis trick that could kill everyone while Gordon and Bullock try to stop him. Also, Jerome is looking for his abusive uncle to get information but is pursued by Bruce, who feels responsible for his actions. Meanwhile, Barbara learns more information regarding her resurrection. ==Plot== Using hypnosis, Tetch (Benedict Samuel) manages to get a prison guard to escape, along with Jonathan Crane (David W. Thompson). They then orchestrate a break, freeing Jerome (Cameron Monaghan) as well as 84 inmates from Arkham Asylum. When Gordon (Ben McKenzie) and Bullock (Donal Logue) investigate the escape, they receive a call from Tetch, telling them to meet him at an address. There, Gordon and Bullock are subdued by hypnotized people while Tetch has a wrecking ball fall on a married couple, crushing them before escaping. Meanwhile, Barbara (Erin Richards) experiences a flashback to the time when Ra's al Ghul (Alexander Siddig) resurrected her, where he sees her as his true heir to the Demon's Head. After retrieving Jerome's file with the help of Selina (Camren Bicondova), Bruce (David Mazouz) heads to Jerome's uncle diner. The uncle, Zachary Trumble (John Treacy Egan) has already been intercepted by Jerome, who reprimands him for his abuse. Zachary tricks Jerome and has one of his colleagues hold him while he serves soup over Jerome's face. Bruce interrupts and is attacked by the henchman while Jerome kills his uncle after learning the location of someone he is searching for. Selina arrives and tries to shoot Jerome but Bruce stops her as he feels responsible for Jerome, prompting Jerome to escape. Soon, Gordon and Bullock find that the city is now filled with hypnotized people ready to jump off their balconies. They soon find that the people were hypnotized through a radio message. Bullock hears the station in order to find where the signal is coming from and is hypnotized himself. Gordon finally finds the station and stops Tetch from continuing the message.

Members of this gens are first mentioned in the time of Augustus, and they achieved prominence during the first century, when two of them obtained the consulship: Gaius Rubellius Blandus in AD 18, and Lucius Rubellius Geminus in AD 29. ==Origin== The first of the Rubellii mentioned in history was a native of Tibur in Latium. Originally a Sabine town, Tibur became part of Roman territory at the end of the Latin War in 338 BC, and its inhabitants gained full Roman citizenship during the Social War.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, p. 492 (\\"Blandus\\"). The nomen Rubellius belongs to a class of gentilicia formed using the diminutive suffix -ellius, typically derived from other gentile names. In this case the root may have been a name such as Rubius, Rubrius, or Rufius, derived from ruber, reddish or ruddy, or rufus, red.Chase, pp. 124, 131. ==Praenomina== The chief praenomina of the Rubellii were Gaius and Lucius, the two most common names throughout Roman history. Titus, also a very common name, appears in a filiation. ==Branches and cognomina== The main family of the Rubellii bore the surname Blandus, charming or flattering.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. blandus. One member of this family was known as Plautus, a common surname originally given to someone with flat or splayed feet. There also seems to have been a family bearing the surname Geminus, a twin, perhaps a cadet branch of the Blandi.Chase, pp. 110, 111. ==Members== * Rubellius Blandus, an eques who taught oratory at Rome during the Augustan era. The elder Seneca described him as the tutor of the rhetorician Papirius Fabianus, and frequently employed Blandus as one of the speakers in his Controversiae and Suasoriae. He was probably the father or grandfather of Gaius Rubellius Blandus, consul in AD 18.Seneca the Elder, Controversiae, i. 1, 2, 4 ff, ii. prooemium, p. 36 (ed. Bipontinus), Suasoriae, 2, 5. * Gaius Rubellius Blandus, triumvir monetalis in an uncertain year, probably the son of the rhetorician Rubellius Blandus, and the father Gaius Rubellius Blandus, the consul of AD 18.Eckhel, vol. v, p. 295. * Gaius Rubellius C. f. Blandus, consul suffectus from the Kalends of August in AD 18, married Julia, the granddaughter of Tiberius, in AD 33. Although their marriage produced several children, Tacitus describes it as a disastrous union, which added to Rome's sorrows at a period of considerable turmoil.Tacitus, Annales, iii. 23, 51, vi. 27, 45.Fasti Ostienses, .Fasti Antiates minores, . * Lucius Rubellius Geminus, consul in AD 29.Tacitus, Annales, v. 1. * Gaius Rubellius L. f.

Plautus, the son of Gaius Rubellius Blandus and Julia, married Antistia, the daughter of Lucius Antistius Vetus, consul in AD 55. Although he seems not to have become involved in politics, he was the subject of various rumours concerning plots against Nero, who sent him into exile in Asia, where the emperor had him put to death in 62.Tacitus, Annales, xiii. 19, xiv. 22, 57–59.Cassius Dio, lxii. 14. * Rubellia Blanda, buried at Thubursicum in Africa Proconsularis, aged seventy-five.ILAlg, i. 1867. * Lucius Rubellius T. f.

Dear Ijeawele was posted on her official Facebook page on October 12, 2016, was subsequently adapted into a book, and published in print on March 7, 2017. Before becoming a book, Dear Ijeawele was a personal e-mail written by Adichie in response to her friend, \\"Ijeawele\\", who had asked Adichie's advice on how to raise her daughter feminist. The result of this e-mail correspondence is the extended, 62-page Dear Ijeawele manifesto, written in the form of a letter. While the manifesto was written to a female friend, the work's audience scope has been recognized to extend beyond only the mothers of daughters. It is composed of fifteen suggestions on how to raise a feminist daughter, with references to Adichie and Ijeawele's shared Nigerian heritage and Igbo culture. Adichie was inspired to publicize the letter after becoming increasingly aware of what she recognized as ongoing gender inequality in her native Nigeria. Dear Ijeawele was listed on NPR's '2017's Great Reads' list. == Synopsis == In Dear Ijeawele Adichie attempts to challenge the prejudices of gender roles and expectations. The epistolary form literary device was used to give the reader a personal and intimate impression of the manifesto. Using language intended to be seen as clear, direct, and simple, the manifesto is meant to provide parents with the tools to combat situations of gender inequality when raising daughters. The manifesto covers issues ranging from domestic duties such as cooking, to gendered baby clothes. The manifesto asserts that central to raising feminist daughters is the embracing of feminist ideals by mothers raising daughters. One piece of advice that Adichie gives is to \\"Ask for help. Expect to be helped...Domestic work and care-giving should be gender-neutral.\\" Adichie rejects the idea of the manifesto as \\"a parenting book.\\" The manifesto references notable figure Hillary Clinton's title of \\"wife\\" on her Twitter account to exemplify claims of gender inequality. The overarching goal of the manifesto is gender equality. === The suggestions === Dear Ijeawele prefaces with Adichie's \\"two 'Feminist Tools'\\", of which the first is: > your premise, the solid unbending belief that you start off with. What is > your premise? Your feminist premise should be: I matter. I matter equally. > Not 'if only.' Not 'as long as.' I matter equally. Full stop. The fifteen suggestions of Dear Ijeawele begin, respectively, with the following prompts: # Be a full person. # Do it together. # Teach her that 'gender roles' is absolute nonsense. # Beware the danger of what I call Feminism Lite. # Teach Chizalum to read. # Teach her to question language. # Never speak of marriage as an achievement. # Teach her to reject likeability. # Give Chizalum a sense of identity. # Be deliberate about how you engage with her and her appearance. # Teach her to question our culture's selective use of biology as 'reasons' for social norms. # Talk to her about sex and start early. # Romance will happen so be on board. # In teaching her about oppression, be careful not to turn the oppressed into saints. # Teach her about difference. ==Reception== The Guardian has reviewed the work in its book format, writing that \\"It would be difficult not to like this little book, which shines with all Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s characteristic warmth and sanity and forthrightness\\" and that \\"Some of the suggestions feel like mountains of difficulty made simple: but then that’s what manifestos are for.\\" The Harvard Crimson wrote favorably about the book, stating that it \\"sets a standard for feminism\\". == References  * How Do You Raise A Feminist Daughter?

McDonald and Sons of Mystic, Connecticut.Connecticut History Illustrated, Item 187, photo caption She was launched on September 21, 1905, six weeks after McDonald's shipyard went into receivership. Her original owner was F. P. Boggs of Boston. Her first master was Captain S. H. Perry. She was originally employed in the lumber trade between South Carolina and Nova Scotia. On March 13, 1918 Charles Whittemore lost her rudder in a storm off of Block Island, Rhode Island. The former Spanish cruiser USS Don Juan de Austria was sent from the Naval Station in Newport, Rhode Island to tow Charles Whittemore to Newport where was taken into service and commissioned in the United States Navy. At this point, the single greatest naval threat to the United States was German U-boats. As effective anti-submarine methods had not yet been developed, many novel approaches were used. In the case of Charles Whittemore it was decided that she would resume her role as an innocuous merchant ship in the hopes that she would become a target for U-boats. As Charles Whittemore was a relatively small sailing vessel, it was likely that a U-boat commander would not consider her worth a torpedo. Instead, it was hoped, a submarine would surface and attempt to sink Charles Whittemore with its deck gun. In anticipation of this eventuality, Charles Whittemore would be towing a submarine on the theory that the submarine could sink the U-boat before Charles Whittemore would be sunk. USS Charles Whittemore was commissioned on 9 August 1918, with Lieutenant J. Lyons, USNRF, in command. The schooner cleared New London 15 August 1918 towing the submarine USS N-5 (SS-57) bound for the shipping lanes in the North Atlantic where it was hoped German submarines would attack a seemingly defenseless ship. Since no contact was made with the enemy, and N-5 broke loose during a storm, Charles Whittemore returned to New London on 9 September. She later conducted a similar mission with the submarine USS L-8 without encountering a hostile submarine. Continuing her service with the Atlantic Submarine Force, the Charles Whittemore carried submarine supplies, vital spare parts, and other cargo between New York, Newport, New London, Bermuda, and Charleston, S. C., until 14 May 1919 when she returned to New York from Hampton Roads to be sold. She was decommissioned and transferred to her new owner 20 May 1919.\\"The Top-Secret Decoy\\", Sea Classics, December 2017\\"Charles Whittemore\\" at HazeGray.org Charles Whittemore later was damaged by fire and a storm off Cape Cod on 11 January 1927, and abandoned at sea.\\"Boston four-master, which got into war in disguise...\\", Boston Globe, 20 February 1927.

It was written by Eddie Guzelian and directed by Michael E. Satrazemis. ==Plot== Daryl (Norman Reedus), aided by Rosita (Christian Serratos), Tara (Alanna Masterson), and Siddiq (Avi Nash), lead the survivors from the destroyed Alexandria Safe-Zone towards the Hilltop while avoiding Savior patrols who are under orders to seek them out by Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan); Dwight (Austin Amelio), a former Savior that has helped the Alexandrians, guides them using his knowledge of the area, but most remain cautious of his advice, since he was previously a member of the Saviors. They come to find the safest route is to cross through a swamp, and Daryl puts Tara in charge of protecting the survivors while he, Rosita, and Siddiq kill the many walkers half-submerged in the swamp. Tara sees some walkers some distance away, and convinces Dwight to help, but this is a ruse to get him away from the group and kill him. Dwight pleads for her to let him go, apologizing for killing her girlfriend, Denise, but she fires a shot and he runs off. However, as she catches up to him, they see a group of Saviors approaching. As the Saviors come closer to where they are hiding, and with Tara's gun pointed at Dwight, he quickly walks out of the brush and approaches the group, acting as if he managed to escape and reunite with the Saviors. He then draws the patrol away from the Alexandria group, telling them that no Alexandrians could be in the swamp area, since he'd just come from there. When Tara returns to the group, Daryl scolds her, fearing Dwight could tell Negan everything, but Tara explains that she now trusts Dwight, and that he would not do so. Elsewhere, Dr. Harlan Carson (R. Keith Harris) helps the ill Gabriel (Seth Gilliam) to escape the Saviors' Sanctuary, but Gabriel's fever, which affects his eyesight, makes them lose their way. Gabriel relies on his faith in God against Dr. Carson's advice, leading them to an abandoned house where they happen to find antibiotics to treat Gabriel to treat his fever, but Gabriel will still likely go blind without additional help. After accidentally breaking open a piggy bank, they discover car keys and a map to a nearby museum. As they near it, Gabriel notices signs that the place is trapped just before Dr. Carson steps into a bear trap, drawing walkers. Despite his dim eyesight, Gabriel manages to safely avoid the traps and walkers, and rescues Dr. Carson in time. However, the commotion leads a group of Saviors to find them. As they are being escorted away, Dr. Carson notices one of their guard's guns in close reach and grabs for it, but another Savior reacts and shoots and kills him first. Gabriel's faith is shaken, and he begins to cry as he is driven off by the Saviors. At the Hilltop, Maggie (Lauren Cohan) reviews the state of their resources, knowing that with their Savior prisoners along with Gregory (Xander Berkeley), they do not have enough supplies to last, and so she considers cutting them off. Daryl's group then makes it to the Hilltop, where news of Carl's death wracks the community, particularly Enid (Katelyn Nacon). Maggie decides to allow the Saviors to have limited rations and supervised time outside of their cage. Siddiq offers his services as a doctor to Maggie, while Morgan (Lennie James) and Carol (Melissa McBride) deal with Henry's (Macsen Lintz) lack of remorse after murdering Gavin. Back at the Sanctuary, Gabriel is put to work under Eugene (Josh McDermitt) to help the Saviors' ammunition manufacturing process at Eugene's new outpost, the industrial machine shop, in advance of Negan's next offensive. When Eugene reports to Negan that their ammo will not be at full supply for several more days and suggests they build catapults instead, Negan comes up with a second plan, to infect some of the Saviors' weapons with walker blood, so that in the pending attack, they merely have to harm their foes to cause them to turn, rather than kill. ==ReceptionCritical reception=== The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 60% with an average rating of 6.27 out of 10, based on 20 reviews. The site's consensus reads: \\"Focusing on different characters and presenting a new walker threat, \\"Dead Or Alive Or\\" is an entertaining episode—though one that struggles to build suspense.\\" ===Ratings=== The episode drew a total viewership of 6.60 million with a 2.8 rating in adults aged 18-49. This was a decrease from the previous week, which had 6.82 million viewers.

Two National Action Plans on Promotion of Open Government were adopted with Presidential Decrees respectively in 2012 and 2016. Even though the Republic of Azerbaijan has joined Open Government Partnership in 2011, however its National Strategy on Increasing Transparency and Combating Corruption adopted in 2007 specifically included several measures aimed at promotion and development of OGP principles. The establishment of ASAN Service (one-stop shop service hall) in Azerbaijan is an example of implementation of OGP commitments. ASAN Service received UN Public Service Award in 2015. == National Action Plan for the Promotion of Open Government (2012-2015) == National Action Plan for the Promotion of Open Government is the main strategic document defining the strategic course of measures to be carried out in the country during a given period, as well as establishing the sequence and the direction of the measures to be conducted in the coming years. In this document, the Government has mobilized all necessary resources for the execution of the National Action Plan. The purpose of the National Action Plan, which covered the years of 2012-2015 was to ensure the duration of the measures carried out in Azerbaijan in the field of combating corruption, increasing transparency in the activity of state bodies, ensuring compliance of administration with modern standards of management, and promotion of the principles of Open Government. National Action Plan guided by the principles of Open Government Partnership outlines measures for public authorities on providing broad public information about its activities, as well as the role of civil society in the decision-making process, the expansion of electronic services and improvement of quality of services provided to the population. Commission on Combating Corruption of the Republic of Azerbaijan, which is in charge of collecting and reviewing reports of responsible state bodies, noted that 82% of measures envisaged in the National Action Plan were implemented by the governmental institutions. It is noted in the final assessment report that public authorities fully implemented the measures regarding the simplification of the access to information, provision of regular information to public on the work of the government agencies and improving e- services. Furthermore, the number of the services provided through e-government portal increased, opportunities of the “ASAN payment” system expanded and “ASAN service” index was created to assess the quality of public services. The governmental agencies improved the citizen grievances’ review rules, and the geographic coverage of the services provided by “ASAN service” centres was expanded. Public councils were set up under governmental institutions, public discussions and hearings were held, and closer involvement of civil society institutions in the work of governmental agencies was assured. The projects and initiatives implemented by government agencies to promote open government were outlined and support was provided to the civil society institutions involved in this area. National chapter of Transparency International regularly conducted independent monitoring of NAP with the financial support of USAID. TI-Azerbaijan concluded that final implementation rate for NAP was 76%. == Drafting process of National Action Plan (2016 -2018) == Drafting process of new National Action Plan on Promotion of Open Government for the years of 2016-2018 was commenced on 25 October 2015. Drafting process lasted for 6 months with inclusive and close involvement of international organizations, civil society organizations, media and state bodies. National chapter of Transparency International noted that 40% of their recommendations were reflected in the adopted version of National Action Plan. It is also mentioned that new National Action Plan project incorporates the results of the assessment of the implementation of the previous National Action Plan, problems encountered during the implementation process and their remedies, as well as all measures necessary to establish transparent and accountable governance mechanisms in Azerbaijan in line with the Open Government principles. == National Action Plan for the Promotion of Open Government (2016-2018) == National Action Plan was approved with the Presidential Decree on 27 April 2016. Open Government Initiative Government and Civil Society Dialogue Platform noted that adoption of the “National Action Plan for the years 2016-2018 on Open Government Initiative” and the scope of the measures to expand open government principles and prevent corruption are an indication of the political will of Azerbaijan. == Establishment of Open Government Dialogue Platform == On 9 September 2016 “Open Government Partnership Dialogue Platform” was established to strengthen the cooperation, communication and partnership among state bodies and civil society organizations and to contribute further expansion of OGP principles/values in Azerbaijan. Memorandum was signed by participating parties which defined the functions and objectives of the Platform and its charter was adopted. 10 state bodies, including Anti-Corruption Commission and Ministry of Justice, whose activity specifically relates to civil society organizations, parliament and 31 NGOs established the platform. == Application of new innovation in the monitoring of National Action Plans == Commission on Combating Corruption, with support of the project of “Strengthening capacities to fight and prevent corruption in Azerbaijan” implemented by Council of Europe and funded by European Union, launched new “Electron Monitoring System”. New system simplifies and expedites the submission of progress reports by state bodies tasked with carrying out specific measures under National Action Plan and facilitates reviewing and monitoring by the Commission on Combating Corruption. State bodies, through new e-portal www.ems.gov.az, are sending progress reports including images, videos and other relevant documents for each and specific measures envisaged in National Action Plan. Contact points from each state body are interacting with each other and Anti-Corruption Commission in the online form. In addition to that, contact points can publish information about carried out or planned events on their activities on e-portal. This practice encourages other state bodies to learn and follow best practices of other state bodies. Another caveat of this e-platform is that OGP Platform will be given access to this system and they will able to do independent monitoring of National Action Plan without applying to state bodies. Azerbaijan is a first country in the region applying e-monitoring system in evaluation of National Action Plan. The OGP Steering Committee resolved to extend Azerbaijan’s inactive status in OGP by one year. == See also == * ASAN service * Commission on Combating Corruption * Open Government Partnership * Azerbaijan Anti-Corruption Academy == References == Category:Open government Category:Open government by location ","title":"Open government in Azerbaijan"},{"id":"56817091","text":"The 9-Piece (九枚落ち kyūmai-ochi) handicap in shogi has all of White's pieces removed except for the king, their right gold, and their line of pawns.

It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films and other television series of the franchise. The season is produced by Marvel Television in association with ABC Studios and Bohemian Risk Productions, with Steven Lightfoot serving as showrunner. Jon Bernthal stars as Frank Castle, with principal cast members Ben Barnes, Amber Rose Revah, and Jason R. Moore returning from the first season. They are joined by Josh Stewart, Floriana Lima, and Giorgia Whigham. Former series regular Deborah Ann Woll returns in a guest capacity. A second season of The Punisher was ordered in December 2017, a month after the first season was released. The new cast members were added in February 2018. Filming began in New York City the next month and concluded in August. The 13-episode season was released on January 18, 2019. Netflix canceled the series on February 18, 2019. ==EpisodesCast and charactersMain=== * Jon Bernthal as Frank Castle / Punisher * Ben Barnes as Billy Russo * Amber Rose Revah as Dinah Madani * Jason R.

Showrunner Steve Lightfoot had an idea of what a second season would be when he first knew what the \\"journey of season 1\\" was at the start of his work on the series, and did not let the fan reaction to the first season affect his plans since \\"some people love it, some people hate it, some people are in the middle. My personal opinion with that stuff is you just have to be true to the character and the story you choose to tell.\\" The season consists of 13 episodes. ===Writing and design=== Lightfoot felt the theme for the season was Frank Castle \\"adopting the mantle\\" of the Punisher. The season begins with Castle traveling across the United States as a way for him to get \\"a look at the country he fought for but has never really seen\\" according to Lightfoot. Costume designer Lorraine Calvert gave Castle a \\"more relaxed\\" look while he is traveling, having him wear blue jeans. Castle eventually puts back on another vest with the character's well-known skull symbol, with Lightfoot and Jon Bernthal working to make that \\"an integral, plot-driven moment\\" in the season. Bernthal felt they had \\"figured out a very intelligent, very tactical reason, a very psychologically tactical reason to wear it\\" with it making \\"a lot of sense\\". Lightfoot also spoke to the inclusion of Karen Page in the season, feeling the relationship between her and Castle would continue \\"to be very important\\". The makeup department worked to realistically place the scars on Billy Russo's face, who is still recovering from his injuries and is suffering from brain damage. Though Russo resembles the character Jigsaw from the comics, he does not take on that name in the season. Ben Barnes also shaved his head for the role this season and adopts a thicker, rougher, New York accent, \\"more akin to his Bensonhurst roots\\". Barnes felt Russo had a vulnerability in the season similar to Vincent D'Onofrio's portrayal of Wilson Fisk in the first season of Daredevil. Dinah Madani has become \\"fixated\\" on Russo, visiting at the hospital daily with complete \\"tunnel-vision on him\\". Amber Rose Revah added that Madani is \\"self-medicating\\" after the events of the first season, resorting to drinking and promiscuous behavior. As Krista Dumont is \\"[v]ery uptight [and] doesn’t want to let anyone into her personal world\\", Calvert worked to make her wardrobe equally concealing. Doing this \\"became a really important part of her character, to hide behind the facade of the clothes that cover her up.\\" ===Casting=== Stars returning for the season were confirmed in February 2018, including Jon Bernthal as Frank Castle / Punisher, Ben Barnes as Billy Russo, Amber Rose Revah as Dinah Madani, and Jason R. Moore as Curtis Hoyle. Announced as joining them for the season were Josh Stewart as John Pilgrim, Floriana Lima as Krista Dumont, and Giorgia Whigham as Amy Bendix, with Corbin Bernsen as Anderson Schultz and Annette O'Toole as Eliza Schultz announced in May. Deborah Ann Woll was confirmed to be reprising her role as Karen Page in December 2018. ===Filming=== Filming for the season had begun by March 10, 2018, in The Bellmores, New York. Filming took place in Albany, New York, in mid-July 2018, with production on the season concluding in August 2018. ==Release== A teaser for the season released in January 2019. The episodes were released on Netflix worldwide, on January 18, 2019. ==Critical response== The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 60% approval rating with an average rating of 6.73/10 based on 35 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"The Punishers second season leaves fans torn between the undeniably action-packed fun and the underwhelming portrayal of the charismatic Frank Castle.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 58 out of 100, based on 6 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". ==References* Category:2019 American television seasons 02 ","title":"The Punisher (season 2)"},{"id":"56817513","text":"Ton Smits (February 18, 1921-August 5, 1981) was a Dutch cartoonist and comic artist.

Due to taxonomic confusion with the Antarctic flying squid the exact limits of its distribution are uncertain but it is thought to be restricted to waters off Southern Africa. ==Description== The Angolan flying squid has the typical cylindrical mantle shape of the Todarodine squids with arrow shaped fins. It does not have visceral photophores. The tentacular club has a short carpal area and has only four pairs of suckers, a number which is distinct for this species. The suckers in the middle part of the manus have 13 to 16 long, pointed teeth on their rings there are 14-18 suckers on the manus arranged in four rows. The tentacles also bear four rows of suckers, the largest of which have 14-17 conical teeth in their rings alternating with square plates. The rings of the suckers on the arms have large distal teeth which alternate with very small teeth. The distal two fifths of the fourth right arm of males is hectocotylised and has thick pedicels rather than suckers which are almost entirely connected by the ventral protective membrane; the dorsal row of pedicels is flattened. The body is a dark purplish brown in colour. ==Distribution== The Angolan flying squid is certainly found off Southern Africa in the south-eastern Atlantic Ocean in the Benguela Current off Angola, Namibia and South Africa and it extends eastwards in to the Indian Ocean. However, some sources list it as having a wider distribution but see taxonomic note below. ==Habitat and biology== The Angolan flying squid is mainly found in the upper slope, benthic habitat of the South African continental slope at depths of between 300m and 500m, as is the lesser flying squid (Todaropsis eblanae) and these two species are considered indicator species for this zone. The adults are restricted to near the bottom during the day while the juveniles occur in all depths apart from the surface, which they avoid during the day. During the night the adult squid move up the watercoilumn and can be found at various depths but still avoid the surface and the juveniles are most abundant at depths of 60m-80m. Normally the young squid show a preference for the epipelagic zone. In a population off Namibia the sex showed a clear predominance of females over males, which has also been observed in the congeneric European flying squid (Todarodes sagittatus). This may be due to differing habitat preferences of males and females and that the only meet to spawn. The smallest mature male has a mantle length of 240mm and the smallest mature female measured 250mm. Studies of certain anatomical features suggest that females become sexually mature at mantle lengths of between 300mm to 350 mm The sub-adult and adult squid are most abundant during the Southern spring, from October to December. Analysis of statoliths suggest that the life span of this species is roughly one year but growth rates are subject to considerable individual variation and are correlated variable environmental effects of the northern Benguela Upwelling System. Angolan flying squid are opportunistic predators and their prey includes a variety of fish species such as the Cape hake Merluccius capensis, in the northern Benguela Current. It is also an important prey item for a number of predatory fish species sharks and marine mammals and may make up the majority of their diet. ==Fisheries== The Angolan flying squid is not directly targeted by fisheries but it is infrequently caught as bycatch in fisheries pursuing other species. ==Taxonomic note== There is uncertainty in the distribution of the Angolan flying squid as there is some confusion over its true taxonomic position which has confused its separation from the Antarctic flying squid. This has led to some authorities describing it as circum global in the southern oceans but others in saying that it is restricted to the waters off Southern Africa. ==References== Category:Squid Category:Molluscs described in 1962 ","title":"Angolan flying squid"},{"id":"56817574","text":"Erna Mirzoyan ( born in 1998), better known by her stage name Erna Mir, is an Armenian singer.

It is also included into stylized folklore choreography and performed at competitions worldwide by folk dance groups from Montenegro and Serbia. == Video == * Oro sample — folk dance Oro by ensemble “Budo Tomovic” (Montenegro). ==References== Category:Montenegrin dances Category:Montenegrin music Category:Montenegrin culture Category:Serbian music Category:Serbian culture ","title":"Oro (eagle dance)"},{"id":"56817587","text":"Event marketing is the experiential marketing of a brand, service, or product through memorable experiences or promotional events. It typically involves direct interaction with a brand's representatives. It should not be confused with event management, which is a process of organizing, promoting and conducting events. Trade shows are an example of event marketing. == Overview == Event marketing is considered to be a part of experiential marketing and content marketing. Experiential marketing follows the process of corporate storytelling, and aims to further engage the audience. Experiential follows a simple formula of combining a brand's message and interactive components. This mode of marketing places the target audience in a live environment that will encourage the desired outcome. Event marketing mostly relies on emotions and the activity of the human brain. Event marketing uses emotions and is based on the fact that people remember what they are experiencing. Emotional stimulus significantly affects the image of the offered service or product. Psychologists proved that while stimulated by emotions, the brain remembers certain facts and pieces of information better. Experiencing something makes it more memorable. In this condition, it is more likely that the brand will stay in the receiver's mind and create a long-lasting image. In a thesis for the International Business and Economics Programme at the Luleå University of Technology, Jessica Eriksson and Anna Hjälmsson wrote: Event marketing can also function purely as a business-to-business (B2B) opportunity, whereby experiential emotions are not a factor in the event, but rather, the event serves as an opportunity to make business contacts and network with customers. == Event marketing worldwide == The term \\"event marketing\\" became an important part of study in German, American, British, and Canadian markets. Event marketing had been considered equal to the promotion of an event in order to increase the sales of the tickets and was forgotten as a form of marketing. This conception changed with excessive studies in the late-20th and early-21st century. Philip Kotler's Marketing, which was published at the beginning of the century, is regarded as the first step to a clear definition of the term. It was later followed by a Danish publication Events as a strategic marketing tool written by Dorothe Gerritsen and Ronald van Olderen. Event marketing became recognized as a marketing tool, especially in Poland when it was introduced in the early 2000s. (Jaworowicz P., Jaworowicz M., Event marketing w Zintegrowanej Komunikacji Marketingowej, Warszawa 2016.) Polish academics mostly relied on Western studies and managed to build up the whole concept. According to The US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the event industry will grow by 44% from 2010 to 2020. A plurality of marketers (31%) believe event marketing to be the single-most effective marketing channel, with 27% voting on Content Marketing, and 25% on Email Marketing. HubSpot has listed 11 experiential marketing campaigns from worldwide renowned brands like Facebook, Google, Zappos, and Guinness, who have hosted or created events as an innovative way of advertising a product. Each of them was successful and attracted thousands of new customers. Marketing Insider Group has also listed 5 event marketing examples that are still being talked about. Among them, The Kia Dream Chute is mentioned as one of the best ideas. All of those events are considered one of the best marketing campaigns in the world. A study made by Jack Morton Worldwide shows that 11 out of 14 consumers prefer to get to know new products or services by experiencing them personally. Moreover, 74% of consumers say that connecting with branded event marketing experiences is making them more likely to buy the products which are being promoted, according to research done by The Event Marketing Institute and Mosaic. == Event marketing strategy == Event marketing strategy is a tailor-made plan to promote a brand/product with events as an advertising tool. This includes an in-depth analysis of plans for the brand's presence at events. In order to measure the success of event marketing, the brand impact has to be verified. Based on an analysis made by the Advertising Research Foundation (ARF) in March 2006, engagement is \\"turning on a prospect to a brand idea enhanced by the surrounding context\\". There was also a function created to show the impact on a brand: Engagement + Trust x Targeted Group = Brand Impact. == Notes  References  Further reading == * Jaworowicz P., Jaworowicz M., Event marketing w Zintegrowanej Komunikacji Marketingowej, Warszawa 2016. * Event Marketing jako nowa forma organizacji procesów komunikacyjnych, pod red.

He was an officer in the British Army. McInnis was first commissioned into the British army on 29 April 1874. He became a Major in the army on 30 March 1887. He was appointed honorary lieutenant-colonel on 23 April 1887. He was appointed to the 9th Lancers in India in 1875. Lt. Colonel McInnis succeeded Captain Bryden as the head of policing in the Gold Coast. He served in this capacity for four years. He was the last British officer to serve in this capacity. Following his appointment, the police force was placed directly under the control of the Governor Sir William Brandford Griffith until the Colonial government started appointing Commissioners of Police in 1893. He was awarded the Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1890 New Year Honours list by Queen Victoria while he was the Inspector General of Constabulary in the then Gold Coast colony.

The aircraft, a 76-seat Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 operated by US-Bangla Airlines, burst into flames after the crash, and the 20 surviving passengers were seriously injured from the impact and the fire. At the time of the accident, it was the deadliest aviation disaster involving a Bangladeshi airline, and the deadliest incident involving the Bombardier Dash 8 Q400. A commission appointed by the Government of Nepal investigated the accident and issued a report that concluded that the probable cause of the crash was pilot disorientation and a loss of situational awareness on the part of the flight crew. The report was criticized by the airline and by the Bangladeshi representative to the commission, who felt that the air traffic controllers at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu had not done their job properly and could have prevented the accident. == Accident == The aircraft, operating as flight number BS-211, departed Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka, Bangladesh, at 06:51 UTC (12:51p.m. Bangladesh Standard Time) bound for Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, Nepal. BS-211 was a regularly scheduled flight that operated four times a week between the two cities. At 08:10 UTC, the first officer contacted Kathmandu Approach, who told the flight to descend to 13,500 feet and enter a holding pattern at a specified navigational waypoint. Long approach delays were common at Kathmandu due to a lack of airport capacity and high volumes of traffic into and out of the airport, so the instruction to enter a holding pattern was not unusual. Since they were slightly ahead of schedule, the pilots expected the delay to last several minutes, so they discussed the navigational elements of the holding pattern, and configured the flight management system in preparation. However, before the aircraft had arrived at the holding point, the approach controller instead cleared the flight to descend and proceed directly to the approach for runway 02. The pilots did not reconfigure the flight management system for the approach, so when the aircraft arrived at the next waypoint, the autopilot began a left-hand turn of the aircraft as it had been configured for the holding pattern. The pilot realized that the plane was turning away from the intended course, and quickly changed the aircraft heading selector to a course that would intercept the correct approach, and manually selected a rate of descent. Those manual inputs disengaged the flight management system that automatically controlled the course and the rate of descent. The crew performed the landing checklist, with the pilot erroneously stating that the landing gear was down and locked. Because the flight management system was disengaged, the pilots had to manually adjust the aircraft's rate of descent, and failed to select a rate that kept the aircraft at its intended altitude throughout the planned descent. The first officer repeatedly called out that they were 500ft to 600ft too high on their approach altitude. Meanwhile, a gear unsafe alert tone sounded continuously in the cockpit, unacknowledged by the pilots. With their attention focused on trying to adjust to the correct altitude, and distracted by audible warnings, the crew failed to notice that the plane was still off course, and had by this time flown to the right of the desired approach path, descending at rates as high as 1,700 feet per minute. Audible warnings of \\"MINIMUM\\", \\"SINK RATE\\", \\"TERRAIN\\", and \\"TOO LOW-GEAR\\" sounded, adding to the confusion. The first officer noticed that the landing gear was not down and lowered it, but by this time the aircraft had already passed the runway and neither pilot was aware of it. The tower contacted the flight crew and informed them that they had been cleared to land on runway 02, but they appeared to be heading to runway 20, the opposite end of the single runway, and asked the pilot's intention. Still unaware that they had already passed the runway, the pilot responded that he intended to land on runway 02. Seeing high terrain ahead of them, the pilot performed a sharp right-hand turn, during which the aircraft descended to as low as 175 feet above the ground, and reached bank angles of up to 35 to 40 degrees. This triggered additional alerts and alarms of \\"PULL UP\\", \\"TERRAIN\\", and \\"BANK ANGLE\\" in the cockpit. After flying to the west without spotting the runway, the pilot calmly admitted to the first officer that he had made a mistake and had become distracted by talking to her, and performed another steep right hand turn, with bank angles as high as 45 degrees and descent rates of over 2,000 feet per minute. Eventually, with air traffic controllers on the radio still trying to clarify where the aircraft was going and the plane flying in a southeasterly direction, the first officer spotted runway 20 at the aircraft's 3 o'clock position, approximately away, and the pilot made a sharp and abrupt right turn back to the west in an attempt to return to the approach end of the runway. The aircraft overflew the end of runway 20 on a heading of 255 degrees, 450 feet above the ground, turning left with a bank angle of 40 degrees. Alarmed by the actions of the aircraft, the air traffic controller hastily cancelled the flight's landing clearance, erroneously calling out \\"takeoff clearance cancelled\\". The aircraft flew over the airport's domestic passenger terminal less than 50 feet over the roof, and controllers in the tower ducked down out of fear. The aircraft made another sharp turn in an attempt to line up with the runway before touching down at an angle 1700 meters along the runway with its right main landing gear. The aircraft skidded off the runway, slid for 300 meters, crashed through a fence on the edge of the airport, came to a stop in a football field, and burst into flames. == Aircraft == The aircraft was a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400, configured with a seating capacity of 76 passengers, and registered as aircraft S2-AGU. It was first delivered to Scandinavian Airlines in 2001, and flown by three airlines before being purchased by US-Bangla Airlines in 2014. It had already been involved in a minor incident in 2015, when it skidded off the runway in Saidpur resulting in minor damage to its right-hand main wheels. At the time of the crash, the aircraft had flown a total of 28,649 takeoff cycles for a total of 21,419 hours and was current on its maintenance. The impact forces of the crash and the post-crash fire completely destroyed the aircraft. == Passengers and crew == The aircraft was carrying 65 adult passengers, 2 children, and 4 crew members, for a total of 71 on board. Of the passengers, 33 were from Nepal, 32 were from Bangladesh, 1 was from China, and 1 was from the Maldives. All of the crew were from Bangladesh. There were 51 passengers and crew members killed in the accident; 22 from Nepal, 28 from Bangladesh, and 1 from China. Most of the Nepalis killed in the crash were medical students who were returning home during a break from school. There were 20 passengers who survived with serious injuries. The captain of the flight was 52-year-old Abid Sultan, a former Bangladesh Air Force pilot. Sultan had 22 years of flying experience, with more than 5,500 hours of flight time, and more than 1,700 hours of experience flying the Q400. He had worked for US- Bangla since 2015 and was also an instructor for the airline. He was experienced with the flight to Kathmandu, having flown it more than 100 times, He had resigned from the airline before the flight, but as part of the airline's code of conduct, he was required to continue working until he had been discharged. He suffered multiple blunt force trauma to his head and chest, initially surviving the crash, but he died of his injuries the next day. The first officer was 25-year-old Prithula Rashid, the first female pilot of the airline. She joined the airline in July 2016 and had a total of 390 hours of flight experience, 240 hours in the aircraft type. This was her first time flying into Kathmandu. She died of her injuries, described as blunt force injury to her head. The two cabin crew members, Khwaza Hossain Mohammad Shafi and Shamim Akter, died after the crash. ==Aftermath== The plane was engulfed in flames within seconds of the plane's initial touchdown, and airport personnel immediately dispatched emergency equipment. Fire trucks arrived within two minutes and firefighters had to put out a grass fire in their path before they could reach the aircraft. The fire at the crashed aircraft took 15 minutes to extinguish. The airport was closed for three hours after the crash, and incoming flights were diverted to other airports. As of March 2019, one year after the crash, the wreckage of the aircraft was still beside the runway at the airport. There were 22 passengers who survived the impact and subsequent fire; they were sent to local hospitals. Two of those survivors later died of their injuries. Survivability was the highest on the right side or near the front of the aircraft, as passengers on the left side were most likely directly killed by impact forces, but the rapidly spreading fire after the crash limited options for escape for the passengers who survived the initial impact. Many of the crash victims were burned beyond recognition, and required DNA tests to identify their remains. At the time of the accident, it was the deadliest aviation disaster involving a Bangladeshi airline, and the deadliest accident involving the Bombardier Dash 8 Q400. In the following days, Nepali Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli visited the crash site and announced that an investigation into the cause of the crash was underway. Imran Asif, chief executive officer of US-Bangla Airlines, told reporters that the company's early opinion was that the crash was caused by air traffic controllers at the airport misleading the pilots, causing them to attempt to land on the wrong runway. He said that he doubted that there was any negligence on the part of the pilots. Nepal Army Lt Col Puran Ghale, who was among the first rescuers to arrive at the aircraft after the crash, complained that aircraft engineers were slow to arrive at the crash site, which hindered the rescue efforts. A spokesman for the airline insisted that the governments of both Bangladesh and Nepal cooperate in the investigation in order to \\"launch a fair investigation and find the reason behind the accident.\\" Responding to early reports, the airline denied that the doomed flight was the first officer's maiden flight into Kathmandu. In later statements, the airline said that it would cover the hospital expenses of injured survivors and pay US$25,000 to the relatives of each of the passengers who died. Two days after the accident, US-Bangla Airlines suspended all service to Kathmandu for an indefinite period. The airline applied for resumption of its Kathmandu operation, in September 2018, intending to resume flights on 28 October, but a source inside the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal said it was \\"highly unlikely\\" that approval would be granted due to the many critical statements about the operation of the airport that executives from the airline had made after the accident. Shortly after the accident, a local news agency published a video taken by Kathmandu residents showing the plane flying very low in the vicinity of the airport. In early 2019, a second video surfaced on social media sites that showed CCTV footage from the airport. The second video showed the aircraft narrowly missing buildings and parked airplanes at the airport, and the last moments of the flight. ==Investigation== After the crash, the Government of Nepal formed an Aircraft Accident Investigation Commission to determine the cause and the circumstances of the accident. The six-member commission was also assisted by Captain Salahuddin Rahmatullah, the head of the Aircraft Accident Investigation Group of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh, and Nora Vallée, senior investigator for the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, where the aircraft was manufactured. The commission released a preliminary report on 9 April 2018. The report was a brief synopsis of the accident and stated that the aircraft had touched down 1,700 meters down runway 20 heading southwest before going off the runway. It said the cockpit voice and flight data recorders had been recovered and had been sent to the Transportation Safety Board of Canada for analysis along with other aircraft components. On 27 August 2018, Nepal's Kathmandu Post newspaper reported that a source had leaked details from the still ongoing official investigation. The source said that the commission was planning to assign blame for the crash on Captain Abid Sultan, and said that he was smoking continuously in the cockpit, lied to the control tower during the landing, and engaged in erratic behavior. The airline and the Bangladeshi representative to the commission dismissed the newspaper report as \\"baseless\\", stating that the story was filled with false information, designed to make the airline and its employees look bad. The final investigation report released on 27 January 2019 concluded that pilot disorientation and a lack of situation awareness led to the crash. The report also shows that Sultan made multiple abusive statements toward a young female pilot who he had trained, and who had questioned his reputation as an instructor. Their relationship was a major topic of discussion throughout the flight. He also spoke of a rumor that he and the trainee pilot had engaged in an extramarital affair, which had forced him to resign from the company. When telling this, he cried and wondered aloud where he would be able to find another job and stated that he had been so worried that he had not slept the previous night. Records show that Rashid, the co-pilot, who was on her first flight to Kathmandu and showed interest to learn at every stage of the flight, was a passive listener to Sultan's story throughout the flight. The sole Bangladeshi representative on the investigative panel was publicly critical of the final report, saying that it left out the fact that air traffic controllers at the airport did not execute their duties properly. He said that the controllers could have provided navigational assistance to the pilots once it became apparent that they were disoriented, but they did not. He said that if the controllers had done so, the accident could have been averted. ==See Also== * Footage of crash: == References == Category:2018 in Nepal Category:21st century in Kathmandu Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Bombardier Dash 8 Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Nepal Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 2018 Category:March 2018 events in Asia ","title":"US-Bangla Airlines Flight 211"},{"id":"56818063","text":"John Oakman (c.1748–1793) was an English engraver and writer. ==Life== Oakman was born in Hendon about 1748, and was educated at a grammar school.

The tournament was held on 29 September 1923 at Weequahic Park in Newark, New Jersey. == Background == After the initial Women's World Games in 1922 in Paris and the three Women's Olympiads (1921 Women's Olympiad, 1922 Women's Olympiad and 1923 Women's World Games) in Monaco, interest in women's sports grew internationally. In 1922, the Women's Amateur Athletic Association (WAAA) was founded in the United Kingdom. The WAAA organised the first official British women's championships in track and field (WAAA Championships) on 18 August 1923 at the Oxo Sports Ground in Downham outside London. In the United States, the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) was founded in 1888, and held its first national championship for women in the sport of swimming in 1916. In 1922, try-outs for the 1922 Women's World Games were held on 13 May at Oaksmere School in Mamaroneck, New York. Some historians consider this event to be the first \\"national\\" women's track meet. In 1923, the AAU sponsored the first official American women's championships in track and field. == Events == The meet was held on 29 September 1922 at Weequahic Park in Newark, New Jersey. Female athletes for the 1922 games also trained at Weequahic Park. The athletes competed in 11 events: running 50 yards, 100 yards, relay race 4x110 yards, hurdling 60 yards, high jump, long jump, discus throw, shot put, javelin, baseball throw (softball throw) and basketball throw.

During the party, Sylvia and Gus are attacked and murdered in an outlying barn by a hulking, monstrous killer—Sylvia is hanged with a rope, while Gus has his arm torn off. The next morning, Dean announces that he and Cheri are leaving, as he is suspicious of the \\"free weekend\\" letters they received. While the remaining others go for a hike, Ken and Julie remain at the main house. Ken goes to search for Kane, the Native American groundskeeper, to inquire about Matthew's death; meanwhile Julie finds Gus and Sylvia's bodies. She frantically phones the local sheriff, Elmer Goodes, but the phone disconnects, and she is killed outside. Meanwhile, while Tak and Shawn are hunting, Tak recounts Matthew's death: He explains how, two years ago, some of the group teased Matthew for allegedly being gay. Matthew entered the barn, where his body spontaneously combusted, after which he fled into the woods, engulfed in flames. His body was never recovered. Back at the house, Ken returns and is unable to find Julie, but finds Kane in the barn, who threatens him with a shotgun. Ken flees, but gets caught on a bear trap in the woods before having his throat slashed by the killer. Jennifer and Laura return from hiking, and Laura begins cutting herself in the bathroom before taking a shower. Jennifer is trapped in the icehouse by the killer, while, Nicole, Jeff, Gerome, and Nancy go to the camp sauna. As Nancy and Jeff have sex outside the sauna, the killer impales them with a pole before bludgeoning Nancy with a hammer, and Jerome with hot stones. Kane finds Shawn and Tak in the woods, and implores them to leave; he explains that his grandfather, a medicine man, cursed the land after it was taken over by Anglo settlers, and that mysterious deaths have since occurred there, particularly in the barn. Shawn and Tak are subsequently confronted by the killer in the woods, and flee back to the main house. Tak frees Jennifer from the icehouse, but is murdered by the killer. Jennifer manages to escape toward the barn. Meanwhile, as Sheriff Goodes drives toward the camp to investigate the call he received, he finds Dean and Cheri walking along a road; they explain that their car broke down. Goodes drives them back, and begins searching the property. Upon finding the bodies at the sauna, Goodes is decapitated. Back at the house, Dean searches for the others outside, armed with a rifle, but is confronted by the killer, who summons a bolt of lightning which electrocutes him to death. The killer subsequently impales Cheri on mounted deer antlers inside the house. Outside the barn, Shawn witnesses Kane strangling Laura, and shoots him. After, Laura smiles and confesses that she orchestrated the reunion of the group to punish them for what they did to Matthew. Suddenly, a decayed and burned Matthew appears. Shawn attempts to kill him, but is unable to, and Matthew stabs Shawn to death with a pitchfork. Jennifer, who has observed the attack through the barn window, screams in horror. Kane knocks over several gasoline-filled barrels inside the barn before lighting a match, blowing up the barn with himself, Laura, and Matthew inside. Jennifer, the lone survivor, escapes in the sheriff's car. As Jennifer drives away, the flames engulfing the barn vanish and it is restored to its original form. ==CastProduction== The screenplay for Twisted Nightmare was copyrighted under its working title, Ancient Evil, on July 1, 1987. The film's opening titles erroneously date the copyright as 1982; this contradicts the 1987 copyright at the film's end credits, as well as a March 6, 1987 listing in Variety. The film was shot by writer-director Paul Hunt and cinematographer Gary Graver, who had previously worked as a cinematographer for Orson Welles on The Other Side of the Wind. ==Release== Twisted Nightmare was released regionally in the United States on May 20, 1988, and later premiered in New York City on September 14, 1988, and in Los Angeles on November 4, 1988. ===Home media=== The film was released on VHS on March 29, 1989. It premiered on Blu-ray in May 2017 by Code Red. ==Critical reception== Upon the film's Los Angeles premiere, Chris Willman of the Los Angeles Times called the film \\"an absolutely bottom-of-the-barrel spookfest about a killer and some evil Indian spirits terrorizing fornicating young folks at a summer camp. Surely there's a more intriguing story behind how this sleepy slimeball of a horror film ever earned a theatrical release than there is in the senseless plot line itself.\\" ==References* * Category:1987 films Category:1987 horror films Category:1980s serial killer films Category:1980s horror thriller films Category:American films Category:American slasher films Category:Films about Native Americans Category:LGBT-related horror films Category:Films about summer camps Category:Supernatural slasher films ","title":"Twisted Nightmare"},{"id":"56818128","text":"Kottayam Diocese is one of the 30 dioceses of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church.

The Master-General of the Ordnance was responsible for the central administration of the artillery, the procurement and care of the army's weapons and ammunition, and for the land defence' (lantförsvaret) stock supplies, the so-called Ordnance Storage (Tygförrådet). Earlier, he was called Riksfälttygsmästare. Between 1782 and 1865, the Master-General of the Ordnance was the head of the Ordnance Department of the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration, with, among others, the Deputy Chief of Ordnance and two Tygmästare (\\"Master of the Ordnance\\") of regimental officers or captain's rank, as subordinates. The Master-General of the Ordnance was head of the artillery until 1898. That year a change was carried out through which the artillery regiments and corps were placed under the command of the commander of each army division, while the Master-General of the Ordnance retained the command over the Artillery Staff and the artillery workshops and ordnance staff. However, he still had the obligation to inspect the artillery's exercises, and his complete title was therefore the Master-General of the Ordnance and Inspector of Artillery. He also served as head of the Artillery Department of the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration. As Inspector, he was responsible for the artillery in the same way as the Inspectors of the Infantry and the Cavalry, and also commanded and supervised the Swedish Army Artillery School (Artilleriets skjutskola, ArtSS). As Master-General of the Ordnance, it was imperative for him to pay constant attention to the improvement of firearms with associated ammunition and equipment, and for that purpose at the King's request to employ or attempt to arrange for them. Furthermore, he would submit to the King for review and establishing proposals for new or changed weapon designs and more. Finally, he would oversee operations at artillery factories and ordnance establishments and oversee manufacturing of weapons, ammunition and artillery equipment for the needs of the army. To his assistant, the Master-General of the Ordnance and the Inspector of Artillery in the latter capacity had at his disposal certain personnel from the Artillery Staff. This personnel, which together formed the Artillery Inspectorate (Artilleriinspektionen), was made up partly of the head of the Artillery Staff, who also served as commander of the Swedish Army Artillery School, and partly of the chief of staff of the Artillery Inspectorate, a major of the Artillery Staff, with the subordinate Equipment Department and the Inspector's Office Department. The personnel in the departments consisted of Artillery Staff officers and commissioned officers. In 1936, the Master-General of the Ordnance's role as Inspector of Artillery ceased and in 1937 he became the head of the Swedish Army Ordnance Corps. In 1968 the post was eliminated. ==Masters-General of the Ordnance== *1682–1692: Per Larsson Sparre *1692–1693: Erik Dahlbergh *1693–1710: Johan Siöblad *1710–1712: Vacant *1712–1715: Reinhold Johan von Fersen *1715–1719: Henning Rudolf Horn af Rantzien *1719–1724: Hugo Hamilton Hamilton af Hageby *1724–1728: Vacant *1728–1740: Fredrik Magnus Cronberg *1741–1754: Per Siöblad *1754–1757: Vacant *1757–1759: Thomas Cunninghame *1759–1761: Carl Ehrensvärd (acting) *1761–1765: Carl Funck (acting) *1766–1772: Anders Reinhold Wrangel *1772–1781: Reinhold Anrep *1781–1784: Gabriel von Spången (acting) *1784–1791: Carl Gideon Sinclair *1791–1800: Carl Ulrik Silfverschiöld *1800–1803: Nils Fredrik Ehrenström *1803–1807: Vacant *1807–1815: Carl von Helvig *1816–1821: Carl von Cardell *1821–1844: Crown Prince Oscar *1828–1834: Claes Josef Breitholtz *1844–1849: Axel Gustaf von Arbin *1849–1857: Crown Prince Charles *1857–1867: Fabian Wrede af Elimä *1867–1872: Carl Henrik Hägerflycht (acting) *1872–1874: Carl Henrik Hägerflycht *1874–1890: Carl Leijonhufvud *1890–1898: Edvard Julius Breitholtz *1898–1902: John Hamilton *1902–1903: Gottschalk Geijer *1903–1915: Fredrik Johan Leth *1915–1919: David Hedengren *1919–1929: Lars Sparre *1929–1934: Ludvig Hammarskiöld *1934–1939: Oscar Osterman *1939–1949: Halvar Gustafsson *1949–1959: Birger Hedqvist *1959–1964: Edward Malm *1964–1966: Sten Wåhlin *1966–1968: Ove Ljung ==See also== *Deputy Chief of Ordnance ==FootnotesReferences== Category:Military appointments of Sweden ","title":"Master-General of the Ordnance (Sweden)"},{"id":"56818275","text":"Chinese traditional music includes various music genres which have been inherited for generations in China.

Inspired by the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago, it was designed to demonstrate how far Nordic women had advanced in the areas of education, employment and art. The first of its kind in Europe, it was considered a great success. ==Background== Old and new kitchen exhibit The Chicago World's Fair in 1893 had impressed Danish visitors with its Woman's Building containing presentations of art and literature. Sophie Oxholm (1848–1935), who had visited the exhibition, was obviously impressed by the exhibition, especially the show of Danish needlework. On her return to Denmark, she immediately brought a number of influential women together with a view to arranging a Nordic women's exhibition in Copenhagen the following year. Despite initial enthusiasm, as a result of budgetary and management problems, it was announced in February 1894 that the exhibition would not be held until 1895. Oxholm, who experienced difficulty in managing the arrangements, gave up her position as head of the coordinating committee in early 1895. She was replaced by Bertha Buch of the Women's Society but it was Emma Gad (1852–1921) who proved to be the most effective member. Appointed deputy chair, Gad managed to complete all the arrangements on time. These included selecting the site of the exhibition which was ultimately shared between the Industrial Association building (Industriforeningen), which had been built in connection with the 1872 Nordic Exhibition, and the premises of Den Frie Udstilling. It was therefore possible for the exhibition to open on 22 June 1895 in the presence of Queen Louise. ==Exhibition== The Greenland exhibit In addition to exhibits from Denmark, the exhibition contained areas specifically dedicated to the Danish provinces and overseas territories (Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland and Danish West Indies) as well as to Norway and Sweden. There are records of the 2,415 exhibits covering painting, curiosities (including items associated with celebrated women), arts and crafts, costumes, jewellery (including gold- and silverware), literature (manuscripts, journals and books) and appliances. There were also separate listings of exhibits relating to housekeeping, philanthropy, hygiene, education, household crafts (spinning and weaving, leather, wood, embroidery, silk painting, and whitework), music and art. For the Den Frie Udstilling building, there was a separate inventory of 301 artworks, paintings and sculptures, listed by artist. ==Key organizers== The two women who were instrumental in organizing the exhibition were Sophie Oxholm and, above all, Emma Gad. ==Outcome== The Women's Exhibition was a great success. Not only was it appreciated in Denmark and beyond, it made a substantial profit. Gad had hoped the money could be used for an independent \\"Women's Building\\" (Kvindernes Bygning) with a meeting room, reading room, restaurant and accommodation for women from the provinces. Work did not begin on the building until 1929. It was completed in 1937. ==Exhibitors== Works by the following artists were included in the Women's Exhibition: === Sculptors === * Elna Borch * Henriette Diderichsen * Agnes Lunn (also painter) * Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen * Johanne Pedersen-Dan * Nielsine Petersen * Adelgunde Vogt (posthumous) === Composers === * Johanne Amalie Fenger * Nanna Liebmann * Elisabeth Meyer * Tekla Griebel Wandall === Painters === * Anna Ancher * Marie Bang * Ville Bang * Brita Barnekow * Louise Bonfils * Alfrida Baadsgaard * Clara Carl * Anthonore Christensen * Augusta Dohlmann * Charlotte Frimodt * Johanne Frimodt * Henriette Hahn-Brinckmann * Ane Marie Hansen * Marie Henriques * Sophie Holten * Susette Holten * Elise Konstantin-Hansen * Johanne Cathrine Krebs * Birgitte Levison * Agnes Lunn (also sculptor) * Marie Luplau * Augusta Læssøe * Emma Løffler * Emma Meyer * Jenny Meyer * Emilie Mundt * Bertha Nathanielsen * Dagmar Olrik * Anna Petersen * Marie Preetzmann * Louise Ravn-Hansen * Holga Reinhard * Marie Sandholt * Charlotte Sannom * Laura Sarauw * Elisabeth Schiøtt * Ida Schiøttz- Jensen * Mimi Schwartzkopf * Anna Smidth * Olga Smith * Edma Stage * Emma Thomsen * Emmy Thornam * Ludovica Thornam * Elisabeth Tornøe * Nicoline Tuxen * Elisabeth Wandel * Bertha Wegmann  Posthumous  * Elisabeth Jerichau Baumann * Juliane Hammer (died shortly before the opening) * Eleonore Christine Harboe * Hanne Hellesen * Marie Knudsen * Julie Lütken * Christine Løvmand * Sophie Madsen * Hermania Neergaard * Bolette Puggaard * Georgia Skovgaard (two sketchbooks from Italian travels 1854-55 and eight embroideries) * Mariane Stub * Eleonora Tscherning ==References * Source Category:1895 in Denmark Category:Events in Copenhagen Category:Festivals established in 1895 Category:19th century in Copenhagen Category:Art exhibitions in Denmark Category:Women and the arts Category:National exhibitions Category:Danish women's history ","title":"1895 Copenhagen Women's Exhibition"},{"id":"56818454","text":"Wai Phyo Aung (; born 15 May 1985) is a Burmese politician and medical doctor who currently serves as a member of parliament in the House of Representatives for Thaketa Township constituency.

The series is a bake-off competition in the style of reality television, where three amateur bakers compete to replicate complicated cakes and confectionery in order to win a $10,000 cash prize and a \\"nailed it\\" trophy. A second season was released on June 29, 2018. A holiday season, dubbed Nailed It! Holiday!, was released on December 7, 2018. The third season was released on May 17, 2019. A second holiday season of Nailed It! Holiday! was released on November 22, 2019. The fourth season was released on April 1, 2020. The series has received critical acclaim and was nominated for three Primetime Emmy Awards, including twice for Outstanding Competition Program and once for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Competition Program. The later nomination made Nicole Byer the first black woman to be nominated for the award. ==Premise== Nailed It! was inspired by the craze of people trying and failing to make elaborate cakes they found on the Internet. Three amateur bakers with demonstrated poor baking skills attempt to re-create edible masterpieces for a $10,000 prize and the Nailed It! trophy. Competitors take part in two challenges over the course of the 35-minute episodes. The first challenge is called \\"Baker's Choice\\", where the contestants pick one of three existing confectionery treats and try to recreate it. The winner of this challenge gets a special prize and is allowed to wear a golden chef's hat. In the second challenge, \\"Nail It or Fail It\\", contestants have two hours to recreate a complicated cake from scratch. They each receive a \\"Panic Button\\" which allows them to get three minutes of assistance from one of the judges. The worst- performing baker from the first challenge gets a second button to distract the other bakers – the specific function varies depending on the episode, but normally involves Nicole annoying the bakers. The three judges decide on the winning cake based upon presentation and taste. The winner receives a trophy and the $10,000 prize. ==Cast== *Nicole Byer, host *Jacques Torres, host *Weston \\"Wes\\" Bahr, associate director ==Episodes== The winners of each episode are listed in bold. ===Season 1 (2018)=Season 2 (2018)=Nailed It!

In 2008 she was awarded the Pride of PNG award for her environmental contributions to the development of her country. As executive director of the not-for-profit organisation Tulele Peisa, she is responsible for organizing the relocation of the inhabitants of the Carteret Islands to the mainland of Bougainville Province. The islands are expected to be uninhabitable by 2040, rendering Rakova's people the world's first climate refugees. == Career == Rakova was born on the islet of Han in the Carteret Atoll. In 2005 she established a community schooling system in Bougainville as an alternative to the failed public school system. In 2006 she established Tulele Peisa to assist her people with relocation as the Carteret Islands were becoming increasingly exposed to sea level rise. The first settlement was established in Tinputz. Rakova has assisted in establishing several environmental NGO's in Papua New Guinea and Bougainville. She coordinated a landmark legal case whereby the Warangoi successfully sued illegal loggers and won compensation for their stolen forest resource. She established Bougainville Cocoa Net Limited to assist relocated Carteret Islanders with opportunities to produce fair trade cocoa. == References == Category:Living people Category:Papua New Guinean environmentalists Category:Women environmentalists Category:Papuan people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Ursula Rakova"},{"id":"56818546","text":"The Rowe House is a single-family home at 2360 Lone Tree Road, northwest of Milford, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. ==History== Squire W. Rowe was born in 1815 in Camillus, New York. After marrying his wife Dolly, he moved to Michigan in 1835 and purchased 40 acres and began farming. Squire Rowe was influential in the community, serving 21 terms as township supervisor. Squire and Dolly Rowe had the house built for them in 1855. Squire continued being active in the community, raising a company for the 13th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment in the Civil War and serving as a member of the state legislature in 1865. His ill health prevented more active service, and he died in 1866. The Rowe House remained in family hands until 1908. In 1953, Squire and Dolly's great-granddaughter Margaret Rowe Mastick and her husband Earl repurchased the property and restored the house. ==Description== The Rowe House is an elegant cut fieldstone Greek Revival house, with a two-story, gable-fronted, rectangular central section, and a one-and-one-half story wing on each side. The fieldstone is irregularly sized, contrasting with the flat, smooth stone quoins, sills and lintels, which project slightly for added contrast. Each wing is fronted with a single- story, two-bay width porch, supported by square Doric columns. The front of the central section contains four double-hung six-over-six sash windows with louvered wooden shutters. The boxed cornice and returns are decorated with delicate scrollwork. In the center of the building is a cobblestone chimney. Unusually for Michigan, a datestone reading \\"1855\\" is centrally placed, directly above the cut stone watertable. A carport was added to one wing early in the 20th century. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Oakland County, Michigan Category:Greek Revival architecture in Michigan Category:Houses completed in 1855 ","title":"Rowe House (Milford, Michigan)"},{"id":"56818558","text":"There were six special elections to the United States House of Representatives in 1991 during the 102nd United States Congress. == List of elections == Elections are listed by date and district. -   data-sort-value=\\"Conte, Silvio O.\\"  Silvio O.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. ==History== In 1836, Orrin Weston, a farmer, constructed the original portion of this inn as his personal residence. In 1841, Stephen Jennings purchased the house and converted it into a tavern. The building served as a stagecoach stop on what was then the Grand River Plank Road, connecting Detroit to Lansing and Grand Rapids. Jennings likely enlarged the house at this time, adding a rear ell and two bays onto the previously- extant structure. In 1860, Milton C. Botsford purchased the inn, renaming it the Botsford Tavern. The Tavern served as a popular meeting place for farmers, drovers, local residents and travelers. The Botsford family owned the inn until the 1920s. At that time, Grand River Avenue was being widened to create U.S. Route 16, and the inn was in danger of being razed. However, in 1924, Henry Ford purchased the Inn from the Botsford family and moved it back from its original site out of the way of the road widening project. Ford had attended gatherings at the inn when he was younger, and had courted his wife Clara there. Ford rehabilitated the structure, enlarging the ell and installing period woodwork. The Ford family continued to operate the Botsford Inn as a restaurant until 1951, when it was purchased by John Anhut. Anhut preserved the interior of the old inn much as the Fords left it, but the popularity of the inn led him to construct several new wings after 1960. In the mid-1960, a medical group purchased much of the property associated with the Inn, constructing Botsford Hospital. However, by the 1990s, economic pressures made it difficult to keep the inn open. In 1993, the Anhut family sold the Inn to Creon Smith. By 2000, the inn had closed its doors. In 2007, Botsford Hospital razed the 1960 wings of the Inn to make room for a new cancer center. The hospital restored the historic portions of the building, and the Inn is now part of the Botsford Hospital complex. ==Description== The Botsford Inn is a two-story, seven-bay, flank-gable-roofed, clapboarded structure with a two-story porch across the front. A long, six-bay ell extends to the rear on one side. The original 1836 building consists of the encompasses the five bays on the left-hand side, between the chimneys. The rightmost two bays were likely added in about 1841, at the same time that the front porch was constructed. An elaborate Federal style doorway with sidelights opens on the first story, with a less elaborate doorway directly above. The interior has much of the original simple trim, including horizontal board wainscoting, plain millwork window and door casings, and several Federal style mantels as well as some wide-board floors. During the 1924 renovation, some excellent reproduction woodwork was installed. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:National Register of Historic Places in Oakland County, Michigan Category:Federal architecture in Michigan Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1836 ","title":"Botsford Inn"},{"id":"56818964","text":"Thomas Armbrüster (born 1968 in Bremen) is a German economist and college professor. == Life == After completing his Abitur Armbrüster joined the German Bundeswehr as regular soldier.

Widely considered one of the founding members of the self-organized group of young painters known as the No Name Group, he continues to create abstract art even now. == Early life == Born in Beijing, China, in 1952 into a wealthy family, Zhang Wei grew up in the old style courtyard home of his paternal grandfather—a successful businessman—with his mother and siblings. During The Cultural Revolution the Red Guard destroyed the courtyard. His grandmother was beaten to death and her possessions burned. Zhang's father died in prison in 1968. In the same year, he was forced to go to the Xiangluo production bridge located in the Shanxi province in order to become an \\"educated youth\\" at the age of sixteen. Due to work-related injuries, Zhang was sent back to Beijing for further treatment in 1971 and began to learn to paint on his own.Exhibition catalogue, Zhang Wei: The Abstract Paintings, Boers-Li Gallery. == Career  1973–1986 === After returning to Beijing, he had met artists Ma Kelu, Waihai, Zheng Ziyan, Shi Xixi in 1973; also became acquainted later with Zhao Wenliang, Yang Yushu, and Shi Zhenyu. Together they formed an artist group known as the Yu Yuan Tan School of Painting. They would gather in different parks in Beijing painting en plein air. In December 1974, these artists held a quasi-underground exhibition Eleven Artists at Zhang Wei's house, establishing the foundation for the No Name Group. Throughout the entire 1970s, Zhang Wei painted from life – mostly landscape and still life. In the early 1980s, he became one of the very few young artists in Beijing who made the earliest attempt at abstract painting. In May 1986, Zhang Wei and friends organized the Graffiti Exhibition which one closed down by the police before it had a chance to open due to the ‘transgressive’ nature of the exhibits.\\"Zhang Wei – Waling Boers Interview\\", The Abstract Art of Zhang Wei 1977 to the Present, Boers-Li Gallery This great disappointment urged active artists at the time to leave the country. Soon after Zhang Wei traveled to America to participate in Avant- Garde Chinese Art, an exhibition organized by Michael Murray from Vassar College. New York had since become his home for the next sixteen years to come. === New York period (1986–2005)=== Shortly after arriving in New York, Zhang Wei first started working with Caroline Hill gallery and subsequently Z Gallery, producing abstract art inspired by the street scenes of Manhattan. Their collaboration ended in 1992. He moved to The West Village, making a living not by painting but by working an assortment of odd jobs. In the later years of Zhang Wei's New York days, he was active in fighting for the right for artists to sell their art on the streets. He participated in multiple protests, including the famous demonstration for the freedom of speech at the Metropolitan Museum in 1997. Zhang and his friends fought their ‘first amendment right’ fervently up to the Supreme Court, where in 2003 their art was recognized as a protected form of free speech, a precedent that still has validity today. === Returning to Beijing === Zhang Wei returned to Beijing in September 2005 and continued to be engaged in abstract painting. He picked up his work where he had left it twenty years earlier, combining abstract painting with found objects in an assemblage style. Zhang's first complete retrospective showcasing his abstract paintings from 1979 to 2012 took place at Boers-Li Gallery in Beijing in 2012, initiating a trend of rediscovering the dawn of Chinese contemporary art. == Recent projects == In the beginning of 2018, he has subsequently participated in 2 group exhibition at Boers-Li Gallery in Beijing and Galerie Max Hetzler in Berlin and will be one of the three artists of a Chinese abstract art group show at Boers-Li Gallery, New York. == Artistry == Zhang's oeuvre is described as pure executions of brushworks that created tension on canvas. Heavily influenced by his experience working at a Peking opera a theater, his abstract vocabulary is characterized by a blast of vibrant colors reminiscent of the movements of actors in their flamboyant traditional costumes. Other various visual elements introduced into his practice over time include Daoism philosophy and the notion of Chinese calligraphy. == Important exhibitions and museum collections == Zhang's works have been the subject of important international exhibitions including M+ Sigg Collection: Four Decades of Chinese Contemporary Art at ArtisTree, Hong Kong (2016); Light before Dawn: Unofficial Chinese Art 1974–1985 at Asia Society, Hong Kong (2013); Blooming in the Shadows: Unofficial Chinese Art, 1974–1985 at China Institute Gallery, New York, USA (2011).

The Festival is remembered as the first public coming out of LGBT*IQA persons in BiH. It became the center of interest of Bosnian-Herzegovinian, regional and international public and media after the escalation of violence against Festival participants and journalists on the day of the opening. The Festival was closed for the public two days after its opening, due to counter-reactions of general public, political representatives and as the organizers, journalists and Festival participants had been physically attacked by Islamic religious extremists and nationalists. == About the Festival == Organization Q is the first organization for the promotion and protection of human rights of queer persons in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In September 2007 and in line with strategic plan of Organization Q, Organization Q and Sarajevski Otvoreni Centar jointly started planning the first Queer Sarajevo Festival dedicated to LGBTIQ community in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Couple of months after the preparations had started, Sarajevski Otvoreni Centar left the organizational committee, while Organization Q continued with preparatory work on the Festival. Queer Sarajevo Festival 2008 was about sharing the personal stories of lesbian, gay, transgender, intersex and queer persons in Bosnia and Herzegovina and everyday accounts of love, friendship, social justice struggle, discrimination, freedom, pride and victory. The Festival in itself challenges and questions heteronormative and patriarchal values, particularly those centered around the issues of identity, gender, sexuality and human rights. The goal of the Festival was to increase the visibility of queer culture, theory and movement and to establish the Festival as traditional event of visibility of LGBTIQ community in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Additionally, it was to open the public space for discussions related to queer issues in Bosnia and Herzegovina, LGBTIQ culture, identities and human rights. The opening night was to be on September 24, 2008 at the Academy of Fine Arts in Sarajevo and the Festival would run for five days. The program of the Festival consisted of exhibitions, performances, documentary movie screenings and round table discussions by participants from Bosnia and Herzegovina, the region and wider. == Reactions  Threats prior to the Festival === Queer Sarajevo Festival was the first public LGBTIQ event that gained attention of the media, political leaders and general public of BiH. The organizers of Queer Sarajevo Festival were at the forefront receiving death threats during preliminary activities of the Festival. The organizers, including their supporters, media partners and journalists received death threats weeks before the opening. There were debates on the Festival and death threats online as well. Homophobic posters were widely distributed and put in prominent places across Sarajevo, calling for violence against the Festival participants and supporters, containing messages such as Death to faggots!. Similar posters were exhibited in other municipalities as well. Anti-Festival protests were announced at the Square of Alija Izetbegovic in Sarajevo, on the 24th of September 2008. Festival organizers had also received a threatening letter signed by the Union of war veterans of Sarajevo. Amnesty International had already called upon the authorities of BiH to ensure protection for Festival organizers and the Festival itself, on the 18th of September 2008. Organization Q documented all threats and handed over the material to the authorities, demanding the cases be processed. === Media coverage of the Festival === Staging Sarajevo Queer Festival during Ramadan month was used as an argument for different claims. It was said that such a festival was a direct attack on the religion of Islam, though it had been made clear that the Festival had no religious or anti-religious references and that it was a sole coincidence that the timing of the Festival overlaps with the month of Ramadan. Most notable print media using inflammatory rhetorics were Dnevni Avaz and SAFF. The cover page of the most read daily newspapers Dnevni Avaz, on the 28th of August 2008 featured a headline: \\"Who is trying to hoax Bosniaks with a gay gathering in Ramadan?\\" Some other headlines of Dnevni Avaz and SAFF were: \\"Gays in Sarajevo on Lejletu-l-kadr night!\\", \\"Dangerous fiddling with religious feelings of Bosniaks\\", \\"Homosexual Festival in holy Ramadan\\". Alongside the print media, a video was published on YouTube platform, portraying scenes of decapitation of one of the Festival organizers Svetlana Durkovic, positing a direct threat to organizers of Sarajevo Queer Festival. Calls for stoning, lynching and burning the Festival organizers and participants were published on online platforms. === Public reactions of political and religious leaders on the Festival === Among those who publicly propagated hatred against LGBTIQ persons were also the representatives of the official governing structured in BiH. Some of the politicians and religious leaders have made public statements that have contributed to spreading hatred and discrimination against LGBTIQ persons. Then Parliament member, Bakir Izetbegović has stated: I am not in the least pleased with the holding of the Queer Festival. This reminder of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of the 27th night [of Ramadan], a noble night which Muslims look forward to – I am not at all pleased by that\\". Izetbegović also said around the time of the Festival that, \\"They [LGBT people] have a right to their sexual orientation, or rather disorientation, but we will employ all moral means to fight the influence of homosexuality on youth... It’s something that will spread if you let it. It should be done between four walls... The statement of mufti Seid Smajkic was that: \\"Freedom should not be used for promotion of that Western trash\\". The statement of Municipality council of Stranka za BiH (The Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina) was: \\"Ramadan ambient was violated by Queer festival, especially in its final and the most meaningful part of the month when every man, relying on the tradition and the significance of the holy month, will not exert a real reaction.\\" Then member of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina Parliament, Amila Alikadić-Husović deemed it inappropriate that \\"something like that\\" was being held in the month of Ramadan, adding, \\"[h]omosexuality is condemned by every religion. Who are we to approve of something that God forbids?\\" == Attack on Festival participants == The opening night of the Festival was the 24th of September 2008, at the Academy of Fine Arts in Sarajevo with about 250 participants. Alongside police forces, Festival organizers hired a public security agency. On the day of the opening a group of about 70 wehabbis and hooligans gathered across Miljacka river bank on the street opposite of the Academy of Fine Arts and started shouting religious paroles and insults to Festival participants, such as: \\"Allahu Akbar! We will get you! Kill the faggots!\\". Police forces on site did not respond adequately and prevent that group in coming over to the entry point of the Festival premises. The attackers started throwing stones at the building of the Academy of Fine Arts and followed some of the participants upon their leaving the Festival. They followed them across the city of Sarajevo and physically assaulted them. Eight persons were injured that night: R.K., H.Ć., T.B., A.S., police officer Boban Vujičinović, journalists Peđa Kojović and Emir Imamović as well as a foreign citizen, Andrejs Viskochis. After the attack, Queer Sarajevo Festival continued with its planned activities on another location but without public gatherings and promotion. Festival organizers continued receiving threats. On September 25, 2008 Dnevni Avaz published the names of injured persons, followed by Oslobođenje and Nezavisne novine. On the same day a YouTube video was published portraying decapitation and death treats targeting Svetlana Đurković as one of the Festival organizers. After the third night of the Festival, the organizers stopped all further activities. Council of Europe, Amnesty International, embassies of France and USA have all issued press releases condemning the violence on Queer Sarajevo Festival. The presidency of BiH did not make any public statements on the threats targeting LGBTIQ population in relation to Queer Sarajevo Festival. However, Damir Arnaut, advisor on constitutional and legal affairs to Bosnian member of Presidency and then President Haris Silajdzic, declared his public support to Organization Q, stating that: \\"Politicians are violating the Constitution of BiH with their homophobic statements.\\" === Legal proceedings === In total 19 charges have been filed to Police Departments of Centar and Novo Sarajevo in the period between September 4 and October 3, 2008. According to the Official Gazette of BiH, in total three indictments have been made by the Prosecutor's Office. One indictee was sentenced to one year, while at the same time a ruling had been made that the sentence will enter into force if the indictee dos not commit another criminal offense in the following two years. Second indictee was acquitted of all charges, while the third indictee was sentenced to suspended 5-year jail sentence. Organization Q appealed to Constitutional court of BiH on the bases that authorities in charge failed to ensure adequate measures for protection of their rights guaranteed by the Constitutional court of BiH and European Convention for protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as well as inefficient investigation, i.e. identification and sanctioning of perpetrators. According to the Official Gazette of BiH, disciplinary proceedings have been initiated against four police officers on November 17, 2008, due to reasonable doubt of a serious breach of official duties. Disciplinary committee found them responsible for the breach and sanctions were stated, while Police committee granted their appeals and freed them from responsibility. Six years after the appeal was filed, the Constitutional Court of BiH on September 25, 2014, at the 88th plenary session, partially adopted the appeal of the Q Association for the Promotion and Protection of Culture, Identity and Human Rights of Queer persons: The Press Council in Bosnia and Herzegovina has received an appeal from Organization Q on 11 September 2008 related to the articles published in Dnevni avaz.

It was composed during the Tuvan People's Republic. It is often incorrectly listed as the Tuvan language version of \\"The Internationale\\" despite the two songs having almost nothing in common aside from similar names. With a different melody and different lyrics, the only similarity between the two songs is the fact that they are about a Workers' International. Even then, however, The Internationale is about the First International whereas the Tuvan Internationale is about the Third International. When the revolutions after the First World War came to a close, communists managed to gain power in only three countries: the Soviet Union, Tuva and Mongolia. After the Soviet Union was formed, it adopted The Internationale as its anthem. In honour of this, composers in Tuva and Mongolia created the Tuvan Internationale and Mongol Internationale. The Mongol Internationale later served as the national anthem of Mongolia from 1924 to 1950. The song was included on the Huun-Huur-Tu album \\"60 Horses In My Herd.

The sequence of carvings is as follow: large padma (inverted cyma recta), kusuma, vajana (\\"plank-edge\\" moulding), kandhara (necking), uttara (beam), urdhvapadma (upper cyma moulding), kapota (roll cornice) and pattika (plain band). Padma is not yet evolved into Kumbha (pot) visible in future Nagara class temples and kumuda are very large and not yet evolved in kalasha (urn). The square cella has plain walls crowned with an urdhvapadma with dog tongue carvings and a kapota. The shikhara superstructure has five tiers, each having chandrashala carvings in decreasing numbers from five to one. The last tier is flanked by half dormers. It is crowned by an amlasaraka (\\"corrugated wheel\\" just below the finial) and a kalasha which may be added later. There is no deity inside the cella. There are some idols placed inside now. The mandapa hall is closed from sides with plain walls. There is a window at the centre with a dandachadya (corrugated hood) and surasenaka (trefoil chaitya dormer) above it.

All three crew members and eight passengers on board were killed. ==History== Part of the wreckage of TC-TRB The aircraft, registered TC-TRB, departed from Sharjah International Airport, United Arab Emirates, at around 17:11 local time (13:11 UTC) bound for Istanbul Atatürk Airport. The flight crew consisted of two pilots and a cabin attendant. The Captain had flown for Turkish Airlines in the past, while the First Officer had a military aviation background and had been one of the first female pilots in the Turkish armed forces. The aircraft reached a cruising altitude of just over . At around 18:01 IRST local time (14:31 UTC), shortly before contact was lost, the crew reported technical problems and requested clearance from air traffic control to descend to a lower altitude. The jet began to climb before abruptly losing altitude, and at 18:09 hit the Zagros Mountains near Shahre Kord, some south of Tehran, Iran. All eleven occupants were killed. One witness reportedly saw the aircraft on fire before the crash. ==Victims== The jet was carrying a group of eight friends returning from a bachelorette party in Dubai. Among them was Mina Başaran, daughter of the head of Başaran Holding, Hüseyin Başaran, and member of the company's board of directors. ==Recovery operations== Search and rescue workers at the scene Local villagers saw a plume of smoke rising from the wreckage and were the first to arrive at the scene. Iranian search-and-rescue teams arrived afterward and found the burned bodies of ten victims. Bad weather conditions at the crash site made the operation difficult. One victim has yet to be found. The recovered bodies were transported to Tehran by helicopter. Turkey then sent emergency personnel via a military jet for assistance. Identification of the bodies required DNA testing. After identification by the Iranian authorities, the bodies of ten victims were flown to Istanbul by the Turkish military and then handed over to the victims' families. Iranian Legal Medicine Organization stated that the remains of the captain were not among the recovered bodies in the eleven body bags from the wreckage. ==Investigation== The aircraft's two flight recorders (the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder) were recovered for analysis. In September 2018, the Aircraft Accident Investigation Board of the Iranian civil aviation authority published a preliminary report indicating that, shortly before reaching cruise altitude, a discrepancy between the airspeed indications shown to the two pilots became apparent, with one indicating an overspeed condition. Engine power was reduced, and shortly after the stick- shaker activated. The aircraft subsequently stalled and entered a steep descent during which both engines flamed out. Control was not regained and the aircraft eventually struck a mountainside. ==References== Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Iran Category:March 2018 events in Iran Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 2018 Category:2018 in Iran ","title":"2018 Iran Bombardier Challenger crash"},{"id":"56819159","text":"Posthumanization comprises \\"those processes by which a society comes to include members other than 'natural' biological human beings who, in one way or another, contribute to the structures, dynamics, or meaning of the society.\\" Elsewhere (p. 35) in the same text Gladden proposes a longer definition, stating that \\"The processes of posthumanization are those dynamics by which a society comes to include members other than 'natural' biological human beings who, in one way or another, contribute to the structures, activities, or meaning of the society. In this way, a society comes to incorporate a diverse range of intelligent human, non-human, and para-human social actors who seek to perceive, interpret, and influence their shared environment and who create knowledge and meaning through their networks and interactions.\\" Posthumanization is one of the key phenomena studied by those academic disciplines and methodologies that identify themselves as \\"posthumanist\\", including critical, cultural, and philosophical posthumanism. Its processes can be divided into forms of non-technological and technological posthumanization.After referring (p. 3) to \\"the current technology-centred discussion about the potential transformation of humans into something else (a process that might be called 'posthumanization'),\\" Herbrechter offers an analysis of Lyotard's essay \\"A Postmodern Fable,\\" in which Herbrechter concludes (p. 7) that \\"What Lyotard's sequel to Nietzsche's fable shows is that, on the one hand, there is no point in denying the ongoing technologization of the human species, and, on the other hand, that a purely technology-centred idea of posthumanization is not enough to escape the humanist paradigm.\\" == Technological vs. non-technological posthumanization  Non-technological posthumanization === While posthumanization has links with the scholarly methodologies of posthumanism, it is a distinct phenomenon. The rise of explicit posthumanism as a scholarly approach is relatively recent, occurring since the late 1970s; however, some of the processes of posthumanization that it studies are ancient. For example, the dynamics of non-technological posthumanization have existed historically in all societies in which animals were incorporated into families as household pets or in which ghosts, monsters, angels, or semidivine heroes were considered to play some role in the world. Such non-technological posthumanization has been manifested not only in mythological and literary works but also in the construction of temples, cemeteries, zoos, or other physical structures that were considered to be inhabited or used by quasi- or para-human beings who were not natural, living, biological human beings but who nevertheless played some role within a given society, to the extent that, according to philosopher Francesca Ferrando: \\"the notion of spirituality dramatically broadens our understanding of the posthuman, allowing us to investigate not only technical technologies (robotics, cybernetics, biotechnology, nanotechnology, among others), but also, technologies of existence.\\" === Technological posthumanization === Some forms of technological posthumanization involve efforts to directly alter the social, psychological, or physical structures and behaviors of the human being through the development and application of technologies relating to genetic engineering or neurocybernetic augmentation; such forms of posthumanization are studied, e.g., by cyborg theory.The Cyborg Handbook (1995). Chris Hables Gray, editor. New York: Routledge. . Other forms of technological posthumanization indirectly \\"posthumanize\\" human society through the deployment of social robots or attempts to develop artificial general intelligences, sentient networks, or other entities that can collaborate and interact with human beings as members of posthumanized societies. The dynamics of technological posthumanization have long been an important element of science fiction; genres such as cyberpunk take them as a central focus. In recent decades, technological posthumanization has also become the subject of increasing attention by scholars and policymakers. The expanding and accelerating forces of technological posthumanization have generated diverse and conflicting responses, with some researchers viewing the processes of posthumanization as opening the door to a more meaningful and advanced transhumanist future for humanity, while other bioconservative critiques warn that such processes may lead to a fragmentation of human society, loss of meaning, and subjugation to the forces of technology. == Common features of technological and non-technological posthumanization == Processes of technological and non-technological posthumanization both tend to result in a partial \\"de-anthropocentrization\\" of human society, as its circle of membership is expanded to include other types of entities and the position of human beings is decentered. A common theme of posthumanist study is the way in which processes of posthumanization challenge or blur simple binaries, such as those of \\"human versus non-human\\", \\"natural versus artificial\\", \\"alive versus non-alive\\", and \\"biological versus mechanical\\".Ferrando, Francesca (2013). \\"Posthumanism, Transhumanism, Antihumanism, Metahumanism, and New Materialisms: Differences and Relations.\\" Existenz: An International Journal in Philosophy, Religion, Politics, and the Arts 8 (2): 26-32. ISSN 1932-1066. Ferrando notes (p. 27) that such challenging of binaries constitutes part of \\"the post-anthropocentric and post-dualistic approach of (philosophical, cultural, and critical) posthumanism.\\" == See also == * Bioconservatism * Cyborg anthropology * Posthuman * Technological change * Technological transitions * Transhumanism == References == Category:Posthumanism Category:Transhumanism Category:Technological change ","title":"Posthumanization"},{"id":"56819181","text":"Mehmet Çekiç (born 1 January 1970) is a Turkish Paralympic alpine skier who competes in the LW4 disability class of men's slalom, standing and giant slalom, standing events.

He was widely known for his research in pheromones, although his academic background based on Physics, specifically on astrophysics under guidance of S.N. Bose. Brahmachary made significant contributions in tiger behavioral studies researching the animal for over 50 years. He studied many species of wildlife, notably big cats and undertook research trips to his favourite continent Africa fourteen times. Brahmachary studied ethology in the Amazon basin in South America and Borneo, Indonesia with an ardent admirer of entomologist Gopal Chandra Bhattacharya. He once said in an interview He died in pneumonia on 13 February 2018 in a city Nursing home in Kolkata, India. Brahmachary had pledged his body to medical research. After paiding respect his body was handed over to Radha Govinda Kar Hospital authorities. ==Early life and education== Ratan Lal Brahmachary belongs to Bengali Hindu family. He was born in Dhaka , Bengal , British India (now in Bangladesh ) in 1932. Professor Brahmachary's early education was in Calcutta, Dacca and Hamburg. He was an astrophysicist. He was a student of the eminent Indian theoretical physicist Satyendra Nath Bose. However, since 1960 he moved into biology, making significant original contributions to molecular embryology, and later, since late 1970s became an ecologist, studying mammalian pheromones, at the Indian Statistical Institute under its founder Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis. ==As a biochemist== Ratan Lal Brahmachary with George Adamson in Kora National Park, Kenya. Following a decade of work on relativistic field theory Astrophysist, Professor Ratan Lal Brahmachary joined Indian Statistical Institute in 1957 and there he was professor of Biology Department and a veteran on tiger research. He did his extensive research in Marine Biological Labs in Italy, France and other institutes in Europe. Professor Brahmachary's early work was on molecular embryology of invertebrates,, and in the 1970s, during a series of visits to Africa, studied food habits of mountain Gorilla. For more than 30 years since 1979, his major research emphasis was on pheromones of tigers and other big cats. He was interested in Animal Behaviour long before the subject was introduced in this part of the world. To observe wildlife, he visited Africa 14 times. He also worked in the Amazon area and Borneo and in the Mediterranean and Andaman Islands. ==Notable worksOn biochemistry=== Tiger pheromones He was among the first scientists to observe the scent-marking behaviour of tigers, where the animals spray urine on tree branches to mark their territories and communicate via biochemical messengers. Brahmachary, along with Jyotirmoy Dutta of Bose Institute, Kolkata made the first comprehensive approach towards understanding the nature of big cat pheromones. After Years long researched on Synthesising the chemical nature of tiger urine (marking fluid), he found out that the molecule 2 acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP) was present in tiger urine (marking fluid) and was the very same molecule that imparts the beautiful aroma to fragrant varieties of rice like basmati. Human pheromone Professor Brahmachary gave his opinion on human pheromone. In an interview he expressed Scented and non- scented mung bean Mung bean is a widely consumed legume of India as well as of Asia. In India, two varieties of this bean, scented and non-scented, are available. The scented variety produces a beautiful aroma when fried, boiled or cooked. Professor Brahmachari researched on this phenomenon with Moumita Pal and Mahua Ghosh. This study was carried out for comparison of the physicochemical and biochemical characteristics of these two varieties. ===On physics=== Professor Brahmachari did a research on \\"Solution of the Combined Gravitational and Mesic Field Equations in General Relativity\\". Which was published in 1960 in Progress of Theoretical Physics. ===Born Free Foundation=== He was one of the founder patron of Zoo Check. Now it is the Born Free Foundation since 1984. Brahmachary always believed that \\"wildlife belongs in the wild and strongly stood for compassionate treatment of animals in research\\". About Born free foundation he told in an interview ==Books== He wrote several books in Bangla to promote the cause of wildlife protection and scientific observation of animal behaviour. most notable books are listed below. * আফ্রিকার জঙ্গলে বারো বার (Africar Jongoley Barobar) (translation in English Twelve Visits to the African Jungle) * বাঘ সিংহ হাতি (Bagh, Shingha, Haathi) (translation in English Tiger, Lion and Elephant) His academic book My Tryst With Big Cats is quite popular among tiger studies scholars. Summary of his last work on tiger phenomenon was published in a book named The Neurobiology of Chemical Communication. This book edited by Carl Mucignat Caretta on 2014. ==Award== For his contributions to science popularisation, he received the coveted state prize of West Bengal Rabindra Puraskar. He also got D.Sc. degree from the University of Calcutta in 2008. ==References== Notes Citations Category:1932 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Indian biochemists Category:Bengali people ","title":"Ratan Lal Brahmachary"},{"id":"56819361","text":"Kuşcenneti railway station () is a railway station in Bandırma, Turkey.

The scientific name of the species was validated and published for the first time in 1883 by Traustedt. URMO: UNESCO-IOC Register of Marine Organisms. Land J. van der (ed), 2008-11-18 It is a soft-bodied, intertidal ascidian, sac-like filter feeders in the subphylum tunicate characterized by a hard outer covering known as a “tunic,” abundant in the shallow subtidal and intertidal zones of the Northern Gulf of Mexico, where they establish pseudopopulations. == Description == These ascidians have soft bodies but are covered by a hard, protective tunic as they are part of the subphylum tunicate. They are sessile intertidal organisms. The tunic contains hair like extensions of the epidermis known as ampullae, which are hollow and tubular. Ampullae grow shortly after the larvae settles in the sediments and are used to form a strong attachment to grains of sand. The grains of sand hold it down as the juvenile forms around seven to nine ampullae to create a secure attachment to soft sediments or hard substrates surrounding the organism. Adult M. occidentalis cover themselves in a layer of sand and use the ampullae to secure the sand on top of them in order to camouflage and protect them from predators. == Environment == Molgula occidentalis occupy soft bottoms. They are sessile organisms as juveniles and adults after the larvae settle. The larvae may settle on hard or soft substrates, adhering to rocks, shells, sea grasses, or other ascidians but most often rest on sandy or muddy substrates. Their larvae are pelagic and they lack a tadpole stage because currents carrying them to shores where they settle in the intertidal or subtidal zone and form a temporary pseudopopulation. Because of this, larvae do best in high current systems. These pseudopopulations typically only survive for a short time and are not self-sustaining. They typically settle during the spring and summer months, reach sexual maturity, then die come the winter months as freezing temperatures and prolonged exposure due to low tide have adverse effects on the organisms. They are limited by vertical zonation: adults can inhabit deeper depths but larvae cannot and they are limited by desiccation if they settle to high so they inhabit the edge of pools no more than a few centimeters above or below low tide. == Ecology == They occur most abundantly in areas where seagrasses, specifically Ruppia maritima, stabilize the sediments because increased sediments in the water and movement of sediments can have adverse effects on the organisms. They are preyed upon by the gastropod Fasciolaria hunteria. This snail inserts its probuscus into a siphon found on the M. occidentalis and consumes the ascidian's internal organs, leaving the tunicate untouched. == Reproduction and Life cycle == Adult M. occidentalis are simultaneous hermaphrodites and are capable of self- fertilization. Once fertilized, they have a very short embryonic period, averaging about 12.5 hours under ideal conditions. Ascidian eggs have different cytoplasmic patterns that influence the embryonic tissues and the fate of the blastomeres. The distribution of the cytoplasmic components are produced by the movement of the contents of oocytes during a process known as ooplasmic segregation. Because they are ascidians, they are part of the phylum chordata and have a notochord in the larval stage, but lose it when they metamorphose into adults. == References == Category:Stolidobranchia Category:Animals described in 1883 ","title":"Molgula occidentalis"},{"id":"56819535","text":"Nauru requires its residents to register their motor vehicles and display vehicle registration plates since 1970.

It has also been published as part of later collections of Herbert's best stories, such as Eye. ==Plot== The story is set in 1972, during a low level war against an unnamed enemy being waged somewhere in the arctic region of the American continent. Both sides have \\"life detection\\" technology, that can detect living creatures at a distance. The American side has an electromagnetic shield that can conceal people from the detectors. Hulser is a scientist conscripted into the army. His wife is expecting their first child. He is manning a forward observation post using detectors and his own shield to spot enemy activity. His detector registers small life forms that may or may not be foxes or wolves. Hulser wonders if the enemy has a shield that merely reduces the apparent size of the person wearing it in the detector. Thinking about his own shield, and need to protect him against chemical reactions it would induce in his body, he realizes that the technology can be used to remotely detonate explosives, giving his side an overwhelming advantage and ending the war. Deciding that the detector is registering enemy soldiers, he calls in a mortar strike and then is embroiled in a full-scale fire fight. Panicking, he spends the rest of his time demanding to be pulled out. The story describes Hulser's efforts to get out of combat and have his idea taken seriously. Convinced of his cause, he stands up to his sergeant and bullies his commanding officer, earning him a cell in the brig. There he is contacted by a prominent scientist who starts to believe his idea. Eventually there is a successful demonstration attended by top military officers and a mysterious civilian that they defer to. Although the war will be won, they are strangely pessimistic. In the final scene they explain that although war with explosives is no longer possible, war will continue with even worse weapons, such as chemical poisons and disease agents. They give Hulser a copy of a book, saying that he and his children will need it.

His family later moved to Lingelihle Township in 1962 to a section called Taptap. His grandfather, Qobose Mhlauli was also a politician and had worked closely with James Calata who was Fort Calata's grandfather and one of the founding members of the South African Native National Congress. Mhlauli went to St James Primary, Cradock Bantu Secondary and finally studied teaching at Lovedale College where he majored in Afrikaans and History. ==Work== Mhlauli’s teaching career started in 1974 at Thembalabantu High School in King William's Town where he also became boarding master. In 1975, the hostel students embarked on a food strike, demanding better quality food. The student leaders were arrested and during their appearance, Mhlauli would be in court to show his support. The security police opposed Mhauli’s actions because they believed the students were arrested for disturbing the education system. He then went to work as a principal at Archie Velile Secondary in Dimbaza. During a student stay-away demanding proper representation in the student council and equal education in South Africa for both black and white students; some students were assaulted by the police. Mhlauli then took the injured to a nearby clinic; this act was also opposed by the security police. ==Politics== Mhlauli met ex-political prisoner Msuthu Sonkwala who was from Cradock but not allowed to live there by the government due to his banning conditions after he was released from prison. Mhlauli held political meetings with Sonkwala and other ex-political prisoners. They would discuss politics and ways to mobilise the community and teach them about the current political status. Their aim was to get the community involved in protests against the injustices that were brought by the apartheid government. Mhlauli then received a post as a principal at a high school in Bongolwethu Township in Oudtshoorn. During this time, he married Nombuyiselo Zonke who was also from Cradock and they had two children together named Ntsika and Babalwa. In August 1983, he attended the launch of the United Democratic Front (South Africa) as part of the Oudtshoorn delegation. Soon after this, they formed the Oudtshoorn Civic Organisation and the Bhongolwethu Youth Organisation. His house became the operation centre for struggle advancement in the Southern Cape Region. His wife became part of a collective of women who championed the establishment of the women’s organisation in their region. A newsletter named Saamstaan (stand together) was established, and Mhlauli was part of the committee which established the publication. This publication informed the public about political events in South Africa. It is believed that Mhlauli survived an arson attack at his office that destroyed all of his belongings, however details regarding this event are scarce. ==Death and memory== During winter school holidays, Mhlauli met with Matthew Goniwe who encouraged him to attend a UDF meeting in Port Elizabeth on the 27th of June 1985, which Mhlauli agreed to. On the 26th of June, the community at Lingelihle and surrounding areas held Freedom Charter celebrations and different organisations which affiliated with the UDF, gave speeches. Mhlauli attended the event as a member of the Oudtshoorn Civic Organization which was affiliated with the UDF On the 27th of June, the four men now referred to as The Cradock Four, went to a UDF meeting in Port Elizabeth. Mhlauli's had been at a course in PE and he had planned to pick her up on their way home. This however did not materialise as their meeting went on until late in the evening. The men were last seen at that meeting. Mhlauli’s body was the second to be found after Sparrow Mkhonto in a bush near Bluewater Bay. He was handcuffed and tied with a rope with 25 stab wounds to his chest, seven in the back and another four in his arms. His throat was cut and his right hand severed; and his body was burned. The Cradock Four were buried at a mass funeral where thousands of people attended on the 20th of July 1985. Speakers at the funeral included Beyers Naudé, Allan Boesak and Steve Tshwete gave keynote addresses. A message from the then president of the ANC Oliver Tambo was read. To honour him, Mhlauli was awarded the Order of Luthuli in Silver by the Presidency of South Africa. The order was for his “Outstanding contribution and dedicating his life to a free, just and democratic South Africa”. ==References== Category:1949 births Category:1985 deaths Category:Anti-apartheid activists Category:Xhosa people Category:Members of the Order of Luthuli ","title":"Sicelo Mhlauli"},{"id":"56819621","text":"Brian William Robinson was the second last person executed in Western Australia at Fremantle Prison, on 24 January 1964.

According to the book Internet Election Campaigns in the United States, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, the election campaign periods in Korea (23 days for presidential elections and 14 days for National Assembly elections) were made intentionally short in order to \\"prevent excessive campaign spending for long-running election campaigns and harmful effects from overheated elections\\", but, on the downside, \\"this works against new candidates who are not well known\\". == Summary of past legislative elections == :* 1946 South Korean legislative election === National Assembly elections === # 1948 South Korean Constitutional Assembly election # 1950 South Korean legislative election # 1954 South Korean legislative election # 1958 South Korean legislative election # 1960 South Korean legislative election # 1963 South Korean legislative election # 1967 South Korean legislative election # 1971 South Korean legislative election # 1973 South Korean legislative election # 1978 South Korean legislative election # 1981 South Korean legislative election # 1985 South Korean legislative election # 1988 South Korean legislative election Winning party: 1946 – 1948 – 1950 – 1954 – 1958 – 1960 – 1963 – 1967 – 1971 – 1973 – 1978 – 1981 – 1985 – 1988 {  ! # !

Susanna Strangways was the co-heiress of her childless brother Thomas Strangways (died 1726) and, after the death of her sister the Duchess of Hamilton in 1729, sole heiress. On 15 March 1736, at the age of 13, Elizabeth married Stephen Fox, the 31-year-old future earl. A homosexual, he was for many years the lover of John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey, whose letters to him have been published. Hervey was angered by the marriage and broke off his relationship with Fox. He was raised to the peerage in 1741 and was created an earl on 17 June 1756, making his wife a countess. In 1758, the earl took the additional surname and arms of Strangways in compliance with the terms of his wife's inheritance. Initially, the earl and countess did not live together because of Elizabeth's youth. Several of their children died in infancy. Those who survived to adulthood were: *Lady Frances Muriel Fox- Strangways (died 1814), who married Valentine Richard Quin, 1st Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl, and had children *Lady Lucy Fox-Strangways (died 1787), who married Colonel Hon.

The house was demolished in 1934, but the gardens, expanded and improved by Elizabeth's son Henry, were restored and opened to the public as Abbotsbury Subtropical Gardens.

The author herself calls it a report to map out the life and settlement of Iranian migrants in Norway. Two main stages of the Iranians' out-migration are described in the book. First section is about the historical context of migration, the factors that influenced the Iranians' decision to migrate. The second section is about the settlement of Iranian migrants in Norway, their adaptation and integration to the new social and cultural environment.  Reception  The language of the book is mainly descriptive and less analytical. There is less almost no information about the methodology of the research. === Women's Everyday Religious Discourse in Iran (1993) === The essay was published in the book Women in the Middle East: Perceptions, Realities, and Struggles for Liberation edited by Afshar Haleh. It is part of the project on Women’s Studies at York Series with the purpose of presenting real images of women from East who are often depicted \\"seductive and mysterious\\" In the notes about contributors of the book Kamalkhani was described as PhD candidate in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Bergan. Kamalkhani's this essay focuses on complex religious rituals of Shiraz women as a unique way of performing their identities and political agency. The gatherings are referred as rowzeh (or rowzeh-zanāneh) which are stories about the Islamic saints (Imams) and oral narratives about the historical events significant for Iranian Shiism. === Women's Islam: religious practice among women in today's Iran (1998). === This book was initially published in 1998 based on Zahra Kamalkhani's Ph.D thesis. The book focuses on the religious practices and family rituals of Iranians women, particularly, women from Shiraz, the author's hometown. After returning to Iran in 1989, the author started to attend religious meetings performed and led by women and the idea of researching women's religious activities was born with this quest. As a native Iranian anthropologist, Kamalkhani describes that women-only religious meetings offered Iranian women public space to perform their identities as in most denominations of Islam and in Muslim cultures, women have comparatively limited participation in public space and Mosques. ==References== Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:Iranian anthropologists Category:Anthropologists of religion Category:Women anthropologists Category:Gender studies academics Category:University of Tehran alumni Category:University of Bergen alumni Category:University of Western Australia faculty ","title":"Zahra Kamalkhani"},{"id":"56819744","text":"Nos Annees Francaises () is a 2012 Chinese historical TV series directed by Kang Honglei and written by Li Kewei.

She is course instructor of Associate Degree of Arts in Visual Arts at the Academy of Visual Arts (AVA), Hong Kong Baptist University since 2015. == Selected works and exhibitions  2001 to 2003: Transmigration of Materials === Room of Memories (2001) Initially working in the media of painting and sculpture during her study at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Ivy Ma already shown her interest in exploring the marginality of different media and materials in her early works by using everyday materials like hairpins, thread, wood, cotton, dolls, fresh meat, and candies. She called the process \\"transmigration of materials\\". Remember How to Draw (2002) Shown in the group exhibition entitled Wo-Man at the Old Ladies House in Macau in 2001, Room of Memories (2001) is an installation work consisted of a giant thought bubble composed of hundreds of old-fashioned women's hairpins suspended above a broken chair in a comic-strip narrative. Remember How to Throb (2002) is an installation consisting of three works presented in the Graduation Exhibition at the University of Leeds where Ma studied with a scholarship by the Hong Kong Arts Development Council. In Remember How to Play (2002), domestic objects such as soft toys, cushions, hair were inserted inside foam and were dotted throughout the exhibition space. Combining video projection and wire, Remember How to Draw (2002) showed the artist’s impulsive reactions to her childhood experience of drawing with fingers. === 2003 to 2009: On-site works and overseas residencies === While Room of Memories (2001) already touches on memory and history of a site, Far Away, So Close (2003) installed at the Kadoorie Farm Botanic Garden in Hong Kong in the exhibition entitled Dream Garden was one of Ma's earliest site- specific works. She collected trees collapsed during the typhoon. The tree trunks were sawn into columns and mirrors were attached to the cross-section of the trunks. Images of the sky and other trees were reflected at various angles. Far Away, So Close (2003), Kadoorie Farm Botanic Garden, Hong Kong From 2005 to 2009, Ivy Ma participated in a series of artist residencies and workshops in Bangladesh, Europe and the USA. Several on-site works were realized during this period. As in Remember How to Play and Remember How to Draw (2002), childhood memories plays an important part in A Fairy Tale (2005), a work made during the residency at the Britto International Artists’ Workshop at the Nikera Kori Center in Bangladesh. The work includes a fabricated scaled-down version of a merry-go-round, and candies in silk handkerchief. As mentioned in the artist's notes, \\"It is about children’s dreams, runs in the air of the playground then settles down in a room…a solitude. It is also about a person watching children play in a playground (as in the lyrics of the Rolling Stones song As Tears Go By), from morning to noon...This was indeed a group work and included the owner of the playground…the blacksmith who made the playground ride, his helper and the children I met in the village who gave me inspiration in thinking about the play in one’s childhood.\\" Collaborated with Abdullah Syed (Pakistan), another participant in the workshop, Always land (2005) is an on-site work using net made with plastic thread and falling leaves. Perception of Phenomenal Soundlessness (2006) Perception of Phenomenal Soundlessness (2006) is an on- site work produced outdoors during her residency at the Cable Factory in Helsinki, Finland. Performative acts were carried out while Ma wandered n the frosty landscape. She dragged an empty suitcase with broken wheels to the lakeside, filled it with her own curled up, unclothed body and photographed herself; she gathered tree sticks from grave land and rearranged them on the ice; and she stuffed ice into a man-shaped cloth doll and hanged it on a tree. Images and documentation of the work were presented in the exhibition entitled Stained, the eclipsed pattern at Uma-g Gallery, Hong Kong in 2006. 235x235px The Wayward Cloud (2006) follows a similar methodology. Originally an on-site work created when Ma lived in Wan Chai on the Hong Kong Island, It is about the view seen looks back at the seer, an idea already explored in Far Away, So Close (2003). In the artist's word, \\"I loved to look from my window and see many old buildings. Then I wanted to search for the view that looked back at my home, so I went to the opposite building, and asked the owner if I could pay her a little bit for permission to got to the top and see back to my home.\\" A photograph depicting a naked figure holding a cotton wool cloud on a rooftop and another photograph of the rooftop without the figure taken at the scene were included in the exhibition Perhaps, Solitude at the studio of the late Jerry Kwan, teacher of Ivy Ma in Fotan in 2007. In Another Land (2008) is an installation piece created during her residency at the Headlands Center for the Arts in San Francisco, using pebbles collected from Rodeo Beach nearby and cotton thread from a closed-down factory in Oakland. === 2010 to 2015: Found images and drawing-interventions === 258x258px Starting in 2010 Ivy Ma began focusing on found images, both stills taken from specific films and photographs found in history museums, for an ongoing series of what she calls \\"drawing-interventions\\" where she actively erases and draws into and over the existing image. In the exhibitions In Details (2010) at agnès b.’s LIBRAIRE GALERIE, Hong Kong, Gazes (2011) at Gallery EXIT, Hong Kong, and Still Lifes and Waves (2011) at the Hong Kong Film Archive, Ma presented cinematic drawings created by magnifying and printing out film stills of objects, plants and fragments of the mise-en-scène in classic films such as Yasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story and A Story of Floating Weeds, Yoshimitsu Morita's And Then, Fei Mu's Spring in a small town. Then she draws directly on the prints in various subtle ways. Yasujiro Ozu, Tokyo Story, Flower and Plant (2011) In the exhibition Numbers Standing Still (2012) at Gallery EXIT, Hong Kong, the source materials are historical images instead of film stills. Re- photographing images of tragedies such as the aftermath of the Hiroshima bombing in Walking Towards (2012), the occupation of Nanjing by Japanese soldiers in Hand 001 / 002 / 003 (2012), and the mass killing by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia in Cambodia/Tuol sleng Genocide Museum/Numbers Standing Still (2012), she erased large portion of the images and then overlapped them with pigments. 254x254px Ma shifted her focus to people in the exhibition Someone (2014) at the Goethe-Gallery and Black Box Studio, Hong Kong. Source materials range from people in the artist's family photographs, to strangers in found photographs and antique photographs, to faces and bodies of people in historical images of war and disaster. Yasujiro Ozu, Tokyo Story, Slippers (2011) Works presented in the exhibition Last Year (2015) at Gallery EXIT, Hong Kong represents an important development in Ma's drawing-interventions which she has been developed for the past 5 years.

It is a companion game to Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative survival game with construction elements. It was initially released in early access on September 26, 2017, for Microsoft Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, followed by ports for iOS, Android, and Nintendo Switch the following year. Epic dropped the early access label for the game on June 29, 2020. Versions for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X are planned for when they launch in late 2020. The concept of the game is similar to previous games of the genre: 100 players skydive onto an island and scavenge for gear to defend themselves from other players. Players can fight alone (Solo), with one additional player (Duos), or with a group of up to three others (Squads). As the match progresses, the playable area within the island gradually constricts, giving the players less and less room to work with. The last player or team alive wins the match. The main distinction from others in the genre is the game's construction elements, letting players build walls, obstacles, and other structures from collected resources to take cover from incoming fire or give one a strategic view advantage. Battle Royale uses a seasonal approach with battle passes to introduce new character customization content in the game, as well as limited time events, some of which correspond with changes to the game map. Since its initial release, several other game modes have been introduced, including \\"Battle Lab\\" and \\"Party Royale\\". The idea for Battle Royale arose following the release of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds in 2017, a similar battle royale game that was highly successful but noted for its technical flaws. Originally released as part of the early access version of Save the World, Epic later transitioned the game to a free-to-play model funded by microtransactions. Following its rise in popularity, Epic split the development team, with one focusing on Battle Royale and the other on Save the World. Battle Royale received positive reviews from critics, who praised its learning curve, gameplay, art style, multiplayer and progression system, but noted its similarity to previous games in the genre. The game quickly rose in popularity following its release, eventually surpassing Battlegrounds in overall player count and revenue. Player count had exceeded 350 million by May 2020, while by March 2019, the game had generated over 2 billion dollars worldwide. The game has gone on to become a cultural phenomenon, with promotion through social media and several celebrities, such as Ninja, Marshmello, and Drake, contributing to the game's popularity, achieving record-high viewership on streaming platforms in the process. ==Gameplay== The player can build structures as defense, buildings, or to gain the high ground over enemies. The main gameplay for Fortnite Battle Royale follows the standard format for the battle royale genre. The game normally is played either with each player on their own, or in a squad of two to four players, with up to 100 players participating each round. The round starts with players, weaponless, skydiving from floating buses (\\"Battle Bus\\") then deploying a glider onto a region of land. The island's fixed layout includes several landmarks and locations (named in an alliterative fashion, such as \\"Lazy Lake\\", \\"Pleasant Park\\", and \\"Retail Row\\") that are mostly ghost towns during matches, while a random distribution of weapons, shields, and other combat support features can be found by searching chests scattered in buildings and other sites. The goal is to be the last player or team alive by eliminating or avoiding other players. When playing in solo modes, players are immediately eliminated when they exhaust their health, while in squad modes, downed players can crawl around while losing health; they can be eliminated immediately by an opponent or revived by a squadmate to help them up. Initially, when the game launched, eliminated players were out of the match, but starting with updates in April 2019, squadmates can attempt to revive a downed player at various \\"Reboot vans\\" scattered around the map, which are few and far between and in the open, making it a risk to respawn a squadmate. Over time, the game's safe zone (representing the eye of a storm), decreases in size, and players caught outside the zone will take damage. This directs the surviving players into tighter spaces, forcing player encounters. Supply drops will spawn in random locations during a match, providing random weapons and items. Like in the original Fortnite game, Fortnite Battle Royale is primarily played in a third-person perspective. Fortnite Battle Royales primary distinction from other battle royale games is the building system, which originated from the original Fortnite survival game. Nearly all objects in the environment can be destroyed and harvested for materials (wood, stone, and metal), which can then be used to build fortifications of limited durabilities, such as walls, ramps, floors, and roofs, which can be used to help traverse the map, protect the player from gunfire, or slow down progression of other players. Weaker pieces can be destroyed in a few hits, but can be built quickly, while stronger pieces can withstand more damage, but take longer to build. The game also revolves around players eliminating their opponents to be the last one standing The game is free-to-play, supported by microtransactions that allow players to buy \\"V-Bucks,\\" the game's internal currency. V-Bucks are also shared with the main Fortnite: Save the World game, which offers players the opportunity to earn V-Bucks by completing missions or daily quests. V-Bucks can then be used to buy cosmetic improvements to the player (outfits, pickaxes, gliders, backblings, and emotes). The game is run in chapters with a number of seasons, each season lasting about 10 weeks each. Each season introduces an exclusive set of cosmetic items that can be obtained. These are offered through a dual-track battle pass, which features a number of tiers that players climb through by earning experience through completing in-game objectives, while acquiring cosmetic rewards or other items in the process. Each player has access to the \\"free\\" track of the Battle Pass, which offers fewer cosmetics that can be earned by clearing multiple tiers, while players can also purchase the Pass' \\"premium\\" track with V-Bucks, which offers more challenges and grants prizes for every tier the player advances. Players can use V-Bucks to purchase tiers as well once they have bought the Battle Pass. Since release, Epic Games has added more features, such as new weapon and items and makeshift vehicles such as shopping carts and golf carts. Epic is also able to deploy hotfixes to the game to adjust aspects like weapon attributes and distribution, pushing these out in minutes if necessary should they or players discover critical issues or glitches, as well as removing older or not well received items from the game in a process called \\"vaulting\\". With the release of the standalone Fortnite Creative gameplay mode in December 2018, an area of the Fortnite Battle Royale map called \\"The Block\\" featured a rotating selection of user-made creations developed in Creative mode and approved by Epic. A \\"Battle Lab\\" mode was added in December 2019 for players to create their own custom battle royale games. In April 2020, a new \\"Party Royale\\" mode was added, taking place on a small map where combat and construction was disabled though non-lethal gameplay items can be acquired like paint guns and vehicles; this map was aimed to be used as a social space, as well as to host in-game events like concerts. Prior to September 2019, Fortnite did not have specialized matchmaking, outside of platform and regional limits. With an upcoming patch, the game will introduced skill-based matchmaking, based on internal metrics that judge a player's skill in the game. Further, with Chapter 2 Season 1, the game will add special matches against computer-controlled bots to help players practice the game. ===Limited time and competitive modes=== Epic has the ability to include limited time modes (LTM) within the game, which provides Epic with experimental capabilities and gain feedback from players to improve upon. One of its earliest additions was a 50-v-50 mode, placing players randomly on one of two teams and dropping them on opposite sides of the map, giving the two teams time to gather resources, create fortifications, and hunt the other team before the storm moved in. A sandbox Playground LTM was introduced in June 2018, which allows up to four players to explore and build anything anywhere on the battle map, while being able to fight each other and respawn upon defeat until the storm covered the map after an hour and eliminated them all; Epic later made this a permanent mode in the game. Epic has stated that they intend to add ranked competitive play in the future. A preliminary competitive mode, Solo Showdown, ran for a limited time starting in May 2018, ranking players by their final placement in matches and rewarding the top-placing competitors with V-Bucks. ===Seasonal changes=== Fortnite Battle Royale has created a larger loose narrative that is exhibited through changes in the game map, which generally correlated to the start and end of the in-game season. For example, in the lead up to the fourth season of the first chapter which started in May 2018, players saw a number of shooting stars cross the skies, followed by a giant comet that neared the ground; upon the start of that season, the comet had hit one of the locations on the map, leaving a giant crater, among other changes. This tied into several new cosmetic skins related to superheroes and super-villains that were available that month. Epic has the ability to create custom events that occur across all game servers simultaneously as well; the first example of such was a countdown leading to a giant rocket's launch in June 2018 which, in the aftermath, left cracks in the skies that have grown since that event. The game initially launched without any seasonable schedule, but starting with the release of Chapter 1 Season 2 in December 2017, Epic has provided new content, which includes new cosmetics, new gameplay elements, and changes to the game's map, on a roughly 10-week basis. This also introduced the use of the battle pass for players to obtain some of this new content by completing challenges and gaining experience. Chapter 1 {  ! width=10%  Season ! Period ! width=70%  Description -  Season 1  September 2017 – December 2017  Retroactively considered the 1st season of the 1st chapter upon the start of the second season. -  Season 2  December 2017 – February 2018 Medieval themed. Introduction of the battle pass. -  Season 3  February 2018 – April 2018  Space themed. Battle Pass increased from 70 tiers to 100. -  Season 4  May 2018 – July 2018  Superhero themed . Leading up to the start of Season 4, players had observed shooting stars crossing the game's map during Season 3, which later became small meteorites that hit the ground and caused some damage. Across all games a large meteor also started to appear, on track to hit the game map to coincide with the start of Season 4, completely destroying one of the major landmarks. -  Season 5  July 2018 – September 2018  Rift themed. Prior to this season, Epic established a one-time event across all games on June 30, 2018 that fired a rocket from a villainous lair which created interdimensional rifts on the map. The rifts grew over the next few days, with some in-game objects disappearing and new objects from other time periods appearing. As part of its marketing, Epic planted a real-world version of the \\"Durrr-Burger\\" restaurant sign in the California desert, with clues pointing to locations of real-world version of the game's loot llamas located around the world. The season started with changes of the map due to these rifts, while the rifts remained as a gameplay element within the season, teleporting the player to a high elevation and to re-land elsewhere in the map. -  Season 6  September 2018 – December 2018  Darkness themed. Near the end of the 5th season, another one-time event occurred in which the rifts created by the rocket launch closed up, leaving a large purple cube with glyphs on its surface in the game world, which players nicknamed \\"Kevin\\". Kevin moved on its own volition throughout the season, creating anomalies in its wake, including levitating itself and the large island in Loot Lake across the map, and allowing transdimensional \\"Cube Monsters\\" to appear across the map and attack players. Ultimately, Kevin overloaded and exploded, temporarily teleporting all players into a white, bottomless void known as the Nexus, where a Rift-shaped butterfly briefly appeared. On return to the map, Loot Lake had returned to normal, but with many smaller islands made up of pieces of Kevin. -  Season 7  December 2018 – February 2019  Winter themed. As the 6th season concluded, a snow cloud appeared over one corner of the map, followed by a large iceberg dubbed \\"Polar Peak\\" at the onset of Season 7 that collided with the island and covered a third of the map in snow with other new features, including a large castle on top of Polar Peak that had been buried deep in the snow. Initially the map's features celebrated the Festuvis holiday. Later, a large ice sphere appeared above the castle, warning of an upcoming winter storm. Soon, the Ice King, who had been trapped in the castle, emerged to cast a spell that unleashed a winter storm across the whole map, and summoned Ice Fiends (similar to the Cube Monsters) to attack players. -  Season 8  March 2019 – May 2019  Pirate/fire/ice themed. In the last days of the 7th season, the island was rocked by earthquakes that created cracks on the ground, eventually heralding the appearance of a large volcano on the northeast corner of the map that erupted. The eruption melted most of the snow from the island, and eradicated the nearby features and replaced them with a lagoon and an Aztec-like temple complex. The eruption also created dangerous lava flows surrounding the volcano. Pirates, ninjas, and more unreal adventurers, (including a \\"prisoner\\" of the Ice King who broke free and developed an affinity for fire) enter the fold, hunting for treasure and victory. Near the end of the season, a special event called \\"The Unvaulting\\" took place, which allowed players to enter a dimension named the \\"Nexus.\\" The dimension gave players the ability to vote for a weapon to be reintroduced into the game. After the drum gun won the vote, the volcano erupted and volcanic rocks flew out of the volcano. These huge rocks struck and destroyed Tilted Towers and Retail Row, as well as severely damaging Polar Peak. -  Season 9  May 2019 – July 2019 Futuristic themed. At the start, the areas destroyed by Season 8's Unvaulting had been reconstructed using futuristic designs and materials. Players observed a large monster swimming around outside the island, and strange footprints in other locations. Drones near the Vault concurrently started to construct a giant robot. At an event at the end of the season, the robot activated and attacked the monster, rampaging across the island. The robot eventually bested the monster with a giant sword, and then flew off, leaving the monster's corpse and sword behind as well as a giant glowing orb. The Zero Point continued to destabilize over the remaining part of the season, and through the Season X teaser trailer, it created an interdimensional blast, causing players to find locations and landmarks from previous seasons, and the meteor that initiated Season 4 completely still in the sky. -  Season X  August 2019 – October 2019  This marks as the final season of Chapter 1. The remnants of the Zero Point's explosion in Season 9 left various rift zones open across the map, bringing back locations that had been lost due to other map changes over past seasons and changing them a bit, such as the area where the meteor had previously landed. The season culminated when the Visitor, a mysterious being that arrived with the meteor, launched a rocket that created numerous rifts, from which came smaller rockets which were controlled by \\"The Seven\\" that struck all across the island, creating a black hole and consuming the entire game itself. Subsequent to this event, the game was unplayable for about 36 hours with the game's screens only showing the black hole. During this period, players could enter the Konami code to play a mini-game. }  Chapter 2  {  ! width=10%  Season ! Period ! width=70%  Description -  Season 1  October 2019 – February 2020  A new season that revamped the game's mechanics and introduced a new map following the destruction of the old map from the black hole at the end of Chapter 1 Season X. This also introduced multiple new mechanics, such as picking up downed teammates (or enemies) and either carrying them to different locations or throwing them, and also the ability to swim and fish for loot. Boats were also added to the game, which increased mobility in water. Some matches may feature players controlled by artificial intelligence. Fortnitemares returned, which featured a special cosmetic set called The Final Reckoning, as well as a special limited-time boss battle against the Storm King, the main antagonist of Fortnite: Save the World. Afterwards, the island returned to its normal state. In November 2019, the season was extended until February 2020, in which will include a winter themed event, a live event, and rewards for everybody. On December 14, the Millennium Falcon came to the Fortnite island for a live event. They were ambushed by 6 TIE fighters, in which were defeated and all crashed onto the map. On December 24, the map was covered with snow, making snowstorms appear and reduce visibility either lightly or largely. The season was extended twice, once to February 8, and other time to February 20. -  Season 2  February 2020 – June 2020  Secret agent themed. In the trailers, it is shown that multiple characters from past seasons are in fact working for a covert agency, under two rival divisions: Shadow (black) and Ghost (white). The two factions compete against each other in spy games. Various landmarks conceal small safe houses for agents of either faction that can be raided for loot. Several large secret bases are established across the coasts and center of the battle royale island, each heavily guarded by small automatic defense turrets, many henchmen and a powerful unique elite agent armed with a powerful weapon, all controlled by artificial intelligence. Players are given certain methods of compromising the bases' defenses, such as adopting disguises and disabling the defense system's power source, and will be able to raid a base's vault and obtain valuable loot upon defeating its elite agent in a boss battle. The season's battle pass allows players to unlock outfits based on these elite agents, complete missions on their behalf to eventually unlock a mutually exclusive, faction- specific version of them (Ghost or Shadow) through one final mission per outfit, and also obtain the Marvel antihero Deadpool. Players can also \\"shake down\\" downed enemies to briefly expose the location of their allies. The season was originally planned to end in late April 2020, but was delayed to June 4. -  Season 3  June 2020 – August 2020  Ocean themed. In a live event for transiting from the last days of Season 2 to 3, the Agency triggered a device it was constructing at its base; this had the effect of warding off the storm but causing the island to sink, the water held back only by a weakening shield. In-game, the water acted as the storm front, as it still constricted play-area on the map, and players trapped within in took damage, though players are able to swim with better mobility while within the wall of water. Part of the season included cross-promotional content with Aquaman, and during the season the water levels started to subside, later revealing part the map named Coral Castle, implied to be the city of Atlantis. -  Season 4  August 2020 – present  Marvel themed. This season contains a Marvel themed battle pass and POIs, featuring numerous superheroes and supervillans from the Marvel universe. The superheroes included are Thor, She-Hulk, Groot , Storm, Dr. Doom, Mystique, Iron Man, and Wolverine as the \\"secret\\" outfit. Galactus is mentioned is approaching the Fortnite island to consume the \\"Nexus\\". } ===Promotional modes and elements=== Shortly after the launch of the film Avengers: Infinity War, Epic ran a Marvel-sponsored event that featured the Infinity Gauntlet that randomly spawned on the map; any player that equipped it became Thanos with added abilities. A second Avengers-based mode was released upon release of Avengers: Endgame, where players are randomly split between Avenger and Chitauri armies, seeking out the Infinity Stones or the Infinity Gauntlet. Since then, other promotional content from other commercial properties, including cosmetic items and map features, has been available for limited periods in Fortnite, typically around the time of premieres or first broadcasts for these works. These commercial properties have included Ralph Breaks the Internet, John Wick, Stranger Things, Star Wars, Birds of Prey. and several others. Non-gameplay related promotional events have included: *EDM artist Marshmello held a virtual concert in the Pleasant Park location on February 2, 2019 across all game servers, estimated to have had over 10 million players watching it live. *On December 14, a special preview of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker previewed at the Risky Reels location, which even featured the return of Emperor Palpatine in a voice segment that was referred to in the film's opening crawl. * Travis Scott performed a virtual \\"Astronomical\\" tour in support of his 2018 album Astroworld within Fortnite on multiple live concerts between April 23 and 25, 2020, including the premier of a new song, The Scotts, featuring Kid Cudi. The first performance on April 23 was estimated to have drawn over 12.3 million players to watch, while a total of 27.7 million unique viewers cumulatively watched the concerts. Along with these concerts, the event included a new cosmetics based on Scott for in-game purchase. Scott also Fortnite-inspired Cactus Jack products such as action figures and lunchboxes for the event. * Diplo performed a live Major Lazer concert along with Jordan Fisher in the new \\"Party Royale\\" game mode on May 1, 2020, while a multi-part concert by Dillon Francis, Steve Aoki, and deadmau5 was held on May 8 to celebrate the full release of the \\"Party Royale\\" game mode. * A trailer for the Christopher Nolan's Tenet was first shown in the \\"Party Royale\\" game mode before releasing to other digital services on May 21, 2020. In June 2020, Fortnite announced that it would livestream three Nolan films, Inception, Batman Begins and The Prestige through its \\"Movie Nite\\" event within \\"Party Royale\\". Epic Games partnered with Nolan and Warner Bros. to secure distribution rights in different languages and countries. * BTS premiered their music video for \\"Dynamite\\" in the \\"Party Royale\\" game mode on September 22, 2020. Epic started a regular Fortnite Spotlight in-game concert event series in September 2020 using the \\"Party Royale\\" game mode, with such concerts from various musicians planned on a weekly basis and free for any player of Fortnite to watch. The musician will perform their set in a special studio set up by Epic that will be digitized in game. According to Nate Nanzer, Epic Games head of global partnerships, \\"We're creating this platform to work with artists — big artists and up-and-coming artists.\\" ==Development== Fortnite had first been revealed by Epic Games in 2011, considered to be a combination of Minecraft and Left 4 Dead as four players would work together to scavenge resources to built fortifications, traps, weapons, and other objects to survive monster attacks. The game ended up with a protracted development period, in part due to both external pressures, with the industry transitioning to a games as a service model, and internal shifts of focus within Epic (including focusing attention on their first free-to-play title Paragon) to meet the external challenges. During this period, Epic made a deal with Tencent, giving them about 40% of the company in exchange for their support for the games as a service approach as well as ready access to the Chinese video game market. Fortnite was confirmed to have a planned 2018 release in June 2017, with a paid early access period starting a month later; the game is planned otherwise as a free-to-play title supported by microtransactions. With release in early access, the game featured its primary gameplay mode, \\"Save the World\\", where players in teams up to four would work cooperatively to survive and complete objectives on randomly generated maps. During the latter part of Fortnites development, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds was released in March 2017 on personal computers in early access, and quickly became a popular and successful game, becoming the defining example of the battle royale genre. According to Mustard, the Epic team \\"loved Battle Royale games like [Battlegrounds]\\", and explored how they could make a similar mode within Fortnites engine. They kept this mode in a separate development team from the main player versus environment modes for experimentation and as to not throw off the balance in the main game. The Battle Royale mode development was led by Eric Williamson with Zack Estep as production lead. Their goal was to develop the Battle Royale mode quickly from the core \\"Save the World\\" mode, putting off any complex features that weren't already in place as to launch the new mode as soon as possible; while they explored such potential ideas, they held off inclusion until after the main mode was launched. The development of the Battle Royale mode took about two months starting in July 2017 after the \\"Save the World\\" mode had shipped, and was aided by the Unreal Tournament team. Key differences for Battle Royale that differed from \\"Save the World\\" included a more limited progression for weapons, a small subset of traps, and a smoother, more natural terrain for the maps. They also wanted to aim for games not taking longer than 25 minutes, which led to some decisions of which elements from \\"Save the World\\" would not carry over. They had including Fortnites building mechanic for fortifications, not sure how players would use that since the safe zone would continue shrinking, but found quickly that the mechanic helped to distinguish the game from Battlegrounds and was used by expert players frequently to win matches, and had since implemented more features to help players with rapidly constructing temporary bases. Fortnite Battle Royale at the 2018 Game Developers Conference In those two months of development, Epic's plan was to include Battle Royale within the paid Fortnite game, and originally announced this approach publicly in early September 2017. Only two weeks before it was released did Epic decide to make it a separate free-to-play title, fearing that having it as part of the paid package would slow down the growth of the title. Epic announced this change formally about a week after first announcing Battle Royale, allowing those that had purchased early access to Fortnite in anticipation of this mode to request refunds. This release, which beat out Battlegrounds to consoles, caused some concern with Battlegrounds developer Bluehole, as they had been working closely with Epic for Unreal engine support in Battlegrounds, and were worried that Fortnite might be able to include planned features to their Battle Royale mode before they could release those in Battlegrounds. With the popularity of Fortnite Battle Royale by the start of 2018, Epic split off a separate development team to focus on improvements for this mode. Epic said that their attention to Fortnite was causing some of their other games to see lower player populations, leading them to reduce development efforts on these games, particularly Paragon. By the end of January 2018, Epic announced it was shutting down Paragon by April of that year, providing refunds to all players. Similarly, Epic announced it had halted development of the planned free-to- play Unreal Tournament game, its team transitioned to Fortnite, though the game will remain available, playable, and open to end-user modifications. Players on a Fortnite-dedicated Reddit forum had expressed concerns that a similar fate could befall the Save the World mode of Fortnite, as externally, the Save the World mode has not received the same attention in providing updates and improvements compared to the Battle Royale mode since that mode's release. On June 29, 2020, Epic announced that they considered Save the World to no longer be in early access, and as a companion move, eliminated the early access labels from both Battle Royale and Creative modes. ===Localization=== Tencent, who is a partial owner of Epic Games, will bring Fortnite Battle Royale to China; the company is already involved in bringing and supporting Battlegrounds in China as well. Tencent plans to spend up to to help promote the game in China, set up eSports tournaments, and fight against copyright infringement and clones of Fortnite that have appeared in the country. Epic also worked with Neowiz Games to bring a version of Fortnite to South Korea, launched in November 2018. ===Ports=== A release of Fortnite for the Nintendo Switch video game console had been rumored in the week prior to the E3 2018 in June 2018. During the Nintendo Direct presentation, Nintendo and Epic Games announced the release of Fortnite Battle Royale for the Nintendo Switch, supporting cross-platform play with any other platform except the PlayStation 4; such users are able to carry over their inventory, Battle Pass status, and in-game currency between these platforms through their Epic user account. The game was released on June 12, 2018, the same day as the announcement. It is the first game to support direct voice chat through the Switch console through software provided by Vivox. With the success of the Switch version of Fortnite, Vivox had made its voice chat software development kit available for other Switch games. In March 2018, Epic announced it was making Fortnite Battle Royale for Android and iOS mobile devices. The iOS version was released first, and was expected to be followed by the Android version by mid-2018. The beta version for iOS devices launched on March 15, 2018, and opened to all players on April 2, 2018. Epic Games stated that it was not possible to release the Android version with the iOS version simultaneously, and declined to provide a concrete release date for it, because the developers wanted to spend a few months making sure that the game will be compatible with as many Android devices as possible, a task that is not easily accomplished due to the high variety of Android hardware. The Android beta version of Fortnite was released on August 9, 2018 with a time-exclusivity for selected Samsung mobile devices until August 12, 2018. On August 13, 2018, Epic began sending invites for the Android version to registered users for non-Samsung devices, and by October 11, 2018, the Android client was made available to all without an invite. Until April 2020, the Android version was originally not distributed on Google Play Store: users had to sideload an installer app from an Android application package (APK) file downloaded from the Epic Games' website (although on Samsung devices, the app was also available via the internal Samsung Galaxy Apps service). Epic Games stated that it wanted to have a direct connection to the players of the game, and did not want its microtransactions to be subject to Google Play Store's 30% revenue sharing requirement (considering them disproportionate to the types of services the store provides). Epic had tried to seek an exemption from Google from this revenue cut for in-app purchases, but Google refused, stating the need for the free to maintain and improve the Google Play storefront. Security experts expressed concern over this decision, since this requires users to modify security settings in default Android distributions to allow third-party sites to install Android application packages (APK). This setting can make users, particularly younger players, prone to potential malware, including clones of Fortnite that install malicious programming. About a month after the Android release, there were at least 32 clones of the Fortnite installer on the Google Store, with half found to include malware. Epic's installer for Android does include a warning message following the install that users should re-enable security controls and warns users of only downloading content from trusted sources. The initial installer was found by Google to have a potential vector that would allow for malware to be installed, though this was patched within 48 hours of discovery and Epic did not believe anyone used the vector. By April 2020, Epic announced it would release Fortnite for Android via the Play Store and discontinue its side-loading approach, stating that Google puts third-party software outside of the Play Store at a high disadvantage. The iOS version of Fortnite Battle Royale alone brought in an estimated in microtransaction revenue within the first three days of in-app purchases being available, according to analysis firm Sensor Tower. Glixel considered these numbers impressive, compared to the early success rate of other popular mobile games, such as Pokémon Go and Clash Royale which earned and in their first four days, respectively. Sensor Tower further estimated that after one month, the mobile title had earned more than in revenue, surpassing revenues from any other mobile games and other several top-grossing apps during the same period. Epic announced in May 2020 alongside its reveal of the upcoming Unreal Engine 5 that ports of Fortnite for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X are planned to be available at the time of consoles' releases in late 2020. These will initially run on Unreal Engine 4, but the game is expected to transition to Unreal Engine 5 by mid-2021 when the engine is released. ===Cross-platform play=== For the first five seasons, all ports of Fortnite Battle Royale supported cross-platform play with other versions, but with limited interaction in regards to the PlayStation 4. Players on personal computer and mobile versions could cross-play with Xbox One and Nintendo Switch users, or alternatively they could cross-play with PlayStation 4 users. While Epic Games had expressed interest in having full cross-platform play across all available platforms, Sony's continued refusal to allow cross-play between the PlayStation 4 and other consoles rendered this impossible, according to Microsoft. Further, while players could use a single Epic Games account to share progress in Fortnite Battle Royale on all other platforms, those who used their PlayStation Network credentials to establish their Epic account cannot use that account on other platforms. The account restriction was confirmed to be as a result of Sony's initial decision to prohibit cross- platform play between its PlayStation 4 and other consoles, rather than a choice Epic had made. By September 2018, Sony had made a decision to allow cross-platform play for the PlayStation 4 for \\"select third-party titles\\", starting with Fortnite. A beta version of the PlayStation 4 client supporting this was released for the game on September 26, 2018, the same day as Sony's announcement. Tools to merge multiple Epic accounts as well as unlinking console accounts from an Epic account to attach to another were released in February 2019. The first full patch adding in cross-platform play support across all consoles was released in March 2019. Solo mobile players, or squads entirely consisting of mobile players will play solely with other mobile players by default for fairness; players however can use cross-platform play to join squads on other platforms, and matchmaking will consider all available matches. With the March 2019 for cross-platform play, the game will similar matchmake PlayStation 4 and Xbox One users by default to avoid these players being at a disadvantage against computer users. ===Promotion and marketing=== In May 2018, Epic announced a partnership with sports apparel manufacturing company IMG to produce official Fortnite-themed clothing. A Hasbro-licensed Fortnite Battle Royale-themed version of Monopoly was announced for release by late 2018; the Fortnite Monopoly game reflects some elements of the video game, such as the money being replaced with player's lives, and the ability to protect properties on the board with walls. Further, with this deal, Hasbro produced Fortnite-based Nerf blasters, which reached retail in 2019. Funko released a series of Fortnite themed Pop! figurines in late 2018. Fortnite Battle Royale has been packaged as special bundles with both the Xbox One and Nintendo Switch, each version providing redeemable codes for V-bucks and platform-unique customization options. A retail release of Fortnite Battle Royale, called Fortnite: Deep Freeze Bundle, was distributed by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch in late 2018. The package included a redeemable code for V-Bucks and unique in-game cosmetics. In October 2018, Epic launched its \\"Support a Creator\\" program for Fortnite. Individual players could designate one of several popular Fortnite streamers, selected by Epic via an application process, to support via the game client. That create would then earn money based on how many V-bucks their supporters spent within the game, at a rate of for every 10,000 V-Bucks (roughly, 5% of the monetary value). Though initially planned as a limited time event, Epic found by December 2018 that millions of Fortnite players were using the promotion to support more than 10,000 streamers, and since have made it a permanent option for Fortnite and hoping this would help some creators go full-time, and plans to extend this program to other games offered via the Epic Games Store, including Tom Clancy's The Division 2. In November 2018, Epic partnered with the National Football League (NFL) to make character skins for each of the 32 teams in the league available to purchase for a limited time. This was the result of the influence of Fortnite on NFL players, who had frequently performed Fortnite dance emotes as touchdown celebrations. == Esports == The Fortnite Pro-Am event at E3 2018 One of the first professional esports competitions using Fortnite was the Fortnite Pro-Am event, held on June 12, 2018 during E3 2018, with 3,000 in attendance. This tournament was announced after the success of the March 2018 stream by Ninja where he played alongside celebrities like Drake. The event featuring 50 celebrities paired with 50 top streaming players competing for prize pool of to be given to winning teams' charities. Ninja and his celebrity teammate Marshmello were the winners of this event. Additional Pro-Am events were held at E3 2019 in June 2019. In May 2018, Epic announced it was setting aside to fund various tournaments throughout the year to help grow Fortnite Battle Royale into an eSport. The first Fortnite World Cup tournament was announced in February 2019, with qualifying rounds in April through June 2019, and the finals held at the Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York City from July 26–28, 2019. A total prize pool of , including a payout to the winner of the solo and duo competitions, was given out. During mid-2018, Epic started running a Summer Skirmish series over eight weeks, each week having a different format, with to be offered to winners throughout the series. The series had some initial problems; the first week event was cut short due to technical issues with game servers, while the second event ended with accusations of cheating towards the winner which Epic later verified were not true. Epic launched its second competition play series, the Fall Skirmish, on September 21, 2018, with up to in prizes for winners. Starting with the game's tenth season in August 2019, Epic plans to run various Champion Series competitions for cash prizes. Each series is expected to have a different format, such as the first one slated to use squads of three. Each will have a number of qualifying weeks and a final tournament to determine winners across several geographic regions. Through PlayVS, Epic will sponsor high school and college-level Fortnite tournaments in the United States starting in 2020. ==Reception and legacyPlayer count and revenue=== Fortnite Battle Royale has become a phenomenon and has been compared by analysts to World of Warcraft and Minecraft for successfully drawing in people who do not usually play video games. Fortnite Battle Royale obtained over 10 million players two weeks after its release. By March 2018, it was estimated to have more than 45 million players. Three months later, in June 2018, Epic announced they had achieved over 125 million players in less than a year, with at least 40 million players playing the game once per month. In November 2018, Bloomberg reported that Fortnite had over 200 million registered accounts across all platforms. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney reported that the game had reached 250 million players by the time of the 2019 Game Developers Conference, with an estimated 35% of those players being female, the highest known percentage for any shooter game. By May 2020, Epic stated the game had over 350 million registered players. Individual platform releases saw initial surges in player counts. Within a day of becoming available, the Nintendo Switch version had been downloaded over 2 million times, according to Nintendo. Epic said that Fortnite had been downloaded over 15 million times for Android within three weeks of its launch. On the release of Season 5 in July 2018, Akamai Technologies reported that Fortnite traffic neared 37 terabytes per second, the largest recorded amount of traffic for any video game that they have observed. With its quarterly financial report ending September 30, 2018, Nintendo said that Fortnite Battle Royale had been downloaded on about half of all Switch systems they have sold, representing about 11.5 million downloads. Fortnite Battle Royale was made available to South Korea and their numerous PC bangs in November 2018; shortly after this point, Epic reported that Fortnite has surpassed a concurrent player count of 8.3 million, surpassing the game's previous record of 3.4 million in February 2018. Analysis firm SuperData estimated that Fortnite Battle Royale made over in February 2018, surpassing Battlegroundss revenues for the same period of . SuperData estimated Fortnites revenues over all platforms to exceed for the month of March. By April 2018, SuperData estimated that Fortnite Battle Royale had surpassed both sales and player count on all platforms over Battlegrounds. The game generated in revenue in April, followed by in May, according to SuperData. By July 2018, Fortnite Battle Royale had been estimated to have brought in over in revenue. Prior to the Season 5 start in July 2018, Sensor Tower estimated that the mobile version of Fortnite Battle Royale made over daily; following the launch of Season 5, revenues jumped to per day. SuperData estimated that Fortnite Battle Royale brought in in revenue during 2018, the highest annual revenue of any free-to-play title. SuperData estimated that Fortnite revenues dropped by 25% in 2019 to , attributing the drop to stabilization of expenditures for the game, and was still the highest revenue- earning game in 2019. At the time of Tencent's investment into Epic in 2012, Epic Games had a valuation. Because of Fortnite Battle Royale, Epic's valuation increased to . Bloomberg raised the estimate to around by the end of 2018 should Fortnite Battle Royale reach during the year. Partially due to the influx of revenue from Fortnite Battle Royale, Epic reduced its portion of sales it collected from the Unreal Engine Marketplace from 30% to 12% in July 2018, applying that retroactively to past sales. ===Viewership=== Fortnite Battle Royale has also had record viewership on various streaming services. One of the first major streams of Fortnite was in March 2018, in which Tyler \\"Ninja\\" Blevins hosted a stream that included Drake, Travis Scott, Kim DotCom, and Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster all playing the game. The stream broke over 635,000 concurrent viewers, making it the highest- watched stream on Twitch outside of esports tournaments at the time. YouTube streamer Rubén Doblas Gundersen held a Fortnite Battle Royale match with 99 other well-known YouTube streamers in late March, which drew over 1.1 million viewers, making it one of the most-watched gaming YouTube streams. The Fortnite Pro-Am event held at E3 2018 was estimated to have drawn over 1.3 million views across Twitch and other streaming services, making it one of the highest-viewed live-streamed event to date. Further live events set by Epic have continued to draw record numbers of stream viewers. The 2019 Fortnite World Cup drew 1.5 million viewers, while \\"The End\\" event that closed out Season X in October 2019 had 1.6 million. Even after the conclusion of the event, during the 36-hour period that the Fortnite game only showed a black screen with a spot of light on it, Fortnite streams had up to 327,000 viewers on Twitch and 437,000 viewers on YouTube watching the idle animation. Epic reported that over 7 million total viewers across Twitch, YouTube, and Twitter across \\"The End\\" event. The Chapter 2, Season 2 ending event in June 2020 had drawn 12 million in-game players with an additional 8.4 million watching through player streams. The single largest viewed in-game event was the Travis Scott in-game concert in April 2020, which drew 12.3 million in-game players to watch. ===Impact=== The Fortnite exhibition booth during the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018 Journalists attributed Fortnite Battle Royales success over PlayerUnknown Battlegrounds as a combination of several factors: besides being free-to-play and available on consoles, the game was released at a time when Battlegrounds was struggling with game cheaters and a toxic community, and that it features a less violent, cartoonish quality to it that, like Minecraft, was able to draw in a younger and mixed-gendered audiences to play. Further, Epic has maintained frequent updates for the game, adding new weapons and in-game tools alongside limited-time events and longer-term narrative elements that help to further draw in players. The high interest in the game within March 2018, which has been able to draw larger audiences compared to existing multiplayer games like Grand Theft Auto Online and Destiny 2, has had a financial impact on competing publishers Take-Two Interactive and Activision Blizzard, their stocks having fallen during this period, according to analysts from Morgan Stanley and KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. Activision's CEO Bobby Kotick, on their quarterly results released May 2018, stated that \\"Fortnite is definitely a lot of competition right now...it’s been a really important catalyst in attracting new gamers to gaming\\", and the company is looking to develop its own battle royale title. Electronic Arts CEO Blake Jorgensen also considered both Fortnite Battle Royale and Battlegrounds as having a significant market impact. Jorgensen said \\" [Fortnite is] bringing younger people into the marketplace and younger people into first-person shooters, and I think that's good for the long run health of that category for all of us in the industry\\". Non-video game entertainment companies have also seen the impact of Fortnite. Netflix, in reporting its Q4 2018 results, stated that their competition is more with Fortnite, including streaming content related to the game, rather than rival television network stations like HBO. Part of the game's success is also considered to be related to its impact on social media. By March 2018, Fortnite Battle Royale became the most-viewed game on Twitch, exceeding the average-concurrent viewership numbers of League of Legends and Battlegrounds. Blevins has gained significant attention as one of the first major Fortnite Battle Royale streamers. He gained a large number of subscribers by March 2018, in part due to his skill and through promotions on Twitch that offered free Fortnite Battle Royale cosmetic items; by March 2018, he was estimated to be making a month from his streaming revenue. By the end of 2018, Blevins had reported he had made nearly from his Fortnite streaming activities in 2018 with over 20 million subscribers to his YouTube and Twitch channels. For his success from Fortnite, Time included Blevins within its Time 100 most influential people of 2019. To acknowledge individuals like Blevins that had helped grow the popularity of Fortnite, Epic has released a number of in-game cosmetics under the \\"Icon Series\\" based on the real-life people; in addition to Blevins, cosmetics were released for musicians Marshmello and Major Lazer, and the streamer Loserfruit, with a planned release of cosmetics related to David \\"Grefg\\" Martínez. Fortnite cosplayers at E3 2018 A number of celebrities and athletes have said they play Fortnite Battle Royale, such as Chance the Rapper, Joe Jonas, Finn Wolfhard, Roseanne Barr, and Norm Macdonald. For athletes, their appreciation for the game has taken on the form of recreating the various emotes in game as part of their on-field celebration dances. Such Fortnite celebrations were frequently throughout the 2018 FIFA World Cup event in June and July 2018, including by Antoine Griezmann after a scoring penalty kick during the 2018 FIFA World Cup Final. Other notable people have expressed their fondness for the game; the Russo brothers, directors of Avengers: Infinity War, stated that they often played Fortnite Battle Royale during breaks on the film's development, leading them to propose the idea of the Thanos LTM for the game. The awareness of the game from well- known celebrities has been considered a reason for further popularity and player growth of the game. ===In popular culture=== Fortnite Battle Royale has been jokingly referred to as \\"Fork Knife\\" on social media, believed to have originated with people, unfamiliar with the game, described their friends and family spending time playing the game. Epic added a harvestable, non-playable \\"Fork Knife\\" food truck to the game map as the term gained popularity. In September 2018, Fortnite was featured as a question on the game show Jeopardy!, and was spoofed in a skit on the September 29, 2018, episode of Saturday Night Live. The South Park episode \\"The Scoots\\" featured the cast wearing Fortnite-based Halloween costumes. In The Big Bang Theory episode \\"The Citation Negation\\", Bernadette attempts to learn how to play Fortnite Battle Royale to beat Howard. Fortnite also makes an easter egg appearance in the Disney animated film Ralph Breaks the Internet. The game was also was a central focal point on the 2018 YouTube Rewind year retrospective, and included an appearance by the popular Fortnite streamer Ninja. In addition to there being a tie-in LTM for Avengers: Endgame, Fortnite conversely appears in the film, in which it is played by Korg in New Asgard, a village inhabited by Asgardian refugees recuperating from the devastating events of Thor: Ragnarok and Avengers: Infinity War. == Past and ongoing concerns Parental concerns=== With the release of the mobile version, teachers, parents, and students have found that the game had become popular to younger players due to the free-to-play nature, its cartoonish art style, and its social nature. This carries over into schools, which has been seen as a disruptive element within the classroom and affecting students' ability to complete homework assignments. Epic has since added warnings on the game's loading screens to discourage students from playing it during classes. The UK's Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Matt Hancock, expressed concern at how much time children were playing Fortnite Battle Royale and similar video games without a balance of physical exercise and social interactions. Other agencies, including the United States' Center on Media and Child Health and the United Kingdom's National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children have cautioned parents that children may be influenced by the violent behavior due to Fortnite Battle Royale. Prince Harry, speaking about various influences of social media on children in April 2019, proposed a possible ban on Fortnite Battle Royale, saying, \\"The game shouldn't be allowed\\", and \\"It's created to addict. An addiction to keep you in front of a computer for as long as possible. It's so irresponsible.\\" A Montreal law firm filed to seek a class-action lawsuit against Epic Games asserting that Epic has known the game is addictive but fail to give this warning to players. At the same time, parents have expressed appreciation for Fortnite to have their children engage socially outside of their core groups of friends in a game that is otherwise not excessively violent, or see offering Fortnite as a reward for encouraging children to do well in school, offering their children the purchase of V-bucks in exchange for good grades. Some parents see potential in their children becoming skilled in Fortnite as to become professional players and compete for part of the large prize pools, creating a market for tutors to help children improve their skills in the game. At the same time, as Fortnite Battle Royale became a social hangout for younger players, issues of peer pressure and bullying have been raised. Cosmetic skins are seen as a sign of skill and status, so younger players spend money to get the rarer skins to appear equal with their friends, or may be taunted by other players for not having such skins and using the game's \\"default\\" skins. Other issues related to children's interest in Fortnite have been raised. Several of the security issues raised around the game are heightened with younger players who may not easily recognize such illicit schemes and put themselves at risk to privacy invasion. There is some concern that online child sexual predators would be able to easily make contact with underage players, with at least one documented case from Florida. === Security issues === Fortnites popularity has drawn a network of hackers since March 2018 that target accounts with lucrative skins and emotes as to resell those accounts to other users. Some of those hackers, speaking anonymously to the BBC, stated they were making thousands of British pounds a week through these actions. Authorities that monitor the dark web have found that Fortnite Battle Royale has become a popular way to engage in credit card fraud: criminals with access to stolen credit card information use that to purchase V-bucks on a freshly-made Fortnite account when they then sell through services like eBay players at a discount, often preying on children and young adults with these schemes. Separately, other security experts such as Check Point have found exploits with Fortnite and its underlying services that allowed hackers to gain access to some accounts, enabling them to gain personal details, buy V-bucks, and listen in to the account's owner when they use the game's voice chat system. Epic has closed a key exploit that enabled this by January 2019. A class-action lawsuit was filed in August 2019 over this breach, acknowledging while Epic did fix the problem, it failed to notified the users that were affected by it. Epic has taken action against players that have used in-game hacks, like aimbots, to gain a competitive edge when these are discovered. In one notable case, Jarvis Khattri, a member of FaZe Clan, was given a lifetime Fortnite ban in November 2019 after he had posted a video which showed how aimbots within Fortnite worked, despite having cautioned his viewers to not use aimbots nor providing details of how to acquire the aimbot. The ban was controversial as Khattri had developed his esports career on Fortnite, and FaZe Clan had started discussions with Epic Games to reduce the ban in context of the video clip. ===Dance emotes lawsuits=== The popularity of Fortnites dance emotes, which borrow from dance moves in popular culture, have led the creators of these dances to express concern and take legal action about these moves being sold by Epic, even though the United States Copyright Office had issued statements that individual dance moves are uncopyrightable. These include rapper 2 Milly regarding his \\"Milly Rock\\", and actor Donald Faison related to a dance move he used on the TV show Scrubs. 2 Milly has started taking legal action against Epic with copyright infringement over the \\"Milly Rock\\"-based dance emote as well as asserting claims against personality rights under California law. Actor Alfonso Ribeiro filed a similar suit against Epic for their \\"Fresh\\" emote dance, which Ribeiro says was directly based on his character Carlton Banks' dance from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. \\"Backpack Kid\\" Russell Horning, whose dance move the Floss was popularized through live performance with Katy Perry, has also initiated legal action against Epic for copyright infringement of his dance. Another lawsuit by the parent of the child that created a popular \\"Orange Shirt Kid\\" dance has also filed a lawsuit against Epic on similar grounds; in this case, while the child had submitted the dance for an Epic-run contest for a new Fortnite dance emote, he did not win, but fans petitioned Epic to include the dance anyway. The lawsuit challenges that the child was not recognized or compensated for the dance move. BlocBoy JB filed another suit against Epic over his \\"Shoot\\" dance move, represented by the in- game \\"Hype\\" emote, by late January 2019. Jared Nickens and Jaylen Brantley filed a lawsuit against Epic in February 2019, seeking in damages for Epic's use of their \\"Running Man\\" dance. In at least one of these cases, that from 2 Milly, Epic is seeking the suit to be dismissed claiming that a simple dance move cannot be copyrighted, according to guidance issued by the United States Copyright Office. In March 2019, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corp. v. Wall-Street.com, an unrelated case, that a copyright infringement lawsuit cannot commence until the Copyright office registered the copyright. As the Copyright office has refused to register some of these dance emotes as copyrights, four of the six pending suits (2 Milly, Ribeiro, Backpack Kid and Orange Shirt Kid) were withdrawn within a few days. The firm that represented the four cases, Pierce Bainbridge Beck Price & Hect, stated this was merely a procedural withdrawal until they completed the registrations with the Copyright office. A seventh suit was filed by Leo Pellegrino, a saxophone player known for his dances during his performances. Unlike previous cases, Pellegrino's case accuses Epic Games of misappropriation of his trademarked likeness over an in-game emote that has a player's character dance while playing a saxophone, rather than any specific dance move. A federal district judge ruled in March 2020 that Fortnite sufficiently transforms Pellegrino's move from his overall likeness to qualify for First Amendment protections, and summarily ruled against all but one of Pellegrino's other claims. The claim of false endorsement was allowed to remain but still will be reviewed by the courts. After receiving a complaint from comedian Matt Geiler over a combination of a dance emote and cosmetic skin that he claimed infringe on his character of the \\"Dancing Pumpkin Man\\", Epic preemptively filed a request to the courts in December 2019 to rule that their emote and cosmetics do not infringe on Geiler's trademark or copyright. Since then, Epic had worked with a dance creator to work the dance emote into the game, such as with musician Rick Astley to add a dance based on his song \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\" (normally associated with rickrolling). Similar suits have been filed against the same dance moves used in 2K Games' NBA 2K games, while the offending dance moves were removed in January 2019 from the game Forza Horizon 4, though it is unknown if this was due to legal action. In the lawsuit involving Riberio's dance, the Copyright Office had refused to grant Riberio a copyright for the dance, not only because they considered it a \\"simple dance routine\\", but also because Riberio had created the dance in context of another copyrighted work, so he would likely be unable to claim ownership. ===Apple and Google lawsuits=== On August 13, 2020, Epic announced it was permanently discounting the price of V-bucks across all platforms by 20%, except for those purchased directly through the iOS App Store and Google Play storefronts. For the mobile platforms, Epic created its own purchasing option that allowed players to purchase directly from Epic bypassing Apple and Google. Epic said that they could not offer this discount to those purchasing through Apple or Google's storefronts due to the 30% fee both took from each sale, which was seen by journalists as yet another means to challenge the 30% fee. Later that day, both Apple and Google removed Fortnite from their stores, both claiming that the payment system violates the store terms. The removals prevent players from downloading the game but not playing it if they already own it. The game still remained available on the Samsung Galaxy Store for Samsung devices as well as directly from Epic Games via their sideloaded app for all Android devices. Epic immediately filed a lawsuit against Apple over \\"unfair and anti-competitive actions\\", along with releasing a short \\"Nineteen Eighty-Fortnite\\" parodying Apple's \\"1984\\" advertisement to explain the reasonings for filing the lawsuit. Epic filed a similar lawsuit against Google the same day. While the game remained playable for users that previously downloaded it, its removal from the iOS App Store left Epic the inability to update the game, which it used to caution players on social media that they will miss out on the upcoming new season starting August 27; Epic also cautioned macOS similarly that they would be unable to update their version as well. Epic was denied a preliminary injunction on August 24, 2020, that would have forced Apple to keep the game on the App Store, thus leaving the game unable to update on iOS. Epic had also believed that Apple was terminating the ability for users with Epic account linked through Apple to log in using their Apple ID by September 11, 2020, but Apple confirmed they would not be disabling this feature. === Other legal issues === In January 2018, Bluehole's PUBG Corp., the South Korean company behind PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG), filed a lawsuit against Epic Games, claiming that Fortnite Battle Royale was a copyright infringement of Battlegrounds; they accused Epic Games of copying PUBGs user interface and game items. According to Korea Times, market observers predicted that there would be little likelihood of Bluehole winning the case, as it would be difficult to establish the originality of PUBG in court due to the battle royale game genre, which includes both PUBG and Fortnite Battle Royale, being derived from the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale. The case has since closed, with PUBG Corp. dropping the lawsuit in June 2018 under undisclosed reasons. In May 2018, Epic Games filed a lawsuit against quality assurance tester Thomas Hannah after he leaked information regarding Season 4. Hannah, who had joined Epic in December 2017, breached the non-disclosure agreement by sharing details of the Season with Adam DiMarco. DiMarco later shared information in a Reddit post, spoiling the theme of the Season. Epic stated that Hannah \\"diminished the enjoyment of the people who play, or who watch others play, Fortnite by ruining the suspense that had been building in the Fortnite community in anticipation of upcoming season\\". In October 2017, Epic Games filed civil complaints against two associates of the website Addicted Cheats, which for a payment provided cheating services to players. The company argued that the two defendants made and used altered game breaking code that was against the End User License Agreement and the Copyright Act. In October 2018, Epic Games sued YouTuber Brandon Lucas, who posts videos on the channel, Golden Modz. The lawsuit details that Lucas, cheats at the game and \\"promotes, advertises and sells software that enables those who use it to cheat.\\" The lawsuit also names Lucas's secondary website in which visitors are encouraged to purchase the hack and/or Fortnite user accounts preloaded with hacks. Epic also sent FNBRLeaks, a group that datamined the files Fortnite to determine new features and events that were likely coming in the near future, a cease & desist letter in December 2018, stating that their reporting of these upcoming features were negatively harming Epic and spoiling the game for the players. FNBRLeaks complied with the terms of the letter. Epic initiated a lawsuit in October 2019 against a Fortnite experience tester that leaked details of the Chapter 2 transition days before the event occurred, which included details of the map and mechanics, stating the tester broke confidentiality agreements. Epic filed a second similar lawsuit in November 2019 against a tester out of Keywords Studio in Montreal over similar Chapter 2 leaks that were in breach of the terms of their non-disclosure agreement. The company that oversees the Coral Castle structure in Miami-Dade County, Florida filed a lawsuit against Epic Games in August 2020, on trademark infringement over use of the name \\"Coral Castle\\" associated with the location the game introduced in Chapter 2, Season 3. The suit contends that the name along with the nautical theme created confusing with their landmark. ==NotesReferences Further reading == * ==External links== * Category:2017 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Battle royale games Category:Early access video games Category:Epic Games games Battle Royale Category:Free-to-play video games Category:IOS games Category:MacOS games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation 5 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Third-person shooters Category:Unreal Engine games Category:Video games containing battle passes Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games with cross-platform play Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games Category:Xbox One X enhanced games Category:Xbox Series X and Series S games ","title":"Fortnite Battle Royale"},{"id":"56819897","text":"Alan Gertner (born 1984) is a Canadian businessman.

Common names include the spiny-headed tunicate, the hairy sea squirt, the stalked hairy sea squirt and the bristly tunicate. This species was first described in 1864 by the American marine biologist William Stimpson who gave it the name Cynthia villosa. It was later transferred to the genus Boltenia. The type locality is Puget Sound, Washington state, United States. ==Description== A solitary, barrel shaped tunicate, Boltenia villosa can grow to a height of about and a width of . It has a small base and is attached to the substrate by a stalk that may be short or long. The tunic is thickly clad with short, bristly, unbranched projections. The siphons, which may be difficult to see, are orange or red, and the tunic is light brown or orangish- red. This tunicate is similar in appearance to Boltenia echinata, which is found in the northern Atlantic Ocean, but the hair-like processes are more numerous, shorter and lack the radial branches that are present in B. echinata. ==Distribution== The species is found in the northeastern Pacific Ocean and the Arctic Ocean, at depths from the lower intertidal zone down to about . It is found on both shelly and muddy bottoms. ==Ecology== Various tunicates concentrate the element vanadium in their body tissues, but B. villosa does this to a greater extent than most other species. Like other tunicates, it is a suspension feeder, drawing water in through the buccal siphon, extracting planktonic particles and expelling the water and waste through the atrial siphon. It feeds mainly on the larvae of crustaceans and molluscs, and on the eggs of various organisms. Sometimes a small crab or some copepods live symbiotically inside the body cavity. B. villosa is preyed on by the Oregon hairy triton (Fusitriton oregonensis), the leather star (Dermasterias imbricata) and the rainbow star (Orthasterias koehleri). ==References== Category:Stolidobranchia Category:Fauna of the Arctic Ocean Category:Fauna of the Pacific Ocean Category:Animals described in 1864 ","title":"Boltenia villosa"},{"id":"56819934","text":"Terence Stephen \\"Terry\\" Morrall (born 24 November 1938) is an English former footballer, who played as a defender.

The district gained small areas to the south and west from Airdrie, Chestermere-Rocky View and Livingstone- Macleod, including the entirety of Kananaskis Country. The Commission also decided to join the Stoney Reserves and Tsuu T'ina Reserve into the same district for representation purposes. ==Electoral results2010s=== {  !colspan=\\"5\\" align=centerRedistributed results, 2015 Alberta election } ==References== Category:Alberta provincial electoral districts Category:Banff, Alberta Category:Canmore, Alberta ","title":"Banff-Kananaskis"},{"id":"56820035","text":"Phallusia fumigata is a tunicate species of marine invertebrate in the genus Phallusia of the family Styelidae. ==References External links == * DORIS * World Register of Marine Species * Animal Diversity Web * NCBI Category:Stolidobranchia ","title":"Phallusia fumigata"},{"id":"56820041","text":"Mitromorpha jaguaensis is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Mitromorphidae.MolluscaBase (2018).

The theory held that mountains formed by vertical movements associated with volcanism.Şengör (1982), p. 4 The idea held that magma and volcanic activity formed mountains was expressed as early as 1777 by Peter Simon Pallas, who claimed the Urals and Altai Mountains had formed that way. Pallas based his ideas by an granitic central axis that he had observed in those mountains. The theory was revived and elaborated further by Leopold von Buch in the 19th century. Observations supporting this view were also given by Alexander von Humboldt in his book Kosmos.Şengör (1982), p. 5 Humbold and Buch considered basaltic volcanism to be linked to elevation craters and trachyte to be the product of \\"true volcanoes\\". Otto Wilhelm Hermann von Abich applied the theory to the Caucasus Mountains and, following the views of Buch and Humboldt, linked mountain building to volcanism, which led him to take interest in the volcanoes of the Caucasus in the area. The geologist Bernhard Studer refined the idea further. Working in the Alps, he considered the mountains to be roughly symmetrical with a Mittelzone containing the igneous rocks that he believed had uplifted the Alps. The rocks were grouped in twelve Centralmassen. To the north and the south of the Mittelzone were two equivalent marginal zones: Nörliche Nebenzone and Südliche Nebenzone. The theory, as posited by Studer, was popular among geologists in Switzerland and nearby areas until the 1870s.Şengör (1982), p. 6 ==ReferencesBibliography== * Category:Obsolete geological theories ","title":"Elevation crater"},{"id":"56820057","text":"Mitromorpha sanctaluciaensis is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Mitromorphidae.MolluscaBase (2018).

In her book Religion in Britain since 1945, she coined the phrase \\"believing without belonging\\" to describe religiosity and secularization in Britain. This is the argument that although church attendance has decreased, people may still think of themselves as religious on an individual level. With this and other works, Davie entered the international ongoing debate on secularization, after Rodney Stark and other American scholars had observed that quantitative data about the United States did not confirm the theory defended in Europe by Karel Dobbelaere and Steve Bruce, implying that modernization necessarily causes a decline of religion. European defenders of secularization theories suggested that an “American exceptionalism” explained why a generally valid hypothesis did not apply to the United States, due to some unique circumstances prevailing there. Davie reversed this theory, and suggested the existence of a “European exceptionalism,” explaining why classic secularization theories are valid in Europe but cannot be verified in the rest of the world.BROWN, Callum G. (2004), review of Europe. The exceptional case: Parameters of faith in the modern world by Grace Davie, The Journal of Ecclesiastical History, vol. 55, no. 2, pp. 442-443. To explain European exceptionalism, Davie introduced yet another new concept, “vicarious religion,” meaning that modern Europeans are happy to “delegate” to a minority of active believers participation in regular church activities, something they approve of but are no longer ready to engage in. This theory was also criticized by those who adhere to classic theories of secularization, who claimed that a generalized sympathy for the religious minority among the non- religious majority cannot be unequivocally demonstrated.BRUCE, Steve and VOAS, David (2010), “Vicarious Religion: An Examination and Critique,” Journal of Contemporary Religion, vol. 25, no. 2, pp. 243–259. == Career == Davie has written several works during her career, including Religion in Britain since 1945 (1994), Religion in Modern Europe (2000), Europe: the Exceptional Case (2002), The Sociology of Religion (2013) and Religion in Britain: A Persistent Paradox (2015). Davie has an undergraduate degree in Sociology from the University of Exeter, and a PhD from the London School of Economics. From 2000 to 2001 she was the Kerstin-Hesselgren Professor at the University of Uppsala in Sweden. She was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Theology from the University of Uppsala in 2008. Davie is Past-President of the Association for the Sociology of Religion (2003) and the International Sociological Association RC22 Sociology of Religion Board (2002-2006). Davie is a participating researcher in The Impact of Religion: Challenges for Society, Law and Democracy (IMPACT), a multidisciplinary research programme at Uppsala University, in the research area Religious and Social Change.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It currently operates as a restaurant. ==History== The Hirst Hotel was built in 1891 by John Hirst to cater to the flow of railroad passengers passing through Holly. Having the largest and finest dining room in the area, the hotel rapidly became the social center of the surrounding community. The hotel itself was one of the best in the area, and attracted guests such as Michigan Governors Thomas E. Dewey and G. Mennen Williams and temperance crusader Carrie Nation. In 1912, businessman Joseph P. Allen bought the building. In 1913, the hotel suffered a disastrous fire, completely destroying the second and third floors. Allen rebuilt the structure, but in a somewhat more modest style, with a shorter tower, plainer second floor fenestration, and plainer porches. The hotel reopened as the Allendorf in late 1913. In 1913, Henry Norton purchased the building, redecorated it, and renamed it the Hotel Norton. However, as the passenger train traffic dwindled and finally stopped, the hotel became less desirable, and the building eventually became just a local restaurant. In 1978, the hotel suffered another disastrous fire. Local resident Dr. Leslie Sher purchased the building and began restoring it, rebuilding the roof and tower to the original 1891 design. The building was reopened in 1979 as a restaurant. Every state governor since that time has dined at the Holly Hotel, as well as President George H. W. Bush during his 1992 campaign. ==Description== The Holly Hotel is a 2-1/2 story rectangular red brick Queen Anne structure with a hip roof, measuring about 50 feet wide by 75 feet long. A three-story, helmet-domed, octagonal corner tower is located between two primary facades. The longer facade facing Battle Alley is asymmetrical, containing a columned porch sheltering a pair of entry doors flanked by single windows on one side and two, large, tripartite windows under broad segmental arches on the other. The second floor has plain, one-over-one sash openings. Two large gabled dormers covered with shingling are located low on the steeply pitched hip roof. The narrower elevation facing Broad Street is symmetrical, with a central entrance topped with a small-paned transom and flanked by segmentally arched, tripartite windows of the same type as those on the Battle Alley elevation. A small porch shelters the entrance. On the second floor are three one-over-one sash windows. A tall gable above contains three, closely spaced, plain, one- over-one, sash windows. ==References * Holly Hotel Category:National Register of Historic Places in Oakland County, Michigan Category:Queen Anne architecture in Michigan Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1891 ","title":"Holly Hotel"},{"id":"56820377","text":"Baseball Punx is a short American documentary about the intersection of baseball and punk rock directed by Jak Kerley. ==Outline== Baseball Punx was shot over a two-year period, primarily by Jak Kerley with a very small crew.

Developed since the early 18th century, it is one of the town's oldest farms, with a long association with the Lamb family, early settlers and important in the development of the Lambtown area of the community. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. ==Description and history== The Lamb Homestead is located in a rural area of southern Ledyard, on Lambtown Road east of Center Groton Road (Connecticut Route 117). The property now consists of about , most of which is south of the road, with the farmhouse on the north side and a barn on the south side. The house is of great antiquity, dated according to family lore to about 1711. It is a 2-1/2 story timber framed structure, with a side gable roof, central brick chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance framed by Federal period pilasters and corniced entablature. Second story windows are set butted against the eave, a typical early-to-mid 18th century placement. The interior retains many 18th-century features, including wide floor boards of oak, pine, and chestnut, a large fireplace hearth in the kitchen, and several doors with original handwrought strap hinges. The house is accompanied by a modern garage and shed. The barn across the street appears to date to about 1900. The property was, according to family history, settled about 1714 by Isaac Lamb, who had previously owned property in nearby Mystic. The family traditionally gives this date as that for construction of the house, even though many of its finishing features are of later 18th century styles. A house was documented to stand here in 1731, when Lamb's sons divided the property. The Lambs were prominent in the establishment of the Baptist congregation of Groton, the first of that sect in the state, and maintained association with the congregation well into the 19th century. At the time the property (reduced from a maximum of over ) was listed on the National Register in 1991, it was still held by the Lamb family. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in New London County, Connecticut ==References== Category:Farms on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in New London County, Connecticut Category:American colonial architecture Category:Ledyard, Connecticut ","title":"Lamb Homestead"},{"id":"56820416","text":"The 1931 World Table Tennis Championships – Women's Doubles was the fourth edition of the women's doubles championship.

Mad studies originated from consumer/survivor movements organized in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and in other parts of the world. The methods for inquiry draw from a number of academic disciplines such as women's studies, critical race studies, indigenous epistemologies, queer studies, psychological anthropology, and ethnography. This field shares theoretical similarities to critical disability studies, psychopolitics, and critical social theory. The academic movement formed, in part, as a response to recovery movements, which many mad studies scholars see as being \\"co-opted\\" by mental health systems. == Origins and scope == Richard A. Ingram, a senior research fellow in the School of Disability Studies at Ryerson University (2007), has been credited with coining the phrase \\"Mad Studies\\" at the First Regional Graduate/Undergraduate Student Disability Studies Conference at Syracuse University on May 3, 2008. In an academic article entitled \\"Doing Mad Studies: Making (Non)sense Together,\\" Ingram points to a number of theorists who created the intellectual groundwork for the field, including Nietzsche, Bataille, Blanchot, Deleuze, and Guattari. In a 2014 Guardian article, Peter Beresford names Canadian scholars at the forefront of this academic field: \\"Mad studies has been pioneered by Ryerson and York Universities in Toronto, with key figures such as mental health survivors, activists and educators David Reville and Geoffrey Reaume and academics Kathryn Church and Brenda LeFrancois.\\" Journalist Alex Gillis summarizes the spread of mad studies programs in a November 2015 article: \\"Soon after Ryerson and York launched mad studies courses in the early 2000s, similar courses began in Simon Fraser University’s department of sociology and anthropology, and more recently at Memorial University’s school of social work, Queen’s University’s school of kinesiology and health studies, and the history departments at Trent University and the University of Winnipeg. A few universities in England, Scotland and the Netherlands launched courses in the past two years, using Canadian courses as models.\\" Some dimensions of this emerging field may include research on the \\"social construction of 'mental illness, normalizing imperatives of the state and medicine, rapidly expanding nosologies (categories of pathology) for mental illness, collusion(s) of pharmaceutical corporations and professional associations within psychiatry, connections between ecocide and mental stress, psychiatrization of nonhuman animals, representation(s) of madness in media, history of consumer/survivor movement(s), and the rise and fall of mental treatments within scientific, medical, and lay communities.\\" == Conferences and symposiums == * June 12–15, 2008, Simon Fraser University, Madness, Citizenship, and Social Justice Conference * May 2012, Ryerson University, International Conference on Mad Studies * September 9–11, 2014, Lancaster University, Disability Studies Conference (stream that focused on Mad Studies) * May 2015, Bergen, Norway, Nordic Network for Disability Research, Mad Studies Symposium * June 17, 2015, Liverpool, UK, PsychoPolitics in the Twenty First Century: Peter Sedgwick and Radical Movements in Mental Health * June 2015, Lancaster University, Mad Studies and Neurodiversity- Exploring Connections * September 30 - October 1, 2015, Durham University, UK, Making Sense of Mad Studies * September 6–8, 2016, Lancaster University, Disability Studies Conference (stream that focused on Mad Studies) * September 11–13, 2018, Lancaster University, Disability Studies Conference (stream that focused on Mad Studies) ==Key texts== * This is Survivor Research (2009) * Mad at School: Rhetorics of Mental Disability and Academic Life (2011) * Mad Matters: A Critical Reader in Canadian Mad Studies (2013) * Psychiatry Disrupted: Theorizing Resistance and Crafting the (R)evolution (2014) * Decolonizing Global Mental Health: The Psychiatrization of the Majority World (2014) * Disability Incarcerated: Imprisonment and Disability in the United States and Canada (2014) * Madness, Distress, and the Politics of Disablement (2015) * Psychiatry and the Business of Madness: An Ethical and Epistemological Accounting (2015) * Searching for a Rose Garden: Challenging Psychiatry, Fostering Mad Studies (2016) * Deportation and the Confluence of Violence within Forensic Mental Health and Immigration Systems (2015) ==References== Category:Identity politics Category:Interdisciplinary subfields of sociology Category:Mental health ","title":"Mad studies"},{"id":"56820503","text":"Liwagao Island, also known as Libago Island or Libagao Island, is an island located southeast off the coast of Mindoro and northwest off Panay. The island is a disputed feature between the towns of Bulalacao, Oriental Mindoro and Caluya, Antique with the latter exercising de facto administration over the island. ==Background== The island has an area of . It is currently under the administration of Caluya town of Antique. It is administered by the town as part of Barangay Sibolo. In 1919 its elevation was recorded at , and at this time it was noted that the island had a few inhabitants, was \\"covered with low, dark scrubby trees\\" and was \\"fringed by reefs.\\" At this time it was noted that three summits exist on the eastern area of the island and that the island's western area is \\"a low, flat sandy point.\\" ==DisputeBulalacao claim=== Presidential Decree No. 1801 issued by then President Ferdinand Marcos on November 10, 1978 which declared select islands, coves, and peninsulas in the Philippines as tourist zones and marine reserves under the management of the Philippine Tourism Authority names Liwagao Island as part of Bulalacao town of Oriental Mindoro. The provincial government of Oriental Mindoro cites this decree as proof of Bulalacao's jurisdiction over the island which it considers as part of Maasin, one of the town's barangays. The Oriental Mindoro provincial board sought to resolve its claims over Liwagao Island by engaging in talks with their counterparts in Antique. The Antique provincial board issued a resolution on May 25, 2012 stating that it is not amenable \\"to any form of settlement on the alleged dispute\\" involving the island. Oriental Mindoro officials filed a petition before the Regional Trial Court in Roxas, Capiz on September 12, 2012. Occidental Mindoro officials cites affidavits submitted by residents of Liwagao on August 2012 who expressed desire that their island be under the jurisdiction of Bulalacao and an affidavit submitted also on August by Oscar Lim, former mayor of Caluya testifying of making a \\"verbal agreement\\" in 1978 or 1979 with then-Bulalacao mayor Dolores Bago of \\"temporarily borrowing\\" Liwagao until the end of his term to pursue fugitives escaping from Caluya authorities. Lim said hed had returned Liwagao to Bulalacao under Bago's successor and brother, Guillermo Salas. The island due to its beaches is planned to be developed for tourism by the officials of Bulalacao and Oriental Mindoro. ===Caluya claim=== Resolution No. 142-2012 of the Provincial Board of Antique expressed Antique province's position in the dispute. It asserts that Liwagao is within its territorial jurisdiction citing an original certificate of title 42891 issued by the Register of Deeds to Joaquin Lim which identified the contested island as part of Barangay Sibolo of the town of Caluya. It also cites the records of the Commission on Election which contains names of Liwagao residents who are registered as voters of Sibolo as well as elected barangay officials from the locality that are residents of the island. It also points out that a map by the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority displays the island as geographically part of Antique. ==References== Category:Islands of Oriental Mindoro Category:Islands of Antique (province) Category:Internal territorial disputes of the Philippines ","title":"Liwagao Island"},{"id":"56820507","text":"Family tree of the First Dynasty of Egypt, ruling ancient Egypt in the 32nd century BCE to the 30th century BCE. ==Chart== 01 04 Family tree Category:32nd century BC in Egypt Category:31st century BC in Egypt Category:30th century BC in Egypt ","title":"First Dynasty of Egypt family tree"},{"id":"56820534","text":"2018 UK higher education strike placards The University and College Union (UCU), a trade union representing 110,000 staff at UK universities, ran a major series of connected strikes in 2018, 2019, and 2020. The action has been characterised as \\"something of a milestone\\" for \\"impending service sector strikes of the 21st century\\". In 2018, the dispute concerned proposed changes to the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS). In 2019–20, strike action on USS continued, and action on a parallel dispute over pay equality, workload, casualisation, and pay levels was added.Bethan Staton, 'Universities face 8-day strike as disputes rumble on', Financial Times (5 November 2019). The first strike began in February 2018. This strike escalated over fourteen strike days between 22 February and 20 March, and took place at sixty-four universities across the UK, represented by Universities UK (UUK). This was the longest ever strike in UK higher-education history. The Office for National Statistics found that in 2018, 66% of all working days lost to strike action were accounted for by the education sector, \\"due mainly to disputes involving employees of universities\\".\\"Labour disputes in the UK: 2018\\" (17 May 2019). An estimated 42,000 staff went on strike with 575,000 teaching hours being lost. By 28 March, over 700 external examiners had also recorded their resignations in a UCU document. As of 28 March 2018, more than a million students were estimated to have been affected, with 126,000 students signing petitions calling for fee refunds. Students also occupied campus buildings in support of striking staff at more than a dozen universities.Thomas Hale, 'The strange economics of the university strikes ', Financial Times (22 February 2018). From 25 November to 4 December 2019, and on fourteen days between 20 February and 13 March 2020, UCU undertook further strikes, partly in a continuation of the pensions dispute which triggered the strikes in 2018, and partly in a parallel dispute over pay equality, workload, casualisation, and pay levels. In this second dispute, universities were represented by the Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA). During the period covered by this article, strikes also took place on local disputes at individual universities, covered in the table of all strike action below. ==Background to the strikes== Non-staff costs as a proportion of universities' total expenditure: UK average 2006–15, rising from around 42% to around 45%, according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency. UK university pay and student income, 2006–16, inflation-adjusted to 2017 prices. Over the period, total spending per student rises by around £2000; vice-chancellors' remuneration rises by £21873; professors' pay falls by £7544; and average pay across all academic staff falls by £4304. The United Kingdom has 130 universities. Staff at 68 universities founded before 1992 are members of the USS pension scheme. (Most academic staff at institutions which became universities after 1992 are members of the Teachers' Pension Scheme, which is unaffected by this dispute.) In January 2018, UCU members at 61 universities (initially) balloted in favour of action over the proposed pension changes. As reporting, both in the UK and abroad, noted, the strikes took place in the context of other tensions over higher education and pension provision in the UK, as follows.'Striking dons add to UK students’ resentments ', The Financial Times (20 February 2018).Richard Adams, 'Theresa May to reveal details of tuition fee overhaul on Monday ', The Guardian (16 February 2018).Sebastian Borger, '[www.fr.de/wissen/grossbritannien-professoren-wollen-universitaeten- lahmlegen-a-1452510 Professoren wollen Universitäten lahmlegen]', Frankfurther Rundschau, 74.44 (21 February 2018), p. 23.Daniel Zylbersztajn, 'Stillstand an den Unis ', Taz (22 February 2018).Steven Parfitt, 'Lecturers on Strike ', Jacobin (21 February 2018). ===National UK higher education policy=== * Debates about tuition fee levels and the mechanisms for paying them. In particular, on 19 February 2018, the UK Prime Minister Theresa May had announced an official review of UK higher education funding.Sean Coughlan, 'Theresa May's university review will not scrap fees ', BBC News (19 February 2018). * The increasingly corporate and privatised character of higher education institutions. For example, universities, whose capital expenditure had traditionally been funded to a significant extent by government funding, were increasingly borrowing from private capital markets, making them concerned about their credit ratings, and with uncertain consequences for their finances and governance.Thomas Hale, 'Universities and the allure of capital markets ', Financial Times (6 March 2018).Rosemary Bennett, Nicola Woolcock and Ryan Watts, 'University debt: credit crunch looms as debt spirals', The Times (3 January 2019), https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/university-debt-credit-crunch-looms-as- debt-spirals. * The creation of the Office for Students on 1 January 2018, whose powers came into force 1 April 2018. For example, on 28 February 2018, the OFS said that \\"universities that fail to mitigate the impact of the strikes would open themselves up to regulatory intervention\\".Harry Yorke, 'Universities told they face fines if strikes harm students', The Daily Telegraph (27 February 2018), 2. ===Pensions=== The USS pension scheme The USS scheme was created in 1974 to provide sector-wide pensions for UK university staff (focusing on academic staff).Douglas Logan, The Birth of a Pension Scheme. A History of the Universities Superannuation Scheme (Liverpool University Press 1985). Its terms changed little until 2011, when major reforms were implemented, followed by further changes in 2014–15.Emmanouil Platanakis and Charles Sutcliffe, 'Asset–Liability Modelling and Pension Schemes: The Application of Robust Optimization to USS', The European Journal of Finance (2015), 1-29, doi:10.1080/1351847X.2015.1071714.Emmanouil Platanakis and Charles Sutcliffe, 'Pension Schemes, Taxation and Stakeholder Wealth: The USS Rule Changes', ICMA Centre, Discussion Paper Number: ICM-2017-08 (23 January 2018): https://ssrn.com/abstract=3039364; .Jack Grove, 'New USS Pension Reform Plans to be Put to Union Vote ', Times Higher Education (15 January 2015). These changes left scheme members markedly worse off: one academic study concluded that the reduced wealth of post-2011 entrants was equivalent to an 11% drop in their total compensation or a 13% drop in their salaries.Emmanouil Platanakis and Charles Sutcliffe, 'Pension Scheme Redesign and Wealth Redistribution Between the Members and Sponsor: The USS Rule Change in October 2011', Insurance: Mathematics and Economics, 69 (2016), 14–28. By 2017, the USS scheme had over 400,000 members.'Universities’ main pension pot faces the biggest deficit of any British fund ', The Economist (3 August 2017). Wider UK pensions * The UK Pensions Act 2004 had placed stringent requirements on private-sector pensions to ensure that their liabilities could be met even if all their member organisations collapsed at once—which in the context of USS would entail the whole University system going bust, an event deemed unlikely by many. Over 2006–17, the proportion of UK private-sector defined-benefit schemes open to new joiners declined from 43% to 14%.'Backing for defined benefit pension scheme bucks trend', The Financial Times (5 October 2018). In the analysis of Mervyn King and John Kay, 'The 2004 Pensions Act is a prime, but by no means unique, example of well-intentioned but inept financial regulation. Over-prescriptive, it has led to the demise of the defined benefit schemes that it was designed to protect. If proposed changes to the USS are implemented, there will be no defined benefit schemes of any significant size outside the public sector open to new members'.Mervyn King and John Kay, 'USS crisis: can the pension system be reformed?', Times Higher Education (6 September 2018), https://www.johnkay.com/2018/09/06/uss-crisis-can-the- pension-system-be-reformed/. * Similar or even more dramatic proposed pension cuts for universities' non-academic staff. For example, in January 2018, Southampton University began consultations on closing its defined-benefits pension scheme for non-academic staff, and in March 2018, Staffordshire University began consultations on moving support staff from the defined- benefit local government scheme to a local defined-contribution scheme. * Worsening outlooks for pension provision across the UK, in the context of rising remuneration for fund managers and increasing integration of pension funds into speculative financial markets.E.g. Christine Berry, 'USS is the tip of the iceberg. Our pensions system is a hot mess ', OpenDemocracy (1 March 2018). For example, it was noted that pay for USS's chief executive rose from £484,000 in 2017 to £566,000 in 2018, while two staff members earned over £1m, and running costs stood at £125m per annum.Sean Coughlan, 'University pension boss's £82,000 pay rise', BBC News (22 February 2018). ===Pay and conditions=== * Public concern about rapidly rising pay for University senior management, particularly Vice-chancellors.Phoebe Braithwaite, 'The university pensions strike is a last resort for STEM academics ', Wired (23 February 2018).Sally Weale, \\"Universities brace for government scrutiny after Policy Exchange report\\", The Guardian (1 March 2020). In particular, on 26 February 2018, the Channel 4 investigative journalism programme Dispatches broadcast an exposé of vice-chancellors' expenses claims.Jamie Doward, 'Revealed: British university vice-chancellors’ five-star expenses ', The Guardian (24 February 2018). * Concern among university staff about falling real-terms pay for most staff. Moreover, the pay projections assumed in USS's 2017 valuation and used to argue for reducing pensions assumed an increase in general pay growth: rather than assuming pay would keep up with inflation (as measured by the consumer price index), USS assumed pay growth one percent above inflation (as measured, more generously, by the retail price index).D. Spiegelhalter and others, 'Examining the Numbers on Pension Valuation', The Financial Times (19 September 2017); available at https://www.dannydorling.org/?p=6109 and http://www.dannydorling.org/wp- content/files/dannydorling_publication_id6103.pdf. On 16 April 2018, staff were actually offered a payrise of 1.7%, below both CPI inflation (then 2.7%) and RPI (then 3.6%).Jack Grove, 'UK university staff offered 1.7 per cent pay rise for 2018-19', Times Higher Education (16 April 2016). * Growing numbers of academic staff were on precarious short-term or zero-hours contracts – in 2018–19, 34% of academic staff were employed on short-term contracts and 13% were paid by the hour.\\"Students hit by 14-day university lecturers strike\\", BBC News (20 February 2020).\\"Higher Education Staff Statistics: UK, 2018/19\\", Statistical Bulletin SB256 (23 January 2020). In March, UCU argued on the basis of data from a freedom of information request that an average of 27% UK university teaching hours were delivered by such staff.Sophie Inge, 'UK universities rely on casual staff ‘for up to half of teaching’ ', Times Higher Education (6 March 2016). The issue of casualisation became increasingly prominent in UCU members' understanding of the strikes as they developed.Sophie Inge, '‘Genie out of the bottle’ on casualisation after pension strikes ', Times Higher Education (21 March 2018). * Similar concerns were reflected by strike action around the same time more widely in UK professional classes: junior doctors undertook their first strikes in the history of the National Health Service (England) in 2015–16, while barristers began strike action on 1 April 2018.'British professionals revolt as austerity hits the middle class', The Economist (26 April 2018). ==2018 USS pension negotiations, and associated strike actionPrior to industrial action=== In July 2017, USS reported a technical deficit (i.e. a gap between the fund's assets and its liabilities) of £17.5 billion, reported as the largest such shortfall in the UK at that time. USS's deficit evaluation was based on suggestions that although the fund's assets had grown (reaching £60 billion, a one-fifth increase on the previous year), its liabilities had also grown (reaching £78 billion, a one-third increase over the previous year). Following negotiations regarding the calculation of the deficit, the USS Joint Negotiating Committee accepted a technical deficit of £6.1 billion in November 2017. The key change proposed by UUK was to close USS's defined benefit scheme (possibly temporarily), replacing it with a defined contribution scheme.Ben Chu, 'If you look at the economics, it's completely reasonable for university lecturers to strike over pension changes', The Independent (25 February 2018). Specifically, the USS Joint Negotiating Committee therefore made the following proposals, to be introduced after 1 April 2019:'Proposed changes to future USS benefits'. * Closing of the defined benefits section of the scheme (though mentioning the possibility of reintroducing it), with all future benefits (apart from death in service and ill health retirement benefits) being transferred to the defined contribution scheme. * Contributions would remain 8% for members and 18% for employers (of which 13.25% contributes directly to pensions, the rest being used for management and running costs, etc.). * Members would be enabled to pay only 4% while still receiving the usual employer contribution, while the option of paying an extra 1%, matched by the employer, would be removed. * Members' 8% (or 4%) would include a contribution to partly finance death in service and ill health retirement benefits. The closure of defined benefits was presented as a red line by UCU, which argued in favour of finding ways to sustain defined benefits, or to introduce a collective defined contribution schemeChristine Berry, 'USS is the tip of the iceberg. Our pensions system is a hot mess ', OpenDemocracy (1 March 2018). (the primary legislation for which was introduced in the UK in 2015, but which had not as of March 2018 been advanced to secondary legislation).'UUK and UCU strike pensions deal', Pensions Expert (12 March 2018). Arguments for the changes USS argued that market conditions had simply proven less favourable than previous valuations had assumed, with the chief executive, Bill Galvin, arguing that 'the unavoidable fact is that market conditions have changed since 2014. Real interest rates have fallen since 2014, relative to inflation, and asset prices have soared ... We are now having to pay more – to get less in return – than we expected in the past'. Moreover, USS emphasised that its room for manoeuvre was constrained by the Pensions Regulator.Bill Galvin, 'USS strike: we can’t ignore reality of our deficit, says pensions boss ', Times Higher Education (19 March 2018). In theory, the deficit could have been resolved through higher contribution rates. However, UUK argued that defined benefit schemes were becoming prohibitively expensive. They said they had a legal duty to put in place a credible plan to reduce the deficit by the summer of 2018. Otherwise, pension contributions from employers and staff would have to sharply increase, potentially resulting in redundancies and cuts to other areas of teaching, research and student support.Alistair Jarvis, 'Universities UK chief Alistair Jarvis: union’s pension demands will cost £1bn a year', The Sunday Times (18 March 2018), accessed from . UUK stated the defined contributions proposal would compare well with private-sector competitors, with employer contributions double the private sector average. USS had a legal responsibility to satisfy the UK pensions regulator that the scheme was sound, and the regulator was requiring change. Arguments against the changes UCU stated that UUK's proposal would \\"leave a typical lecturer almost £10,000 a year worse off in retirement than under the current set-up\\", with younger staff the worst affected, with some losing up to half their anticipated pensions. Critics of the changes offered the following main arguments against implementing the changes to the scheme promoted by UUK. * UUK's assessment of the health of the higher education sector after a 2015/16 report by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) found the sector was financially sound. Independent analyses undertaken by University of Warwick economist Dennis Leech and UCL academic Sean Wallis argued that UUK used a \\"flawed valuation model\\". * The proposed USS changes were shaped by the demand of the UK pensions regulator that USS should be made less risky to employers than USS's actuaries had wished. It was argued, however, that in view of the exceptional economic circumstances associated with the Bank of England's quantitative easing from 2009, the regulator was placing unrealistic expectations on UK pensions nationally.David Bailey and John Clancy, 'USS strike: regulator is to blame for pensions crisis', Times Higher Education (13 March 2013). * Concern also grew, on the basis of research by Michael Otsuka from the London School of Economics, that UUK's negotiating position was disproportionately influenced by the views of Oxford and Cambridge Universities, whose constituent colleges made separate submissions to consultations.Richard Adams, 'Universities strike blamed on vote by Oxbridge colleges ', The Guardian (21 February 2018). * Current employees were annually paying £2.1bn into the USS fund, while it was annually paying out £1.8bn to pensioners. To cover the current annual cost of pensions from investment returns, the fund required a net annual return of 3%.Anthony Hesketh, 'The solution to university pensions? Better fund managers ', The Guardian, 22 February 2018. One of the assumptions used in the July 2017 valuation was that the fund would stop accepting contributions – the sort of situation that would normally arise if the companies in a pension scheme went bust, which was an unlikely real-world situation for the UK higher education sector. USS's analyses showed that, assuming the most likely circumstances rather than the most challenging circumstances (technically referred to as the \\"best estimate\\"), the pension scheme was sustainable in the long-term. In contrast to technical deficits based on stringently conservative assumptions, this more probable valuation showed the fund in credit by £8.3 billion. * At the inception of USS, employer contributions were 16% of salary, rising to 18.55% in 1983. However, from January 1997 to September 2009 they were decreased to 14% (before rising to 16% from October 2009 to 2016 and 18% thereafter). It was suggested that staff were bearing the consequences of an earlier lack of investment by employers.Susan Cooper, 'A Pensions Proposal: Constant Contributions ' (p. 1). ===UCU ballots for industrial action (29 January 2018)=== On 29 January, UCU announced that 88% of UCU members had voted to back strike action and 93% backed action short of a strike. The turnout was 58%, meeting the 50% minimum set by the Trade Union Act 2016. Shortly after, on 13 February, the trade union UNISON, many of whose members in the Higher Education sector were also USS members, began a consultative ballot on striking alongside UCU.'HE members to be consulted over proposed pension changes' (13 February 2019). On 20 February, UNISON wrote to vice-chancellors in support of UCU's position.'UNISON writes to vice chancellors over university pensions dispute' (20 February 2018). ===Strike action commences (23 February 2018) and new negotiations follow=== International Women's Day and Leeds UCU signs, 2018 Strikes commenced on 23 February, whereupon UUK agreed to meet UCU for further negotiations on 27 February. Leaked emails suggested they would not negotiate on UCU's key issue, retaining defined benefits.Camilla Turner, '[ Lecturers' strike: universities refusing to bow on pension reforms, leaked letter reveals', The Sunday Telegraph (24 February 2018). The meeting led to an agreement to undergo conciliation through Acas, the UK's national industrial dispute conciliation body. UCU tabled and published a set of proposals which it argued was consistent with the majority of UUK members' positions in USS's earlier consultation, but strikes were not called off.Richard Adams and Emily Hawkins, 'University staff pension dispute moves to Acas ', The Guardian (27 February 2018).Camilla Turner, 'Lecturers and university leaders enlist conciliation service Acas but strikes are set to continue ', The Telegraph (27 February 2018).'Further talks agreed in universities pensions dispute ' (27 February 2018). A spokesperson for Universities UK said: \\"Both sides are currently engaged in serious and constructive talks at Acas. We are committed to seeking a viable, affordable and mutually acceptable solution to the current challenges facing USS pensions.\\" ===UCU's proposal (27 February 2018)=== UCU tabled an alternative proposal at the first round of talks with UUK which UCU stated would involve universities accepting some increased risk and small increased contributions from employers and scheme members. UUK's response was that they would need time to cost the union's proposal which it feared would require \\"very substantial increases in contributions\\". However, some vice-chancellors voiced support for UCU's plan. UCU's proposal, along with suggestions for longer-term strategies, was: * Universities should accept a slightly riskier but probably more lucrative investment strategy, leading to a deficit of £5.1 billion rather than £6.1 billion, a level accepted by the majority of institutions when it was proposed by USS in September 2017. * Retaining defined benefits on salaries up to £55,550. * Reducing the annual accrual rate from 1/75 to 1/80. * Increasing contributions by 2.7% for employers and 1.4% for members (i.e. 4.1% split 65/35 between employers and employees). The parties held inconclusive talks on 5 March, scheduling the next talks for 7 March. However, a bizarre Twitter spasm from UUK on the night of 5 March insisted that the group was available for talks on 6 March, and this led to talks at noon on 6 March.Judith Burns, 'University strike talks resume after Twitter skirmishes ', BBC News (6 March 2018). Talks continued on 7 March, inconclusively. On 8 March, UCU's Higher Education Committee agreed that it would call further strikes if necessary after the Easter vacation, between April and June.Robert Wright, 'UK universities could be hit by new strikes amid pension dispute ', Financial Times (8 March 2018). ===Joint UUK and UCU proposal (12 March 2018)=== Placard from 13 March 2018 UCU protest, Leeds. On the evening of Monday 12 March UCU and UUK issued a joint agreement, arrived at through ACAS, to be put to their respective members. The agreement was specifically for a three-year \\"transitional benefit arrangement\\" lasting from 1 April 2019, maintaining defined benefits up to a salary threshold of £42,000, reducing the accrual rate to 1/85, but raising contributions to 19.3% of salaries for employers and 8.7% for members. The next valuation was to be informed by an \\"independent expert group\\", 'aiming to promote greater transparency and understanding' of the methodologies, assumptions, and viability of the scheme. Indexation and revaluation was to be measured using CPI and capped at up to 2.5% p.a. (meaning that if inflation, measured by CPI, rose above 2.5%, the pension would lose value in real terms). UCU was to suspend industrial action and \\"encourage\\" branches to reschedule any classes disrupted by the strike.

Many UCU members used the Twitter hashtag #NoCapitulation to express their disapproval of the agreement, helping to co-ordinate a strong response to the proposals.Nicole Kobie, '#NoCapitulation: How one hashtag saved the UK university strike ', Wired (18 March 2018). UCU general secretary Sally Hunt said that preparations for strikes during the exam period would be made, while urgently seeking further talks.See further 'How we got to yesterday and what's next' (14 March 2018).

In some places, the decision was followed the next day by rallies.Kristian Johnson, 'Five things we learned from the latest UCU rally through Leeds city centre ', LeedsLive (14 March 2018). ===Developments 14–23 March 2018=== As of 14 March, UUK's consultation with its members remained ongoing.'Universities UK planning more talks with UCU to end pensions dispute ' (14 March 2018). A statutory 64-day consultation by USS on pension changes had been due to commence on 19 March, but as of 15 March, USS were declaring an unspecified delay to the commencement of consultations.'Employer consultation in relation to proposed changes to Universities Superannuation Scheme ' (accessed 15 March 2018). On 16 March, UCU called on members employed as external examiners to resign until the dispute was resolved.Chris Havergal, 'Call for external examiners to quit in UK pensions dispute ', Times Higher Education (16 March 2018). By 23 March over 600 resignations had occurred.Sophie Inge, 'Hundreds of external examiners resign in UK pensions dispute', Times Higher Education (23 March 2018). On 18 March, UUK announced that it would convene an \\"independent panel\\", featuring an independent chair and involving academics and pension professionals, to \\"consider issues of methodology, assumptions and monitoring, aiming to promote greater transparency and understanding of the USS valuation\\". The panel would invite UCU \\"to play a full role in providing evidence to the panel\\" and would also liaise with USS and the pensions regulator.'Panel of independent experts to review processes for arriving at pension deficit' (18 March 2018). UCU's response was that \\"UCU will of course look at any proposals UUK makes but our members have made it quite clear that what is needed is a much improved offer\\".'UCU responds to UUK valuation review' (18 March 2018). On 22 March, UCU sanctioned fourteen further strike days to fall in the April to June 2018 exam period should the talks fail to come to a resolution. On 23 March, UNISON announced that its consultative ballot of its USS members had returned 91% support for industrial action, and that it would begin a formal ballot for strike action in April.'University members asked to strike to defend USS pension scheme' (23 March 2018).Talya Misiri, '‘Enough is enough’ Unison urges USS members to join industrial action', PensionsAge (23 March 2018).'Unison strike ballot over university pensions', Morning Star (24 March 2018). ===UUK makes a new offer (23 March 2018)=== On 23 March, UCU announced a new offer from UUK.

The Financial Times noted that this would be \\"a far more comprehensive review of the current structure and valuation of the Universities Superannuation Scheme\\" than previously considered, but also noted that \\"the new agreement avoids any mention of increases in contributions by either employers or employees to plug the hole in the scheme\\". UCU was due to consult members' representatives at a formal meeting on 28 March.Max Jenner, 'NewsUUK tables new proposal for UCU', Oxford Student (23 March 2018). Meanwhile, on 26 March, the UK's Joint Negotiating Committee for Higher Education Staff began its round of negotiations for pay in the sector for 2018/19, with unions demanding a large pay uplift.'University and College Union Higher Education Branch Action Note', UCUBAN/HE29 (21 March 2018).Jack Grove, 'UK university staff offered 1.7 per cent pay rise for 2018-19', Times Higher Education (16 April 2018 ). ===New strike dates announced as UCU members balloted on proposal (28 March 2018)=== UCU announced that members would be electronically balloted on the new offer in April to decide on the proposal for the Joint Expert Panel. UUK pledged to maintain the current contributions and retirement benefits until at least April 2019 while the review by the panel of experts took place. At the same time, UCU gave formal notice of a five-day strike action, aimed at disrupting the exams and assessments period, at some universities for 16 to 20 April 2018, potentially to be called off if there was progress in the negotiations. 13 universities including Manchester, Cardiff, Oxford, St Andrews, Leeds and Southampton would be affected by this next round of strikes with the prospect of industrial action at the other 52 universities to take place later in April and continuing into July if no agreement was reached. However, staff would not take part in additional strike action if UCU members vote to accept the UUK proposal. As of 28 March, nearly 700 external examiners had recorded their resignations in a UCU document. The Guardian reported that \\"students at the end of their courses could find themselves unable to graduate if crucial exams cannot be invigilated, marked or assessed\\" as a worst-case scenario. Debate followed among UCU members as to whether to accept the proposals or not.Steven Parfitt, 'Deal or No Deal?', Jacobin (3 March 2018). As of 4 April, some branches had decided to recommend that their members reject the proposals as they stood,Richard Adams, 'University staff vote on pensions offer – without a deal in sight', The Guardian (4 April 2018).Sophie Inge, 'Under-pressure UCU leader urges members to accept pensions deal', Times Higher Education (4 April 2018). and prominent discontent with the proposals continued to be registered in the run-up to the ballot closing. === UCU accepts UUK proposal (13 April 2018) and Joint Expert Panel is formed === The result of the ballot was the UCU members accepted UUK proposal. Industrial action was suspended and the impending strikes of 16 April were called off.'Members vote to accept employers' latest offer' (13 April 2018).Chris Havergal, 'Strikes suspended as union members vote to end pensions dispute', Times Higher Education (13 April 2018). {  + Total balloted 53,415 - Total votes cast 33,973 - Total number valid votes 33,913 - Turnout 63.5% - Yes to accept the UUK offer 21,683 (64%) - No to reject the UUK offer 12,230 (36%) } On 18 April, UCU confirmed that it was ending its call for external examiners to stand down. Commentary suggested that scrutiny of the pension negotiations by the union membership was nonetheless ongoing. On 18 May, UUK and UCU announced that the Joint Expert Panel would be chaired by Joanne Segars.'UCU and UUK announce appointment of Chair for USS Joint Expert Panel', 18 May 2018.UCU and UUK announce appointment of Chair for USS Joint Expert Panel' (18 May 2018). On 21 May UCU announced three nominations to the panel.'UCU announces nominations to USS joint expert pane' (221 May 201). Other members were later determined as Ronnie Bowie, Sally Bridgeland, and Chris Curry (appointed by UUK) and Catherine Donnelly, Saul Jacka, and Deborah Mabbett (appointed by UCU).The Joint Expert Panel on the Universities Superannuation Scheme commissioned by the University and College Union and Universities UK, 'Report of the Joint Expert Panel' (September 2018), pp. 70-71. The Joint Expert Panel was scheduled to report in September. On 1–3 June, a tumultuous UCU congress included calls for the general secretary, Sally Hunt, to resign over what was perceived to be undemocratic practice within the Union's prosecution of the dispute. Much of the congress's proceedings had to be aborted, and a new congress was proposed for the future.Chris Havergal, 'Sally Hunt clings on as UCU leader as congress curtailed', Times Higher Education (1 June 2018). (On 18 October a recalled congress saw the withdrawal of motions to call for resignation, but a motion of censure was passed complaining at a lack of transparency and accountability in Hunt's representation of UCU members during the dispute.Jack Grove, 'UCU’s Sally Hunt censured over handling of pensions strike', Times Higher Education (18 October 2018).) === USS plans contribution increases (25 July 2018) === While the Joint Expert Panel deliberated, USS announced that, given that the legal deadline for addressing the fund's deficit had passed, it would, in accordance with statutory procedure, act already to raise both staff and employer contributions, following a statutory consultation period, to maintain the scheme's benefits. The proposed rises (as a percentage of salary) were to be phased in over a year: {  + ! !Staff contributions !Employer contributions - status quo 8% 18% - April 2019 8.8% 19.5% - October 2019 10.4% 22.5% - April 2020 11.7% 24.9% } These plans were announced against a backdrop of USS's annual report calculations of the deficit falling, due to changing assumptions about factors such as returns on corporate bonds and mortality. On different measures, the 2018 annual report showed a 2014 deficit of 12.6bn falling to a 2018 deficit of 12.1bn; or a £17.5bn deficit falling to £8.4 billion deficit. Though this plan was criticised by UCU and UUK, as of 22 November 2018, USS continued to plan to implement it.'Concluding the 2017 valuation' (22 November 2018).Jack Grove, 'USS to revisit £7.5 billion deficit valuation', Times Higher Education (22 November 2018). === Joint Expert Panel releases first report (13 September 2018) === On 13 September, the Joint Expert Panel that had been convened to re-examine the valuation of the USS scheme issued its first report.The Joint Expert Panel on the Universities Superannuation Scheme commissioned by the University and College Union and Universities UK, 'Report of the Joint Expert Panel' (September 2018). The Panel's press release recommended a number of adjustments to the methodology and data used in the 2017 valuation of the USS scheme, and stated that \\"it is the Panel’s belief, based on independent actuarial analysis, that the full implementation of these adjustments could mean total required contributions estimated at 29.2% to fund current benefits [...] This compares to the current rate of 26% (18% of salary paid by employers, 8% by employees) and the rate of 36.6% from April 2020 which is proposed by USS, based on the valuation as it stands\\".'USS Joint Expert Panel' (13 September 2018). It was suggested that this proposal might entail raising employees' contributions to 9.1% of salary, and employers' by 2.1%, taking their contribution to 20.1%.Jack Grove, 'Pay extra 1% of salary to save USS pension benefits, says panel', Times Higher Education (13 September 2018). On 15 October Sam Marsh, of the University of Sheffield, reported in detail on his own analysis of data obtained from USS after a long period of requesting the information. He found that the methodologies by which USS's 'test 1' measures the pension scheme's viability were flawed, and that by maintaining previous investment strategies, USS would have the surplus it would require to meet its future liabilities. UUK asked the USS trustee to investigate Marsh's arguments.Josephine Cumbo, 'University pension fund accused of exaggerating shortfall', The Financial Times (16 October 2018).Sam Marsh, 'A flawed valuation: the layperson’s guide to my findings on USS’s ‘Test 1’' (15 October 2018).Felicity Callard, Jo Grady, Nick Hardy, Jaya John John, Nicky Priaulx, and Ruth Stirton, 'Sam Marsh exposes new problems in the USS valuation', USSbriefs, 59 (16 October 2018). Marsh's commentary had also attracted prominent support from Michael Otsuka.Michael Otsuka, 'USS’s valuation rests on a large and demonstrable mistake' (13 October 2018). USS defended its position the next day, accepting that Marsh's reanalysis was 'not wrong in isolation', but arguing that de-risking was necessary anyway.'Claims of a ‘large and demonstrable error’ in the valuation', (16 October 2018).Jack Grove, 'Universities Superannuation Scheme rejects valuation error claim', Times Higher Education (17 October 2018). In response, UCU commissioned an independent report by First Actuarial which on 16 November 2018 supported Marsh's arguments and levelled a number of criticisms at USS's valuations and reasoning.Hilary Salt and Derek Benstead, 'Report for University and College Union: Three Questions on the USS 2017 valuation' (16 November 2018). On 8 November, UUK reported on a consultation of its members, which found them, like UCU, to support the Joint Expert Panel's recommendations.'Update: employers' views on JEP recommendations' (8 November 2018). The news was welcomed by UCU.'UCU welcomes universities' acceptance of expert pensions report's findings' (14 November 2018). This suggested that a consensus position between these parties had been more or less achieved, meaning that the main faultline in the dispute now ran between USS on the one side, and UCU and UUK on the other.Jack Grove, 'Universities back panel’s plans for USS pension contributions', Times Higher Education (14 November 2018). === USS declares 2017 valuation complete but agrees to a new 2018 valuation (22 November 2018) === On 22 November, USS declared that 'as member and employer representatives on the Joint Negotiating Committee could not agree on an alternative outcome to the 2017 valuation', it would maintain the defined benefits scheme but implement contribution increases using the Scheme's default rules for cost-sharing between members and employers, as published on 25 July (starting with a small increase in contributions in April 2019). The 2017 valuation was eventually signed off on 29 January 2019.'Scheme Funding Report of the Actuarial Valuation: Universities Superannuation Scheme, as at 31 March 2017' (Birmingham: Mercer, 2019). However, USS agreed to undertake a new valuation of the fund as it stood at 31 March 2018, which the Joint Expert Panel had suggested would indicate a far smaller deficit. It was thought that this new valuation might forestall further requirements for contribution increases after April 2019. === Consultation on 2018 USS valuation closes (28 February 2019) === On 2 January 2019, USS began a consultation with UUK on its 2018 valuation, which closed 28 February. USS proposed that it should be possible to increase overall contributions from 26% of salary (the contribution level that obtained from April 2016 to April 2019) to 29.7% of salary, rather than the higher increases planned in response to the 2017 valuation—but only if scheme members agreed to a system of 'trigger contributions' (additional contributions that would be triggered if short-term measures of deficit exceeded a certain level).Universities Superannuation Scheme, '2018 Actuarial Valuation: A consultation with Universities UK on the proposed assumptions for the scheme’s Technical Provisions and Statement of Funding Principles' (2 January 2019). UUK members, however, expressed scepticism at the necessity and appropriateness of this arrangement.Stephanie Hawthorne, 'Employers reject call for contingency contributions from USS', Pensions Expert (15 March 2019). In response, on 9 May 2019, USS proposed three options 'for finalising the 2018 valuation', retaining the scheme's previous benefits, and requiring lower contributions than the arrangement that the scheme had defaulted to in the absence of an agreement, but requiring much higher contributions than the proposals put forward by the JEP:'2018 Valuation update: 9 May 2019' (9 May 2019). # A fixed total contribution rate of 33.7% of salary. # A standard total contribution rate of 29.7% but with 'sufficiently strong contingent contribution arrangements' enabling higher contributions in certain circumstances. # A fixed total contribution rate of 30.7%, 'subject to a 2020 valuation'. Meanwhile, on 15 March the Council of Trinity College, Cambridge voted to withdraw the college unilaterally from USS as of 31 May 2019, in a move that came to be called Trexit. By October 2019, the college had replaced the USS scheme with a defined benefits scheme to avoid the college bearing any responsibility for other pensions in the UK higher education system in the event of foreclosures in the sector. The move sparked protests, resignations, and a boycott.Noella Chye, 'Revealed: Trinity plans exit from national pension scheme, isolating college from higher education sector', Varsity (8 December 2018).Rosie Bradbury, 'Trinity confirms exit from national pensions scheme – over 230 academic staff will now boycott supervising Trinity students', Varsity (24 May 2019).Chris Havergal, 'Cambridge’s Trinity confirms departure from USS pension scheme', Times Higher Education (24 May 2019).Natalie Tuck, 'UCU threatens boycott of Trinity College over USS exit', PensionsAge (21 June 2019).Camilla Turner, \\"Cambridge college faces resignations over decision to switch pension plans for staff\\", The Telegraph (3 October 2019), p. 11.Ellie Arden and Dylan Perera, 'Trexit conflicts continue as Trinity welcomes new master', Varsity (8 October 2019). On 21 May 2019, it was revealed that Jane Hutton, in her capacity as a non- executive director on the USS board of trustees, had in March 2018 complained to the Pensions Regulator, alleging that her efforts in 2017 to check whether the USS deficit had been miscalculated had been frustrated by delays and obstructions to providing her with data to which she needed access to fulfil her fiduciary duties. As of May 2019, the Pensions Regulator and Financial Reporting Council were investigating the allegations.Josephine Cumbo, 'Regulators probe claims about university pension plan', Financial Times (21 May 2019). On 14 June 2019, as the investigation continued, the Regulator rebuked USS for claiming that aspects of USS policy were mandated by the Regulator when in fact they were not.Josephine Cumbo, 'Regulator rebukes UK university pension scheme', Financial Times (14 June 2019). On 11 October 2019, it was reported that Hutton had been dismissed as a director of USS on the grounds that, according to an independent investigation, \\"she had breached a number of her director’s duties owed under company law and contract\\". USS said that the dismissal was independent of Hutton's whistleblowing and the ongoing investigation; Hutton said she did not view the decision as valid and was considering further action.Anna McKie, 'Whistleblowing professor Jane Hutton fired from USS board', Times Higher Education (11 October 2019).Jack Gray, 'USS whistleblower fired', PensionsAge: (11 October 2019). On 22 August 2019, the Joint Negotiating Committee, representing UCU and UUK, met to determine the position that they would put to the USS trustees. The independent chair, Andrew Cubie, used his deciding vote to support UUK's preferred plan. In this scheme, total contributions per member would be 30.7% of salary, with 9.6% being paid by the employee and 21.1% by the employer. A further valuation would follow in 2020 and in the absence of an alternative agreement, the contribution rate would rise to 34.7% in October 2021 with members paying 11% and employers 23.7%. UCU argued that employees' contributions should not rise above 8%, and that the Joint Expert Panel had suggested alternative paths to achieving this that had been agreeable to both UCU and UUK. UUK offered to limit staff contributions to 9.1% instead of 9.6% if UCU would agree to hold no strikes on pensions for two years, an offer which UCU rejected.Richard Adams, 'UK universities brace for strike action in pensions dispute', The Guardian (25 August 2019).'Autumn pension strikes more likely as universities impose higher costs' (22 August 2019).'Employers' strike ban rejected by UCU in pensions dispute' (23 August 2019). The 21.1%:9.6% contribution rates were ratified on 12 September by the USS trustee board. ==Responses to the 2018 pension strikes== Crowds gather at a UCU strike rally in George Square, Glasgow. === Changes in UK law === The strike brought to the attention of unions and the UK government a potential ambiguity in UK legislation: migrant workers on Tier 2 and 5 visas have an annual 20-day limit on unpaid absence from work.Tyler Denmead, 'Tier Two Worker Remote Office: Resisting the Marketization of Higher Education', Journal of Curriculum and Pedagogy, 16:1 (2019), 6-34, . As some universities had seen local strike action during 2017–18 in addition to the 14 days of national strike action, fears arose that staff members who were on strike for more than 20 days in a year might have their visas revoked, and that this might in turn impinge on their legal rights to take industrial action. On 12 July, the home secretary Sajid Javid declared that it was \\"not the government’s policy to prevent migrant workers from engaging in legal strike action\\" and that he would introduce changes to the rules and guidelines on immigration to be explicit that strike action did not count as \\"unpaid absence\\". ===Staff=== Dinosaur of Solidarity lino print, alluding to the presence of a dinosaur on Southampton UCU's picket lines. In the ballot for the strike, UCU achieved an unusually high turnout and strong support for industrial action, and membership grew by about 15,000 between the beginning of 2018 and 12 April.Jack Grove, 'The USS strike and the winter of academics’ discontent', Times Higher Education (12 April 2018). Staff organised \\"teach-outs\\" off campus at \\"every university with a substantial picket line\\";Sanjana Varghese, 'Why students are coming out in support of their striking lecturers ', The New Statesman (8 March 2018). these featured education sessions which tended to be left-wing or critical of recent changes in UK higher education,John Marenbon, 'USS strike: academics are wrong to walk out ', Times Higher Education (2 March 2018).'Bangor University staff to ‘Teach-Out’ during strike ', The Bangor Aye (20 February 2018).Jana Bacevic, 'USS strike: picket line debates will re-energise scholarship', Times Higher Education (13 March 2018). apparently led by the University of Leeds, whose UCU branch had tested the model during a local dispute in autumn 2017.Lesley McCorrigan, 'Fourteen Days, Hold Tight: Reflections from Leeds on the USS Strike', Another Education is Possible, 10 (Spring 2018), 12-13.

Meanwhile, Southampton University UCU's 'Dinosaur of Solidarity', a person in a dinosaur costume, became a minor social-media sensation.Arun Aggarwal, 'Interview with a Dinosaur' (12 March 2018). As the strikes commenced, academics at Oxford and Cambridge began using those universities' democratic structures to change the universities' position on pension reform.Richard Adams, 'Universities threaten to punish striking staff over cancelled lectures ', The Guardian (2 March 2018). Oxford staff's attempts to use the university's supreme governing body, Congregation, to effect a change of policy failed due to procedural problems on 5 March, but the next day Oxford's vice-chancellor Louise Richardson declared that the University would nonetheless heed the wishes of staff to \\"reverse its response to the UUK survey\\".Richard Adams, 'Oxford University backs down in pensions dispute ', The Guardian (7 March 2018). As the strikes developed, university staff increasingly called into question the governance structures of UUK, individual universities, and USS, along with the marketisation of the UK higher education sector and its increasingly precarious workforce.Christopher Phelps, 'Britain: Universities on Strike ', Dissent (15 March 2018).Richard Watermeyer, 'USS strike: academics (and football fans) are fed up with ‘dehumanising’ conditions ', Times Higher Education (20 March 2018).Celine Tan, 'USS Strikes: Defending the Collective Public Goods Mandate of the UK Universities', SLSA Blog (16 March 2018). By 13 April, over 12,000 people had signed a petition calling for UUK to be made subject to the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Staff also made extensive use of social media (see below). ===Universities=== Chalk graffiti reading \\"email the VC\\", at the Downing Street entrance to the Sedgwick Site, Cambridge University, during the spring 2020 strikes. Universities were represented in the dispute by UUK. However, some vice-chancellors expressed support for UCU's position before the strike. Anthony Forster, vice-chancellor at the University of Essex, described a staff consultation process that led Essex to support retaining defined benefits via increased pension contributions.Anthony Forster, 'Universities must pay more to protect pensions ', Times Higher Education (19 February 2018). The University of Warwick's Stuart Croft publicly stated that \\"I am sure that I am not alone in being mystified at this [proposed] change\\", and argued, in line with the position of the Liberal Democrats, that the UK government should underwrite USS pensions.Stuart Croft, 'USS strike: is it time to nationalise university pensions? ', Times Higher Education (26 February 2018). After the strike began, other vice chancellors voiced concern about UUK's position, and by the second day of strike action, 18 were being reported as calling for renewed negotiations, or as supporting UCU's position.Todd Gillespie and Catherine Lally, 'Stephen Toope joins calls for renewed talks to end strikes ', Varsity (23 February 2018). Some joined staff on picket lines, among them Anton Muscatelli (Glasgow), Keith Burnett (Sheffield) and Robert Allison (Loughborough).Sophie Inge, 'Pensions strike ‘poisons relations’ on UK campuses ', Times Higher Education (8 March 2018). In a letter to The Times of 16 March, the vice-chancellor of Cambridge University, Stephen Toope, expressed sympathy with the concerns of staff and students about not only pensions, but also marketisation of UK universities,Stephen Toope, 'The future of UK universities', The Times (16 March 2018), accessed from .Rosemary Bennett, 'Turning universities into businesses ‘caused strikes’, says Cambridge vice-chancellor Stephen Toope', The Times (16 March 2018).Louis Ashworth, 'Toope attacks ‘fundamental error’ of university marketisation ', Varsity (16 March 2018). and held a wide- ranging public meeting with around 550 staff and students in Great St Mary's Church, scheduling a further such meeting for 26 April.Noella Chye & Jack Conway, 'Hundreds of students gather to quiz Toope on pensions, divestment, and Prevent ', Varsity (16 March 2018). Some universities decided to cushion the financial impact of strike action on their staff by deducting pay for the days not worked over several months. These included Glasgow, Leicester, Cardiff, Cambridge, and York. Video recording of lectures had become widespread in UK universities by 2016,John Elmes, 'Universities ‘uncertain’ about lecture-capture copyright' , Times Higher Education (8 December 2016). and some universities sought to use lectures recorded in previous years to substitute for teaching missed during the strikes. This prompted renewed debates about what rights universities should claim in the intellectual output of their staff.Jack Grove, 'Academics ‘must sign away authorship rights’ to recorded lectures', Times Higher Education (20 March 2018).  Threatened pay deductions for not rescheduling teaching  Conversely, many universities demanded that staff reschedule teaching that had not been delivered during the strike, noting their right to deduct pay for partial performance if staff did not. However, a smaller number appeared to be committed to implementing deductions. Examples which attracted media attention included: {  + !University !Threatened deduction - University of St Andrews 100% - University of Sheffield 25% - University of Kent 50% per breach of contract - University of Leeds 25%Sophie Inge, 'Tensions Mount on Campus as USS Pensions Strike Looms ', Times Higher Education (22 February 2018).Kristian Johnson, 'Staff hit out at the University of Leeds for 'penalising striking members twice' ', LeedsLive (28 February 2018).'Universities urged not to withhold staff pay', Yorkshire Post (2 March 2018). - Keele University 20%Kathie McInnes, 'Union boss claims university is 'punishing' striking academics by docking their pay twice over ', The Stoke Sentinel (3 March 2018). } In Sheffield's case, pay deduction of 25% for partial performance, rising to 100% after five days, was initially threatened,Lee Peace, 'Striking University of Sheffield lecturers in fresh row over 'pay deductions ', The Star (2 March 2018). provoking alumni to threaten to withdraw donations. The University then explained that it would not implement deductions for partial performance.Dominic Penna, 'BREAKING: Former students are withdrawing donations to the University of Sheffield over ‘draconian’ strike policy ', The Tab (1 March 2018). Similar developments occurred at St Andrews, with the Principal, Sally Mapstone, writing that \\"having considered all matters in the round, I believe that our current policy to deduct pay at 100% for failure to reschedule classes cancelled due to strike action is inconsistent with this University's values and the store we place on our shared sense of community\\".

In February 2018, a poll of 1,500 students for Times Higher Education magazine found over half (51.8%) would support their lecturer in a walk-out and just under a third (29.3%) would not. Support for the national strike was evenly balanced, with 38.4% in favour and 38.4% against. By 8 March, extensive student support for the strikes was still being reported, observing that students were joining with staff in solidarity against the marketisation of UK higher education. Occupations and other activism On the first day of the strikes the UUK head office in London was occupied by students. Students undertook occupations of university buildings in support of the strike at various institutions, including University College London (26 February), the University of Liverpool (28 February) and the University of Bristol (5 March), along with students at Leicester, Bath, Exeter, Southampton, Sussex, and Reading. A fresh wave of occupations began on 12 March, following the publication of the first ACAS-brokered joint agreement between UCU and UUK, which UCU members rejected. Universities with occupations during that week included Reading,Luke Adams,'Protesters refused to leave to support lecturers at the University of Reading ', The Reading Chronicle (13 March 2018). Cambridge (in the Old Schools),Oliver Guest and Todd Gillespie, 'Student activists occupy Old Schools in support of strikes ', Varsity (12 March 2018).

At one point during the occupation, students were locked into a room by staff members of the university.Ceren Sagir, 'University of London seals protesting students into a room', Morning Star (22 March 2018). In the wake of the February–March strikes, the students' union at SOAS called on its members to refuse to submit work with deadlines before 23 March, arguing that deadlines so soon after the end of the strikes would negatively affect students' work.Safa Daud, 'SOAS SU calls for student boycott of coursework deadlines ', London Student (18 March 2018).  Compensation  Students, who in England had since 2012 paid fees covering most of the cost of their education, responded by demanding compensation from their universities, explicitly in support of the striking staff: by 20 February 2018, 70,000 had signed letters and petitions of this kind,Sally Weale, '70,000 students call for compensation over UCU lecturer strike ', The Guardian (20 February 2018). rising to around 126,000 by 5 March. On 4 March 2018, it was reported that King's College London had become the first university to offer to use money not spent on striking staff's salaries to compensate students.Sian Griffiths, 'King’s College London offers student refunds over lecturers’ strike', The Sunday Times (4 March 2018).Sylvie Dumont, 'King’s College London is offering refunds to students for the lecturer strikes ', The Tab (4 March 2018). Robert Liow, a third-year law student at the university, told the BBC that if universities did not refund students part of their fees, they would be profiting from the dispute, as they would gain the money not paid to striking university staff: > I don't want a consumerist education service. I believe education is a > public good and not a service to be sold. But if we are going to be treated > as consumers we are going to ask for our money back. On 23 March 2018, it was reported that the international disputes lawyers Asserson had begun co-ordinating a no-win no-fee suit for compensation for students affected by the strikes, inviting students to sign up to participate online.Jamie Barlow, 'International law firm launches claim for University of Nottingham students to receive compensation amid strike action', Nottingham Post (23 March 2018). On 24 April 2018, it was announced that over 1,000 students had signed up: enough to apply for a group litigation order. By 17 June, over 5,000 had joined. Asserson estimated that one million students had been affected by the strike, with 575,000 teaching hours lost. They suggested that universities might be liable for £20m compensation. By May 2019, the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education (designated under the Higher Education Act 2004 to run the higher education student complaints scheme within England and Wales) has issued a number of adjudications in response to student complaints, asking universities to offer partial refunds of fees.Eleanor Busby, 'Universities told to refund half of students’ tuition fees for failing to make up missed lectures during strikes', The Independent (14 May 2019).  In media  On 25 November 2019, Joshua Curiel, a student at the University of Kent, wrote an article for The Guardian encouraging fellow students to support their lectures. Curiel argued that \\"This strike will have a greater impact if universities see that the lecturers have the full support of their students and understand that changes must be made. We have a part to play in these strikes, to keep the pressure up to ensure fairer working conditions.\\" ===Politicians=== On 29 November 2017, Carol Monaghan (Scottish National Party) tabled an Early Day Motion in the House of Commons entitled \\"Defending Academic Pensions\\", noting \\"with concern the proposal by Universities UK to close the defined benefit portion of the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) to all future service\\". The motion was sponsored by Caroline Lucas (Green Party), Martyn Day and Pete Wishart (SNP), and Jim Cunningham, and Mary Glindon (Labour). As of 19 March, it had been signed by 133 MPs..Djuna Thurley, 'Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS)', House of Commons Library, briefing paper CBP-8156 (20 February 2018), p. 14. During the first week of industrial action, UCU's stance was explicitly supported by the LabourEmma Bartlett, 'Jeremy Corbyn sends 'solidarity and thanks' to lecturers and other university staff who begin a month of walkouts over pensions ', The Mirror (22 February 2018). and Green Parties.Liam Soutar, 'Backing for lecturers’ strike ', Wigan Today (23 February 2018). The Liberal Democrats argued that the government should underwrite the USS pension scheme, easing its assessment of risk.Lizzy Buchan, 'University strikes: Ministers urged to step in to guarantee lecturers' pensions after mass walkouts', The Independent (24 February 2018). The Conservative universities minister Sam Gyimah encouraged the parties to negotiate, and encouraged universities to compensate students for missed education.Eleanor Busby, 'University strikes: Students set to receive 'direct compensation' over lectures missed due to action, minister says ', The Independent (28 February 2018). The Chinese embassy in the UK also made representations to the Department for Education, expressing concern for the situation of Chinese students in the UK.'Chinese embassy concerned as lasting UK university strike affects students ', China- Europe (1 March 2018). ===UCU=== The \\"intense infighting\\" experienced by parts of UCU during and following the 2018 pension strikes and negotiations led UCU to establish a 'democracy commission' to recommend ways to improve participatory democracy within the Union. Among its recommendations was the suggestion that the office of General Secretary should be held for three-year terms, and for a maximum of three terms. The commission suggested introducing a mechanism for members to recall general secretaries. Its recommendations were put to a special congress of the union of 7 December 2019.Vicky Blake, \\"More transparency will improve the UCU’s democratic processes\\", Times Higher Education (5 December 2019). ===Scholarly societies=== Some scholarly societies issued statements supporting the strike or its goals. They included History UK, which said it 'believes universities should try to maintain the conditions of employment under which academics were originally employed. That includes pensions';'HUK statement on current industrial action' (5 March 2018)George Gosling, 'SHS Statement on the USS Pensions Dispute' (10 March 2018). the Engineering Professors' Council;'Statement on strike action over USS Pensions' (1 March 2018). and the British Dental Association.'Changes to Academic Pensions'. Others did not take a position but did publicly discuss the issues, among them the British Psychological Society.Julianna Challenor, Trudi Edginton, Deborah Rafalin, Carla Willig, 'Call to support in pensions dispute', The Psychologist, 31 (April 2018), 1-2. ===Media===  Traditional media  The action attracted national television coverage,E.g. Jane Deith, 'University staff strike over pensions ', Channel 4 News (22 February 2018). and supportive editorials from newspapers including the Observer'The Observer view on the shambolic way universities are run ', The Observer (25 February 2018). and the Financial Times, which opined that \\"the universities must increase their pensions offer, and lecturers should give a fair hearing to any new proposals. Failing that, students should be compensated by the colleges\\". Support for UUK, meanwhile, was offered in The Times, with Daniel Finkelstein, for example, arguing that \\"the pension fund is a pot of money shared between current and past staff. All that the trustees and the regulator are trying to do is to make sure it is fairly shared out. They are ensuring the money hasn't all been given away while there are people with future claims against it\\".Daniel Finkelstein, 'Lecturers can’t expect us to pay their pensions', The Times (27 February 2018). A number of commentators expressed exasperation at a tendency in the media, and on social media, to refer to the strike as a \\"lecturers' strike\\", when it involved a wide range of staff, academic and non- academic.Fiona Whelan, 'USS strike: why aren’t more administrative staff on picket lines?', Times Higher Education (28 February 2018). Social media UCU members made extensive use of social media during the dispute. They were used to disseminate activists' research on the changes to pensions.Sherrill Stroschein, 'USS strike: social media has collapsed the case for pension cuts', Times Higher Education (12 March 2018). Social media were also used to satirise universities' senior management: for example, the hashtag #FindMyProvost was used to mock vice-chancellors who did not engage with staff, and the 'UCU Strikeposting' meme page on Facebook, which was ran by students and staff who supported the strike, and quickly amassed over 6,000 likes in 4 weeks.https://www.facebook.com/shitpostingoncompanytime/ Hashtags were also a powerful organising tool. A prominent example was the Twitter hashtag #NoCapitulation, which emerged as the unifying message university staff rallied behind twenty hours after the Acas agreement of 12 March.Phil Hedges, '(Still) writing a history of now: #NoCapitulation', Interface: A Journal for and about Social Movements, 10 (2018), 196-214. Dr Ed Rooksby, a tutor at Ruskin College Oxford, said \\"the leadership saw this wave of hostility coming towards them and backed down ... I'm sure there wouldn't have been as much momentum without Twitter, and without someone coming up with that hashtag.\\" Dr. Jo Grady, a senior lecturer in employment relations at Sheffield University, stated her belief that Twitter had helped people connect \\"outside of traditional union frameworks\\" and that this was ironic as their employers were the ones who encouraged staff to use social media as a tool for self- promotion. == 2019–20 industrial action on pensions and on the 'four fights' == UCU Four Fights placard Concern about pay and conditions, particularly in relation to high senior pay and expenditure on new buildings in the face of declining staff pay, the gender pay gap, precarious contracts and casualisation, and workloads were all expressed as part of the wider context of the pensions dispute, but also formed the basis of ballots for industrial action across all UK higher education unions (UNISON, Unite, EIS, GMB and UCU) during the period of the pensions strikes. Accordingly, from September to October 2019, UCU balloted members for industrial action in two disputes: renewed industrial action on pensions (for those institutions participating in USS), and new industrial action on pay and conditions (which UCU called the 'four fights'—pay inequality, job insecurity, rising workloads, and pay deflation—for all higher education branches). Ballots were undertaken separately for each institution in the belief that turnout might pass the 50% of members required by the Trade Union Act 2016 at a sufficient number of institutions to enable meaningful industrial action, while averting the risk of an aggregated national ballot falling below the 50% threshold. It was argued that it was necessary to make industrial action possible on both issues at once to avoid gains to overall remuneration made via one channel being negated by losses on the other. === Ballot on USS pensions (31 October 2019) === On 26 May 2019, UCU's Higher Education Sector Conference voted to commence a further dispute with USS employers. UCU wrote to relevant vice-chancellors on 7 June asking them to avert possible industrial action by committing \\"to uphold the level of contributions no higher than 26% (8% for members)\\", in the first instance by seeking to influence USS policy via employers' representatives on the Employers' Pension Forum (EPF) and the UUK nominees to USS's joint negotiating committee. The Union asked that, failing that, employers \\"must cover any increases in full that are needed to maintain current benefits until USS’s governance and valuation methods and assumptions have been overhauled\\".Paul Bridge, 'Notice of Trade Dispute Over USS Pensions' (7 June 2019). On 31 October 2019, UCU reported that of 64 branches balloted, at least 43 had passed the 50% turnout threshold or were otherwise able to take industrial action. The national aggregate of votes (with four institutions still to be counted) achieved a 53% turnout with 79% voting for strike action. ===Ballots concerning joint higher education trade union national pay claim (31 October 2019)===  2018-19 pay negotiations  Strike placard relating to the equality component of the \\"four fights\\". In March 2018, the UK's Joint Negotiating Committee for Higher Education Staff began its round of negotiations for pay in the sector for 2018/19, with unions demanding a large pay uplift. Citing long-term real-term declining pay, on 26 March 2018 the unions submitted a pay claim seeking a 7.5% pay increase or £1,500, whichever was greater; a £10 minimum wage to make all higher education institutions \\"living wage\\" employers; and gender pay equality by 2020. In April 2018, the Universities and Colleges Employers Association proposed a 1.7% pay increase for 2018–19, raising the offer to 2% (and 2.8% for the lowest paid) in May. These figures were both below inflation, which in March 2018 stood at 2.7%.Ellie Bothwell, 'UK university staff offered 2 per cent pay rise', Times Higher Education (11 May 2018). On 6 June 2018, UCU commenced a consultative ballot to determine whether to conduct a formal ballot for industrial action in relation to the UK Joint Negotiating Committee for Higher Education Staff's negotiations over 2018-19 pay. The ballot closed on 27 June 2018, with 82% of participating members voting to reject the offer from the University and Colleges Employers' Association of a minimum pay rise of 2 per cent, rising to 2.8 per cent for the lowest paid.Anna McKie, 'UK university staff to vote on strike action in pay dispute', Times Higher Education (29 June 2018). UCU formally declared a trade dispute on 24 July 2018.'HE national negotiations 2018-19' (accessed 11 September 2018). On 21 August 2018, UCU served statutory notice of its intention to ballot members for industrial action regarding the 2018-19 national pay dispute. The ballot opened on 30 August 2018. On 22 October 2018 UCU announced the results of the ballot. Although the majority of Union members who voted elected to take industrial action, the turnout only passed the 50% of members required by the Trade Union Act 2016 at seven universities (alongside which three Northern Irish universities, unaffected by the legislation, also voted to strike).'Trade union laws frustrate national support for strike action on pay' (22 October 2018). Likewise, on 29 October Unison reported that although a majority of voting members had supported strike action, the vote was frustrated by insufficient turnout.'Higher education ballot result' (29 October 2018). On 7 November, UCU's special higher education sector conference decided to run another ballot, this time aggregating votes across the sector rather than running a different ballot for each university. On 23 November, the ballot was scheduled to run from 14 January to 22 February 2019.'Next Steps Agreed', HE national negotiations 2018-19 (26 November 2018). This ballot achieved a turnout of only 41%, so again led to no industrial action.Chris Havergal, 'UK union members vote to strike over pay but turnout falls short', Times Higher Education (22 February 2019).Jo McNeill, 'The pay ballot shows that the UCU is stronger than ever', Times Higher Education (25 February 2019).  2019-20 pay negotiations  Strike placard relating to the casualisation and workload components of the \\"four fights\\". On 1 May 2019, employers' final offer in the 2019-20 pay negotiations was 1.8%, rising to 3.65% for the lowest paid (deleting the lowest point on the pay scale to ensure a living wage for all staff). For most members, the offered raise was below inflation (then 2.4% RPI), and unions called for an increase of RPI+3% or of £3,349 – whichever was greater.Chris Havergal, 'Final pay offer promises 1.8 per cent minimum rise for UK staff', Times Higher Education (1 May 2019). Later that month, the UCU congress resolved to campaign to win an industrial action ballot on this offer, with a campaign naming the 'four fights' of pay, equality, casualisation, and workload. Unite and Unison also resolved to ballot on pay. On 31 October 2019, Unison reported that although around 66% of members voting had voted for strike action, turnout had not passed the 50% threshold. Likewise, Unite announced that 73.3% of members had voted to take action, but that turnout had been 32.1%.'Higher Education Pay Vote to strike'. On the same day, UCU reported that of 148 branches balloted, at least 54 had passed the 50% turnout threshold or were otherwise able to take industrial action. The national aggregate of votes achieved a 49% turnout with 74% voting for strike action (with four institutions still to be counted). === UCU announces eight days of strikes (5 November 2019) === On 5 November 2019, UCU announced that at those institutions with a legal mandate to strike, eight consecutive strike days would be held from Monday 25 November to Wednesday 4 December, 'unless', in the words of UCU's general secretary Jo Grady, 'the employers start talking to us seriously about how they are going to deal with rising pension costs and declining pay and conditions'. Following 4 December, Union members were also to begin action short of a strike (such as 'working to contract'). 60 universities were to be affected (43 regarding both pensions and pay, 14 regarding pay only, and 3 regarding pensions only).'UCU announces eight days of strikes starting this month at 60 universities' (5 November 2019).Sally Weale, 'University strike could affect more than a million students, says union', The Guardian (5 November 2019). It was estimated that the strikes would affect over a million students.Eleanor Busby, 'UK university strikes: Walkouts at 60 institutions to hit more than a million students', The Independent (5 November 2019). Spokespeople for UUK and Universities & Colleges Employers Association argued that UCU did not have a strong mandate for action given that the majority of branches had not qualified to take strike action. The UUK spokesperson expressed hopes that the industrial dispute could be resolved without strike action and that UCU 'will now join us to consider governance reforms and alternative options for future valuations' regarding USS. The UCea spokesperson argued that the 2019-20 national pay negotiations had delivered a pay deal 'at the very limit of what is affordable'.Anna McKie, 'UCU announces eight days of strikes, starting late November', Times Higher Education (5 November 2019). Opinion among university leaders was not uniform, however: on 15 November, the vice-chancellor of the University of Essex argued that 'the University of Essex is willing to increase contributions to the scheme to sustain critical features of the USS, including defined benefits'.Anthony Forster, 'As a university leader, I think we can afford a better pensions deal for striking staff', The Guardian (15 November 2019).Chris Havergal, 'Essex v-c says universities can afford to pay more into pensions', Times Higher Education (18 November 2019). On 19 November, UUK and UCEA jointly wrote an open letter 'to staff impacted by the UCU pensions and pay disputes', partly arguing that 'the publication of the JEP's second report will present UUK and UCU with the opportunity to develop a valuable and sustainable future for USS' and that while universities 'simply cannot afford to put more into this year's pay increases than they already have', UCEA had invited negotiations on 'workload, gender pay/equality and casual employment arrangements'.https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/news/Documents/uuk-ucea-open- letter-ucu-disputes-pensions-pay.pdf UCU's response included the argument that 'you cannot refuse to talk about pay yet say you want to talk about closing pay gaps that exist for women and BME staff' and that 'we are always keen to negotiate and will attend talks to try and avert the disruption the strikes will inevitably cause'.'UCU accuses universities of 'playing games' after they offer to talk about anything but pay' (19 November 2019). === Strikes take place (25 November–4 December 2019) === UCU Strike Rally, Buchanan Street, Glasgow. University of Leeds Sociologists on Strike banner Strikes began on 25 November. According to figures subsequently gathered by UCEA, 29.2% of UCU members at the affected universities took strike action, representing 5% of all staff at those universities (not all of whom were in the constituency represented by UCU), though around 26% reported pockets of high impact on teaching.Anna McKie, 'One in three union members joined strikes, say employers', Times Higher Education (7 January 2020). As in 2018, striking staff at a number of universities ran educational 'teach-outs' off campus, which were open to students affected by the strikes.Andrew Jack, 'University staff launch 8-day strike across UK', Financial Times (25 November 2019). On 27 November, negotiators from UCU and UCEA met, with UCEA pledging to consult its members on 'gender and ethnicity pay gaps, casual employment arrangements and workload' ahead of a meeting the next week, while stating that it had no mandate to alter the pay increase that had been implemented for the 2019–20 academic year.'Statement from today's meeting between UCEA and UCU' (27 November 2019).'UCU statement on latest pay talks' (27 November 2019). Employers' organisations continued to argue that the strike represented a minority of staff in a minority of universities,Anna McKie, '\\"Solid\\" support for strikes as staff rally over pay and pensions', Times Higher Education (25 November 2019). with Oxford Brookes University's vice-chancellor Alistair Fitt arguing further that 'the call for more money comes at a time when universities are operating in a challenging environment amid increased competition, a freeze on tuition fees, and prolonged uncertainty over the implications of Brexit'.Alistair Fitt, 'Why we’re asking college lecturers to stop striking over pensions and get back to talking', The Times (25 November 2019). A few universities were reported as being heavy-handed in their response to the strikes, with the University of Liverpool attracting criticism for telling its students they must not join picket lines;Sally Weale and David Batty, 'International students crossing picket lines \\"out of fear of losing visas\\"', The Guardian (27 November 2019). Sheffield Hallam putting a form online for students to record which lecturers were on strike (which attracted a large number of satirical submissions);Helena Horton, 'Students complain they are being asked to 'snitch' after university asks for names of striking lecturers as eight day industrial action begins', The Telegraph (25 November 2019). and the University of Birmingham telling its staff that picketing on campus would be trespass (which attracted a large petition in opposition). As the strikes began, the Guardian published an editorial arguing that the strikes represented \\"a battle for the soul of the campus\\" and that \\"the market model in higher education has created an intellectual precariat who are right to fight back\\".'The Guardian view on university strikes: a battle for the soul of the campus', The Guardian (25 November 2019). Soon after, the Financial Times ran en editorial arguing that \\"while academics and universities might not want to hear it, if the USS is to continue operating, the money has to come from them\\", and also saying that \\"the current industrial action carries wider significance than the fate of a disputed retirement plan. It has exposed the precariousness of Britain's higher education system as it has become more of a marketplace\\", and calling for an \\"independent inquiry\\" into the handling of the USS valuation \\"by all key players, including the Pensions Regulator\\".\\"Universities strike is over more than just pensions\\", The Financial Times (28 November 2019).

Support from individual university students' unions was less clear, with some, such as the University of Birmingham Guild of Students, taking an explicitly neutral stance.Ewan Somerville and Phoebe Southworth, 'Picket lines are trespassing, University of Birmingham tells its striking lecturers', The Telegraph (28 November 2019). Reading University Students Union voted to support the strikes, but was unusual in doing so.Alex Seabrook, 'University of Reading students support the strike', The Reading Chronicle (28 November 2019). The Times reported that 'by and large' students 'support their lecturers and their anger is with universities and vice-chancellors'.Rosemary Bennett, 'Students join picket lines to support striking lecturers', The Times (26 November 2019), p. 2. In Edinburgh, students occupied David Hume Tower in solidarity with the strike,Joshua King, 'Edinburgh students occupy David Hume Tower in solidarity with striking lecturers', Edinburgh Evening News (26 November 2019). while students at Strathclyde University occupied a lecture theatre (both in support of the strikes and in protest at what they called 'rampant mismanagement, alleged corruption and irresponsible fossil fuel investment at the University of Strathclyde').Lynn Love, 'Strathclyde University students barricade themselves in lecture theatre to support striking staff', The Daily Record (26 November 2019).James Delaney, 'Scottish University students take over lecture hall in solidarity with striking staff', The Herald (26 November 2019). Students at the University of Stirling occupied a management building for two weeks, later receiving an eight-week suspension in punishment.Eleanor Busby and Gina Gambetta, \\"University strikes: Students face punishment after supporting staff walkouts\\", The Independent (21 February 2020). Some scholarly societies, such as the American Studies Association, expressed support for the strike.'Statement of Support with the (UK) University and College Union' (2 December 2019). The 2019 strikes took place in a somewhat different regulatory and legal environment from the 2018 ones, due to the establishment of the Office for Students and the emergence of a body of case-law from the Office of the Independent Adjudicator on the compensation of students for lost teaching in the wake of the 2018 strikes.Bill Gardner, 'Lecturers' strike risks having a damaging effect on students with mental health problems, complaints watchdog warns', The Telegraph (26 November 2019).Fabio Aricò, 'University strikes: yes, students should get compensation – but not in the form of monetary payment', The Conversation (27 November 2019). Growing anxiety about the position of international students whose visa requirements for class attendance might be affected by the strikes, in the context of the UK Home Office's hostile environment policy towards migrants, was also in evidence. The University of Liverpool and Goldsmiths University attracted particular attention for telling international students that missing classes on account of refusing to cross picket lines might jeopardise their visas.Max Clements, 'University of Liverpool under fire over 'intimidating' letter to students about strike action', The Liverpool Echo (25 November 2019), p. 13. === Following strike action (5–12 December 2019) === In the wake of the strike action, UCU called for 'action short of a strike' in the form of 'working to contract', interpreted primarily as working only the hours notionally required and not rescheduling teaching missed during the strikes. As in 2018, universities' responses to this varied, with some threatening pay deductions for 'partial performance' in the event of staff not rescheduling teaching and others not planning to deduct pay.Anna McKie, 'Universities split over pay deductions for action short of strike', Times Higher Education (3 December 2019).Andrew Chitty, Felicity Callard, and Leon Rocha, 'University management tactics on strike and ASOS pay deductions – and ways to push back', USSbriefs (5 December 2019).

On 4 December, UCU began reballoting thirteen branches which had nearly succeeded in achieving the 50% voter turnout necessary to take strike action, in the belief that the strike action at other branches would galvanise members into voting. It was believed that this would strengthen the threat of further industrial action.Anna McKie, 'Fresh strike ballots at 13 UK universities over pay and pensions', Times Higher Education (26 November 2019).\\"Strike Ballots to Open at another 24 Universities\\" (18 December 2019). ===Second report of the Joint Expert Panel on pensions (13 December 2019)=== 13 December saw the publication of the Joint Expert Panel's second report.

Reporting focused on the Panel's proposal to introduce a dual discount rate into the USS pension scheme, whereby the fund supporting members who had retired would be put into low-risk, low-return investments, but the remainder of the fund (accruing to working members who had not yet retired) would be free to be invested in higher-risk, higher-return holdings.https://www.professionalpensions.com/news/4008278/uss-joint-panel- dual-discount-rate-proposal-%E2%80%98broadly-aligns%E2%80%99-tpr- views.https://www.pensionsage.com/pa/JEP-publishes-recommendations-to-ease- USS-dispute.php. The report was welcomed by UUK and UCU and media reporting suggested that negotiations in its wake could lead to the cessation of impending industrial action;Anna McKie, 'Fresh UK pension scheme talks ‘could avert further strikes’', Times Higher Education (23 December 2019). as strikes loomed in February, however, the UCU general secretary Jo Grady commented that 'most importantly, employers have not yet offered to cover the unfair contribution increases that are pricing members out of the scheme', implying that this was a key sticking point.Jo Grady, 'UCU calls 14 more days of strike action in higher education' (3 February 2020). The report also recommended three-way talks between UCU, UUK and USS on the governance of USS to lead to future pension policies being more satisfactory to scheme stakeholders. The 'tripartite group' first met on 17 January 2020.Joanne Segars, 'Statement of the first meeting of the tripartite group' (17 January 2020). In mid-January 2020, the University of Sussex launched an \\"industrial action ex gratia scheme\\" to compensate students up to £100 for inconvenience caused by the ongoing industrial action. It this became the first UK university to offer compensation while industrial action was still in process.Richard Adams, \\"Sussex University offers students up to £100 for strike distress\\", The Guardian (15 January 2020). On 15 January, the Wellcome Trust published the report 'What Researchers Think About the Culture They Work In',\\"What Researchers Think About the Culture They Work In\\" (London: Wellcome Trust, 2020). which found that 29% of respondents felt secure in their jobs.Ian Sample, \\"Researchers facing ‘shocking’ levels of stress, survey reveals\\", The Guardian (15 January 2020). On 20 January, UCU published a report on 'the dehumanising effects of casualisation in higher education' that noted that '67,000 research staff were on fixed-term contracts, making up two-thirds of the total research staff employed at universities, alongside 30,000 contracted teaching staff, many paid by the hour. A further 69,000 academic staff were on \\"atypical contracts\\" and so are not counted in the main staff record, while an estimated 6,500 were on zero-hours contracts'.Richard Adams, \\"Thousands of UK academics 'treated as second-class citizens'\\", The Guardian (20 January 2020).Nick Megoran and Olivia Mason, \\"Second class academic citizens: The dehumanising effects of casualisation in higher education\\" (London: University and College Union, 2020). ===UCEA publish negotiating position (27 January 2020)=== On 27 January, UCEA published a document 'offered as part of a potential composite JNCHES settlement for 2019-20' addressing the Four Fights issues, with the exception of pay (where the pay rise offered remained at 1.8%).'REVISED PROPOSALS presented on 27 January 2020'.Anna KcKie, 'UK universities make offer on sector working conditions in dispute', Times Higher Education (29 January 2020). UCEA noted that it had been 'given the scope to go further than ever before as a national employer representative body', proposed to set 'expectations' for the employment practices of individual institutions, and summarised its offer at sector-level thus:'What’s in UCEA’s offer on contractual arrangements; workload and mental health; and gender pay gap and ethnicity pay' (London: UCEA, 2020). > * For contractual arrangements, a new trade union/employer working group to > examine the annual national staff record (HESA), looking for example at > trends in 'zero hours' and 'hourly-paid' employment, and contractual > arrangements across protected characteristics.

UCU welcomed these offers as progress but criticised the lack of an improved offer on pay and argued that UCEA needed to provide universities with 'a clear set of mechanisms for policing and enforcing the expectations which they are signing up to'. ===Fourteen more universities ballot for strike action (29 January 2020)=== Posters in Leeds, February 2020. On 29 January 2020, UCU announced results from the December–January reballots of selected universities that had failed to secure a 50% turnout in the 2019 ballots. As a result, two further universities joined the disputes on pensions and pay/conditions; nine joined the dispute on pay/conditions alone; and three joined the dispute on pensions alone; and two that had been on strike about pensions only added pay/conditions to their disputes. The number of institutions with a mandate to strike at this point stood at 74 in total: 47 for pay/conditions and pensions, 22 for pay/conditions only, and 5 for pensions only.\\"Staff at another 14 universities can join strike action\\" (29 January 2020). === Strikes recommence (20 February 2020) ===  Before the strikes  University of Leeds strike rally outside the Parkinson Building, 26 February 2020. Group of people assembled for a teach-out in front of King's College London entrance on the Strand, 2 March 2020 On 3 February 2020, following consultation with branch representatives at the union's Higher Education Committee, UCU announced fourteen days of strike action, escalating over a period running from 20 February to 13 March: 20–21 February, 24–26 February, 2–5 March and 9–13 March.Anna McKie, 'Union calls 14-day strike in UK pay and pensions dispute', Times Higher Education (3 February 2020).Anna McKie, 'Union tries to keep members on board as more strikes near', Times Higher Education (10 February 2020).'UCU announces 14 strike days at 74 UK universities in February and March' (3 February 2020). During February, UUK consulted its members on the possibility of making a new offer in the pensions dispute, responding to UCU's request that employers shoulder more of the burden of rising pensions contributions. 84% opposed the idea of making a new offer. Meanwhile, UCEA did not alter the offer it had made on 27 January.Anna McKie, \\"Employers refuse to back down on eve of UK university strikes\\", Times Higher Education (18 February 2020).https://www.ussemployers.org.uk/briefing-resources/background- and-briefings/open-letter-uuk-and-ucea-staff-about-2020-industrial-action. During the same period, the Times Higher Education reported restiveness among some UCU members about the desirability of further strikes.Anna McKie, \\"Union tries to keep members on board as more strikes near\\", Times Higher Education (10 February 2020).  Weeks 1-2 (20–26 February)  Strikes began on 20 February, with 74 universities affected, and news reporting on the day focusing on the determination of striking staff picketing in rainy weather.Anna McKie, \\"UK university strikes: ‘grim determination’ on the picket lines\\", Times Higher Education (20 February 2020).Sally Weale and Laith Al- Khalaf, \\"Thousands of university workers strike across UK\\", The Guardian (20 February 2020).\\"Education Workers Strike Back\\", The Socialist (20-26 February 2020), pp. 16, 7.

UCEA resumed negotiations with UCU on Monday 24 February,Jo Grady, \\"Further talks and more on the Four Fights dispute\\" (24 February 2020). and UUK resumed negotiations on Tuesday 25th.Jo Grady, \\"Employers agree to further negotiations\\" (26 February 2020). Negotiations continued throughout that week.Jo Grady, \\"Negotiations update: more USS talks on Friday\\" (27 February 2020).

By the end of the third week of strike action (Friday 6 March), UCU summarised the position of negotiations as showing good progress on achieving a UK-wide, sector level framework to address casualisation, gender pay-gaps, and workload, with continued debate concerning the pay deal. Regarding pensions, the Union represented UUK as putting more pressure on USS for reform, but little progress on convincing employers to shoulder a higher proportion of rising pension contributions.Jo Grady, \\"Detailed negotiations update\\" (5 March 2020).\\"Negotiators' statement on Four Fights negotiations\\" (5 March 2020).  Week 4 (9–13 March)  Little news emerged from negotiations, and on 11 March UCU negotiators on the Four Fights made it clear that good progress had been made on three, but that the sticking point for them was pay, and argued that UCU members would need to continue industrial action to achieve improvements in that area.'Four Fights negotiators’ update 11 March' (11 March 2020). Meanwhile, debate on USS was complicated by USS beginning their 2020 valuation, with UCU criticising USS's valuation methods and calling on UUK for support. No significant change appeared to have come about in employers' willingness to shoulder more of the rising costs of the pension scheme.Anna McKie, \\"Union says USS valuation proposals ‘ignore members’ views’\\", Times Higher Education (10 March 2020). As the strikes came to an end, UK universities found themselves under a relatively sudden set of pressures as the COVID-19 pandemic led to falling projections for international student recruitment,Richard Adams and Rachel Hall, \\"UK universities face cash black hole amid coronavirus crisis\\", The Guardian (6 March 2020). and UK universities rapidly switching their teaching to online modes.John Morgan, \\"Coronavirus: LSE to teach online for rest of academic year\\", Times Higher Education (12 March 2020).Richard Adams, \\"UK universities switching to online lectures and exams\\", The Guardian (12 March 2020).\\"Coronavirus: Face-to-face lectures cancelled at some universities\\", BBC News (12 March 2020). UCU cancelled rallies on the last day of strikes to reduce the risk of infection.Jo Grady, \\"Coronavirus advice in relation to industrial action\\" (12 March 2020).  Responses to the strike  Student support at the outset of the strike was estimated at 47% by an unscientific poll reported by the BBC.\\"Students hit by 14-day university staff strike\\", BBC News (20 February 2020). With continued NUS support for the strikes, twenty- six students' unions wrote to the Minister of State for Universities, the chairs of the UCEA and USS trustee boards and the Chief Executive of Universities UK, expressing support for UCU and urging a swift resolution to the strikes.https://www.ucu.org.uk/media/10756/Joint-student-unions-HE- dispute-letter-Mar-20/pdf/studentunions_hedisputeletter_mar20.pdf. As in previous strikes, there was a student occupation, in this case of the Old Schools in Cambridge.Claudia Rowan, \\"Old Schools occupied by Cambridge Marxist Society and Cambridge Defend Education\\", The Cambridge Tab (3 March 2020). UCU members continued to find innovative ways to picket, with developments including a group of picketing runners circumnavigating the University of Leeds campus.Peter Lazenby, \\"Striking UCU lecturers stage a ‘running picket line’ at Leeds University\\", The Morning Star (2 March 2020). === After the strikes === The prospect of convulsive changes to university staff workload and working conditions caused by universities' responses to the pandemic increased the complexities and tensions surrounding the dispute. To continue legally constituted industrial action, most branches at this time needed to reballot for action; however, the reballots were postponded due to the crisis, and the legal mandate for industrial action expired on 28 April 2020.Jo Grady, 'Reballots postponed due to Covid-19; pickets cancelled but action continues' (15 March 2020). Against the backdrop of the closure of UK campuses and an improvised sector-wide shift to online teaching, negotiations on the disputes continued. On 1 April 2020, UCEA tabled a new offer regarding the Four Fights dispute.UCEA, 'Without Prejudice'. As before, there was no increase in UCEA's previous pay increase offer of 1.8%, but the offer did include more explicit resolutions to establish sector-wide 'expectations' and 'recommendations' that all employers should implement through action and negotiation with unions at a local level. On 16 May UCU announced that it would convene representatives from its branches on 26 May with a decision about the Union's next step to be taken by its Higher Education Committee the next day.'Four Fights branch briefing' (May 2020). The dispute over the USS pension was also cast into a new light by the economic shock of the pandemic and fears over the short-time financing of the UK higher education sector;Jack Grove, 'Coronavirus: USS pensions could become ‘much less generous’', Times Higher Education (23 March 2020). the fund breached a self-sufficiency measure on 12 March and reported itself to The Pensions Regulator accordingly. Fears were made more acute by the fact that USS's statutory annual valuation date fell on 31 March, in the midst of the economic crash.Anna McKie, 'USS proceeds with valuation ‘in the middle of a crisis’', Times Higher Education (15 April 2020). In April 2020, UCU and UUK issued a joint statement on their position in relation to USS, in this respect presenting a united front against the pension trustees.'This document has been jointly agreed by UCU and UUK and sets out their position, as stakeholders, on key issues relating to USS' (April 2020). == Table of UK higher education strikes 2018–20 == { class=\\" mw-collapsible\\" +  2018  colspan=\\"2\\" 2019\\"More universities to be balloted for strikes\\" (26 November 2019).  colspan=\\"2\\" 2020 2018-20 -  USS USS Four Fights USS Four Fights Local disputes - Aberdeen, University of × ×  ×   - Aberystwyth University ×      - Aston University × × × × ×  - Bangor University × × × × ×  - Bath, University of × × × × ×  - Bath Spa University     ×  - Birkbeck College, University of London ×   × ×  - Birmingham, University of ?

He was educated at Newcastle-under-Lyme High School, and in 1912, inspired by his father's friend Dr Wheelton Hind, Southwell joined the University of Birmingham to study petroleum technology, then a new course established by John Cadman (later Lord Cadman).H.

His job entailed exploring the Middle East for oil deposits and he successfully predicted the presence of oilfields under Kuwait. During the Second World War, he was placed in charge of oil exploration in the United Kingdom (he took the rank of temporary Lieutenant-Colonel and was also on the Government Committee on Business Training in 1945),\\"Sir Philip Southwell\\", The Times (London), 10 December 1981, p. 14. but with the war over he returned his sights to Kuwait. In 1946 he was invited to join the Kuwait Oil Company as Manager Director, serving until 1959. The company was jointly run by BP and the American company Gulf Oil; he was responsible for exploring and extracting Kuwaiti oil and oversaw the company's 15,000 employees. According to his obituary in the Journal of the Royal Society of Arts, \\"he developed the Kuwait oilfields so rapidly that Britain suffered little from the Iranian oil nationalization [in 1951]. He encouraged better relations with Middle Eastern countries and local control of oil resources, and deplored the invasion of Suez.\\" Southwell was President of the Institute of Petroleum for the 1951–52 year. He received the Silver Medal from the Royal Society of Arts in 1953 and the Institute of Petroleum's Cadman Memorial Medal in 1954. He was President (1960–80) of Brown and Root (UK) Limited, Chairman of Highland Fabricators from 1968 to 1980, and Director-General of St John Ambulance in 1968. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1954 and a Knight Bachelor in 1958; he was also a Bailiff Grand Cross of the Order of St John (GCStJ). In 1926, he married Mary Burnett, daughter of Thomas Scarratt, of Ipstones.

Until 1991, it was called the Beauharnois Tunnel. == History  Construction === The construction of the tunnel was carried out as part of the construction of the Beauharnois Canal, between 1956 and 1957. The tunnel consists of 18 caissons, placed directly on the rock, one lane in each direction, one sidewalk on the north side and three ventilation shafts, one of which is used for the air outlet and two others for the air inlet. The tunnel passes under the Beauharnois Canal in Melocheville and is an integral part of the St. Lawrence Seaway. === Improvements === In 1968, work was carried out for tunnel rehabilitation and resurfacing. Since then, maintenance work such as road repairs, repair of tunnel walls and rehabilitation of approaches have been carried out to ensure a safe and efficient passage for users and preserve the integrity of the structure. == Circulation == In the tunnel, the two traffic directions are separated by a central support structure forming the first ventilation shaft (air outlet).

During the short siege, which lasted several weeks in the autumn of 1618, an assault of the city was unsuccessful. Having failed, the Polish-Lithuanian government went to the conclusion of the Truce of Deulino. == Prelude == The campaign was presented as an action by the \\"legitimate\\" Tsar Wladyslaw Vasa against the \\"usurper\\" Michael Romanov . The Crown forces led by Wladyslaw (6,000 men) and Lithuanian under the command of the Great Hetman Jan Karol Chodkiewicz (6,500 men) took part in the campaign. Wladyslaw started from Warsaw on April 5, 1617, but only in September arrived in Smolensk. The Russian government pulled all available forces into the western direction, and in the Mozhaysk area, the Poles were given serious resistance. The Battle of Mozhaysk lasted all summer of 1618. Despite the fact that Russian troops eventually had to retreat, the Polish-Lithuanian army lost time, and was severely weakened as the gentry left the camp en masse due to non-payment of salaries. On October 2, the Polish-Lithuanian army of about 8.000 approached Moscow and settled in Tushino, on the site of the former impostor's camp. They were reinforced by 18.000 Zaporozhian Cossacks, led by Hetman Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny, who easily advanced from the southwest to Moscow, along the way capturing a number of small fortresses. == Siege == According to the military register books, the Moscow garrison numbered only about 11 500 people. Of these, about 5,500 people were a militia gathered throughout Moscow, about a half of them armed with firearms. Even less reliable defenders were the Cossacks (about 1.450 horse and 1.150 foot). In addition to low fighting spirit, there was a threat of direct betrayal. As the most reliable defense of Moscow were service people (about 450 Moscow nobles and up to 900 provincial gentry and boyar children) and Streltsy of four Moscow orders (up to 1.500 men). In addition to them, the garrison included about 300 German mercenaries and 450 Tatars. During the night of October 10, invaders made a general assault. The main Polish-Lithuanian forces attacked on the Arbat gate (2,700 men) and Tver gate (2,300 men) . The gate attack scheme was identical: infantry fire was to cause the defenders to leave the walls, while the engineers destroy the gates with petards. Despite the huge numerical superiority of the Cossacks, they had an auxiliary role. Hussar banners, in contrast to the events of 1612 , Chodkiewicz left in reserve. Shortly before the storm began, two French engineers ran over to the Russian side, delivering Polish plans to the defenders. As might be expected, the assault forces immediately encountered prepared and stubborn resistance. The attack of the Tver Gate was stopped immediately: the fire of Russian infantry from the walls of the White City scattered the enemy ranks. The walls of the fortress were too high for assault ladders. A huge mass of Cossacks did not dare to engage in battle. At the Arbat Gate, Poles breached the wooden fortifications and pressed into the city. They were stopped by a detachment of German mercenaries. Around them rallied the other soldiers, and in the evening the Poles were knocked out of the fortification. == Aftermath == The failure of the assault meant the collapse of the hopes of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth government to occupy the Russian throne with a Polish protege. Nevertheless, the position of the Russian government was extremely difficult. Polish-Lithuanian troops and Zaporozhian Cossacks kept dozens of towns and fortresses and continued to threaten the capital and major centers (Yaroslavl and Kaluga). Battle of Mozhaysk demonstrated that the Russian army can not reverse the course of the war in their favor. This forced the Russian government to accept the difficult conditions of the Truce of Deulino. == References == Moscow 1618 Moscow 1618 Moscow 1618 Category:Sieges involving the Grand Duchy of Lithuania Category:Military history of Moscow Category:Conflicts in 1618 Category:1618 in Russia Category:17th century in Moscow ","title":"Siege of Moscow (1618)"},{"id":"56820853","text":"The list of shipwrecks in January 1843 includes ships sunk, foundered, wrecked, grounded, or otherwise lost during January 1843. ==1 January2 January3 January4 January5 January6 January7 January8 January9 January10 January11 January12 January13 January14 January15 January16 January17 January18 January19 January20 January21 January22 January23 January24 January25 January26 January27 January28 January29 January30 January31 JanuaryUnknown dateReferences== 1843-01 ","title":"List of shipwrecks in January 1843"},{"id":"56820861","text":"Volos railway station () is a railway station in Volos, Greece. located within the city itself (close to the harbour). Opened on 22 April 1884 by the Thessaly Railways (now part of OSE). Today TrainOSE operates three daily local trains to Larissa. Previously Thessaly Railways oparted a narrow gage service to Mileai from Volos, however this service now starts and terminates from Ano Lechonia (12km from Volos).http://www.trainose.gr/en/tourism-culture/train- and-recreation/the-pelion-train/ ==History== The station was opened on 22 April 1884, an inauguration led by King George. The station building (and the line) was designed by the Italian Evaristo de Chirico, (father of Giorgio de Chirico) soon after the liberation of Central Greece from the Ottomans. Part of the station still functions in this picturesque 1884 structure, reminiscent of a stately home to some. The building, built between 1900 and 1903 under Evaristo De Chirico, served as the administrative headquarters of the Thessaly Railways. The building remains much the same the day it was constructed and is one of the few buildings that survived the earthquakes that hit Volos in the 1950s.http://www.trainose.gr/en/ιστορικός-σταθμός-βόλου/ Its roof is birch and has a wooden outline. Outside the station there is a statue of the goddess Athena, the work of the Italian sculptor I. Previsan. In 1955 Thessaly Railways was absorbed into Hellenic State Railways (SEK). https://thessalyrailways.gr/?page_id=2768⟨=en In 1960 the line from Larissa to Volos was converted to standard gauge and connected though Larissa to the mainline from Athens to Thessaloniki, allowing OSE to run through services to Volos from Athens and Thessaloniki. Volos station was converted to dual gauge, in order to accommodate trains of the two branches. Parts of the station and the track towards the city centre were at this period of a unique triple-gauge system: standard gauge for Larissa trains, metre gauge for Kalambaka trains and gauge for Pellon trains. The section from Volos to Agria line was operated as a heritage railway by \\"The Friends of Pelion Railway\\" between 1987 and 1994, but OSE forced them to terminate the operation in a row over competition. However, in 1996 OSE reopened the section from Ano Lechonia to Mileai as a heritage railway, initially using steam traction and converting to diesel traction in 1999. However there is currently no connection between Volos and Ano Lekhonia. Today the first floor of the station building is given over to a museum. ==Facilities== The station is staffed, with a cafe in the station.

Volos is directly linked with Athens once per day, with Thessaloniki twice per day, and with Larissa 15 times a day. In the past Volos was served by railway lines of three different gauges, the metre gauge line of Thessaly Railways to Kalambaka, the standard gauge line to Larissa and the gauge line to Pelion. Remnants of triple gauge lines still exist near the station. Currently, the Pelion railway operates for touristic heritage service every Saturday, Sunday and public holiday from mid-April to the end of October from Ano Lehonia.

Born in Campbell County, Virginia, Morgan was the daughter of Robert Withers Morgan and grew up at the family estate, Centerview, in Lynchburg. In the 1890s she taught art in the local public schools before beginning more formal study in Lynchburg with Bernhard Gutmann, in 1895; she continued her lessons with Louise Jordan Smith. An alumna of Randolph-Macon Woman's College, she traveled to Paris for study at the Académie Julian. She began her teaching career as an art instructor at Lynchburg College in 1906; from 1915 until 1945 she chaired the art department at the same institution, during which time she traveled to Philadelphia and Gloucester, Massachusetts for further study. She continued living at Centerview with her mother in the 1910s and 1920s; according to family tradition she used the dependency behind the house as a studio during this time. In 1923, she and her mother's other heirs sold the house out of the family. Active in civic affairs, Morgan was among the founders of the Lynchburg Civic Art League in 1932; four years later she was among those who worked to establish the Federal Art Gallery in the city, a project of the Works Progress Administration. She also served in other capacities locally, including a stint as vice-president of the Lynchburg Historical Society from 1933 until 1936. During her career Morgan was elected to the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors. As an artist she produced mainly miniatures and landscapes, which she showed in galleries along the East Coast and at the Paris Salon. She had a reputation as a \\"Bohemian\\" for much of her life; one student recalled how she could frequently be found covered in paint, and it was noted that she kept her brushes in her hair to ensure she would remember where they were. At her death, she was memorialized in the local press as the \\"Dean of Lynchburg Artists\\". She is buried at Lynchburg's Spring Hill Cemetery. A historical marker in Morgan's honor, in front of Centerview, was sponsored by Randolph College and erected under the auspices of the Virginia Department of Historic Resources in 2015; another marker in honor of her father was erected adjacent to it at the same time. ==References== Category:1869 births Category:1951 deaths Category:American women painters Category:19th-century American painters Category:19th-century American women artists Category:20th-century American painters Category:20th- century American women artists Category:Randolph College alumni Category:University of Lynchburg faculty Category:Alumni of the Académie Julian Category:People from Campbell County, Virginia Category:People from Lynchburg, Virginia Category:Painters from Virginia Category:Works Progress Administration in Virginia ","title":"Georgia Weston Morgan"},{"id":"56820908","text":"Clara L.

A brief sketch of the results of the first years of her work appeared in A Woman of the Century. She was a most enthusiastic and persevering student, having taken a thorough course in an art school under able instructors from abroad. She paid considerable attention to portrait painting, but is seen at her best in landscapes. Some of these appeared on the walls of the Boston Art Club in four successive years. Her work was represented at all the exhibitions of the Portland Society of Art. One of her landscapes was thus mentioned: \\"The live, graceful treatment of the long ranks of willows, the shadowy foreground, contrasting with the airy, sunlighted middle distance, all suggest the great French master, Corot\\"; again, \\"The work is strong, showing almost a masculine touch.\\" Of the three pictures that she exhibited at the Midwinter Fair in San Francisco, a critic said, \\"The man who painted these pictures knew his Inisiness.\\" She made many fine sketches of the scenery about Casco Bay. She added to her collection some excellent sketches of mountain and inland scenery. Some of her studies, which were exhibited in Boston, Portland, and other cities, were highly praised by critics, as well as the general public. She made many sketches while in the Sierras and Yosemite Valley. She devoted much time to teaching, being instructor of drawing and painting at Westbrook Seminary, Portland. Dyer passed the summer of 1902 in Europe, visiting the art galleries and the British Museum in London, the Louvre and Luxembourg in Paris, the Vatican in Rome, also galleries in Florence, Venice, Naples, Milan, Amsterdam, and the Hague. After her return, she produced from her sketches many interesting pictures of Venice and Holland. Dyer was among the first members of the Society of Art and the Portland Art League.

She proved herself generous by giving paintings to increase by their sale the funds of needy societies. ===Lecturer, reader=== As Dyer was well drilled in elocution and in parliamentary usage, she became a power in the club work of Portland. She served as president of the Faneuil Club and also of the Mutual Improvement Club, and was a member of the Civic, Cresco, and Conklin Class. For two years, she was chair of the Schoolroom Decoration Committee, and while working in this line gave a lecture in \\"Across the Sierras to the Yosemite,\\" which received favorable comments by the press, and added to the fund.

Amongst the distinguished Irish ecclesiastics present in Rome at this time were Oliver Plunkett and John Brennan. On 19 1669 Dowley was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Limerick. Despite initial hesitation about the appointment which was expressed to William Burgat the clergy of the diocese accepted Dowley. After his arrival in the diocese he endeavoured to visit every church and sent a report to Rome. The diocese was judged to be in good shape despite not having a bishop for fifteen years. Douley was consecrated bishop on 19 August 1677 with the principal consecrator being his old Roman friend John Brenan who assisted by Bishop Creagh of Cork and James Phelan of Ossory.

It was written for the 275th anniversary of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra in 2018. ==History== Widmann was appointed for the season 2017–2018 as the first Gewandhauskomponist (Gewandhaus composer). Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra and Boston Symphony Orchestra commissioned Partita in 2015 as part of the collaboration between both orchestras. The work was composed from 2017 to 2018 for the 275th anniversary of the Gewandhaus Orchestra. ==Structure== The five reminiscences, a partita, are: # Grave – Gigue # Andante # Divertimento # Sarabande # Chaconne ==Music== The five pieces refer to the musical history of Leipzig and Boston. All movements begin with woodwinds. The whole concept of Partita is to link the music of Bach and Mendelssohn. The first reminiscence is influenced by Bach, Bruckner, and Wagner. A bass clarinet solo, playing an endless melody line, dominates the opening, followed by a section with Wagner tubas. The expansionary prelude leads to a first dance of the orchestra, a brief gigue. The second reminiscence Andante cites Mendelssohn's Clarinet Sonata (2nd movement), but starts with an English horn solo. : \\\\relative c' { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"clarinet\\" \\\\time 6/8 \\\\tempo 8 = 80 \\\\key g \\\\minor \\\\partial 8 d8 g8. fis16 g8 bes a g a4( fis8 d) r8 a'16( c) bes4 bes8 \\\\acciaccatura d8 c( bes c) d4 f16 es d4 f16 es d4 f16 es d4\\\\fermata } \\\\layout { \\\\context { \\\\Staff \\\\consists \\"Horizontal_bracket_engraver\\" } } :Mendelssohn: Clarinet Sonata (2nd movement: Andante) Mendelssohn was the Gewandhauskapellmeister from 1835 to 1847. Woodwind figures open the third movement of neo-Baroque ancestry. Widmann cites in the Divertimento the Bach cantanta Tue Rechnung! Donnerwort, BWV 168. The fourth reminiscence, Sarabande, contains bassoons whimpering in highest register. The last reminiscence, a chaconne, starts with a modern decatonic scale, played by an alto flute.

He succeeded his father Mahadeva, and remained on throne for a few months, before being overthrown by his cousin Ramachandra. == Ascension == Ammana was a son and the successor of the Yadava king Mahadeva. Mahadeva had ascended the throne around 1261, after the death of his elder brother Krishna, probably because Krishna's son Ramachandra was a minor at the time. When Mahadeva died around 1270, Ammana became the new king, but Ramachandra contested his claim to the throne. The general public and important officers of the Yadava kingdom probably saw Ramachandra as the rightful heir. This is evident from the fact that courtiers Hemadri and Tikkama, who had been loyal to Mahadeva, supported Ramachandra instead of Ammana. The Purushottamapuri copper-plate inscription of Ramachandra refer to some military achievements of Ammana, but given the short duration of Ammana's reign, this description can be ignored as historically unreliable. == Overthrow == Ammana was a pleasure-loving man, who was fond of dance and music. Ramachandra overthrew him sometime in the second half of 1271 CE. According to an inscription of Ramachandra, he and his followers entered the Devagiri fort, disguising themselves as actors, and arranged a performance before Ammana. During the performance, they suddenly unmasked themselves, and seized Ammana and his supporters. This account is also supported by literary texts such as Bhanuvilasa (a Mahanubhava text) and Nagadeva-Charita of Parashurama-Vyasa. According to the Mahanubhava texts, Ramachandra blinded Ammana. Parashurama Vyasa's Nagadeva-Charita states that Ramachandra killed Ammana, and that Ramachandra's ultimate defeat against the Muslims was a result of this sin. The veracity of this claim is doubtful, since the other texts only mention the blinding, not the killing. Ammana may have died a natural death in prison. == References  Bibliography === * * Category:Seuna (Yadava) dynasty ","title":"Ammana"},{"id":"56821149","text":"The Canadian Screen Award for Best Children's or Youth Non-Fiction Program or Series is an annual television award, presented by the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television to honour the year's best non-fiction television programming for children produced in Canada.

Hovhaness wrote this piece during his so-called \\"Armenian period\\" from 1943-1951, where he was heavily influenced by not only Armenian and other Middle Eastern music but also Indian music. These three Armenian Rhapsodies were his first efforts in using his Armenian roots \\"as the source of a deeper and more individual creative voice.\\" They are the only three pieces to include actual Armenian melodies from Armenian music (songs, dances, church chants, etc.). Critics have noted that these rhapsodies \\"display a sense of atmosphere and a fresh approach to modal polyphony that was not present in his earlier work.\\" Hovhaness wrote three rhapsodies, each with an opus number that was largely uncorrelated; he had just begun attempting to order his works, and began numbering though he did not yet have a system. == Musical influences == Hovhaness was influenced to write many of his pieces by nature as well as by Armenian musical tradition, especially Armenian liturgical music, which he played frequently beginning in 1942 when he was an organist at an Armenian church. His music was said to be \\"spiritually rooted in ancient, and often remote, mysticism.\\" This piece in particular was one of the few pieces where Hovhaness actually incorporated Armenian melodic ideas that existed in Armenian dance, liturgical, and other music. While Hovhaness did rely on the \\"Armenian folk idiom,\\" his pieces remained entirely unique and original, keeping with his voice and musical style while incorporating parts of Armenian musical tradition. It was said to be still of his \\"own construction,\\" rather than being directly quoted and mimicked. Hovhaness was also influenced by Byzantine as well as Baroque ideas, using both improvisatory and fugal, canonical structures in his writing. This improvisatory, Byzantine language became known as a 'spirit murmur' in the context of Hovhaness's pieces which consisted of improvisations across instruments contained within certain scales. == Music == Hovhaness's pieces were often described as \\"[mixing] long, melismatic lines with Baroque-inspired counterpoint,\\" with \\"several rhythmic pulses going on at once, and an individual and unpredictable sense of harmony.\\" Armenian Rhapsody No. 2 uses similar styles. Critics have described the piece as one that \\"develops into a series of at first decidedly un-nationalist fugues,\\" with more typical classical natural minor scales used. Hovhaness then introduces Armenian motifs on top of those un-Armenian sounds, and critics note that \\"the Armenian influences eventually come to dominate the music before it stops rather abruptly.\\" This rhapsody represents Hovhaness trying to get back to his Armenian roots through the basis of traditional Armenian songs. This rhapsody is similar in work and style to Enescu and the musical model of Liszt in the way in draws on tradition and folk songs. === Techniques === Hovhaness used a variety of techniques in his work to create this return to Armenian roots. First, he uses counterpoint and canons and fugues to interweave the two sounds together through overlaying the two melodies and motifs he creates in his work. Next, Hovhaness uses varying rhythmic pulses and rhythmic time (duples, triplets, etc.) to create a sense of confusion and chaos that could represent his feelings about returning to his Armenian roots after growing up in America, but it could also represent his attempt to create a sound where it is hard to tell which sound is which and if they are truly different. Though Hovhaness uses two distinctly different motifs, through the piece he overlays them and distorts them in different ways in order to create a unified sound that represents not just his return to his Armenian roots but perhaps his unification or his American and Armenian roots as well. == Performances/Recordings == The most popular recording of this piece is by Gil Rose and the Boston Modern Orchestra Project. This recording is said to \\"[surpass] all previous recordings,\\" and is known for its impressive \\"recorded sound\\" and for its \\"finer contrapuntal nuances\\" in the set of the three Armenian Rhapsodies. The piece is also said to be one of the most rewarding pieces on the recording (as it was part of a set of multiple songs including the other two Armenian Rhapsodies as well as Exile Symphony No. 1 and Soprano Saxophone Concerto). Critics have credited the producer for not putting the rhapsodies next to each other since they are so similar. == References == Category:Compositions by Alan Hovhaness Category:1944 compositions ","title":"Armenian Rhapsody No. 2 (Op. 51)"},{"id":"56821198","text":"Kanisha Jimenez (born 28 November 1995) is a Puerto Rican female volleyball player.

The battle is part of the Moscow campaign of Wladyslaw IV. During months of fighting, the Russian armies managed to maintain their combat capability and prevent the rapid seizure of Moscow. However, the threat of encirclement forced the Russian troops to retreat, opening the way to the enemy for the capital. == Prelude == After the victory over the Polish-Lithuanian troops in the Battle of Moscow (1612) and the election of Tsar Michael Romanov, Russian troops passed into a counteroffensive. In the years 1613-14 they managed to free most of the captured cities from the Polish-Lithuanian troops and even undertake several raids on the territory of Lithuania . However, the main goal of the campaign - recapture of Smolensk - failed. In turn, the Polish king Sigismund III did not gave up attempts to subjugate the Russian state, in the name of his son Wladyslaw. The new campaign in 1617 was presented as an action by the \\"legitimate\\" Tsar Wladyslaw Vasa against the \\"usurper\\" Michael Romanov. The Crown forces led by Prince Wladyslaw (6,000 men) and Lithuanian under the command of the Great Hetman Ian Karol Khodkevich (6,500 men) took part in the campaign. Prince Wladyslaw started from Warsaw on April 5, 1617, but only in September arrived in Smolensk. In October 1617 Dorogobuzh and Vyazma surrendered to \\"Tsar\\" Wladyslaw without battle. In fact, on the enemy's path to the capital, there was only poorly fortified Mozhaysk and a weak army with a low morale. == Battle == The Russian government pulled all available forces into the western direction, and in the Mozhaysk area, the Poles were given serious resistance. Russian regiments of Voivode Boris Lykov (5.300 cavalry and 460 Streltsy), Dmitry Cherkassky (4.500 cavalry and 780 Streltsy) and Dmitry Pozharsky (3.900 cavalry and 1.500 Streltsy) heavily fortified Mozhaysk and several surrounding towns and monasteries. Fierce fighting near Mozhaysk lasted for entire spring and summer of 1618, with Polish-Lithuanian army unable to break Russian defenses. On July 30, 1618, a detachment of Lisowczycy under the command of Chaplinsky blocked the supply route from Moscow. Soon a Cossack defector informed the Russians that Wladyslaw was going to firmly besiege the Russian fortified camps and force them to surrender with hunger. Supplies in the camps were not enough, especially after a part of train was lost in battle. Realizing this, the government already on August 2, 1618, sent an order to the Voivodes to withdraw from Mozhaysk to Moscow, leaving there a garrison with sufficient supplies. == Aftermath == The fighting near Mozhaysk was not considered a failure by the Russian command. In the course of almost half a year of confrontation (the first half of 1618), Prince Wladyslaw's offensive was delayed, enabling the preparations for the defense of Moscow. The stubborn resistance of the Russian troops dispelled the illusions of the Polish prince about the possibility of resuming the Time of Troubles. On the side of \\"the lawful Tsar Wladyslaw\\", only the garrison of Dorogobuzh and several Cossack villages defected. Rebellion against the Romanovs, which Polish invaders expected, did not happen. ==References== Mozhaysk (1618) Mozhaysk (1618) Mozhaysk (1618) Category:History of Moscow Oblast Category:Conflicts in 1618 Category:1618 in Russia ","title":"Battle of Mozhaysk"},{"id":"56822028","text":"A Tatuus F4-T014 competing in the 2015 German F4 series. The Tatuus F4-T014 is an Italian built racing car introduced in 2014. The basic chassis is also used in the Tatuus MSV F4-016, Tatuus USF-17 and the Tatuus PM-18. The car is built by Tatuus an Italian racecar constructor building racing cars since 1980. ==F4-T014 and MSV F4-016== The Tatuus F4-T014 was the first racing car homologated according to the FIA Formula 4 rules. The car was first used in the 2014 Italian F4 Championship, won by Lance Stroll. As of 2015 the chassis is also used in the ADAC Formula 4 and the SMP F4 Championship. The Italian manufacturer also got competition with Mygale and Dome entering the FIA Formula 4 market in separate championships. In 2016 Tatuus expanded further supplying the proven chassis to the Spanish and UAE championships. All Tatuus Formula 4 chassis are powered by the Abarth 1.4L inline 4 engine. The BRDC Formula 4 Championship (not to be confused with the F4 British Championship) was launched by MotorSport Vision using the RFR MSV F4-013 chassis. Tatuus adapted the Tatuus F4-014 chassis to a more powerful Cosworth-Duratec engine. The car was first used in the 2015 BRDC Formula 4 Autumn Trophy won by Ben Barnicoat. The engine used has 70hp more than the Formula 4 spec version, making the car 10 seconds a lap quicker at most circuits. Besides the more powerful engine, the MSV version also has more aero adjustable components. ==USF2000 and Pro Mazda== Tatuus was announced as the sole chassis supplier for the USF2000 in October 2015. The Tatuus USF-17 replaced the ageing Van Diemen DP08, a tube chassis racecar in use since 2008. To cope with the added risk of racing on oval circuits the car was updated with zylon side intrusion panels. The car is powered by a 2.0L Mazda engine. The USF2000 chassis is also the base car for the Pro Mazda chassis. The Pro Mazda car features the most powerful engine of all F4 based cars, a 2.0L Mazda MZR-PM18A.

Williams grew up in Chicago's South Side and trained as an architect. Her work investigates color, race, and space in the city while blurring the conventional line between art and architecture. In addition, she has taught at the California College of the Arts in San Francisco, Sam Fox School at Washington University in St. Louis, Illinois Institute of Technology, and Cornell University and has lectured at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the New Museum. == Early life and education == Williams was born in Evanston, Illinois and grew up in the Auburn-Gresham neighborhood in the South Side of Chicago, attending the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools for high school. She received her Bachelor of Architecture from Cornell University in 1997, where she was a member of the Quill and Dagger society, and worked for a commercial architecture firm in San Francisco for six years before returning to Chicago to pursue art full-time. == Art == William's work deals with the intersection of race, urban space, and color and is heavily influenced by her background as an architect. While enrolled at Center Program in Chicago, Williams felt unsatisfied with paint on canvas, and was challenged by visiting critic Tricia van Eck to enlarge the scale of her work to match her architecture. === Color(ed) Theory === Her most famous project, Color(ed) Theory, which debuted at the Chicago Architecture Biennial in 2015, was met with critical acclaim for its confrontational look at race and space in the South Side of Chicago. Between 2014 and 2016, Williams repainted eight vacated and condemned houses in the Englewood neighborhood with the help of friends and family members. The artist chose eight colors she felt best represented black consumer culture specific to the South Side of Chicago, including Harold's Chicken Shack red, Newport 100's teal, Crown Royal Bag purple, Flamin’ Hot Cheetos orange, Ultrasheen conditioner blue, Pink Oil moisturizer, Currency Exchange yellow, and Safe Passage yellow. The bright colors converted the desolate, abandoned homes into sculptural objects, drawing attention to the issue of underinvestment in black communities and the corresponding decline of those neighborhoods. The project was displayed as a series of photographs. === Uppity Negress === Part of The Arts Club of Chicago Garden Projects, Uppity Negress is a site specific, exterior installation. Positioned in the intermediate space between public and private, the installation addresses accessibility and authority in urban space. The piece engages the existing fence with a secondary fence that breaks away and deconstructs itself from the original boundary. Through the process of de-familiarization, Williams begins to question the connotations that fences hold and their dual function as both containers and barriers, particularly, in relation to gender and race. Referencing the contemporary usage of the term \\"uppity negress\\", Williams creates a disorienting space with a deformed fence referencing black women's place in the city. === Chicago Works: First Solo Exhibition (MCA Chicago) === For her first solo-show, which ran in the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, from July 18 to December 31 in 2017, the artist presented work responding to changes in contemporary urban spaces. The show featured sculptures and photography that focused on the relationship between context and material value. Williams asked viewers to consider the social, political and racial narratives which contribute to the devaluation of a neighborhood. Although her work focused specifically on neighborhoods on Chicago's South Side, the ideas are applicable to nearly every modern urban landscape. Williams’ gold brick installations that were featured in the show examined the evolution of urban landscape and questioned the legitimacy of how we assess the value of architecture in declining neighborhoods. With the help of family members and friends, William's painstakingly painted imitation gold-leaf onto locally sourced bricks from the demolished remains of the Color(ed) Theory houses. In It’s a Gold mine/ Is the Gold Mine? a stack of bricks painted gold are displayed on an artist-made pallet. By using bricks from demolished buildings, Williams attaches commercial and conceptual value to salvaged material deemed useless in their previous contexts. Painting them gold and leaving them on display in art museums adds another level of prestige and merit to the objects’ worth, alluding to the historic significance of the \\"gold standard.\\" William plays with desire and access in She’s Mighty Mighty, Just Letting’ It All Hang Out, where a golden brick wall completely blocks off one of the gallery entrances.

The gold bricks were an extension of her project Color(ed) Theory, and highlight how demolition and renewal can shape the lives of urban populations, raising difficult questions about social and political undertones in Chicago. === Cadastral Shaking === For the inauguration of Lori Lightfoot's mayoral office in Chicago, the Smart Museum of Art loaned Cadastral Shaking (Chicago v1), part of a series of screen and relief prints that Williams journalist Natalie Y.

It has a circumglobal distribution in the seas around the lower latitudes of the Southern Oceans. ==Description== The Antarctic flying squid is a large species of oceanic pelagic squid which grows to a mantle length of greater than 52 cm in females and 40 cm in males. It has a long, narrow and muscular mantle, which has a width which is roughly a quarter of its length, tapering posteriorly to a pointed tail. The fins are arrowhead shaped and both their length and width are roughly equivalent to half that of the mantle. The basal suckers on the arms have around 10 teeth but there are no alternating small teeth. The fourth right arm has a hectocotylised distal portion which takes up one fifth to one third of the arm's length. This portion has the suckers transformed to papillae and tubercles, a ventral protective membrane and an expansive development of trabeculae. The robust and large tentacles have almost their entire length taken up by the tentacular clubs which have 12-14 transverse rows of suckers on the manus, the largest of which has 7-13 teeth on its ring and a diameter equal to 2.7-4.5% of the mantle length. The tentacle also has two pairs of carpal suckers. ==Distribution== The Antarctic flying squid has a circumglobal distribution in the Southern Ocean south of 35°S and it is common in the waters of the subtropical convergence zone. It has been found as far north as Peru but these are thought to have drifted north on the Humboldt Current. ==Habitat and biology== The Antarctic flying squid occurs over the continental slope and oceanic waters with depths between 0 and 1,200m. It has been caught from near to the bottom, through the water column to near the surface at night. This species is associated with faster currents and with a wide variation in temperature from cold Antarctic water 1t 3-3.6 °C to waters as warm as 24 °C. The spawning season occurs between December and August when mature males form a greater proportion of the population off southern New South Wales, this suggests that mating and spawning most likely takes place towards the northernmost limits of the species distribution in this area. Spermatophores are obvious in males which have attained a mantle length of 260 mm while those at 320 mm mantle length bear formed spermatophores. The smallest mature female recorded having eggs in the oviduct was measured with a mantle length of 380 mm. Studies in South African waters indicate a similarly extended spawning period running from February to August. In addition, data gathered on specimens sampled from stomachs of commercially whaled sperm whales off Durban suggest that Antarctic flying squid breed off the southeast African coast. Like most members of the Ommastrephidae growth is rapid and the life cycle is completed in one year, although little is known about the early life stages of this species, with the females growing faster than the males. Both this species and the Angolan flying squid grow faster in cooler ater than they do in warmer temperatures. This species preys on fishes, crustaceans and cephalopods. Smaller squids have crustaceans as the predominant element in their diet while larger squid, larger than 200mm mantle length, feed mainly on cephalopods. This species is also preyed upon by several fish species, sea birds and marine mammals, up to the size of sperm whales. The adult Antarctic flying squids may bear large parasite loads of encysted nematodes and cestodes in their mantle tissue. ==Fisheries== This species has been targeted by commercial fisheries in the Falkland Islands and the Tasman Sea and is currently taken as a bycatch in fisheries pursuing other species. Its abundance and muscular flesh suggest it could be a viable commercial species. ==References== Category:Squid Category:Molluscs described in 1975 Category:Fauna of the Southern Ocean ","title":"Antarctic flying squid"},{"id":"56822307","text":"Adolf Mathis (born 22 May 1938) is a Swiss alpine skier.

She gained her medical licence in 1906 from the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland graduating from the Apothecaries Hall. She was one of only six women to do this between 1885 and 1922. Her residency was with the Mater Hospital in Dublin. She gained a Diploma in Public Health in 1905. As one of the early women doctors Barry was an active and founding member of the Women's National Health Association which began in 1908. Through the association Barry became the medical officer for nine Babies Clubs in Dublin from 1912-1929. Barry was one of the founders of St Ultan's Infant Hospital which was first opened in 1919 in Dublin, and one of the benefactors and fundraisers for the hospital. She worked with the various government-established councils on public health and medical services in Ireland. While based in Cork Barry worked in Kilbrittain as the dispensary district medical officer until she was succeeded there by Dorothy Stopford Price. She was a supporter of the republican movement and was known to give shelter to republicans seeking shelter during the war of independence. On one occasion by pretending to be visiting a sick patient, Barry prevented one arrest of Micheal Collins and walked out of a house of British soldiers with his papers under her jumper. Later Barry began to focus on TB and was running sanatoria, one in Rossclare, Co. Fermanagh and then the Peamount Sanatorium in Newcastle, Co. Dublin, where she developed treatments and care routines for the children sent there. She was involved in the foundation of the Peamount Industries. ==Fellowship== Barry was a member of the RCPI from 1911 and was the first woman to be nominated for a fellowship in 1914. However her nomination was withdrawn when a ruling by the college restricted the award to men. This caused the college to review and then update the rules which then permitted women to become fellows but it took until 1930 for Barry to be elected. ==Death== Poor health caused Barry to resign from full-time work in 1946 but she continued to devote her time to St. Ultan's. She died on 2 July 1955 in Dublin and is buried in Glasnevin. ==References== Category:1880 births Category:1955 deaths Category:People from Cork (city) Category:Women physicians ","title":"Alice Mary Barry"},{"id":"56822456","text":"The Meteors are a British psychobilly band The Meteors may also refer to: * The Meteors (Dutch band) * Meteor Music Awards * The New Zealand band led by Max Merritt ","title":"The Meteors (disambiguation)"},{"id":"56822460","text":"Jorge Abelardo Eiras (born 7 August 1942) is an Argentine alpine skier.

Following the closure of Droxford station, on the Meon Valley Railway in Hampshire, both it and the track south to Wickham station were leased by SRC, who used the line to demonstrate the Pacerailer to potential buyers. A section of the line was rebuilt with a 1:10 incline to demonstrate the vehicle's abilities on steep gradients. There were problem with vandalism at the site, with the tracks intentionally blocked and points jammed in an effort to derail vehicles, and on 4 May 1970 the Pacerailer prototype was burned out and badly damaged. Ashby was in advanced negotiations to reopen the line between Cowes and Ryde on the Isle of Wight using Pacerailers.

It is used to create short music, lip-sync, dance, comedy and talent videos of 3 to 15 seconds, and short looping videos of 3 to 60 seconds. It is an international version of Douyin that was originally released in the Chinese market in September 2016. Later, TikTok was launched in 2017 for iOS and Android in most markets outside of mainland China; however, it only became available worldwide, including the United States, after merging with another Chinese social media service Musical.ly on 2 August 2018. TikTok and Douyin have almost the same user interface but no access to each other's content. Their servers are each based in the market where the respective app is available. The two products are similar, but features are not identical. Douyin includes an in-video search feature that can search by people's face for more videos of them and other features such as buying, booking hotels and making geo-tagged reviews. Since its launch in 2016, TikTok/Douyin rapidly gained popularity in East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, the United States, Turkey, Russia, and other parts of the world. As of October 2020, TikTok surpassed over 2 billion mobile downloads worldwide. Vanessa Pappas is the CEO of TikTok following the resignation of Kevin Mayer on 27 August, 2020. On 3 August 2020, US President Donald Trump threatened to ban TikTok in the United States on 15 September if negotiations for the company to be bought by Microsoft or a different \\"very American\\" company fail. On 6 August, Trump ByteDance signed two executive orders banning US \\"transactions\\" with TikTok and WeChat to its parent company, ByteDance, set to take effect 45 days after the signing. A planned ban of the app on 20 September 2020 has been postponed by a week. It has been banned by the government of India since June 2020 along with 223 other Chinese apps in response to a border clash with China. Pakistan banned TikTok citing 'immoral' and 'indecent' videos in October 2020. == History  Evolution === ByteDance Ltd., the Chinese company owning and operating TikTok Douyin was launched by ByteDance in Beijing, China in September 2016, originally under the name A.me, before rebranding to Douyin () in December 2016. ByteDance planned on Douyin expanding overseas. The founder of ByteDance, Zhang Yiming, stated that \\"China is home to only one-fifth of Internet users globally. If we don’t expand on a global scale, we are bound to lose to peers eyeing the four- fifths. So, going global is a must.\\" Douyin was developed in 200 days and within a year had 100 million users, with more than one billion videos viewed every day. TikTok was launched in the international market in September 2017. On 23 January 2018, the TikTok app ranked No. 1 among free app downloads on app stores in Thailand and other countries. TikTok has been downloaded more than 80 million times in the United States, and has reached 2 billion downloads worldwide, according to data from mobile research firm Sensor Tower that excludes Android users in China. In the United States, many celebrities including Jimmy Fallon and Tony Hawk began using the application in 2018; other celebrities such as Jennifer Lopez, Jessica Alba, Will Smith, and Justin Bieber joined TikTok as well and many other celebrities have followed. On 3 September 2019, TikTok and the US National Football League (NFL) announced a multi-year partnership. The agreement occurred just two days before the NFL's 100th season kick-off at the Soldier Field, where TikTok hosted activities for fans in honor of the deal. The partnership entails the launch of an official NFL TikTok account which is to bring about new marketing opportunities such as sponsored videos and hashtag challenges. In July 2020, TikTok, excluding Douyin, reported close to 800 million monthly active users worldwide after less than four years of existence. === Musical.ly merger === On 9 November 2017, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, spent up to US$1 billion to purchase musical.ly, a startup headquartered in Shanghai with an overseas office in Santa Monica, California, US. Musical.ly was a social media video platform that allowed users to create short lip-sync and comedy videos, initially released in August 2014. It was well known, especially to the younger audience. Looking forward to leveraging the US digital platform's young user base, TikTok merged with musical.ly on 2 August 2018 to create a larger video community, with existing accounts and data consolidated into one app, keeping the title TikTok. This ended musical.ly and made TikTok a worldwide app, excluding China, since China already has Douyin. === Expansion in other markets === As of 2018, TikTok has been made available in over 150 markets, and in 75 languages. TikTok was downloaded more than 104 million times on Apple's App store during the full first half of 2018, according to data provided to CNBC by Sensor Tower. After merging with musical.ly in August, downloads increased and TikTok became the most downloaded app in the US in October 2018, which musical.ly had done once before. In February 2019, TikTok, together with Douyin, hit one billion downloads globally, excluding Android installs in China. In 2019, media outlets cited TikTok as the 7th-most- downloaded mobile app of the decade, from 2010 to 2019. It was also the most- downloaded app on Apple's App Store in 2018 and 2019, surpassing Facebook, YouTube and Instagram. In September 2020, a deal was confirmed between ByteDance and Oracle in which the latter will serve as a partner to provide cloud hosting. Walmart intends to invest in TikTok. == Douyin (抖音) == As a separate app from TikTok, Douyin (), officially known as Dǒuyīn duǎn shìpín (抖音短视频; lit. Douyin Short Video), is primarily downloaded in China and has a slightly older audience than TikTok, as their user base ranges from children to middle-aged adults. The app uses two different types of verification, an influencer personal verification similar to that of TikTok and a business verification requiring a licence and yearly fee. Business verified users can promote to a specific audience, which allows them to choose where they want their video to be seen, such as a specific physical location. Douyin also has its store, in which users can tag and advertise their products, and users can request to work with an influencer for brand deals. Part of the app's popularity has been attributed to its marketing campaigns that launched several activities with Chinese celebrities to engage their fans' interest. == Features and trends == The TikTok mobile app allows users to create a short video of themselves which often feature music in the background, can be sped up, slowed down or edited with a filter. They can also add their own sound on top of the background music. To create a music video with the app, users can choose background music from a wide variety of music genres, edit with a filter and record a 15-second video with speed adjustments before uploading it to share with others on TikTok or other social platforms. They can also film short lip-sync videos to popular songs. The app's \\"react\\" feature allows users to film their reaction to a specific video, over which it is placed in a small window that is movable around the screen. Its \\"duet\\" feature allows users to film a video aside another video. The \\"duet\\" feature was another trademark of Musical.ly. Videos that users do not want to post yet can be stored in their \\"drafts\\". The user is allowed to see their \\"drafts\\" and post when they find it fitting. The app allows users to set their accounts as \\"private.\\" When first downloading the app, the user's account is public by default. The user can change to private in their settings. Private content remains visible to TikTok, but is blocked from TikTok users who the account holder has not authorized to view their content. Users can choose whether any other user, or only their \\"friends\\", may interact with them through the app via comments, messages, or \\"react\\" or \\"duet\\" videos. Users also can set specific videos to either \\"public\\", \\"friends only\\", or \\"private\\" regardless if the account is private or not. Users are also allowed to report accounts depending on the account's content either being spam or inappropriate. In TikTok's support center under \\"For Parents\\", they reassure the parents that inappropriate content for their children can be blocked and reported. The \\"For You\\" page on TikTok is a feed of videos that are recommended to users based on their activity on the app. Content is generated by TikTok's artificial intelligence (AI) depending on what kind of content a user liked, interacted with, or searched. Users can also choose to add to favorites or select \\"not interested\\" on videos in their for you page. TikTok combines the user's enjoyed content to provide videos that they would also enjoy. Users and their content can only be featured on the \\"for you\\" page if they are 16 or over as per TikTok policy. Users under 16 will not show up under the \\"for you\\" page, the sounds page, or under any hashtags. When users follow other users, a \\"following\\" page is located on the left of the \\"for you\\" page. This is a page to only see the videos from the accounts a user follows. Users can also add videos, hashtags, filters, and sounds to their \\"saved\\" section. When creating a video, they can refer to their saved section, or create a video straight from it. This section is visible only to the user on their profile allowing them to refer to any video, hashtag, filter, or sound they've previously saved. Users can also send their friends videos, emojis, and messages with direct messaging. TikTok has also included a feature to create a video based on the user's comments. Influencers often use the \\"live\\" feature. This feature is only available for those who have at least 1,000 followers and are over 16 years old. If over 18, the user's followers can send virtual \\"gifts\\" that can be later exchanged for money. One of the newest features as of 2020 is the \\"Virtual Items\\" of \\"Small Gestures\\" feature. This is based on China's big practice of social gifting. Since this feature was added, many beauty companies and brands created a TikTok account to participate and advertise this feature. With quarantine in the United States, social gifting has grown in popularity. According to a TikTok representative, the campaign was launched as a result of the lockdown, \\"to build a sense of support and encouragement with the TikTok community during these tough times.\\" TikTok announced a \\"family safety mode\\" in February 2020 for parents to be able to control their children's digital well-being. There is a screen time management option, restricted mode, and can put a limit on direct messages. === Artificial intelligence === TikTok employs artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze users' interests and preferences through their interactions with the content, and display a personalized content feed for each user. TikTok has an algorithm in which they process the user's preferences based on the videos they \\"like\\", comment on, and also how long they watch the video. Compared to conventional consumer algorithms such as those of YouTube and Netflix with a list of recommended videos, TikTok interprets the user's individual preferences and provides content that they would enjoy. === Viral trends === There are a variety of trends within TikTok, including memes, lip-synced songs, and comedy videos. Duets, a feature that allows users to add their own video to an existing video with the original content's audio, have sparked most of these trends. Trends are shown on TikTok's explore page or the page with the search logo. The page enlists the trending hashtags and challenges among the app. Some include #posechallenge, #filterswitch, #dontjudgemechallenge, #homedecor, #hitormiss, #bottlecapchallenge and more. In June 2019, the company introduced the hashtag #EduTok which received 37 billion views. Following this development, the company initiated partnerships with edtech startups to create educational content on the platform. The app has spawned numerous viral trends, Internet celebrities, and music trends around the world. Many stars got their start on musical.ly, which turned into the global platform known as TikTok on 2 August 2018. These users include Loren Gray, Baby Ariel, Kristen Hancher, Zach King, Lisa and Lena, Jacob Sartorius, and many others. Loren Gray remained the most- followed individual on TikTok until Charli D’Amelio surpassed her on 25 March 2020. Loren was the first TikTok account to reach 40 million followers on the platform. She was surpassed with 41.3 million followers. Charli was the first to ever reach 50, 60, and 70 million followers. Until now Charli D’Amelio remains the most-followed individual on the platform. Other creators rose to fame after the platform had merged with musical.ly on 2 August 2018 to release TikTok worldwide. Influencers such as Charli D’Amelio are an example. She rose to fame after duetting another TikTok user that went viral. She is also well known for performing a dance called \\"The Renegade\\", to the song \\"Lottery\\" by K CAMP. Other top TikTok influencers include her sister, Dixie D’Amelio, Addison Rae, Avani Gregg, Chase Hudson, Michael Le, Josh Richards, and many more. Charli D’Amelio was once part of the Hype House, a TikTok collaborative content house based in Los Angeles with a group of other TikTok stars, but left months later. The Hype House was founded by Daisy Keech, Chase Hudson, Alex Warren, Kouvr Annon, and Thomas Petrou in 2019. Charli D’Amelio and her sister Dixie D'Amelio reportedly left the Hype House, along with Daisy Keech and Addison Rae. Current members of the Hype House are Chase Hudson, Connor Yates, Alex Warren, Avani Gregg, Wyatt Xavier, Ryland Storms, Nick Austin, Ondreaz Lopez, Tony Lopez, Kouvr Annon, Thomas Petrou, Calvin Goldby, James Wright, Jack Wright and Patrick Huston. Aside from \\"The Renegade\\" that had over 29.7 million videos, a notable TikTok trend is the \\"hit or miss\\", from a snippet of iLOVEFRiDAY's \\"Mia Khalifa\\" (2018), which has been used in over four million TikTok videos. This song helped introduce the app to a larger Western audience. Other songs that have gained popularity because of their success on the app include \\"Roxanne\\" by Arizona Zervas, \\"Lalala\\" by bbno$, \\"Stupid\\" by Ashnikko, \\"Yellow Hearts\\" by Ant Saunders, \\"Say So\\" and \\"Like That\\" by Doja Cat, \\"Truth Hurts\\" by Lizzo, \\"Savage\\" and \\"Captain Hook\\" by Megan Thee Stallion, \\"Play Date\\" by Melanie Martinez, \\"Tap In\\" by Saweetie, and \\"Rockstar\\" by DaBaby and Roddy Rich. TikTok also played a major part in making \\"Old Town Road\\" by Lil Nas X become one of the biggest songs of 2019, and the longest running number-one song in the history of the Billboard Hot 100. TikTok has allowed bands to get notoriety in places all around the globe. The band Fitz and The Tantrums has developed a large following in South Korea despite never having toured in Asia. \\"Any Song\\" by R&B; and rap artist Zico became number 1 on the Korean music charts due to the popularity of the #anysongchallenge, where users dance the choreography of \\"Any Song\\". The song was on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for 17 weeks, breaking the record for the longest time a song was number 1 on the charts. After his song \\"Old Town Road\\" went viral on the app, Lil Nas X received a record deal and the song rose to the top of the Billboard charts. The platform has received some criticism for its lack of royalties towards artists whose music is used on their platform. There is controversy over whether this type of promotion is beneficial in the long run for artists since it seems to play as a \\"one-hit wonder\\". In June 2020, TikTok users and K-pop fans \\"claimed to have registered potentially hundreds of thousands of tickets\\" for President Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa through communication on TikTok, contributing to \\"rows of empty seats\\" at the event. TikTok has banned holocaust denial, but other conspiracy theories have become popular on the platform, such as Pizzagate and QAnon (two conspiracy theories popular among the US alt-right) whose hashtags reached almost 80 million views and 50 million views respectively by June 2020. The platform has also been used to spread misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic, such as clips from the Plandemic video. TikTok removed some of these videos, and has generally added links to accurate COVID-19 information on videos with tags related to the pandemic. ==User characteristics and behavior Users === In the three years after it launched in September 2016, TikTok acquired 800 million active users. Its users include Zach King, Loren Gray, Baby Ariel, Lisa and Lena, Will Smith, Dwayne Johnson, Brent Rivera, Addison Rae, Jason Derulo, Jennifer Lopez, Camila Cabello, Lilly Singh, Selena Gomez, Millie Bobby Brown, Noah Schnapp and Charli D'Amelio, the most-followed individual on the platform.  Demographics  In the United States, 52% of TikTok users are iPhone users. While TikTok has a neutral gender-bias format, 44% of TikTok users are female while 56% are male. TikTok's geographical use has shown that 43% of new users are from India. TikTok has proven to attract the younger generation, as 41% of its users are between the ages of 16 and 24. Among these TikTok users, 90% say they use the app daily. As of July 2020, there were over 90 million monthly active users in the United States alone, according to TikTok. == Country bans and attempted bans == TikTok was banned completely in India by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology on 29 June 2020, along with 223 other Chinese apps, with a statement saying they were \\"prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order\\". On 6 August 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order which would ban TikTok in 45 days if it is not sold by ByteDance; Trump also signed a similar order against the WeChat application owned by the Chinese multinational company Tencent. On 14 August 2020, Trump issued a new executive order giving ByteDance 90 days to sell or spin off its U.S. TikTok business. In the order, Trump said that there is \\"credible evidence\\" that leads him to believe that ByteDance \\"might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.\\" On 23 September 2020, TikTok filed a request for a preliminary injunction to prevent the app from being banned by the Trump administration. The preliminary injunction was approved by justice Carl J. Nichols on 27 September 2020. TikTok has been intermittently blocked in countries including Indonesia and Bangladesh on different bases. On 9 October 2020, Pakistan blocked TikTok for failing to filter out “immoral and indecent” content. == Controversies == The app === Addiction concerns === Some users may find it hard to stop using TikTok. In April 2018, an addiction-reduction feature was added to Douyin. This encouraged users to take a break every 90 minutes. Later in 2018, the feature was rolled out to the TikTok app. TikTok uses some top influencers such as Gabe Erwin, Alan Chikin Chow, James Henry, and Cosette Rinab to encourage viewers to stop using the app and take a break. Many were also concerned with users' attention spans with these videos. Users watch short 15-second clips repeatedly and studies say that this could report to a decrease in attention span. This is a concern as many of TikTok's audience are younger children, whose brains are still developing. === Content concerns === Many countries showed concerns regarding the content of TikTok which is thought to be obscene, immoral, vulgar and encouraging of pornography. There have been temporary blocks and warnings issued by countries including Indonesia, Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan over the content concerns. In 2018, Douyin was reprimanded by Chinese media watchdogs for showing \\"unacceptable\\" content, such as videos depicting adolescent pregnancies. On 27 July 2020, Egypt sentenced five women to two years in prison over TikTok videos on charges of violating public morals. The court also imposed a fine of 300,000 Egyptian pounds (E£14,600) on each defendant.  Misinformation  In January 2020, Media Matters for America said that TikTok hosted misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic despite a recent policy against misinformation. In April 2020, the government of India asked TikTok to remove users posting misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic. There were also multiple conspiracy theories that the government is involved with the spread of the pandemic. As a response to this, TikTok launched a feature to report content for misinformation.  Content censorship and moderation by the platform  In January 2019, the Chinese government said that it would start to hold app developers like ByteDance responsible for user content shared via apps such as Douyin, and listed 100 types of content that the Chinese government would censor. It was reported that certain content unfavorable to the Chinese Communist Party has already been limited for users outside of China such as content related to the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests or Tibetan independence. TikTok has blocked videos about human rights in China, particularly those that reference Xinjiang re-education camps and abuses of ethnic and religious minorities such as the Uyghurs, and disabled the accounts of users who post them. TikTok's policies also ban content related to a specific list of foreign leaders such as Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump, Barack Obama, and Mahatma Gandhi because it can stir controversy and attacks on political views. Its policies also ban content critical of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and content considered pro-Kurdish. TikTok was reported to have censored users supportive of the Citizenship Amendment Act protests in India and those who promote Hindu-Muslim unity. On 27 November 2019, TikTok temporarily suspended the account of 17-year-old Afghan-American user Feroza Aziz after she posted a video, disguised as a makeup tutorial, drawing attention to the internment camps of Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang, China. TikTok later apologized and said that her account was suspended as a result of human error, and her account has since been reinstated. In July 2020, TikTok suspended the account of another user whose viral video called attention to human rights of the Uyghurs. In October 2019, TikTok removed about two dozen accounts that were responsible for posting ISIS propaganda on the app. In countries where LGBT discrimination is the socio-political norm, TikTok moderators have blocked content that could be perceived as being positive towards LGBT people or LGBT rights, including same-sex couples holding hands, including in countries where homosexuality has never been illegal. Former U.S. employees of TikTok reported to The Washington Post that final decisions to remove content were made by parent company employees in Beijing. In response to censorship concerns, TikTok's parent company hired K&L; Gates, including former U.S. Congressmen Bart Gordon and Jeff Denham, to advise it on its content moderation policies. TikTok also hired lobbying firm Monument Advocacy. In March 2020, internal documents leaked to The Intercept revealed that moderators had been instructed to suppress posts created by users deemed \\"too ugly, poor, or disabled\\" for the platform, and to censor political speech in livestreams, punishing those who harmed \\"national honor\\" or broadcast streams about \\"state organs such as police\\" with bans from the platform. In June 2020, The Wall Street Journal reported that some previously non-political TikTok users were airing pro-Beijing views for the explicit purpose of boosting subscribers and avoiding \\"shadow\\" bans. In July 2020, the company announced it was pulling out of Hong Kong responding to the Hong Kong national security law. In June 2020, The Times of India reported that TikTok was \\"shadow banning\\" videos related to the Sino-Indian border dispute and the 2020 China–India skirmishes. === User privacy concerns === Privacy concerns have also been brought up regarding the app. In its privacy policy, TikTok lists that it collects usage information, IP addresses, a user's mobile carrier, unique device identifiers, keystroke patterns, and location data, among other data. Web developers Talal Haj Bakry and Tommy Mysk said that allowing videos and other content being shared by the app's users through HTTP puts the users' data privacy at risk. In January 2020, Check Point Research discovered a security flaw in TikTok which could have allowed hackers access to user accounts using SMS. In February, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman criticised the app, calling it \\"spyware,\\" and stating \\"I look at that app as so fundamentally parasitic, that it's always listening, the fingerprinting technology they use is truly terrifying, and I could not bring myself to install an app like that on my phone.\\" Responding to Huffman's comments, TikTok stated \\"These are baseless accusations made without a shred of evidence.\\" Wells Fargo banned the app from its devices due to privacy and security concerns. In May 2020, the Dutch Data Protection Authority announced an investigation into TikTok in relation to privacy protections for children. In June 2020, the European Data Protection Board announced that it would assemble a task force to examine TikTok's user privacy and security practices. In August 2020, The Wall Street Journal reported that TikTok tracked Android user data, including MAC addresses and IMEIs, with a tactic in violation of Google's policies. The report sparked calls in the U.S. Senate for the Federal Trade Commission to launch an investigation.  US COPPA fines  On 27 February 2019, the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) fined ByteDance US$5.7 million for collecting information from minors under the age of 13 in violation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. ByteDance responded by adding a kids-only mode to TikTok which blocks the upload of videos, the building of user profiles, direct messaging, and commenting on others' videos, while still allowing the viewing and recording of content. In May 2020, an advocacy group filed a complaint with the FTC saying that TikTok had violated the terms of the February 2019 consent decree, which sparked subsequent Congressional calls for a renewed FTC investigation. In July 2020, it was reported that the FTC and the United States Department of Justice had initiated investigations.  UK Information Commissioner's Office investigation  In February 2019, the United Kingdom's Information Commissioner's Office launched an investigation of TikTok following the fine ByteDance received from the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Speaking to a parliamentary committee, Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said that the investigation focuses on the issues of private data collection, the kind of videos collected and shared by children online, as well as the platform's open messaging system which allows any adult to message any child. She noted that the company was potentially violating the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which requires the company to provide different services and different protections for children. === Cyberbullying === As with other platforms, journalists in several countries have raised privacy concerns about the app, because it is popular with children and has the potential to be used by sexual predators. Several users have reported endemic cyberbullying on TikTok, including racism and ableism. In December 2019, following a report by German digital rights group Netzpolitik.org, TikTok admitted that it had suppressed videos by disabled users as well as LGBTQ+ users in a purported effort to limit cyberbullying. TikTok's moderators were also told to suppress users with \\"abnormal body shape\\", \\"ugly facial looks\\", \\"too many wrinkles\\", or in \\"slums, rural fields\\" and \\"dilapidated housing\\" to prevent bullying. == Legal issues Tencent lawsuits=== Tencent's WeChat platform has been accused of blocking Douyin's videos. In April 2018, Douyin sued Tencent and accused it of spreading false and damaging information on its WeChat platform, demanding CN¥1 million in compensation and an apology. In June 2018, Tencent filed a lawsuit against Toutiao and Douyin in a Beijing court, alleging they had repeatedly defamed Tencent with negative news and damaged its reputation, seeking a nominal sum of CN¥1 in compensation and a public apology. In response, Toutiao filed a complaint the following day against Tencent for allegedly unfair competition and asking for CN¥90 million in economic losses. === Data transfer class action lawsuit === In November 2019, a class action lawsuit was filed in California that alleged that TikTok transferred personally identifiable information of U.S. persons to servers located in China owned by Tencent and Alibaba. The lawsuit also accused ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, of taking user content without their permission. The plaintiff of the lawsuit, college student Misty Hong, downloaded the app but said she never created an account. She realized a few months later that TikTok has created an account for her using her information (such as biometric) and made a summary of her information. The lawsuit also alleged that information was sent to Chinese tech giant Baidu. In July 2020, twenty lawsuits against TikTok were merged into a single class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. ==See also== * Likee * List of most-liked TikTok videos * List of most-followed TikTok accounts * Timeline of social media * Triller * Byte ==References *Official website *ByteDance official website *Douyin Category:2010s fads and trends Category:2016 software Category:2020s fads and trends Category:Adware Category:Android (operating system) software Category:ByteDance Category:Chinese brands Category:Freeware Category:Internet culture Category:Internet properties established in 2016 Category:IOS software Category:Mobile applications Category:Music software Category:Social networking services Category:Video hosting Category:Video software Category:Youth culture Category:Delisted applications ","title":"TikTok"},{"id":"56822865","text":"Ellis Foote (16 Nov 1911 - 8 Sep 1991) was an American poet. Largely self- educated, the vibrant, experimental work he published in the 1940s, largely unknown today, endeared him to such Western literary figures as Vardis Fisher and Alan Swallow, and may have influenced writers of the Beat Generation. ==Life== Foote was born near Quitchumpah Creek in Emery County, Utah. He attended school only through the ninth grade, and was largely self-educated, taking classes at Brigham Young University and other extension programs.\\"Ellis Foote, City Manager, Arizona Range News, May 8, 2013 p.15 http://azr.stparchive.com/Archive/AZR/AZR05082013p15.php A member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, he spent his missionary period in Council Bluffs, Iowa, and Leadville, Colorado.Liahona: The Elder's Journal 34 (1936) p.215 He married Norma Schreiner on May 20, 1937 in the Salt Lake LDS Temple.Obituary: Norma Foote http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/saltlaketribune/obituary.aspx?n=norma- schreiner-foote&pid;=2377982 They would have five children.\\"Ellis Foote, City Manager, Arizona Range News, May 8, 2013 p.15 http://azr.stparchive.com/Archive/AZR/AZR05082013p15.php In the early 1940s, through the writing programs organized by the poet Brewster Ghiselin at the University of Utah, Foote was introduced to a Western literary community. His associates included Ghiselin,Brewster Ghiselin papers https://rbsc.princeton.edu/collections/brewster-ghiselin-papers the novelist Vardis Fisher,Ellis Foote, \\"The Unholy Testator,\\" American Book Collector, September 1963 the critic George Snell,George Snell papers, 1928-1984 http://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv33312/pdf and the poet Francis Goffling.Carpe Librum Books, \\"Francis Golffing Papers,\\" Catalogue 7: Manuscripts & Archives, Literary & Historical (Spring 2018) He spent his final years in Boulder, Colorado. Foote published his works in a number of literary journals, including American Book Collector, New Mexico Quarterly, Prairie Schooner, and Neurotica. His first book was the first—and evidently the only—volume published by the Rocky Mountain Review.Alan Swallow, \\"Publishing in the Rocky Mountains,\\" The News Bulletin of the Rocky Mountain Modern Language Association Vol. 2, No. 3 (Nov., 1949), pp. 1-3 Foote's second major book was published by Alan Swallow. Foote withdrew from publishing in the early 1950s, focusing on a career in municipal administration. During his professional life, he served as city manager for several Western settlements, including Moab, Utah, which he noted was \\"in the heart of the Colorado Plateau country where all the uranium is being discovered.\\"Ellis Foote in Folio, 20/1 (Winter 1954), p.41 He was the first town manager of Hayden, Arizona,Ellis Foote, \\"Hayden, Arizona,\\" Western City, vol. 34-35 (1959), p. 22 and served in similar capacity in Needles, California, and Willcox, Arizona.\\"Ellis Foote, City Manager, Arizona Range News, May 8, 2013 p.15 http://azr.stparchive.com/Archive/AZR/AZR05082013p15.php During his period of withdrawal from the literary world, Foote continued to write for himself and a close circle of friends. He began to issue collections of his work once more in the 1970s. These later works were self-published in very limited quantity for private distribution.Ellis Foote, \\"Introduction\\" in Earth turning to morning: selected poems (Boulder, Colo.: Ellis Foote, 1990). ==Critical reception== In a review, the publisher Alan Swallow noted that Foote's first book \\"is composed of experiments in a good many styles by a poet who obviously has not yet found his best method. The work is a good bit better than merely encouraging however.... Foote indicates that he is a poet to be reckoned with.\\" Alan Swallow, A Review of Some Recent Poetry, New Mexico Quarterly 13, 2 (1943), p.217 Rather more sardonically, critic Tom Trusky called Foote \\"the first interesting and experimental poet from Zion.\\" Tom Trusky, \\"Western Poetry, 1850-1950\\" in A Literary History of the American West by the Western Literature Association (Texas Christian University, 1987), p.196 Vardis Fisher thought enough of Foote's work to use a poem by him as the epigraph for his book, Thomas Wolfe As I Knew Him and Other Essays (1963).Vardis Fisher, Thomas Wolfe as I Knew Him and Other Essays (Denver: Alan Swallow, 1963), p. 4 A review of Foote's Layman’s Fall in Poetry rhapsodized: “Mr Foote’s long symbolic poem is a remarkable achievement, showing great boldness of design as well as finesse of craftsmanship. … Throughout the composition we find a dazzling display of verbal and metaphysical wit and, what is more, a Mozartian lightness of touch, almost unknown in English literature outside of Joyce and Sterne.”Francis C. Golffing, \\"Two Longer Poems,\\" Poetry 73/5 (February 1949), p. 294 The literary historian R. J. Ellis suggests that an experimental poem Foote published in the first issue of Neurotica, a journal edited by Jay Landesman and treasured by literary bohemians, likely inspired writers of the Beat generation: \\"Ellis Foote's wild neologisitic experiments in \\"Hall Whalemocked the Damned\\" may (almost as much as Joyce's Finnegans Wake) have influenced Kerouac, whilst Foote's long-line forms may have been noticed by Ginsberg.\\"R.

It is native to eastern and southern Australia, the Norfolk Ridge and the Kermadec Islands of New Zealand. ==Description== The starfish has plates on its aboral (upper) surface arranged in a reticulate fashion with brightly coloured tubercles scattered between them. There are only a few inconspicuous marginal plates but the superomarginal plate at the end of each arm is very large. The tube feet are tipped with suckers and do not have any spicules. The tubercles vary in size and colour, making a red, purple and orange pattern on the aboral surface. There is a pair of very large tubercles at the tip of each arm. ==Distribution and habitat== Endemic to Australia, A. truncatus occurs on the south and east coasts, on the western end of the Norfolk Ridge and the Kermadec Islands. In southern Australia it is a deep water species found in rocky habitats at , but in New South Wales it occurs on shallow rocky reefs in the subtidal zone. ==Ecology== A. truncatus feeds by grazing on sponges and other colourful benthic organisms at the base of the kelp forest, amongst which its bright colours are inconspicuous. A commensal shrimp can sometimes be found living among the tubercles. It has been observed releasing gametes into the water column by standing on the tips of its arms to raise its body off the sea floor. However, little is known of the biology of this starfish. ==References== Category:Echinometridae Category:Animals described in 1911 Category:Fauna of the Pacific Ocean ","title":"Asterodiscides truncatus"},{"id":"56822997","text":"The Canadian Screen Award for Best Actress in Comedy Series is an annual Canadian television award, presented by the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television to the best leading performance by an actress in a Canadian television comedy series.

He studied at Jefferson College in Canonsburg. == Career == At the onset of the American Civil War, he left college and enlisted with the 12th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry. He earned multiple promotions. He was promoted to first lieutenant on 11 October 1861, captain on 20 May 1862, and lieutenant-colonel on 7 December 1864. Finally, on 2 April 1865, he was brevetted colonel for gallant and distinguished service during the Union Army's assault on Fort Gregg, Virginia. After the war, he entered the United States Army, and on 28 July 1866, he was appointed Captain in the 18th United States Infantry. During the Centennial Campaign of 1876, he served on the staff of his brother-in-law, Major General Alfred Terry, where he authored a critique of George Armstrong Custer's actions leading to the Battle of the Little Bighorn. On 19 February 1885 he was promoted to major and made inspector-general of the Third Infantry Division. While serving with that division, he was promoted to lieutenant- colonel on 11 March 1885 and to colonel on 31 August 1888. During the Spanish–American War, he was sent to the Philippine Islands with the Philippine Expeditionary Force, serving on the staff of Major-General Elwell Stephen Otis. He received several appointments there: brigadier-general of volunteers on 3 June 1898, chief of staff of the 8th Corps on 23 June 1898, and Provost Marshal General of the city of Manila and its suburbs on 3 September 1898. While in the post, Otis gave him official praise for his handling of the great fire in Manila. Hughes's tact and vigilance saved the capital from complete destruction. On 25 May 1900, he was appointed a member of the commission to treat with the insurrectionist forces in the Philippine Islands. On 25 May 1900, he was made commander of the Visayan Military District, and on 25 February 1901, he was elevated to brigadier-general in the United States Army. After his return from the Philippines, he commanded the Army's Department of California. He was promoted to major-general on 1 April 1902, and reached the mandatory age of retirement on 11 April 1903. == References  External links == * * * Category:1839 births Category:1909 deaths Category:American military personnel of the Philippine–American War Category:American military personnel of the Spanish–American War Category:Military personnel from Pennsylvania Category:People of the Great Sioux War of 1876 Category:Union Army officers Category:United States Army generals ","title":"Robert Patterson Hughes"},{"id":"56823057","text":"The following list contains the upraisings in Hungary, the Kingdom of Hungary and the Principality of Transylvania in timely order. *1046 – Vata pagan uprising *1061 – Second pagan uprising in Hungary *1437 – Transylvanian peasant revolt led by Antal Nagy de Buda *1492–93 – Revolt of the Black Army of Hungary *1514 – Peasant revolt led by György Dózsa *1526 – 1527 – Revolt led by Jovan Nenad *1572 – Croatian–Slovene Peasant Revolt *1562, 1575, 1595–96 – Szekler uprisings *1604 – Stephen Bocskai's revolt *1631 – 1632 – Revolt led by Peter Császár *1672 - First kuruc uprising *1678 – Emeric Thököly's uprising *1697 – Kuruc uprising in 1697 *1703 – Rákóczi's War of Independence *1735 – 1736 – Uprising of Pera Segedinac *1784 – Revolt of Horea, Cloșca and Crișan *1831 – Cholera uprising in Hungary *1848 – Hungarian Revolution of 1848 *1918 – Aster Revolution *1921 – Uprising in West Hungary *1956 – Hungarian Revolution of 1956 Category:Hungary-related lists ","title":"List of uprisings in Hungary"},{"id":"56823067","text":"The 1959 Drexel Dragons football team represented the Drexel Institute of Technology (renamed Drexel University in 1970) as a member of the Middle Atlantic Conference during the 1959 NCAA College Division football season.

All 35 seats in the Parliament were up for election. The election was held simultaneously with regional elections in eleven other autonomous communities and local elections all throughout Spain, as well as the 2019 European Parliament election. ==OverviewElectoral system=== The Parliament of Cantabria was the devolved, unicameral legislature of the autonomous community of Cantabria, having legislative power in regional matters as defined by the Spanish Constitution and the Cantabrian Statute of Autonomy, as well as the ability to vote confidence in or withdraw it from a regional president. Voting for the Parliament was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over eighteen, registered in Cantabria and in full enjoyment of their political rights. Additionally, Cantabrians abroad were required to apply for voting before being permitted to vote, a system known as \\"begged\\" or expat vote (). The 35 members of the Parliament of Cantabria were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of five percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied regionally. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution. ===Election date=== The term of the Parliament of Cantabria expired four years after the date of its previous election. Elections to the Parliament were fixed for the fourth Sunday of May every four years. The previous election was held on 24 May 2015, setting the election date for the Parliament on Sunday, 26 May 2019. The president had the prerogative to dissolve the Parliament of Cantabria and call a snap election, provided that no motion of no confidence was in process, no nationwide election was due and some time requirements were met: namely, that dissolution did not occur either during the first legislative session or within the legislature's last year ahead of its scheduled expiry, nor before one year had elapsed since a previous dissolution. In the event of an investiture process failing to elect a regional president within a two-month period from the first ballot, the Parliament was to be automatically dissolved and a fresh election called. Any snap election held as a result of these circumstances would not alter the period to the next ordinary election, with elected deputies merely serving out what remained of their four-year terms. ==Parliamentary status== The Parliament of Cantabria was officially dissolved on 2 April 2019, after the publication of the dissolution decree in the Official Gazette of Cantabria. The table below shows the status of the different parliamentary groups in the Parliament at the time of dissolution. {  style=\\"font-size:95%; text-align:center;\\" + Parliamentary composition in April 2019 - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" colspan=\\"2\\" width=\\"100\\" Groups ! rowspan=\\"2\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Parties ! colspan=\\"2\\" Legislators - !

Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of at least one percent of the electorate in Cantabria, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates.

She went to high school in Lynn, Massachusetts. She graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in wildlife management and conservation in 1946. Initially, Losey could not find work because she was a woman. She worked as a research assistant for the University of Michigan until 1952.

Her assignment was to understand the importance of beavers in waterfowl management. Losey was the first woman research biologist in the country. She quit when she was told she was being transferred West, as by that time \\"romance had crept in\\". She was only employed by the agency for three years, but built up a successful career as an ornithologist. Rachel Carson recognized Losey's preparations for a manuscript on trumpeter swans as \\"an excellent job of organizing the material for an effective story\\". In 1964 she published her observation of duck broods at the Seney National Wildlife Refuge. Losey travelled America and Canada taking photographs of fur trading posts and collecting Native American art, which was later donated to the DeVos Art Museum in Michigan. Losey wrote two books. Let Them Be Remembered: The Story of the Fur Trade Forts, the story of the Hudson's Bay Company and the 1600 fur trade, was published in 1999. Her second, Seney National Wildlife Refuge: its story, was published in 2003. She remained a volunteer at Seney National Wildlife Refuge until her death in 2005. She wrote her final peer-reviewed paper at the age of 92 on the history of the Sharp-tailed Grouse, which was published after her death. She was a lifetime sponsor of Delta Waterfowl Foundation. She is regarded as a pioneer in gender equality within fieldwork. == References == Category:1912 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Women conservationists Category:American conservationists Category:American women biologists Category:People from East Orange, New Jersey Category:Scientists from New Jersey Category:University of Michigan alumni ","title":"Elizabeth Losey"},{"id":"56823267","text":"Robert Adrian Băjan (born 30 October 1995) is a Romanian professional footballer who plays as a right back for Liga II side Farul Constanța.

In the early 2010s, some controversies arose over the organization's management of the team:Nueva polémica en el equipo femenino de Osasuna (New controversy in Osasuna's women's team); Vavel in March 2011, eleven players left the team accusing the executives of sexism, lack of interest and poor training conditions,Nueve jugadoras dejan el equipo femenino de Osasuna (Nine players leave Osasuna's women's team); Diario de Navarra, 25 March 2011 and in May of the following year, outgoing chairman Patxi Izco declared women's football as \\"unsightly\\" and \\"unsuitable for women\\".\\"El fútbol femenino es antiestético\\" (\\"Women's football is unsightly\\"); Marca (newspaper), 28 May 2012 The team was disbanded in June 2014 in the midst of financial turmoil, weeks after the male team's relegation to the Segunda División;Desaparece el Osasuna femenino. Diario de Navarra, 6 June 2014 rising star player Maite Oroz moved to Athletic Bilbao Femenino on a free transfer. However, within weeks an agreement was secured with fledgling club , based in nearby Mutilva Baja (Aranguren), to collaborate on the formation of a senior team in the Navarre Regional League (third tier) for the following season, with this squad playing at Osasuna's Tajonar Facilities and Mulier operating its own club structure and youth teams. The Mulier-Osasuna team won promotion at the first attempt, winning 26 of their 28 matches. Struggling at the bottom of the table in the subsequent Segunda División campaign, the two clubs thereafter parted ways, with Mulier reprieved to remain in the second tier and Osasuna's team re-launching independently in the level below as the figureheads of a new foundation involving several other local clubs (including SD Lagunak, who for much of the decade prior were one of the elite clubs of Spanish women's football). Mulier, who declined to join the Osasuna group as it would have resulted in their relegation, performed better without the assistance of their professional neighbours, finishing runners-up in the Segunda División group (they later agreed a new partnership with Athletic Bilbao in 2019), while the separate Osasuna Femenino team dominated the Navarre regional league (80 points from a possible 84) and were promoted to join their former partners, along with the women's sections of the Basque clubs Eibar and Alavés. The first home fixture of 2017–18 was played at El Sadar Stadium, home to the Osasuna men's team, marking the first occasion that the venue hosted a women's match in its 50-year history. Osasuna was also permitted to add a B team in the Navarre regional league for 2017–18,Osasuna creará otro equipo femenino en regional, si el primero consigue el ascenso a la segunda división [Osasuna will create another women's team in regional, if the first gets promotion to the second division], Navarra.com (in Spanish), 1 February 2017 as they had previously in the 2011–12 and 2012–13 seasons. At the same time as the first team were promoted to the new Segunda Pro level in 2019, the B team also moved up to the third tier, now called Primera Nacional. From 2018 until 2020, the telecommunications firm Euskaltel will be the main sponsor of the Osasuna Femenino team. ==Season to season== { valign=\\"top\\" width=0% {  - f0f6fa;\\" !Season !Division !Place !Copa de la Reina - BF8D5B;\\"2003–04 BF8D5B;\\"Prov.

He featured in the youth ranks of Brampton Youth SC and North Mississauga SC before moving to England to join Fulham Academy aged 13. After three years with Fulham, he joined the Liverpool Academy in 2016. ==Early life== Millar was born in Toronto and raised in Brampton and Oakville. He moved to England at the age of 13 for footballing purposes. His father played for Charlton Athletic and is an electrician who works on television series, including Game of Thrones. ==Club career Early career === Millar began his career with Brampton Youth SC at the age of four. After two years he joined North Mississauga SC and remained at the club until his move to England. He joined Fulham at the age of 13 but felt he struggled to adapt to English football. On moving to England, Millar said \\"It took me a while to adjust to how English football is, it probably took me a good two-and-a-half years.\\" === Liverpool === In July 2016, he joined Premier League club Liverpool on a free transfer with striking options limited in the Academy. Millar scored four minutes into his Liverpool U18s career and marked his debut in the U18 Premier League with a hat-trick in a 4–0 victory against Blackburn Rovers U18s in August 2016. A month later, he signed a professional contract on his 17th birthday. Injury ruled Millar out for three months of his inaugural season but a return in January saw him finish the season with six goals in 17 appearances in the U18 Premier League. He featured in every game of Liverpool's 2017–18 UEFA Youth League campaign and scored twice in eight games. After 18 months under the guidance of Steven Gerrard in the Under-18s, Millar received his first call-up to the Under-23 squad in January 2018. Loans to Kilmarnock On January 31, 2019, Millar signed a long-term first-team contract with Liverpool and joined Scottish Premiership side Kilmarnock on loan until the end of the 2018–19 season. He made his debut on February 1 in a 2–1 loss to Heart of Midlothian. He scored his first goal on March 11 against St Mirren. He returned on loan to Kilmarnock in August 2019. This loan period was cut short in January 2020 when he returned to his parent club.  Return to Liverpool  He made his senior Liverpool debut on February 4, 2020 starting in the FA Cup fourth-round replay against Shrewsbury Town. In mid-2020 Liverpool turned down multiple transfer offers for Millar, who received loan interest from clubs in the Championship and Bundesliga. == International career Youth=== Millar was first involved in the international set-up at the age of 14 in the squad for the Tournoi Montaigu. After being invited to an U20 camp in Costa Rica in 2016, he made his debut in the CONCACAF Under-20 Championship in February 2017. He made three appearances as Canada finished third in Group A and failed to progress to the classification stage. In May 2018, Millar was named to Canada's under-21 squad for the 2018 Toulon Tournament. Millar was named to the Canadian U-23 provisional roster for the 2020 CONCACAF Men's Olympic Qualifying Championship on February 26, 2020. ===Senior=== In March 2018, Millar was named in John Herdman's first squad as national team manager. In that same camp, Millar made his senior debut and first start for Canada during a 1–0 win over New Zealand, impressing while doing so. In May 2019, Millar was named to the 23-man squad for the 2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup. == Playing style == Millar's preferred position is as a number nine, but he has been utilised in various roles with Liverpool due to his flexibility. He has been noted for his ability on the left flank. In August 2016, manager Neil Critchley said: \\"He's a goalscorer. He can run down the side of defenders, he runs in behind, he gives them real problems with his movement and he's a good finisher off both feet. He's got a good brain, good awareness, very calm and can finish. He's a good player, a good all-round player.\\" ==Career statisticsClub=== { class= style=\\"text- align: center;\\" + Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"Domestic cup !colspan=\\"2\\"League cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"4\\"Liverpool 2018–19 Premier League 0000000000 - 2019–20 Premier League 0010000010 - 2020–21 Premier League 0000000000 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !0!!0!!1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!1!!0 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Kilmarnock (loan) 2018–19 Scottish Premiership 131100000141 - 2019–20 Scottish Premiership 201002000221 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !33!!2!!1!!0!!2!!0!!0!!0!!36!!2 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !33!!2!!2!!0!!2!!0!!0!!0!!37!!2 } ===International=== {   ! colspan=\\"3\\"  Canada national team - !Year!!Apps!!Goals - 201840 - 201940 - !Total80 } == Personal life == Millar is engaged to hockey goalie Daniela Paniccia, who played for Penn State Nittany Lions and Oakville Hornets in the Provincial Women's Hockey League. == References == Category:1999 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian expatriate soccer players Category:Liverpool F.C. players Category:Soccer people from Ontario Category:Sportspeople from Brampton Category:Sportspeople from Oakville, Ontario Category:Sportspeople from Toronto Category:Canadian soccer players Category:Canada men's international soccer players Category:Fulham F.C. players Category:Canada men's youth international soccer players Category:Association football forwards Category:Canadian expatriate sportspeople in England Category:Kilmarnock F.C. players Category:Canadian expatriate sportspeople in Scotland Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:Expatriate footballers in Scotland Category:Scottish Professional Football League players Category:2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup players ","title":"Liam Millar"},{"id":"56823408","text":"Dr Graham Renshaw FRSE FZS LRCP (1872-1952) was a 20th-century British physician and noted biologist.

It was the fourteenth edition of the competition limited to British athletes only, launched as an alternative to the AAA Championships, which was open to foreign competitors. However, due to the fact that the calibre of national competition remained greater at the AAA event, the UK Championships this year were not considered the principal national championship event by some statisticians, such as the National Union of Track Statisticians (NUTS).

After three weeks in a critical condition, Yulia regained consciousness and was able to speak; she was discharged from hospital on 9 April.; Sergei was also in a critical condition until he regained consciousness one month after the attack; he was discharged on 18 May. A police officer was also taken into intensive care after attending the incident. By 22 March he had recovered enough to leave the hospital. In the 1990s, Sergei Skripal was an officer for Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) and worked as a double agent for the UK's Secret Intelligence Service from 1995 until his arrest in Moscow in December 2004. In August 2006, he was convicted of high treason and sentenced to 13 years in a penal colony by a Russian court. He settled in the UK in 2010 following the Illegals Program spy swap. Sergei holds dual Russian and British citizenship; Yulia is a Russian citizen, and was visiting her father from Moscow. Later on 12 March, the British government accused Russia of attempted murder and announced a series of punitive measures against Russia, including the expulsion of diplomats, on the 14 March. The UK's official assessment of the incident was supported by 28 other countries which responded similarly. Altogether, an unprecedented 153 Russian diplomats were expelled. Russia denied the accusations and responded similarly to the expulsions and \\"accused Britain of the poisoning.\\" On 30 June 2018, a similar poisoning of two British nationals in Amesbury, seven miles north of Salisbury, involved the same nerve agent. A man found a perfume bottle, later discovered to contain the agent, in a litter bin somewhere in Salisbury and gave it to a woman who sprayed it on her wrist.https://www.itv.com/news/2018-07-26/novichok-charlie-rowley- amesbury-nerve-agent-exclusive/ The woman, Dawn Sturgess, fell ill within 15 minutes and died on 8 July, but the man, Charlie Rowley, who also came into contact with the poison, survived. British police believe this incident was not a targeted attack, but a result of the way the nerve agent was disposed of after the poisoning in Salisbury. On 5 September 2018, British authorities identified two Russian nationals, using the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, as suspected of the Skripals' poisoning, and alleged that they were active officers in Russian military intelligence. On 26 September 2018, investigative website Bellingcat published a statement that it had positively identified the man known as Ruslan Boshirov as the highly decorated GRU Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga. On 8 October 2018, Bellingcat claimed the real identity of the suspect named by police as Alexander Petrov to be Dr. Alexander Mishkin, also of the GRU. A third GRU officer present in the UK during the time Sergey and Yulia Skripal fell into a coma has been identified as Denis Vyacheslavovich Sergeev, a graduate of Russia's Military Diplomatic Academy.Bellingcat, 14 February 2019 Suspect in Scripal poisoning identified as Denis SergeevBellingcat 21 February 2019 The search for Denis Sergeev Denis Sergeyev is believed to hold the rank of major general in the GRU. The pattern of his communications while in the UK indicates that Maj Gen Sergeyev liaised with superior officers in Moscow. The attempted assassination was allegedly organized by a secret Unit 29155 of the Russian GRU under command of Maj. Gen. Andrei V. Averyanov. The unit is allegedly responsible for destabilizing European countries and organized the Montenegrin coup attempt.Top Secret Russian Unit Seeks to Destabilize Europe, Security Officials Say, New York Times On 27 November 2019, the OPCW global chemical weapons watchdog added Novichok, the Soviet-era nerve agent used in the attack, to its list of banned toxins. ==Chronology of events== *At 14:40 GMT on 3 March 2018, Yulia Skripal, the 33-year-old daughter of Sergei Skripal, a 66-year-old resident of Salisbury, flew to Heathrow Airport from Russia. *At 09:15 on 4 March Sergei Skripal's burgundy 2009 BMW 320d was seen in the area of London Road, Churchill Way North and Wilton Road at Salisbury. *At 13:30 Skripal's car was seen on Devizes Road on the way towards the town centre. *At 13:40 the Skripals arrived in the upper level car park at the Maltings, Salisbury and then went to the Bishop's Mill pub in the town centre. *At 14:20 they dined at Zizzi on Castle Street, leaving at 15:35. *At 16:15 an emergency services call reported that a man and woman, later identified as Sergei and Yulia, had been found unconscious on a public bench in the centre of Salisbury by the passing Chief Nursing Officer for the British Army and her daughter. An eyewitness saw the woman foaming at the mouth with her eyes wide open but completely white. According to a later British government statement they were \\"slipping in and out of consciousness on a public bench\\". *At 17:10, they were taken separately to Salisbury District Hospital by an ambulance and an air ambulance. At 09:03 the following morning, Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust declared a major incident in response to concerns raised by medical staff; shortly afterwards this became a multi-agency incident named Operation Fairline. Health authorities checked 21 members of the emergency services and the public for possible symptoms; two police officers were treated for minor symptoms, said to be itchy eyes and wheezing, while one, Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who had been sent to Skripal's house, was in a serious condition. On 22 March, Bailey was discharged from the hospital. In a statement he said \\"normal life for me will probably never be the same\\" and thanked the hospital staff. On 26 March, Skripal and his daughter were reported to still be critically ill. On 29 March it was announced that Yulia's condition was improving and she was no longer in a critical condition. On 5 April, doctors said that Sergei was no longer in critical condition and was responding well to treatment. On 9 April, Yulia was discharged from hospital and taken to a secure location. On 18 May, Sergei Skripal was discharged from the hospital too. On 23 May, a handwritten letter and a video statement by Yulia were released to the Reuters news agency for the first time after the poisoning. She stated that she was lucky to be alive after the poisoning and thanked the staff of the Salisbury hospital. She described her treatment as slow, heavy and extremely painful and mentioned a scar on her neck, apparently from a tracheotomy. She expressed hope that someday she would return to Russia. She thanked the Russian embassy for its offer of assistance but said she and her father were \\"not ready to take it\\". On 5 April, British authorities said that inside Skripal's house, which had been sealed by the police, two guinea pigs were found dead by vets, when they were allowed in, along with a cat in a distressed state, which had to be put down. On 22 November the first interview with DS Bailey was released, in which he reported that he had been poisoned, despite the fact that he inspected the Skripals' house wearing a forensic suit. In addition to the poisoning, Bailey and his family had lost their home and all their possessions, because of contamination. Investigators said that the perfume bottle containing Novichok, which was later found in a bin, had contained enough of the nerve agent to potentially kill thousands of people. In early 2019, building contractors built a scaffolding \\"sealed frame\\" over the house and the garage of Skripal's home. A military team then dismantled and removed the roofs on both buildings over the course of two weeks. Cleaning and decontamination was followed by rebuilding over a period of four months.\\"Poisoned spy's house to be dismantled by military\\" 8 January 2019 Sky News\\"Skripal Novichok poisoning attack house roof replaced\\" BBC 8 January 2019 On 22 February 2019, Government officials announced that the last of the 12 sites that had been undergoing an intense and hazardous clean-up – Skripal's house – had been judged safe.\\"Salisbury ruled safe a year after Skripal poisoning as police make fresh appeal\\" Guardian 1st March 2019 In May 2019, Sergei Skripal made a phone call and left a voice message to his niece Viktoria living in Russia. This was the first time after the poisoning that his voice had been heard by the public. In August 2019 it was confirmed that a second police officer had been poisoned while investigating, but only in trace amounts. ==Investigation== The first public response to the poisoning came on 6 March. It was agreed under the National Counter Terrorism Policing Network that the Counter Terrorism Command based within the Metropolitan Police would take over the investigation from Wiltshire Police. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, head of Counter Terrorism Policing, appealed for witnesses to the incident following a COBR meeting chaired by Home Secretary Amber Rudd. Samples of the nerve agent used in the attack tested positive at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down for a \\"very rare\\" nerve agent, according to the UK Home Secretary. 180 military experts in chemical warfare defence and decontamination, as well as 18 vehicles, were deployed on 9 March to assist the Metropolitan Police to remove vehicles and objects from the scene and look for any further traces of the nerve agent. The personnel were drawn mostly from the Army, including instructors from the Defence CBRN Centre and the 29 Explosive Ordnance Disposal and Search Group, as well as from the Royal Marines and Royal Air Force. The vehicles included TPz Fuchs operated by Falcon Squadron from the Royal Tank Regiment. On 11 March, the UK government advised those present at either The Mill pub or the Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on 4 and 5 March to wash or wipe their possessions, emphasising that the risk to the general public was low. Several days later, on 12 March, Prime Minister Theresa May said the agent had been identified as one of the Novichok family of agents, believed to have been developed in the 1980s by the Soviet Union. According to the Russian ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, the British authorities identified the agent as A-234, derived from an earlier version known as A-232. By 14 March, the investigation was focused on Skripal's home and car, a bench where the two fell unconscious, a restaurant in which they dined and a pub where they had drinks. A recovery vehicle was removed by the military from Gillingham in Dorset on 14 March, in connection with the poisoning. Subsequently, there was speculation within the British media that the nerve agent had been planted in one of the personal items in Yulia Skripal's suitcase before she left Moscow for London, and in US media that it had been planted in their car. Ahmet Üzümcü, Director-General of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), said on 20 March that it will take \\"another two to three weeks to finalise the analysis\\" of samples taken from the poisoning of Skripal.\\"Two to three weeks to analyze samples from Salisbury attack: OPCW\\". Agence France-Presse. 20 March 2018. On 22 March, the Court of Protection gave permission for new blood samples to be obtained from Yulia and Sergei Skripal for use by the OPCW.Justice Williams, High Court Judgement, Royal Courts of Justice, 22 March 2018. judiciary.gov.uk. By 28 March, the police investigation concluded that the Skripals were poisoned at Sergei's home, with the highest concentration being found on the handle of his front door. On 12 April the OPCW confirmed the UK's analysis of the type of nerve agent and reported it was of a \\"high purity\\", stating that the \\"name and structure of the identified toxic chemical are contained in the full classified report of the Secretariat, available to States Parties.\\"; A declassified letter from the UK's national security adviser, Sir Mark Sedwill, to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, stated Russian military intelligence hacked Yulia Skripal's email account since at least 2013 and tested methods for delivering nerve agents including on door handles. The Department for Environment confirmed the nerve agent was delivered \\"in a liquid form\\". They said eight sites require decontamination, which will take several months to complete and cost millions of pounds. The BBC reported experts said the nerve agent does not evaporate or disappear over time. Intense cleaning with caustic chemicals is required to get rid of it. The Skripals' survival was possibly due to the weather – there had been heavy fog and high humidity, and according to its inventor and other scientists, moisture weakens the potency of this type of toxin. On 22 April 2018, it was reported that British counter-terror police had identified a suspect in the poisoning: a former FSB officer (reportedly a 54-year-old former FSB captain) who acted under several code names including \\"Gordon\\" and \\"Mihails Savickis\\". According to detectives, he led a team of six Russian assassins who organized the chemical weapons attack. Sedwill reported on 1 May 2018 however that UK intelligence and police agencies had failed to identify the individual or individuals who carried out the attack. On 3 May 2018, the head of the OPCW, Ahmet Üzümcü, informed the New York Times that he had been told that about 50–100 grams of the nerve agent was thought to have been used in the attack, which indicated it was likely created for use as a weapon and was enough to kill a large number of people. The next day however the OPCW made a correcting statement that the \\"quantity should probably be characterised in milligrams\\", though \\"the OPCW would not be able to estimate or determine the amount of the nerve agent that was used\\". On 19 July the Press Association reported that police believed they had identified \\"several Russians\\" as the suspected perpetrators of the attack. They had been identified through CCTV, cross- checked with border entry data. On 6 August 2018, it was reported that the British government was \\"poised to submit an extradition request to Moscow for two Russians suspected of carrying out the Salisbury nerve agent attack\\". The Metropolitan Police used two super recognisers to identify the suspects after trawling through up to 5,000 hours of CCTV footage from Salisbury and numerous airports across the country. ===Suspects and attack timeline=== On 5 September 2018, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced charges in absentia against two alleged Russian agents. The two Russian nationals were believed to have been travelling under aliases, although they had genuine Russian passports with the identities of Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov when applying for visas and entering the UK. The CPS said there was enough evidence to charge the men, but it was not applying to Russia for the extradition of the two suspects. Interpol Red Notices and domestic and European Arrest Warrants were issued in case the suspects travel to the EU. As part of the announcement Scotland Yard and the Counter Terrorism Command released a detailed track of the individuals' 48 hours in the UK. This covered their arrival from Moscow at Gatwick Airport, a trip to Salisbury by train the day before the attack, stated by police to be for reconnaissance, a trip to Salisbury by train on the day of the attack, and return to Moscow via Heathrow Airport. The two spent both nights at the City Stay Hotel, next to Bow Church DLR station in Bow, East London. Novichok was found in their hotel room after police sealed it off on 4 May 2018. Neil Basu, National Lead for Counter Terrorism Policing said that tests were carried out on their hotel room and it was \\"deemed safe\\". British Prime Minister Theresa May announced in the Commons the same day that British intelligence services had identified the two suspects as officers in the G. U. Intelligence Service (formerly known as GRU) and the assassination attempt was not a rogue operation and was \\"almost certainly\\" approved at a senior level of the Russian government. May also said Britain would push for the EU to agree new sanctions against Russia. On 5 September 2018, the Russian news site Fontanka reported that the numbers on leaked passport files for Petrov and Boshirov are only three digits apart, and fall in a range that includes the passport files for a Russian military official expelled from Poland for spying. It is not known how the passport files were obtained, but Andrew Roth, the Moscow correspondent for The Guardian, commented that \\"If the reporting is confirmed, it would be a major blunder by the intelligence agency, allowing any country to check passport data for Russians requesting visas or entering the country against a list of nearly 40 passport files of suspected GRU officers.\\" On 14 September 2018, the online platforms Bellingcat and the Russian publication Russia Insider noted that in Petrov's leaked passport files, there is no record of a residential address or any identification papers prior to 2009, suggesting that the name is an alias created that year; the analysis also noted that Petrov's dossier is stamped \\"Do not provide any information\\" and has the handwritten annotation \\"S.S.,\\" a common abbreviation in Russian for \\"top secret.\\" On 15 September 2018, the Russian opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta reported finding in Petrov's passport files a cryptic number that seems to be a telephone number associated with the Russian Defence Ministry, most likely the Military Intelligence Directorate. On 26 September 2018, the real identity of the suspect named by police as Ruslan Boshirov was revealed as Colonel Anatoliy Vladimirovich Chepiga by The Daily Telegraph, citing reporting by itself and Bellingcat, with Petrov having a more junior rank in the GRU.Newsnight, BBC2, 26 September 2018 The 39-year-old was made a Hero of the Russian Federation by decree of the President in 2014. Two European security sources confirmed that the details were accurate. The BBC commented: \\"The BBC understands there is no dispute over the identification.\\" The British defence minister Gavin Williamson wrote: \\"The true identity of one of the Salisbury suspects has been revealed to be a Russian Colonel. I want to thank all the people who are working so tirelessly on this case.\\" However, that statement was subsequently deleted from Twitter. On 8 October 2018, the real identity of the suspect named by police as Alexander Petrov was revealed as Alexander Mishkin. On 22 November 2018, more CCTV footage, with the two suspects walking in Salisbury, was published by the police. On 19 December 2018, Mishkin (a.k.a. Petrov) and Chepiga (a.k.a. Boshirov) were added to the sanctions list of USA Treasury Department along with other 13 members of the GRU agency. On 6 January 2019, the Telegraph reported that the British authorities had established all the essential details of the assassination attempt, including the chain of command that leads up to Vladimir Putin. ==Response of the United Kingdom== Within days of the attack, political pressure began to mount on Theresa May's government to take action against the perpetrators, and most senior politicians appeared to believe that the Russian government was behind the attack.Russian spy: May under pressure to take firm action BBC, 12 March 2018.Neil Buckley, David Bond, Henry Foy.

On 17 March, Russia announced that it was expelling 23 British diplomats and ordered the closure of the UK's consulate in St Petersburg and the British Council office in Moscow, stopping all British Council activities in Russia. The poisoning has been officially declared to be a fabrication and a \\"grotesque provocation rudely staged by the British and U.S. intelligence agencies\\" to undermine Russia.UK rejects joint probe with Russia into spy poisoning The Washington Post, 4 April 2018.Нарышкин назвал «дело Скрипаля» гротескной провокацией Британии и США Izvestia, 4 April 2018. The Russian government and embassy of Russia in the United Kingdom repeatedly requested access to the Skripals, and sought to offer consular assistance. These requests and offers were denied or declined. In September, Russia described the Skripals' situation as \\"de-facto deprivation of liberty\\", claiming that several diplomatic and human rights conventions were violated. On 5 September the Russian government rejected the accusations \\"against Russia and two allegedly Russian citizens.\\" On 5 September 2018 Putin's Press Secretary, Dmitry Peskov, stated that May's accusations from that day were \\"unacceptable\\". Peskov asserted Russia had not received any official request from Britain for assistance in identifying the two suspected Russian GRU military intelligence officers that Scotland Yard believes carried out the Skripal attack. The same day, the Foreign Ministry of Russia asserted that UK ambassador in Moscow, Laurie Bristow, had said that London would not provide Russia with the suspects' fingerprints, passport numbers, visa numbers, or any extra data. On 12 September 2018, Putin, while answering questions at the plenary meeting of the 4th Eastern Economic Forum in Russia's Far Eastern port city of Vladivostok said that the identities of both men London suspected of involvement in the Skripal case were known to the Russian authorities and that both were civilians, who had done nothing criminal. He also said he would like the men to come forward to tell their story.Skripal suspects expressed their opinion, but this does not put lid on case. TASS, 13 September 2018Russia This Week – Focus On The Skripal Case. MEMRI Russian Media Studies Project, Special Dispatch No.7673, 16 September 2018 In a 13 September 2018 interview on the state-funded television channel RT, the accused claimed to be sports nutritionists who had gone to Salisbury merely to see the sights and look for nutrition products, saying that they took a second day-trip to Salisbury because slush had dampened their first one. On 14 September, Lavrov stated: \\"Our proposal of putting into operation existing mechanisms between London and Moscow on the legal assistance in criminal cases is still in force. Since there is no response to our proposal, we have all grounds to believe that there had been no crime, which these ladies and gentlemen are trying to attribute to our citizens.\\"Lavrov blasts London’s reaction to interview with Skripal case suspects as illogical. TASS, 14 September 2018 On 26 September, the same day one of the suspects was identified as the Colonel of GRU, Lavrov once again urged the British authorities to cooperate in the investigation of the case, said Britain had given no proof of Russia's guilt and suggested that Britain had something to hide. On 25 September, the Russian FSB began searching for Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) officers who had provided journalists with foreign passport and flight information about the suspects. ===Russian state media=== For a few days following the poisoning, the story was discussed by web sites, radio stations and newspapers, but Russian state-run main national TV channels largely ignored the incident. Eventually, on 7 March, anchor Kirill Kleimyonov of the state television station Channel One Russia's current affairs programme Vremya mentioned the incident by attributing the allegation to foreign secretary Boris Johnson. After speaking of Johnson disparagingly, Kleimyonov said that being \\"a traitor to the motherland\\" was one of the most hazardous professions and warned: \\"Don't choose England as a next country to live in. Whatever the reasons, whether you're a professional traitor to the motherland or you just hate your country in your spare time, I repeat, no matter, don't move to England. Something is not right there. Maybe it's the climate, but in recent years there have been too many strange incidents with a grave outcome. People get hanged, poisoned, they die in helicopter crashes and fall out of windows in industrial quantities.\\" Kleimyonov's commentary was accompanied by a report highlighting previous suspicious Russia-related deaths in the UK, namely those of financier Alexander Perepilichny, businessman Boris Berezovsky, ex-FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko and radiation expert Matthew Puncher. Puncher discovered that Litvinenko was poisoned by polonium; he died in 2006, five months after a trip to Russia. The host of the Vesti Nedeli on Russian state television (Russia-1 channel of VGTRK), Dmitry Kiselyov, said on 11 March that the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, who was \\"completely wrung out and of little interest\\" as a source, was only advantageous to the British to \\"nourish their Russophobia\\" and organise the boycott of the FIFA World Cup scheduled for June 2018. Kiselyov referred to London as a \\"pernicious place for Russian exiles\\".Вести недели с Дмитрием Киселевым от 11.03.18 (the relevant footage begins at 1:27:20), Vesti Nedeli, 11 March 2018.Britain Poisoned Double Agent Skripal to 'Nourish Russophobia' — Russian State Media The Moscow Times, 12 March 2018.Russian state TV accuses Britain of poisoning spy in special operation Reuters, 12 March 2018.Russia Wants Samples Of The Nerve Agent Believed To Have Poisoned A Former Russian Spy And His Daughter Buzzfeed.com, 12 March 2018. The prominent Russian television hosts' warnings to Russians living in the UK were echoed by a similar direct warning from a senior member of the Russian Federation Council, Andrey Klimov, who said: \\"It's going to be very unsafe for you.\\" Claims made by Russian media were fact-checked by UK media organisations. An interview with two men claiming to be the suspects named by the UK was aired on RT on 13 September 2018 with RT editor Margarita Simonyan. They said they were ordinary tourists who had wished to see Stonehenge, Old Sarum, and the \\"famous ... 123-metre spire\\" of Salisbury Cathedral. They also said that they \\"maybe approached Skripal's house, but we didn't know where it was located,\\" and denied using Novichok, which they had allegedly transported in a fake perfume bottle, saying, \\"Is it silly for decent lads to have women's perfume? The customs are checking everything, they would have questions as to why men have women's perfume in their luggage.\\" Although Simonyan avoided most questions about the two men's backgrounds, she hinted that they might be gay by asking, \\"All footage features you two together ... What do you have in common that you spend so much time together?\\" The New York Times interpreted the hint by noting that \\"The possibility that Mr. Petrov and Mr. Boshirov could be gay would, for a Russian audience, immediately rule out the possibility that they serve as military intelligence officers.\\" ==Chemical weapons experts and intelligencePorton Down=== On 3 April 2018 Gary Aitkenhead, the chief executive of the Government's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) at Porton Down responsible for testing the substance involved in the case, said they had established the agent was Novichok or from that family but had been unable to verify the \\"precise source\\" of the nerve agent and that they had \\"provided the scientific info to Government who have then used a number of other sources to piece together the conclusions you have come to.\\" Aitkenhead refused to comment on whether the laboratory had developed or maintains stocks of Novichok. He also dismissed speculations the substance could have come from Porton Down: \\"There is no way anything like that could have come from us or left the four walls of our facility.\\" Aitkenhead stated the creation of the nerve agent was \\"probably only within the capabilities of a state actor\\" and there was no known antidote. ===Former Russian scientists and intelligence officers=== Vil Mirzayanov, a former Soviet Union scientist who worked at the research institute that developed the Novichok class of nerve agents and lives in the United States, believes that hundreds of people could have been affected by residual contamination in Salisbury. He said that Sergei and Yulia Skripal, if poisoned with a Novichok, would be left with debilitating health issues for the rest of their lives. He also criticised the response of Public Health England, saying that washing personal belongings was insufficient to remove traces of the chemical. Two other Russian scientists who now live in Russia and have been involved in Soviet-era chemical weapons development, Vladimir Uglev and Leonid Rink, were quoted as saying that Novichok agents had been developed in the 1970s–1980s within the programme that was officially titled FOLIANT and the term Novichok referred to a whole system of chemical weapons use; they, as well as Mirzayanov, who published Novichok's formula in 2008, also noted that Novichok-type agents might be synthesised in other countries.Что такое \\"Новичок\\"?

The spies were discovered through a joint investigation by the Swiss, Dutch, and British intelligence services. The two men expelled were not the same as the Salisbury suspects. == Response from other countries and organisations  US government === Following Theresa May's statement in Parliament, the US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson released a statement on 12 March that fully supported the stance of the UK government on the poisoning attack, including \\"its assessment that Russia was likely responsible for the nerve agent attack that took place in Salisbury\\". The following day, US President Donald Trump said that Russia was likely responsible. United States Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley at the Security Council briefing on 14 March 2018 stated: \\"The United States believes that Russia is responsible for the attack on two people in the United Kingdom using a military-grade nerve agent\\". Following the United States National Security Council's recommendation, President Trump, on 26 March, ordered the expulsion of sixty Russian diplomats (referred to by the White House as \\"Russian intelligence officers\\"Statement from the Press Secretary on the Expulsion of Russian Intelligence Officers The White House, 26 March 2018.) and the closure of the Russian consulate in Seattle.США высылают из страны 60 российских дипломатов TASS, 26 March 2018. The action was cast as being \\"in response to Russia's use of a military-grade chemical weapon on the soil of the United Kingdom, the latest in its ongoing pattern of destabilising activities around the world.\\" On 8 August, five months after the poisoning, the US government agreed to place sanctions on Russian banks and exports. On 6 August, the US State Department concluded that Russia was behind the poisoning. The sanctions, which are enforced under the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991 (CBW Act), were planned to come into effect on 27 August. However, these sanctions were not implemented by the Trump administration. ===European Union and member states=== European Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans argued for \\"unequivocal, unwavering and very strong\\" European solidarity with the United Kingdom when speaking to lawmakers in Strasburg on 13 March. Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, expressed shock and offered the bloc's support. MEP and leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the European Parliament Guy Verhofstadt proclaimed solidarity with the British people. During a meeting in the Foreign Affairs Council on 19 March, all foreign ministers of the European Union declared in a joint statement that the \\"European Union expresses its unqualified solidarity with the UK and its support, including for the UK's efforts to bring those responsible for this crime to justice.\\" In addition, the statement also pointed out that \\"The European Union takes extremely seriously the UK Government's assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible.\\" Norbert Röttgen, a former federal minister in Angela Merkel's government and current chairman of Germany's parliamentary foreign affairs committee, said the incident demonstrated the need for Britain to review its open-door policy towards Russian capital of dubious origin. Sixteen EU countries expelled 33 Russian diplomats on 26 March. The European Union officially sanctioned 4 Russians that were suspected of carrying out the attack on 21 January 2019. The head of the GRU Igor Kostyukov and the deputy head Vladimir Alexseyev were both sanctioned along with Mishkin and Chepiga. The sanctions banned them from traveling to the EU and froze any assets they may have there along with banning any person or company in the EU providing any financial support to those sanctioned. ===Other non-EU countries=== Albania, Australia, Canada, Georgia, North Macedonia, Moldova, Norway and Ukraine expelled a total of 27 Russian diplomats who were believed to have been intelligence officers. The New Zealand Government also issued a statement supporting the actions, noting that it would have expelled any Russian intelligence agents who had been detected in the country. ===NATO=== NATO issued an official response to the attack on 14 March. The alliance expressed its deep concern over the first offensive use of a nerve agent on its territory since its foundation and said that the attack was in breach of international treaties. It called on Russia to fully disclose its research of the Novichok agent to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Jens Stoltenberg, NATO Secretary General, announced on 27 March that NATO would be expelling seven Russian diplomats from the Russian mission to NATO in Brussels. In addition, 3 unfilled positions at the mission have been denied accreditation from NATO. Russia blamed the US for the NATO response. === Joint responses === The leaders of France, Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom released a joint statement on 15 March which supported the UK's stance on the incident, stating that it was \\"highly likely that Russia was responsible\\" and calling on Russia to provide complete disclosure to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons concerning its Novichok nerve agent program. On 19 March, the European Union also issued a statement strongly condemning the attack and stating it \\"takes extremely seriously the UK Government's assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible\\". On 6 September 2018, Canada, France, Germany and the United States issued a joint statement saying they had \\"full confidence\\" that the Salisbury attack was orchestrated by Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate and \\"almost certainly approved at a senior government level\\" and urged Russia to provide full disclosure of its Novichok programme to the OPCW. ==Expulsion of diplomats== Expelled Russian diplomats By the end of March 2018 a number of countries and other organisations expelled a total of more than 150 Russian diplomats in a show of solidarity with the UK. According to the BBC it was \\"the largest collective expulsion of Russian intelligence officers in history\\". The UK expelled 23 Russian diplomats on 14 March 2018. Three days later, Russia expelled an equal number of British diplomats and ordered closure of the UK consulate in St. Petersburg and closure of the British Council in Russia. Nine countries expelled Russian diplomats on 26 March: along with 6 other EU nations, the US, Canada, Ukraine and Albania. The following day, several nations inside and outside of the EU, and NATO responded similarly. By 30 March, Russia expelled an equal number of diplomats of most nations who had expelled Russian diplomats. By that time, Belgium, Montenegro, Hungary and Georgia had also expelled one or more Russian diplomats. Additionally on 30 March, Russia reduced the size of the total UK mission's personnel in Russia to match that of the Russian mission to the UK.

On 13 September, Chris Busby, a retired research scientist, who is a regular expert on the Russian government controlled RT television network, was arrested after his home in Bideford was raided by police. Busby was an outspoken critic of the British Government's handling of the Salisbury poisoning. In one video he stated: \\"Just to make it perfectly clear, there's no way that there's any proof that the material that poisoned the Skripals came from Russia.\\" Busby was held for 19 hours under the Explosive Substances Act 1883, before being released with no further action. Following his release, Busby told the BBC he believed that the fact that two of the officers who had raided his property had felt unwell was explained by \\"psychological problems associated with their knowledge of the Skripal poisoning\\". On 16 September, fears of Novichok contamination flared up again after two people fell ill at a Prezzo restaurant, from the Zizzi location where the Skripals had eaten before collapsing. The restaurant, a nearby pub, and surrounding streets were cordoned off, with some patrons under observation or unable to leave the area. The next day, the police said there was \\"nothing to suggest that Novichok\\" was the cause of the two people falling ill. However, on 19 September, one of the apparent victims, Anna Shapiro, claimed in The Sun newspaper that the incident had been an attempted assassination against her and her husband by Russia. This article was later removed from The Sun \\"for legal reasons\\" and the police began to investigate the incident as a \\"possible hoax\\" after the couple were discharged from hospital. In April 2019, The New York Times reported that then deputy CIA director Gina Haspel advised Donald Trump in a discussion that young children had been hospitalised and ducks killed after exposure to the Novichok nerve agent that poisoned the Skripals. She showed him photos of these victims which the New York Times reported had been provided by British officials. The incident was cited as an example of the \\"persuasive skills\\" of the then CIA director Gina Haspel. In response Tracy Daszkiewicz, the director of public health for Wiltshire, said: \\"There were no other casualties other than those previously stated. No wildlife were impacted by the incident and no children were exposed to or became ill as a result of either incident\\".Trump wrote off novichok attack of defector as 'spy games' – report, The Guardian, 16 April 2019 ===Russian public opinion=== The Moscow Times reported later in the year of the poisonings \\"The results of the survey published by the independent Levada Center pollster [in October 2018] say that 28 percent of Russians believe that British intelligence services were behind Skripals' poisoning, with only 3 percent saying they believe their own intelligence officers carried out the attack. Another 56 percent said that \\"it could have been anyone.\\" Meanwhile, 37 percent of respondents said they knew about the case in detail and 33 percent said they had \\"heard something\\" about it, with another 20 percent saying they had heard nothing about the poisoning.\\" ==Recovery money== As of 17 October 2018, a total of £7.5 million had been pledged by government in support of the city and to support businesses, boost tourism and to cover unexpected costs. Wiltshire Council had spent or pledged £7,338,974 on recovery, and a further half million \\"was in the pipeline\\": * £733,381 towards unexpected closure and loss of footfall to businesses * £404,024 in revenue grants for 74 businesses * £99,891 in capital grants * £229,446 in business rate relief for 56 businesses * £210,491 on events to boost tourism * £500,000 from the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport * £4,000 on dry cleaning or disposal of clothes believed to be contaminated by Novichock * £1 million towards keeping contaminated sites safe * £570,000 recovery money to cover costs of free parking, and free park and ride services * £4.1 million of the money pledged by the Home Office to cover Wiltshire Police's costs. A council commissioner said total policing cost had exceeded £10 million. Having £6.6 million allocated for funding the police force, he said he hoped to \\"recoup the full amount from central government\\". == Recognition of responders == Deputy Chief Constable Paul Mills and Superintendent Dave Minty of Wiltshire Police were each awarded the Queen's Police Medal in the 2020 New Year Honours for their roles in responding to the incident. The combined Wiltshire Emergency Services received Wiltshire Life's 2019 \\"Pride of Wiltshire\\" award. == Media depictions == The Salisbury Poisonings, a three-part dramatisation of the events with a focus on the response of local officials and the local community, was broadcast on BBC One in June 2020. ==See also== * Intelligence agencies of Russia * Assassination of Kim Jong-nam by North Korea with VX nerve agent * Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko putatively by Russian intelligence agents with Polonium-210 * Poisoning of Alexei Navalny, Russian politician poisoned with Novichok * Bulgarian umbrella used to assassinate Georgi Markov in London * List of poisonings ==NotesReferences * Report from the Russian Embassy to the UK, \\"Salisbury Unanswered Questions,\\" 4 March 2019 * \\"Salisbury & Amesbury Investigation –UK Counter Terrorism Policing\\", 5 September 2018 * \\"Russian spy: What we know so far\\", BBC, 19 March 2018 * \\"Amanda Erickson: The long, terrifying history of Russian dissidents being poisoned abroad\\", The Washington Post, 7 March 2018 * \\"Joel Gunter: Sergei Skripal and the 14 deaths under scrutiny\\", bbc.com, 7 March 2018 * Bellingcat's investigative page for the Chepiga identification – Skripal Suspect Boshirov Identified as GRU Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga Category:2018 controversies Category:2018 crimes in the United Kingdom Category:2018 in British politics Category:2018 in international relations Category:21st century in Wiltshire Category:Attacks in 2018 Category:Crime in Wiltshire Category:Diplomatic incidents Category:Failed assassination attempts in the United Kingdom Category:Forensic toxicology Category:History of Salisbury Category:March 2018 crimes in Europe Category:March 2018 events in the United Kingdom Category:Poisoning by drugs, medicaments and biological substances Category:Russia intelligence operations Category:Russia–United Kingdom relations Category:Russia–United States relations ","title":"Poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal"},{"id":"56823714","text":"The Visconti-Sforza Castle of Novara is a castle located in the south-western border of the old center of Novara.

The origin of the castle is connected to the transfer of Novara under the influence of Milan, taking place in the second half of the 13th century.

In the 14th century, after the exchange of the ruling families from the Della Torre to the Visconti, the Lord of Milan Giovanni Visconti (1339-1354) paid again attention to Novara and had the castle built. The castle was strengthened by his successors Galeazzo II (1354-1378) and Gian Galeazzo (1378-1402). Works and repairs were done over the years by Francesco Sforza. His son, the duke Galeazzo Maria, carried out the major transformation of the building. After almost ten years of restoration, in January 2016 the castle was reopened to the public. == References  * Il Castello di Novara (official site) Category:Castles in Piedmont ","title":"Visconti-Sforza Castle (Novara)"},{"id":"56823718","text":"The 1987 Giro del Trentino was the 11th edition of the Tour of the Alps cycle race and was held on 6 May to 9 May 1987.

Containing a total of fourteen tracks with twelve of which were released as singles from 2016 to 2018, the album marked the first group release with eighteen members from three different units participating at the time, while being the first release to officially introduce three new members Kun, Jungwoo and Lucas. With the group's label founder Lee Soo-man serving as the executive producer, composition and production for the album was contributed by Matt Schwartz, Tommy $trate, The Stereotypes, Timothy 'Bos' Bullock, Deez, Yoo Young-jin, Ryan S. Jhun, MZMC, Adrian McKinnon, Shin Hyuk, Josh Cumbee, Andrew Choi, Sara Forsberg, LDN Noise, and others. It was released on March 14, 2018, by SM Entertainment and iriver Inc along with the album's fourth single \\"Touch\\" by the Seoul-based unit NCT 127 and \\"Black on Black\\", the first single featuring all eighteen members of the group at that time. Upon its release, NCT 2018 Empathy received mixed to positive reviews from music critics over its \\"compiled\\" tracklist and the overall solidity. The album also attained commercial success domestically, peaking at number two on the Gaon Album Chart and became the group's first release to receive a Platinum KMCA certification following its introduction in 2018. It also experienced international success, peaking at number five on the Billboard World Albums while becoming the first NCT release to appear on other European charts. As of August 2019, the album has achieved a cumulative sales of over 350,000 physical copies. == Background == Following the announcement and introduction to the group's debut earlier in January 2016 by founder Lee Soo- man, a total of three sub-units debuted subsequently in the same year. The first sub-unit was NCT U, a rotational sub-unit with different members participating accordingly to the unit's music release which, at the time, saw the first appearance from member Taeil, Taeyong, Doyoung, Ten, Jaehyun and Mark. They eventually debuted with a double digital single, containing \\"The 7th Sense\\" with the latter five members and \\"Without You\\", which were performed by member Taeil, Doyoung and Jaehyun. The label then introduced NCT 127, the Seoul-based unit with number \\"127\\" representing the longitude coordinate of South Korea's capital on July 1 with seven members for its initial line-up: Taeil, Taeyong, Yuta, Jaehyun, Winwin, Mark, and Haechan. Following the label's announcement on December 27, 2016, member Doyoung and then-SR15B member Johnny officially joined the unit, marking with the unit's sophomore extended play later in January 2017. On August 18, SM Entertainment announced that the third unit would be NCT Dream, the teen-aged unit which consists of seven members: Mark, Renjun, Jeno, Haechan, Jaemin, Chenle, and Jisung. By the end of 2016, fifteen members were introduced officially as part of the unlimited NCT brand. NCT 127 and NCT Dream then continued to promote actively throughout the following year with further releases. In mid-January, SM Entertainment unveiled NCT 2018, a singular-year project involving all current members of NCT. Through the \\"NCT 2018 Yearbook #1\\" video on January 30, the label officially introduced new members Kun, Lucas, and Jungwoo to the current line-up of NCT. Followed by a series of online documentary videos titled NCTmentary as part of the NCT 2018 project, the group shared \\"NCT Yearbook #2\\" video via their official YouTube channel on February 5. Prior to their official introduction, member Kun was featured on the Chinese version of \\"Without You\\" in April 2016, having performed live with NCT U. The label eventually revealed that the group would release their first large-scale project as a studio album the following day, with all eighteen members participated accordingly to their sub-unit and music project for NCT U. == Composition == NCT 2018 Empathy consists of fourteen tracks in total, including an instrumental intro and outro and one extended version of a new song. The album also includes five previously released songs for its latter half, namely \\"The 7th Sense\\", the Korean and Chinese versions of \\"Without You\\" and \\"Timeless\\" by NCT U, while \\"Dream in a Dream\\" is an English solo record by member Ten, which along with \\"Timeless\\" was originally part of the SM Station project. The new recording material includes \\"Boss\\", a future-bass hip-hop track with \\"heavy bass riffs\\" which is produced by Mike Daley, Mitchell Owens, Tiffany Fred, Patrick \\"J. Que\\" Smith and Yoo Young-jin. With co-writing contribution by member Taeyong and Mark, the song contains the message of how the modern society \\"needs true empathy\\" and the unit's aspiration to bring out such empathy. Seven members participated in recording the song: Taeyong, Doyoung, Winwin, Jaehyun, Jungwoo, Lucas and Mark. It is followed by \\"Baby Don't Stop\\", an electro-hop, synth-pop track co-produced again by Yoo Young- jin with contribution from producer Matt Schwartz and Ryan S. Jhun. It possesses an \\"impressive\\" minimalist sonic composition with \\"addictive\\" drum and bass riff, expressing the sensation of an immediate love. It was also co- written by member Taeyong, whom performed the track along with member Ten as NCT U. He also contributed lyrically to the third and final new NCT U record, titled \\"Yestoday\\". It was described as a \\"sorrowful\\" old-school hip-hop influenced track, with member Taeyong, Doyoung, Lucas and Mark rapping and singing about how \\"today will eventually become yesterday\\". Other new material for the album includes the tropical-house influenced \\"Touch\\" by NCT 127. Produced by production team LDN Noise, Deez and Adrian McKinnon, the song offers a \\"softer side\\" for the nine-member unit in comparison to their signature intense hip hop style. In contrast, the teen-aged sub-unit NCT Dream also offers their \\"rebellious\\" side with the electro-hop bombast of \\"Go\\", featuring heavy hi-hats and snare lines that resembles more of a hip hop venture than the group's usual \\"youthful leanings\\" of their earlier discography. The rap-centric \\"Black on Black\\" is a \\"booming\\" electro-dance production featuring roars and \\"highly distorted\\" vocals, which credited NCT 2018 as the performers though only the rap-line members (Taeyong, Mark, Lucas) participated in the recording of the song. == Release and promotion  Distribution === NCT 2018 Empathy was released on March 14, 2018 by their native label SM Entertainment. The release was done through many music portals, including MelOn (South Korea) and iTunes (internationally), with physical release provided on the same day as well. The physical release contains two different versions, namely Reality and Dream with slightly difference on the package design and different group photo booklets. The digital release also contains an extended version of the album's fifth single \\"Yestoday\\" by NCT U. === Singles === Featuring members Taeyong, Doyoung, Jaehyun, Winwin, Mark, Jungwoo and Lucas (with the latter two members being officially introduced for the first time), the NCT U-leading \\"Boss\\" was released as the album's first single on February 18 with its music video. It was the most successful release from the album, peaking at number 97 on the Gaon Digital Chart, number 80 on the Billboard K-Pop Hot 100 and number three on the Billboard World Digital Songs chart. It was proceeded by the music video for \\"Baby Don't Stop\\", another NCT U single with member Taeyong and Ten on February 26, with both music videos sharing the same filming location at the Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine in Kiev, Ukraine. The single peaked at number two on the Billboard World Digital Songs chart, tying with their 2016's release \\"The 7th Sense\\" as the unit's highest peak on the chart. The third single \\"Go\\" by NCT Dream was released on March 4 to moderate success, peaking at number eighteen on the Billboard World Digital Songs and number twenty-five on the Billboard K-Pop Hot 100, becoming the highest charting release of NCT 2018 Empathy on the latter chart. In conjunction with the album release on March 13, the NCT 127-leading \\"Touch\\" was released as the fourth single on March 13. It also attained moderate success, peaking at number fifty-four on the Billboard K-Pop Hot 100 and number eleven on the World Digital Songs chart. Two further singles were released later, including the old school hip-hop influenced \\"Yestoday\\" on April 1 with participation from member Taeyong, Doyoung, Mark and Lucas as the fifth single, and \\"Black on Black\\", the performance-assisted single by the whole group as the sixth and final single on April 18. The latter became the only single to feature all eighteen members, and subsequently the first to officially introduce Chinese member Kun. Neither of these singles charted in any native, nor the World Digital Songs component chart. === Live performances === Promotion for the album started with NCT U's \\"Boss\\" first television performance at M Countdown on February 22, followed by performances on Show Champion, Show! Music Core and Inkigayo. Under the same unit, member Taeyong continued to promote with member Ten for \\"Baby Don't Stop\\" with live performances on M Countdown, Music Bank, Show! Music Core and Inkigayo starting from March 1. NCT Dream then continued the pre-release promotion activities with \\"Go\\" from March 8 and \\"Touch\\" by NCT 127 starting from March 15. \\"Touch\\" later won the unit their first music show trophy at The Show on March 29, 2018, being the only release from the album to do so. == Commercial performance == Prior to the album's release, NCT 2018 Empathy already achieved 203,000 pre-orders, eventually topped several iTunes country charts upon its release.

It was the second time that the event was held in the Welsh capital, following on from the 1990 championships there. Strong winds affected several of the jumps on the programme. A women's hammer throw was added to the schedule for the first time, though it was not classified as a UK championship event at the competition. It was the fifteenth edition of the competition limited to British athletes only, launched as an alternative to the AAA Championships, which was open to foreign competitors. However, due to the fact that the calibre of national competition remained greater at the AAA event, the UK Championships this year were not considered the principal national championship event by some statisticians, such as the National Union of Track Statisticians (NUTS). Many of the athletes below also competed at the 1991 AAA Championships.UK Championships. GBR Athletics. Retrieved 2018-02-25.AAA WAAA and National Championships Medalists. NUTS. Retrieved 2018-02-25. Three athletes won a third straight UK title, all of them throwers: Paul Head (hammer), Sharon Gibson (javelin) and Jackie McKernan (discus). Five further athletes defended their 1990 titles: Linford Christie (100 m), David Sharpe (800 m), Paul Edwards (shot put), Andy Ashurst (pole vault) and Alison Wyeth (1500 m). Judy Oakes returned to the top of the women's shot put podium to take a record-breaking ninth UK title. No athlete won multiple UK titles, though Michael Rosswess managed runner-up in both short sprints. The main international track and field competition for the United Kingdom that year was the 1991 World Championships in Athletics. Liz McColgan added the world 10,000 metres title to her UK 3000 m title. Though neither Roger Black nor Kriss Akabusi topped the UK podium, they won medals at the world level that year.IAAF World Championships in Athletics. GBR Athletics.

Prior to the merger RMU, known as the Eagles, was one of the ACHA's historically-dominant programs, a status that included a pair of national championships (in 2005 and 2007), as well as a national-best five winners of the Zoë M. Harris Award as the ACHA's player of the year. RMU made 11 appearances at the ACHA National Tournament, a count that also placed near the top of the association. Mason Strom was hired as the team's seventh full- time head coach for the 2018–19 season and the first year of the team's identity as the Lakers will be his third overall. ==HistoryRobert Morris University Illinois (2003–20)=== Instant dynasty (2003–08) The athletics logo of Robert Morris University Illinois Robert Morris College (as the school was known until May 1, 2009) added women's hockey to its athletic department for the 2003–04 season. The Eagles, under head coach John Burke, quickly assembled a roster that was among the nation's best, featuring stars like co-captains Leah Johnson and Krista Sleen, as well as Warroad, Minnesota product Lisa Gens. Beginning a trend in the program that continues to the present, the inaugural roster was geographically diverse, featuring players local to Chicago and Illinois, but also from places as far away as Texas and Washington. From the program's inaugural game, a 10–0 victory at then-home Glacier Ice Arena in Vernon Hills, Illinois against Notre Dame on October 10, 2003, RMC had little issue with most ACHA competition, losing within the association only to eventual national champion Wisconsin and emerging power Lindenwood during the regular season. The program captured its first trophy midway through the year by taking first place at the White Out Tournament, hosted by UMass and the first mid-season showcase event held within the ACHA's women's divisions. That title also led to Robert Morris' first-ever number one ranking in the ACHA polls, in Ranking 3 of that season. The Eagles would retain the top position for ten ranking periods, spanning two and a half seasons (a time-period reign that was eventually matched by Lindenwood from 2009–11 but has never been exceeded). As the ACHA's top-ranked team, RMC was invited to the 2004 ACHA National Tournament, held in East Lansing, Michigan. However, the Eagles dropped their opener to No. 8 Colorado despite goals by Leah Johnson, Kathleen Johnson and Mindy Shelton, a defeat that eventually cost the squad a spot in the semifinals, before dumping No. 12 University of Pennsylvania and then tying No. 11 Penn State in a consolation game to finish sixth. An already-strong team got even stronger in the seasons that followed thanks largely to its 2004 entering class, which went on to become one of the best and most decorated in ACHA history. Erie, Pennsylvania's Savannah Varner, the ACHA's 2006–07 Zoë M. Harris Player of the Year and an All-American in 2004–05, 2005–06, and 2007–08 headlined the group, which also featured NCAA transfers Crystal Zace (a goaltender from Bemidji State) and Jennifer Norris (a defenseman from Wisconsin–Stevens Point). Other standouts included Katie Kosobucki, another Warroad High School graduate, and Ashley Boye from the noted Belle Tire youth program in Michigan. From the 2004–05 season through 2007–08, the Eagles lost just ten games against ACHA competition, all against perennial contenders Lindenwood and Michigan State. That reality, in part, led to RMC frequently seeking outside challenges, most significantly from NCAA Division III and U Sports (then called CIS) competition. Throughout the 2000s, Robert Morris schedules generally numbered between 40 and 45 games, with the 2006–07 slate serving as representative: 25–2–1 in 28 ACHA games, 5–4–1 in ten games against NCAA squads, and 0–5–0 versus CIS foes. During the 2005–06 season, RMC traveled to Tallinn, Estonia to compete in a tournament against seven European teams, and hosted by the Estonian Ice Hockey Association in an effort to get the brand-new Estonia women's national ice hockey team off the ground. The Eagles beat Estonia by a 5–0 count in their tournament opener the day after Estonia defeated Iceland in their first-ever international contest. Thanks to Varner's hat trick, RMC routed British side Kingston Diamonds 8–0 to capture the title, after also defeating Coventry Phoenix (Great Britain), KFS Wildcats (Denmark), and a team from Riga, Latvia. Stateside, the Eagles' dominance in the ACHA made invitations to nationals a foregone conclusion, with the season's success usually ultimately hinging on the last words against other top squads. The team qualified for the ACHA semifinals for six consecutive seasons from 2004–05 through 2009–10, with the first five of that run featuring championship game appearances. =2005 national championship= The 2005 ACHA National Tournament was held outside of Buffalo, New York, with the Eagles entering the competition as the top seed, and in Pool A with hosting University at Buffalo and North Country Community College. RMC opened by battering UB by an 8–0 count on March 10, 2015, a contest in which the Bulls were held to just three shots on goal, behind two tallies by Leah Johnson and three by Boye. Burke's charges didn't have much more of an issue in the pool and quarterfinal bid clincher against NCCC, as the team scored four goals shorthanded, three by Varner, in a 7–2 victory. The ACHA, at the time, played its quarterfinal and semifinal rounds on the same day, forcing the Eagles to follow up their pool wins by defeating two strong opponents with only about seven hours between games. Fifth-ranked Western Michigan opened the rigorous stretch by handing the Eagles their first (and only, as things turned out) deficit of the tournament on a Jennifer Goscicki goal just 1:27 into the game. However, two goals from Boye, and one each from Johnson and Mindy Shelton put RMC ahead 4–2 by the end of the first period on the way to a 9–3 win. That evening, a Crystal Randall shutout helped Robert Morris past frequent nationals nemesis Rhode Island and into the championship game by a 4–0 count. The final, against Michigan State, was also largely drama-free, as the Eagles led 2–0 within the first minute of play thanks to Norris and Varner. Zace largely shut down the Spartans from there, and the RMC onslaught wrapped up with a 7–1 title win. RMC's 2004–05 campaign remains one of the most dominant in ACHA history. The Eagles were the association's top- ranked team wire to wire, and were a spotless 20–0–0 against ACHA competition. Sleen won the Zoë M. Harris Award as the ACHA's player of the year, while Johnson was the national tournament most valuable player, and Varner, Boye and Johnson each received placement on the All-American teams. =2007 national championship= Edge Ice Arena, RMU and Roosevelt's home since the 2006–07 season The 2005 national title game would prove to be an anomaly in terms of opponent, as each of the next four ACHA finals would feature Robert Morris- Lindenwood matchups. The Lions shut down RMC's repeat bid in 2006 with a 3–2 overtime win, but the Eagles roared back the following season, and eventually recaptured the top spot in the rankings with a late-season home sweep of LU. That flip gave Robert Morris the top seed for the 2007 national championships in Amherst, Massachusetts, where the Eagles promptly dispatched of Michigan and hosting Massachusetts in the pool round by a combined 12–1 count, thanks in part to Jessica Zalesky's three goals. Things became much tighter from there, starting with a 3–1 quarterfinal win over Norwich on March 9, 2007. Thanks to an early Sophie LeClerc goal, the Cadets (who were competing in their final ACHA season before heading to NCAA Division III) held a 1–0 lead until late in the second period. RMC finally got going from that point, tying the game through freshman standout Bridget Katz, then adding third period tallies by Varner and Kosobucki for the final margin. The semifinal contest, against a Connecticut team that had upset always powerful Michigan State in the quarterfinals, offered even more drama. Varner's spectacular interception- to-backhand goal put RMC up 1–0 in the second, and her assist of Katz with six minutes left in the third period gave the Eagles a 2–1 lead. However, the Huskies grabbed a 5-on-3 goal in the last minute of regulation to force overtime, and an Eagles penalty immediately after the goal put UConn right back on a 5-on-3, with a chance to end things. Zace stood tall on the opening rush of overtime, and Varner subsequently boosted her squad to the finals with a shorthanded goal that, as with her first goal of the game, was a solo effort beginning with a turnover near the Huskies line. The championship rematch against Lindenwood was a bit less tense. Jackie Holmes and Ashley Ackerman gave the Eagles a 2–0 lead, and although Katie Kells made it 2–1 in the second period, Zace made a key save on eventual two-time ACHA player of the year Kat Hannah to keep RMC ahead. Katz scored shortly after that to restore the two- goal advantage, and Tricia Cain added a late clincher on the power play. Varner was named the most valuable player of the tournament, completing a rare double MVP season following up her Zoë M. Harris Award win. Zace captured first team All-American honors for the second year in a row, and she was joined on the top All-American tier by Kosobucki and Dana Paha. Weaver era and continued success (2008–14) The main rink at Edge Ice Arena includes the Eagles' collection of championship banners Robert Morris endured its first significant era change in 2008, as the 2004 entering class that formed much of the core responsible for the 2005 and 2007 national championships graduated (or already had, in the case of transfer players). Furthermore, Burke departed midway through the 2008–09 campaign after five-and-a-half seasons behind the Eagles bench. He was replaced on an interim basis by long-time assistant Chris Chelios (no relation to the Hockey Hall of Fame player) for the remainder of 2008–09, before Tom Robertson became the permanent replacement. If those disruptions hurt the team, it wasn't immediately apparent. The Eagles brought in a loaded recruiting class in 2008, headlined by Alaska native Ramey Weaver, North Dakota's Cassie Beckerleg and Californian Rachel Black. Those freshmen combined with underclass stars like Danielle McCutcheon and Hope Fullum to drive the program for the next few years. Despite the heavy graduations and coaching uncertainty, RMU maintained its position near the top of the ACHA during 2008–09 and 2009–10, never falling below fifth in the rankings, and making its fifth and sixth consecutive trips to the national tournament semifinals. Both seasons ended in heartbreak however, first with one more title game loss to Lindenwood, then with a narrow semifinal defeat to Michigan State. In 2010, Robert Morris joined the Central Collegiate Women's Hockey Association, ending the program's run as an independent team. With its CCWHA membership, RMU once again found itself competing for trophies with Lindenwood (which had joined the conference in 2007), although the reunion was short- lived, as the Lions left the CCWHA and the ACHA for College Hockey America and NCAA Division I after 2010–11, the Eagles' first season in the league. Still, 2010–11 was a season for the record books, literally. The Eagles added 5-11 Alberta native Mandy Dion - a Lindenwood transfer - that year, and Dion promptly posted a staggering 79 goals and 122 points, both single-season RMU records (Dion, in fact, ranks sixth in Robert Morris career scoring, despite only spending one season as a player in Chicago). McCutcheon was just behind Dion with 120 points, and would capture the Zoë M. Harris Award that season, while Weaver added 93 points as the Eagles battered most of the competition in their new league, finishing second to Lindenwood during the regular season and losing only to the Lions within the CCWHA. However, the postseason brought bitter disappointment as LU defeated RMU in the conference semifinals and the Eagles failed to escape the pool round at nationals for the first time since their inaugural 2003–04 season, after losses to eventual national champion Michigan State and an ascendant Northeastern team that would go on to win the title in 2011–12. Robert Morris found its greatest CCWHA success in 2011–12 and 2012–13 under head coach Bud Hickey, winning the league regular season championship in both seasons (with a combined CCWHA record of 29–1–4), as well as the playoff title in 2011–12, with the playoff championship largely due to the play of Staci Pomering. Pomering, a goaltender who transferred from NCAA Division III's University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point, allowed just two goals across five games against Michigan (twice), Grand Valley State, Western Michigan, and Ohio State to win tournament MVP honors. That success vaulted RMU to the top spot in the polls heading into nationals for the first time since the 2006–07 championship season, but a 1–0 semifinal loss to Minnesota on a goal in the last three minutes of regulation stalled the quest for a third national title. The Eagles were still represented well during 2011–12 awards season, however, with Weaver's 67-point campaign good enough for RMU's second straight Zoë M. Harris Award - and fourth overall, surpassing Lindenwood for the most all-time. Hickey, in his first season with the Eagles women after three with RMU's ACHA Men's Division 2 squad, was the ACHA's coach of the year, thanks largely to the team's return to prominence after the hard- to-swallow ending of 2010–11. RMU's CCWHA tournament title defense failed in 2012–13 when Maria Barlow and Michigan State shut the Eagles out 1–0 in the championship game, while Liberty ended Robert Morris' ACHA title hopes in the semifinal round for the third time in four years thanks to Carrie Jickling's goal to win a double overtime epic. The 2013–14 campaign started with a jolt as the Eagles, somewhat unexpectedly, ended up with two top players not with the team during the previous season. The first was Weaver, who had originally graduated in 2012 but returned after a year off to complete her eligibility. The other was Hayley Williams. Williams had been an NCAA Division I player at Bemidji State in 2009–10 but left the team and the sport after that season, attending the school for two more years before returning home to the Chicago area. She then volunteered to help out at Chicago Steel home games, and the USHL franchise sharing Edge Ice Arena with RMU at the time facilitated a chance meeting with a former teammate that ended with Williams resurrecting her career with the Eagles. Weaver and Williams were generally considered 2013–14's headliners (both were first team All-Americans and first team All- CCWHA selections, with Williams capturing RMU's record-extending fifth Zoë M. Harris Award), but heavy contributions from players like Chelsea Kasprick, Jessica Merritt and Madi Biluk once again made Robert Morris one of the ACHA's most explosive teams. On February 8, 2014, Robert Morris defeated Grand Valley State 4–2, in an outdoor contest as part of a multi-game event dubbed the Winter Frost Faceoff and held at MB Financial Plaza (now Parkway Bank Park) in nearby Rosemont, Illinois. The Eagles spent the entire season ranked third or fourth in the polls, and finished second in the CCWHA standings, behind a Miami team at the beginning of their own dynasty (the RedHawks would win their first national championship that season to begin a stretch of three in four years). However, things fizzled out quickly in the postseason: Michigan State and Michigan teams fighting for national tournament bids beat and tied RMU in the pool round at the CCWHA playoffs to prevent the Eagles from advancing to the semifinals, while an overtime loss to Adrian and a tie with Liberty delivered the same fate at nationals. Final RMU seasons (2014–20) Following the challenging 2014 season, RMU entered a transitional period both on the ice and on the bench. After the Eagles missed the ACHA National Tournament for the first time in program history in 2014–15, Chelios (then in a second brief stint as the team's head coach) was let go cutting a line of continuity to the program's early days. Jennifer Wilson was then hired as Chelios' replacement. Wilson was an accomplished player, including skating for the 2005–06 ECAC East championship team at Manhattanville College before playing two seasons at RMU, where she posted 49 points from 2012–14, and she had also spent time as an assistant coach with Saint Michael's College's NCAA program. Wilson began rebuilding the team with a stellar 2015 entering class that included standout defenseman Alex Nurse, cornerstone forwards Bria Berggren, Grace Dynek, and Madison Schultz, as well as a few star transfers like Allyson Zachwieja (Marian University) and Rebecca Dilley (Bethel University). That group joined a solid existing core, notably including then- rising-sophomore Makaila Anderson, who would go on to be the number eight scorer in program history, as of the end of 2017–18. Rachel Arias and Emily Urban would add offensive punch among the 2016 entries. The 2015–16 season proceeded with highs and lows typical of a young team, with highs including upsets of Michigan and Grand Valley State that boosted the Eagles to tenth in the rankings late in the season, in position to aim for a national tournament bid. The win over the Lakers was particularly noteworthy, as Dynek scored the winning goal on a 3-on-0 rush with just five seconds remaining, and GVSU wound up as the national runners-up that year. The season quickly crashed from there though - RMU not only missed nationals, but also missed the CCWHA playoffs for the first time since joining the conference, as the Eagles were edged by a single point by Davenport for the sixth and final spot. The following year saw measurable progress, as Robert Morris not only returned to the playoffs, but also upset Michigan to advance to the conference semifinals for the first time since 2013. Dynek, Berggren, Zachwieja, and Anderson all scored in the victory over the Wolverines. Wilson left for the head coach job with NCAA Division III program Buffalo State after 2016–17, and she was replaced by Sonja Novak. Novak also came highly regarded in the hockey world, thanks largely to her time as a player with Princeton University and the Czech Republic women's national ice hockey team, helping the latter to win consecutive division promotions at the 2011 IIHF Women's World Championship and 2012 IIHF Women's World Championship (including seven points in five games during the 2012 tournament). Although Novak's first season was derailed late by a slew of injuries, RMU still managed its fair share of highlights while qualifying for the CCWHA playoffs for the second consecutive year. On November 10, 2017, at its hosted ACHA showcase, the Eagles toppled fifth-ranked UMass 3–2. After trailing 2–1 into the last six minutes of the contest, Katie Merrell tied things up on the power play, then Urban capped the dramatic victory with just 33 seconds remaining. Exactly one week later, Laura Noble delivered a 34-save shutout of Michigan, supported by goals from Nurse and Abby Cardew. However, Novak departed after a single season to join Wilson's staff, after the latter had left Buffalo State for Lake Forest College. Mason Strom, notable as the leader of the successful program at Fenwick High School, succeeded Novak as RMU's coach. The Eagles largely struggled through Strom's first two seasons though, finishing sixth in the CCWHA each time. Highlights of those campaigns included a 1–0 victory over eventual ACHA National Tournament participant McKendree on December 1, 2018 on the back of a Lauren Yomantas shutout, as well as a 2–1 victory over Davenport on February 23, 2020, thanks to Arias' winning goal with 3:44 remaining that allowed the Eagles to clinch the final spot in the CCWHA playoffs. ===Roosevelt University (2020–present)=== The team will begin play as the Roosevelt Lakers for the 2020–21 season, with Strom and associate head coach Carla Pentimone continuing in their roles. ==Season by season results== {  bgcolor=\\"#ffeeaa\\"Won Championship bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\"Lost Championship bgcolor=\\"#d0e7ff\\"Regular Season Conference Champions } ===Roosevelt=== {  - align=\\"center\\" 008752;color:#ffffff;\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"80px\\" Year ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"120px\\"  Coach ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"40px\\"  W  ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"40px\\" L  ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"40px\\" T ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"80px\\" Conference ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"40px\\" Conf.

A preseason ranking was initiated beginning with 2014–15. Beginning with the 2016–17 season, the ACHA tabulated rankings each week during the season and issued them on Tuesdays following weekends including games. The ranking methodology initially used a combined human voter and computer ranking process before moving exclusively to a computer ranking for the 2018–19 season, a development that eliminated the preseason ranking. {  style=\\"white-space:nowrap;\\" - !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"100\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"Year !colspan=\\"25\\"Ranking - !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"Pre !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"1 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"2 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"3 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"4 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"5 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"6 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"7 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"8 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"9 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"10 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"11 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"12 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"13 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"14 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"15 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"16 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"17 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" !

The inaugural 2000–01 season featured teams divided into East and West Regions, with the top four from each in February's final ranking invited to nationals. For 2001–02 and 2002–03, the setup was expanded to include East, Central and West Regions. Under that system, the top two from each region were invited to nationals, along with two wild card teams. In 2003–04, RMU's inaugural year, the tournament field was expanded to 12 teams, and a national ranking was introduced. The latter development diminished the importance of the regional rankings, as the national rankings were used to determine nationals bids. Regional champions were still awarded an autobid, however, even if ranked outside of the top 12 nationally. In 2004–05, growth in the number of ACHA women's teams resulted in an increase to four regions - Northeast, Southeast, Central and West - although things reverted to East, Central and West in 2007–08. The 2009–10 season was notable both for the fact that the tournament field was reduced back to eight teams and as the final year of the regional system, which had become largely antiquated as regional champions generally had little issue placing highly in the national rankings. Robert Morris was included in the Central Region for the duration of its existence within the regional ranking system. {  style=\\"white-space:nowrap;\\" - !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"100\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"Year !colspan=\\"25\\"Ranking - !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"1 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"2 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"3 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"4 !scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"30\\"5 - style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ! 2000–01 bgcolor=FFFFFF colspan=\\"5\\" Not an ACHA member - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! 2001–02 bgcolor=FFFFFF colspan=\\"5\\" Not an ACHA member - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! 2002–03 bgcolor=FFFFFF colspan=\\"5\\" Not an ACHA member - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! 2003–04 bgcolor=FFFFFF1C bgcolor=FFE6E62C bgcolor=D8FFEB1C bgcolor=FFFFFF1C bgcolor=F2F2F2 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! 2004–05 bgcolor=FFFFFF1C bgcolor=FFFFFF1C bgcolor=FFFFFF1C bgcolor=FFFFFF1C bgcolor=F2F2F2 - style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ! 2005–06 bgcolor=FFFFFF1C bgcolor=FFFFFF1C bgcolor=FFFFFF1C bgcolor=FFFFFF1C bgcolor=F2F2F2 - style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ! 2006–07 bgcolor=FFFFFF1C bgcolor=FFFFFF1C bgcolor=FFFFFF1C bgcolor=FFFFFF1C bgcolor=F2F2F2 - style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ! 2007–08 bgcolor=FFFFFF1C bgcolor=FFFFFF1C bgcolor=FFFFFF1C bgcolor=FFFFFF1C bgcolor=F2F2F2 - style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ! 2008–09 bgcolor=FFFFFF1C bgcolor=FFE6E62C bgcolor=FFFFFF2C bgcolor=FFFFFF2C bgcolor=F2F2F2 - style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ! 2009–10 bgcolor=FFFFFF1C bgcolor=FFFFFF1C bgcolor=FFFFFF1C bgcolor=F2F2F2 bgcolor=F2F2F2 } ==ACHA national honorsAnnual awards=== All-Americans and All-Tournament selections including all seasons except 2008–09.

Robert Morris had six players selected to Team USA, all for the 2011 and 2013 tournaments. The 2011 squad, featuring Ramey Weaver, Becky Katz, and Rachel Black, finished fourth in Erzurum, Turkey by winning games against overmatched Great Britain and Turkey teams but losing to the more traditional hockey powers in Canada, Slovakia, and Finland. Even in defeat, a game against Finland during the round robin stage was likely Team USA's best moment of the tournament. In the contest, the Americans held a team featuring several members of the senior Finland women's national ice hockey team that had just won bronze medals at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics within a 3–1 score, including an empty-net goal (Venla Hovi and Annina Rajahuhta from that Finland team would go on to also win bronze medals at the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics). Weaver had four points during the tournament to tie for fifth in team scoring. Two years later, she was not only invited back to the team, but also named its captain, and was joined on the roster by Eagles Hayley Williams (who was an alternate captain) and Jessica Merritt. The trio helped Team USA to bronze medals in Trentino, Italy, a historic finish as a first medal for any American team in the modern era (USA Hockey resumed its participation in the WUG on the men's side in 2001 after a lengthy hiatus) and just the second overall, following the U.S. men in 1972 (who \\"earned\\" bronze medals by finishing third in a three-team tournament). Particularly, Weaver and Williams were among the team leaders, not only in terms of leadership roles, but also in offensive output - Weaver's eight points led all Americans, while Williams added five to rank fourth. Each contributed a point in the team's biggest win, a 4–2 victory over a Russia team featuring several Russia women's national ice hockey team members to open the tournament, while Williams (one goal, one assist) or Weaver (one assist) had a hand in every U.S. goal during a 3–1 bronze medal match win over Japan. { style=\\"text-align: center;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"100px\\"  Year ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"180px\\"  Location ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"180px\\"  Player ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"110px\\"  Result -  rowspan=\\"3\\"  2011http://www.achahockey.org/files/roster_2011_us_women.pdf  rowspan=\\"3\\"  Erzurum, Turkey  Rachel Black  rowspan=\\"3\\"  Fourth place -  Becky Katz -  Ramey Weaver -  rowspan=\\"3\\"  2013  rowspan=\\"3\\"  Trentino, Italy  Jessica Merritt  rowspan=\\"3\\"  Bronze Medal -  Ramey Weaver -  Hayley Williams } ===2010 ACHA women's select team=== As a precursor to World University Games participation, the ACHA assembled a first- of-its-kind women's select team that toured Geneva, Switzerland, Chamonix, France and Méribel, France during April 2010. The team included Weaver, as well as Eagles goaltender Ashley Miller, as RMU player representatives. Its final record overseas was 2–2–0, including two close losses to the France women's national ice hockey team and two decisive wins over local club teams. ==RivalriesDavenport=== Although there's a fair amount of contrast between the histories of the two programs, given that Davenport only started its team in 2013–14 and has yet to qualify for the ACHA National Tournament, the Lakers and Panthers have nevertheless developed a healthy feud in a relatively short time, primarily while RU was still playing as the Robert Morris Eagles. DU (along with fellow Grand Rapids, Michigan-area schools Aquinas College and Grand Valley State University) is Roosevelt's closest CCWHA competitor, and the two teams have spent much of the last few seasons jockeying for league playoff position. In 2015–16, Davenport knocked RMU out of the league playoffs for the first time ever when the Panthers pulled off a late-season upset of then-No. 4 GVSU to edge the Eagles by one point in the standings. During the season series, RMU did win five of a possible eight points from Davenport, although crucially, DU forced overtime through a Lexie Boydston goal with 22 seconds remaining on November 7, 2015. While the Eagles did go on to take that game thanks to an Abbey Revelle winner, the Panthers' point earned with the overtime loss wound up being the difference between the teams in the standings. The Eagles got the best of Davenport in that regard on other occasions. The 2014–15 regular season, for example, ended with Robert Morris as the last team in the CCWHA playoffs, one point ahead of the Panthers. This occurred in spite of the fact that DU won the only series between the teams that year - although RMU made up for that deficit with upset wins over Michigan State and Adrian. The Eagles similarly made the conference playoffs in both 2016–17 and 2017–18 while Davenport did not, although the margins were more comfortably in RMU's favor on those occasions. One of the biggest games in series history occurred on February 23, 2020, a contest that had been postponed from January 11th due to snow. The new date at the end of the regular season multiplied the drama though, as it turned out to effectively be a play-in game for the CCWHA playoffs with the winner taking the sixth and final seed and the loser seeing its season end. After Ali Sinnett and Amanda Ballestero traded goals over the first two periods, RMU's Rachel Arias propelled her team to a 2–1 win with 3:44 remaining. The teams have met once in postseason play, with Robert Morris taking a 9–3 CCWHA playoff win on February 21, 2014. Ramey Weaver scored four times for RMU, including twice in the first 10:07 of the contest and sandwiching a Madi Biluk tally, as the Eagles ran out to an early 3–0 advantage and never looked back. Through the end of the 2019–20 season, Roosevelt owns a 13–6–2 series advantage on the Panthers. ===Michigan State=== From independent national powers to CCWHA rivals, Robert Morris and Michigan State were frequently been in each other's way over stakes both large and small, and both were among the ACHA's most storied programs with a pair of national championships apiece. The first time the Eagles and Spartans met was also the most important: the 2005 national championship game, won by RMC in a 7–1 rout. Since then, however, the teams have faced off four additional times at nationals, all within a span of five years between 2009 and 2013. The first two of those, 2009 and 2010, occurred in the semifinal round. Robert Morris took the first of those by a 3–0 count, upsetting the second-ranked Spartans behind two Weaver goals and an Ashley Miller shutout. MSU got even the next year with a 2–1 win that snapped the four-year run of RMU vs. Lindenwood title games. In 2011's tournament, a 4–0 loss to MSU in the pool round helped stop the Eagles short of the semifinals for the first time in seven years en route to an eventual national championship for the Spartans, while 2013's pool round tilt went to the Eagles thanks, in part, to two Chelsea Kasprick tallies. Once Robert Morris joined the CCWHA in 2010, it gave the programs an additional venue for competition. Michigan State, however, has won all four matchups to date in the league playoffs. Two of those contests took place in the same postseason, 2013, after RMU had won the conference regular season crown (and both CCWHA titles in 2011–12). However, Spartans goalie Maria Barlow shut out the always-potent Eagles twice in the tournament - once in the pool round, then by a 1–0 count in the CCWHA championship game. The rivalry will have a decidedly different tone as the Lakers identity takes over, with Roosevelt rebuilding and MSU remaining one of the ACHA's top programs. Michigan State won the 2019–20 season series from Robert Morris by sweeping a pair of games in East Lansing, Michigan on January 25th and 26th, 2020. ===Lindenwood=== Although now essentially dormant as a result of LU's move to NCAA Division I for the 2011–12 season, the Lions and RMU ruled the ACHA's top women's division for most of the 2000s. The teams met five times during the first two seasons of Robert Morris' program, but the rivalry began in earnest during the 2005–06 season. That year, Eagles took three of four early-season meetings, but in the 2006 ACHA championship game - played at LU's home Lindenwood Ice Arena - Kristen Dlugos' goal 1:40 into overtime delivered the title for the Lions. That game kicked off a run of four straight seasons that ended with Robert Morris and Lindenwood playing each other for the title. RMU took the final victory in 2007, but the Lions emerged with the championship in 2008 and 2009, in addition to their 2006 win. The 2008 championship game was a particularly notable moment in the rivalry, as Ashley Boye assisted on both Lindenwood goals to help LU recapture the crown with a 2–1 victory at Edge Ice Arena. Boye had been a star for the Eagles during the 2004–05 and 2005–06 seasons (winning the 2005 ACHA title in the process) before departing for St. Lawrence's NCAA Division I program in 2006–07. She then returned to the ACHA for that 2007–08 season, but with Lindenwood, where she helped defeat her former team for the title on its home ice. Fortunately for Robert Morris, the transfer train ran both ways, as former Lions ace Mandy Dion headed to Chicago in 2010–11 and posted the most prolific single season in Eagles history, with 122 points. Dion would also subsequently serve as an assistant coach and recruiting coordinator at RMU for five seasons. The teams met for one final weekend in 2011–12, where Lindenwood, then in their first season as an NCAA program, swept a three-game series with RMU by 4–1, 4–1, and 6–0 scorelines. Those results gave Lindenwood an indefinite 28–11–4 series lead, although LU added a second team for the 2020–21 season following the dissolution of the team at the school's Belleville campus which will, in some sense, reboot the series during the Roosevelt era. ==PlayersCurrent roster=== As of May 15, 2020. ===Notable alumni=== *Danielle McCutcheon (2007–11) - Former player for the EHV Sabres in the Austria women's ice hockey Bundesliga and the Elite Women's Hockey League *Savannah Varner (2004–08) - Former player for Alleghe in Italian Serie A *Hayley Williams (2013–14) – Player for SK Gorny in the Russian Women's Hockey League; former player for the Toronto Furies of the Canadian Women's Hockey League (CWHL), the Brampton Thunder of the CWHL, and the Buffalo Beauts of the National Women's Hockey League, and a participant in the 1st NWHL All-Star Game ==See also== *American Collegiate Hockey Association *Central Collegiate Women's Hockey Association *Edge Ice Arena *Roosevelt University *Robert Morris University Illinois ==References== Hockey, Women's Category:Ice hockey teams in Illinois Category:American Collegiate Hockey Association ","title":"Roosevelt Lakers women's ice hockey"},{"id":"56823830","text":"Diuris amplissima, commonly called the giant donkey orchid is a species of orchid that is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It is a rare species and the largest Diuris in Western Australia. It has two or three leaves at its base and up to seven purple and dull yellowish-brown flowers on a tall flowering stem. ==Description== Diuris amplissima is a tuberous, perennial herb, usually growing to a height of with two or three leaves emerging at the base, each leaf long and wide. There are between three and seven purple and dull yellowish-brown flowers long and wide. The dorsal sepal is erect, long and wide and oval to kidney-shaped (wider than long). The lateral sepals are linear to sword-shaped, green with purplish marks, long, wide, turned downwards and usually parallel to each other. The petals are more or less erect with an elliptic to oval blade long and wide on a purplish-brown stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is wedge-shaped, long, wide and the side lobes are asymmetric egg-shaped, long and wide with wavy or crinkled edges. There is a ridge-like callus in the mid- line of the base of the labellum. Flowering occurs from September to November. ==Taxonomy and naming== Diuris amplissima was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected near Moodiarrup, and the description was published in Australian Orchid Review. The specific epithet (amplissima) is a Latin word meaning \\"largest\\", referring to the \\"impressive flowers\\". ==Distribution and habitat== The giant donkey orchid grows in woodland and forest between Porongurup and Capel in the Avon Wheatbelt, Jarrah Forest and Mallee biogeographic regions.

In her time and place, she was the first woman ordained by the Hawaiian Evangelical Association, and the only woman Christian minister in the Territory of Hawaii. Her pastorate was primarily on the Islands of Maui and Molokai, where she helped restore the Siloama Church. Her childhood and young adult church life had been at Kawaiahaʻo Church in Honolulu, and the board of directors of that church later offered her the position of Kahu (pastor). ==Background== She was born in Honolulu, the Kingdom of Hawaii, to Native Hawaiian mother Kuhilani Awai Kanaina (1861–1930), and Swedish sea captain father Andrew A. Rosehill (1851–1913) . Her siblings were sisters Minnie, Inez, Emma, and brothers Edward, Joseph, Francis and William. A stepbrother Frederick was from her mother's first marriage.; Educated at Kaahumanu Elementary and Kawaiahao Seminary for Girls, she was employed as a book binder at the Advertiser Publishing Company in Honolulu when she met Maui sheriff Peter Noa Kahokuoluna. They were married in 1912 in the home of Kahu (pastor) Henry Hodges Parker of Kawaiahaʻo Church. ==Call to the ministry== The Kahokuolunas were devout Christians, who kept their ties to Kawaiahaʻo Church in Honolulu. Encouraged by the church kahu Akaiko Akana, Alice attended Auburn Theological Seminary and Andover Newton Theological School. She was called in 1923 to shepherd Wananalua Congregational Church in Hana, Maui. Advocating the church as a positive factor in the community, Kahokuoluna encouraged congregational involvement in local sports activities, scouting, music and other social outlets. Although she was a licensed minister, she had never been ordained. At the request of the congregants, the Hawaiian Evangelical Association officially ordained her into the ministry in 1925, the first woman the organization had ever admitted into the clergy. She became pastor of Wainee Church that same year. Her husband Peter died in 1926 after a lengthy illness. When Akana died in 1933, the board of trustees of Kawaiahaʻo Church offered the position to Alice, noting that she was the only ordained woman Christian minister in Hawaii, but she did not accept the position.; On December 1, 1933, Kawaiahao held a year-end \\"Praise Service\\", with Alice delivering a Hawaiian language sermon. The Siloama Church body of Christians had been formed at Kalawao, Molokai in 1866, by exiled people afflicted with leprosy. The Hawaiian Board of Missions erected the actual building in 1871. Over the years, the building fell into disrepair, and Congregationalists erected Kanaana Hou, the Church of New Canaan, at a different Molokai location in 1915. In 1938, Alice accepted a call to be pastor of the Siloama-Kanaana Hou churches, and spearheaded a drive to raise funds and restore the old Siloama Church. While searching through the abandoned ruins, Alice and Floyd McHenry, a naturalist affiliated with the Bishop Museum, discovered a vault beneath its foundation. Therein, they found its original 1866 record book. That discovery inspired Hawaiian historian Ethel Moseley Damon to write a book on history of the church. Japan's 1941 Attack on Pearl Harbor, and the United States entry into World War II, caused a shortage of needed building supplies for the restoration effort. However, the efforts continued, and the restored Siloama was re-dedicated in 1948. Thereafter the congregants of Kanaana Hou Church worshiped at Siloama one Sunday each month. ==Final years== Her efforts at Molokai drew support from other churches and individuals in Hawaii. The choir she had organized participated in a congregational convention in 1951. She never remarried or had any children of her own. For all her years of being in service to leprosy patients, she never contracted the disease herself. But by the end of her life, she was known as \\"Mother Alice\\" on Molokai for her selfless caring of others. No one who needed her was turned away, no matter the hour of the day or night. She was said to be \\"a Hawaiian of quiet distinction, a vigorous, understanding woman of conviction and courage, but with a saving smile in her eyes ... \\" Upon her 1957 death of cancer, a bronze plaque was created by Kanaana Hou Church to commemorate her life's service. == Notes ReferencesSources== * ==Further reading== * * ==External links== * Category:1888 births Category:1957 deaths Category:People of the Territory of Hawaii Category:Hawaiian Kingdom people Category:Native Hawaiian people ","title":"Alice Kahokuoluna"},{"id":"56824159","text":"Diamanté Quiava Valentin Harper (born July 2, 1994), known professionally as Saweetie (), is an American rapper.

The term was first publicised by Rudolph Peters in his Croonian Lecture of 1951. == Lethal Synthesis of Methylglyoxal == A 1971 study published by the Harvard Medical School identified methylglyoxal, a form of glycerol, as a product of lethal synthesis in a specific E.coli mutant. In E.coli, the synthesis of triose phosphate from glycerol is a reaction regulated by the synthesis rate of glycerol kinase and by feedback inhibition by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. The study demonstrated that, in E.coli mutants that had lost both control mechanisms, glycerol kinase no longer reacted to feedback regulation and instead produced the cytotoxic methylglyoxal. A more recent review of research done on methylglyoxal metabolism concluded that the compound's cytotoxic nature is dependent on its ability to form advanced glycation end products (AGEs). These compounds, which are thought to be factors in ageing and in the progression of degenerative diseases, have been shown to hinder the functions of the proteins they target. ==References== Category:Metabolism Category:Toxins ","title":"Lethal synthesis"},{"id":"56824202","text":"The Estelline Bandstand and Gazebo Park, at 105 N.

On April 14, 1994, the wrecks of the Spencer and the Amboy were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. ==History== The George Spencer in dry dock The George Spencer (Official number 85849) was built in 1884 by the Thomas Quayle & Sons Shipyard in Cleveland, Ohio. She was built for Thomas Wilson of Cleveland, Ohio. She had an overall length of , she was long between her perpendiculars, her beam was wide and her cargo hold was deep. She was powered by a 625-horsepower fore and aft compound engine which was fueled by a coal burning Scotch marine boiler. She had a gross tonnage of 1360.75 tons and a net tonnage of 1082.79 tons. She was used to haul bulk cargoes such as iron ore, coal and grain. She was also one of the first vessels to load iron ore in Two Harbors, Minnesota when the port opened in 1884. In 1888 the Spencer was sold to B.L. Pennington (Lockwood Taylor & Company). In 1889 the Spencer was transferred Lockwood Taylor Hardware Company (2/3) and B. F. Powers (1/3). On 8 August, 1894 she rescued the crew of the steamer () from lifeboats after their ship burned in Lake Superior the night before. In 1895 she was transferred to the Commercial Transit Company. In 1899 the Spencer was sold to the Tonawanda Iron & Steel Company of Tonawanda, New York. On September 9, 1901, the Spencer was sailing down the west channel of the Niagara River when she grounded at the head of Little Island. When she was freed she was towed by the tugs that freed her to a dock. The 1,400 tons of iron ore that was in the Spencer cargo hold was consigned to the Tonawanda Iron & Steel Plant. The Spencer's grounding was caused by low water levels in the river. ==Final voyage== On the day of November 28, 1905 the Spencer and the Amboy were bound from Buffalo, New York for Duluth, Minnesota with a cargo of coal when they were struck by the full force of the Mataafa Storm. After the storm blew itself out it was discovered that 18 ships were wrecked or stranded; and one, the steamer Ira H. Owen was lost with all hands. The crew of the Spencer cut the line between her and the Amboy in an attempt to save both of the ships. Both vessels were driven ashore. The crew of the ships escaped the vessels with a breeches' buoy which was rigged up by some nearby fishermen. A December 1, 1905 issue of the Duluth Evening Herald described the wreck of the Spencer and the Amboy: > Both boats lost their bearings in the snowstorm and landed on a sandy beach. > As soon as they struck, buoys with lines were thrown over the side. When > they floated ashore they were caught by fishermen and made fast. With an > improvised life buoy rigged in the hawsers the entire crew were taken safely > to shore preceded by Mrs. Harry Lawe, wife of the mate, who was acting as > steward. The vessels ran on the rocks Tuesday morning, and for thirteen > hours the situation of the crew on the battered hulks was desperate. > Fishermen rushed into the surf almost to their necks and aided the sailors > to escape. The Spencer cargo can be lightered but there is little hope for > saving the boat. The vessels were coming up without cargo to load ore. Capt. > Frank Conland sailed the Spencer and Fred Watson was master of the Amboy. > The Spencer was valued at $35,000 and the Amboy at $10,000. A December 6, 1905 issue of the Duluth News Tribune wrote about the assessment of the wrecks: > Captain C.O. Flynn returned last evening from an inspection of the stranded > steamer George Spencer and schooner Amboy. He said \\"the schooner Amboy is a > total wreck ... the steamer Spencer is still in good shape. Her hatches are > intact, and she does not appear to be seriously damaged. As to the condition > of her bottom that cannot be told at present. ==The George Spencer today== The remains of the George Spencer lies off the beach and about one mile south of Sugar Loaf Cove, the quarter mile long stretch of beach is crescent shaped and blends from the large cobbles on the north to the sand on the south section of the beach. Even though much of her hull was removed there are still large bits of her hull on the site. Her wreck is a lot more intact than that of the Amboy. The wreckage of the Spencer consists of a long section of the base of her wooden hull from the turn of the bilge down. Her hull lies perpendicular to the beach. A piece of her hull, possibly the bow lies in of water and about from the beach. Her stern lies in . ==References *George Spencer (Propeller), 18 Feb 1892 *George Spencer (Propeller), 23 Mar 1899 *George Spencer (Propeller), aground, 28 Nov 1905 *George Spencer historic photos *Mixstory 1905 *More historic photos of the George Spencer Category:1884 ships Category:Maritime incidents in 1905 Category:Great Lakes freighters Category:Steamships of the United States Category:Merchant ships of the United States Category:Shipwrecks of Lake Superior Category:Shipwrecks on the National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota Category:Protected areas of Cook County, Minnesota Category:Shipwrecks of the Minnesota coast Category:Ships built in Cleveland ","title":"SS George Spencer"},{"id":"56824318","text":"Robert Mihai Geantă (born 7 April 1997) is a Romanian professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for CSM Focșani.

As of August 2020, the business was closed. Operation had been suspended due to financial problems encountered by Genting HK because of the slowdown in the cruise ship industry caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The company was awaiting funds from Germany’s Economic Stabilization Fund to reopen. Genting hoped to receive 570 million Euros. ==History== The company was originated in Genting Hong Kong's purchase in April 2016 of three shipyards from Nordic Yards, located in Wismar, Stralsund, and Rostock- Warnemünde. The yards were initially combined with Lloyd Werft, previously purchased by Genting, to form the Lloyd Werft Group, but in July 2016 the three eastern ex-Nordic yards were organized into MV Werften, headquartered in Wismar and led by Jarmo Laakso. In August 2016, MV Werften's first newbuild vessels, two river cruise ships of the Rhine class named Crystal Bach and Crystal Mahler, were laid down at the Wismar shipyard. In November, Genting Hong Kong publicized further plans for its shipbuilding plans at MV Werften-- four river cruise vessels for Crystal Cruises under the Crystal River Cruises brand to be delivered in 2017 and 2018, followed by a 20,000 GT Endeavor class yacht annually for Crystal Yacht Cruises in 2019--2021, with Dream Cruises receiving a Global class cruise ship in 2020 and a sister ship the flowing year. At full capacity post-2021, the three shipyards are planned to be able to build two vessels of both the Endeavor and Global classes annually. Rostock shipyard with Global Dream under construction Facility in Wismar The first Rhine class vessel, Crystal Bach, was delivered in August 2017, followed by Crystal Mahler in September. In January 2018, shipbuilding began at the Stralsund shipyard with a ceremony for the first steelcutting in the construction of Crystal Endeavor, the first Endeavor class yacht. In March, construction of the first Global class ship began, with components to be built at both the Rostock and Wismar yards and the vessel assembled in Wismar. In December 2019, Genting Hong Kong announced that MV Werften would build a new class of mid-size cruise ships, named the Universal class, which would measure 88,000 gross tons with a capacity for 2,000 passengers. The first ship of the class was scheduled for delivery in late 2022, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic MV Werften closed temporarily in March 2020, which delayed the expected deliveries of both Universal and Global class vessels. In July 2020, MV Werften received €175 million in financial aid from a consortium of commercial and state sources, which was expected to keep the shipyard solvent until an expected federal aid package of up to €570 million later in the year. In October, MV Werften received a €193 million loan from the German federal government's Economic Stabilisation Fund, which allowed for the resumption of work that month on Crystal Endeavor, with a target of a March 2021 delivery, and Global Dream. ==Facilities== MV Werften's largest shipyard is in Rostock, with of total space, of which is covered. When Genting Hong Kong purchased the yard, it had a single shipbuilding hall measuring long by wide, with an interior clearance of .

A field effect is the polarization of a molecule through space. The effect is a result of an electric field produced by charge localization in a molecule. This field, which is substituent and conformation dependent, can influence structure and reactivity by manipulating the location of electron density in bonds and/or the overall molecule. The polarization of a molecule through its bonds is a separate phenomenon known as induction. Field effects are relatively weak, and diminish rapidly with distance, but have still been found to alter molecular properties such as acidity.Field effect on a carbonyl arising from the dipole in a C-F bond. == Field sources == 180x180pxA bicyclooctance acid with an electron-withdrawing substituent, X, at the 4-position experiences the same field effect on the acidic proton from the C-X bond dipole as the related bicylcoheptane. Field effects can arise from the electric dipole field of a bond containing an electronegative atom or electron-withdrawing substituent, as well as from an atom or substituent bearing a formal charge. The directionality of a dipole, and concentration of charge, can both define the shape of a molecule's electric field which will manipulate the localization of electron density toward or away from sites of interest, such as an acidic hydrogen. Field effects are typically associated with the alignment of a dipole field with respect to a reaction center. Since these are through space effects, the 3D structure of a molecule is an important consideration. A field may be interrupted by other bonds or atoms before propagating to a reactive site of interest. Atoms of differing electronegativities can move closer together resulting in bond polarization through space that mimics the inductive effect through bonds. Bicycloheptane and bicyclooctane (seen left) are two compounds in which the change in acidity with substitution was attributed to the field effect. The C-X dipole is oriented away from the carboxylic acid group, and can draw electron density away because the molecule center is empty, with a low dielectric constant, so the electric field is able to propagate with minimal resistance. == Utility of effect == A dipole can align to stabilize or destabilize the formation or loss of a charge, thereby decreasing (if stabilized) or increasing (if destabilized) the activation barrier to a chemical event. Field effects can therefore tune the acidity or basicity of bonds within their fields by donating or withdrawing charge density. With respect to acidity, a common trend to note is that, inductively, an electron-withdrawing substituent in the vicinity of an acidic proton will lower the pKa (i.e. increase the acidity) and, correspondingly, an electron-donating substituent will raise the pKa. The reorganization of charge due to field effects will have the same result. An electric dipole field propagated through the space around, or in the middle of, a molecule in the direction of an acidic proton will decrease the acidity, while a dipole pointed away will increase the acidity and concomitantly elongate the X-H bond. These effects can therefore help to tune the acidity/basicity of a molecule to protonate/deprotonate a specific compound, or enhance hydrogen bond-donor ability for molecular recognition or anion sensing applications. Field effects have also been shown in substituted arenes to dominate the electrostatic potential maps, which are maps of electron density used to explain intermolecular interactions. == Evidence for field effects == 180x180px Localized electronic effects are a combination of inductive and field effects. Due to the similarity in these effects, it is difficult to separate their contributions to the electronic structure of a molecule. There is, however, a large body of literature devoted to developing an understanding of the relative significance of induction and field effects by analyzing related compounds in an attempt to quantify each effect based on the present substituents and molecular geometry. For example, the three compounds to the right, all octanes, differ only in the number of linkers between the electron withdrawing group X and an acidic functional group, which are approximately the same spatial distance apart in each compound. It is known that an electron-withdrawing substituent will decrease the pKa of a given proton (i.e. increase the acidity) inductively. If induction was the dominant effect in these compounds, acidity should increase linearly with the number of available inductive pathways (linkers). However, the experimental data shows that effect on acidity in related octanes and cubanes is very similar, and therefore the dominant effect must be through space.179x179px 180x180pxIn the cis-11,12-dichloro-9,10-dihydro-9,10-ethano-2-anthroic acid syn and anti isomers seen below and to the left, the chlorines provide a field effect. The concentration of negative charge on each chlorine has a through space effect which can be seen in the relative pKa values. When the chlorines are pointed over the carboxylic acid group, the pKa is higher because loss of a proton is less favorable due to the increase in negative charge in the area. Loss of a proton results in a negative charge which is less stable if there is already an inherent concentration of electrons. This can be attributed to a field effect because in the same compound with the chlorines pointed away from the acidic group the pKa is lower, and if the effect were inductive the conformational position would not matter.200x200px 200x200px == References == Category:Chemical properties Category:Chemistry Category:Electrostatics Category:Electromagnetism Category:Matter Category:Molecular physics Category:Molecules Category:Physical chemistry ","title":"Field effect (chemistry)"},{"id":"56824578","text":"Bang Lamphu or spelled Banglampoo and Banglamphu (, ; in the past, it was often misspelled บางลำภู) is a neighbourhood in Bangkok located in Phra Nakhon District. The history of the Bang Lamphu community dates to the establishment of the Rattanakosin Kingdom, or earlier. Bang Lamphu covers an area north of Phra Nakhon in Rattanakosin Island from Phra Athit Road to Samsen Road, which leads toward Dusit District. ==History== The name \\"Bang Lamphu\\" can mean area of mangrove apple (lamphu is Thai for mangrove apple). Mangrove apples (Sonneratia caseolaris) once flourished along waterways in the area, including the Khlong Bang Lamphu and Chao Phraya River. There are no more mangrove apple trees in the local Santi Chai Prakan Park, since the last one died in 2012 from 2011 Thailand floods, but the name Bang Lamphu is still commonly used to describe the area. Bang Lamphu became a community prior to the Rattanakosin period. It is the residence of royalty, courtiers, vassals and citizens of many ethnic groups, including Thai, Chinese, Mon and Muslims who settled in the vicinity. Once the Khlong Rop Krung canal was excavated, a pier was established at Bang Lamphu by which goods such as vegetables and fruits could be transported from the Thonburi side. Bang Lamphu also became a major market for overland trade via the Khaosan Road and a number of other roads. The community is home to likay dancers and Thai musicians and is the birthplace of Montri Tramote, a Thai musician recognized as \\"master of Thai classical music\\" and National Artist of Performing arts (Thai music). Bang Lamphu has become a popular tourist destination, especially for Westerners. The Khaosan and Rambuttri Roads feature tourist attractions. Accommodations and dining are available including guest houses, hostels, restaurants, street foods, bars, cafés, clothes, and travel agencies including Thai massage services. For Thai people, Bang Lamphu is also considered to be a hub for notable school uniform stores. Bang Lamphu, especially Sip Sam Hang Road, the area opposite Wat Bowonniwet Vihara considered as a center of teenagers in 1950s–60s, like Wang Burapha. Since it was home to many restaurants including cafés and ice cream parlours that offer jukebox and television, which was are rare appliances in those days. Hence, Bang Lamphu and Sip Sam Hang Road was cited in the 1997 Thai heroic bloodshed film Dang Bireley's and Young Gangsters as a backdrop for the characters in street gang battles. ==Interesting PlacesTransportation== * MRT Purple Line: Bang Khun Phrom Station (future extension) *BMTA bus: route A4, S1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 30, 32, 33, 43, 47, 53, 56, 59, 64, 65, 68, 70, 82, 127, 503, 516, 524 *Khlong Bang Lamphu Boat Service: Bang Lamphu Pier (under Norarat Sathan Bridge) *Chao Phraya Express Boat: Phra Arthit Pier (N13) == References  *Banglamphu in Lonely Planet Category:Neighbourhoods of Bangkok Category:Phra Nakhon District Category:Tourist attractions in Bangkok ","title":"Bang Lamphu"},{"id":"56824588","text":"The European Association for Studies in Screen Translation (ESIST) is an international association in the field of audiovisual translation.Díaz Cintas, J.

He emigrated to South Australia late in 1859 or early 1860, following his brother, the Rev. C. E. Palmer. :Charles Edwin Palmer had arrived from Warrington with his wife Carlotte, née Palin, in 1858 to take charge of the Glenelg Independent Church on the Bay Road, then quickly established the new Glenelg Congregational Church on Jetty Road opposite Nile Street, completed in 1859, and was its first minister. He decided however to leave the Congregational Church for the Church of England, and left for England to be ordained, leaving the Glenelg church without a pastor, a failed Sunday School, a dwindling congregation and a great debt to repay, a situation that was only reversed with the incumbency of Charles Manthorpe. C. E. Palmer was in 1861 ordained curate of Trinity Church, Hartlepool. It was arranged by John Lorenzo Young, head master of Adelaide Educational Institution that during his extended absence in 1860 Palmer would take his maths classes and the senior class in classics. He was remembered by one student as aloof and disconnected from his pupils, not at all likeable, and with the voice of someone with a perpetual sinus infection. Another remembers him as an object of ridicule and subject of students' pranks. Between January and May 1860 he wrote a series of articles for the South Australian Register over the pen-name \\"A Templar\\": *Torrens Title *The Party System *Early History of Australia *The Office of Attorney General *The Late Commissioner of Insolvency Palmer established a legal practice at Auburn, then in 1863 moved to Kapunda, where he maintained an office for the rest of his life, and had an extensive business for some time. He also maintained an office in the Town Hall Chambers, Adelaide. Henry Charles Hamilton Ayliffe (18 June 1846 – 10 March 1916) was articled clerk to Palmer at the time of his death. In 1870, following a petition by residents, Palmer agreed to stand for the seat of The Burra at the forthcoming election, but at the poll he was betrayed by his proponents, and received very few votes, the elected candidates being Captain John Hart and Charles Mann. It appeared the urging to join the contest was in the nature of a \\"lark\\" or practical joke. Palmer was found dead in his bed at the Pilot Boat Hotel, Port Pirie, on Monday morning. A coronial inquest determined the cause of death as apoplexy, and not suicide. Palmer never married and had no children. His brother Rev.

Completed in 1916, the eight-story brick building is notable for its association with the Osgood Bradley Car Company, an early manufacturer of both railroad cars and automobiles. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. ==Description and history== The Osgood Bradley Building is located east of downtown Worcester, set close to Interstate 291 on the west side of Grafton Street at Franklin Street. It is an eight-story masonry structure, built with a concrete frame, and an exterior finished in concrete, brick, terra cotta, and marble. The main facade is ten bays wide, with two building entrances, four retail spaces between them, and two outer bays with windows only. The lower two floors are set off from the upper floors by a dentillated cornice, with medallions at the tops of the piers between the bays. The outer two bays have segmented-arch openings on the second floor, while the inner bays have bays with two pairs of sash windows separated by piers. Central piers on the upper floors are finished in red brick, in contrast to the pale concrete and terra cotta of the most of the facade. The Osgood Bradley Company was founded in 1820, and originally manufactured stage coaches, carriages, and wagons. In the 1830s, it branched out into the manufacture of railroad cars, one of the earliest manufacturers to do so. In 1835, it developed the Grafton Street property with a factory for rail car manufacture. The facility produced them until 1909, except during the American Civil War, when production was converted to gun carriages and forges. Following the relocation of its rail car business, the company tore down the factory and built this industrial facility as a speculative venture to lease to other manufacturers. It retained William Timmis, an industrial architect from New York City to design the building. During World War II, businesses occupying the building manufactured proximity fuses for use in munitions. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in northwestern Worcester, Massachusetts *National Register of Historic Places listings in Worcester County, Massachusetts ==References== Category:Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts Category:Buildings and structures in Worcester, Massachusetts Category:National Register of Historic Places in Worcester, Massachusetts ","title":"Osgood Bradley Building"},{"id":"56824897","text":"Zhang Yu (; born 7 May 1994) is a Chinese footballer who currently plays for China League One club Changchun Yatai, on loan from Chinese Super League side Beijing Sinobo Guoan. ==Club career== Zhang Yu started his professional football career in 2012 when he registered for Beijing Youth, which was the U18 team of Chinese Super League side Beijing Guoan, for 2012 China League Two.

The 1899 publication of the Palgrave- macmillan Dictionary of Political Economy lists Diehl second when listing authors who have contributed \\"critical works on the life and doctrine of Proudhon.\\" Christian Gehrke lists Karl Diehl first, when listing the main, European adherents of David Ricardo's economics, in the fourth-quarter of nineteenth-century academia. ===On the Origin of Anarchism=== In 1890, Diehl came to realize that William Godwin was the father of the Anarchist movement and theory, early sparking his interest in this area of thought. This may mean he is the first to attempt to suggest that Anarchism was born out of the coldly-logical, rights-based political theory in Britain, instead of what was traditionally believed by historians, namely, that Anarchism was an outgrowth of the terrorism and disorder of the hot-blooded French Revolution. ===On the Theory of Price and Value in Germany=== Diehl was well-esteemed by economists by his contributions to the development of the Theory of Price and Value in Germany in the nineteenth century, based on his contributions to Festchrift. ===On the German Anarchist Movement=== Diehl in well-quoted in Anarchist publications regarding Anarchism in Germany. He is quoted by one editor in a volume on German Anarchism as saying... > Anarchist ideas evoked a certain amount of theoretical interest and > discussion. But the anarchist movement in Germany never achieved any > significant political activity, nor did the group organizations at any time > approach a numerical size which could be considered important. ===On Planned Economy=== Diehl's theories regarding Socialist planned economy eventually turned out to be useful \\"to those Soviet economists who dealt actually with the questions of the theory of rent in their own country.\\" ==External links== * Works of Karl Diehl (English) * Works of Karl Diehl (German) ==References== Category:Heidelberg University faculty Category:University of Freiburg faculty Category:Anarchist theorists Category:Anarchist economics Category:Historians of anarchism Category:German male non-fiction writers Category:German political writers Category:1864 births Category:1943 deaths Category:German economists ","title":"Karl Diehl (economist)"},{"id":"56824911","text":"is the former Head coach of the Sendai 89ers in the Japanese B.League. ==Head coaching record== -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Toyota Antelopes  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2012-13  29227 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"2nd633  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Runners-up -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Toyota Antelopes  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2013-14  33267 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"2nd312  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"3rd -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Toyota Antelopes  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2014-15  302010 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"4th202  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"4th -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Sendai 89ers  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2017  281315 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Fired---  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"- - - ==References== Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:Akita Isuzu/Isuzu Motors Lynx/Giga Cats players Category:Japanese basketball coaches Category:Rizing Zephyr Fukuoka coaches Category:Sendai 89ers coaches ","title":"Toshihiro Goto"},{"id":"56824915","text":"Barrington DeVaughn Hendricks (born October 22, 1989), known professionally as JPEGMafia (stylized as JPEGMAFIA), is an American rapper, singer and record producer from Baltimore, Maryland. His 2018 album Veteran, released through Deathbomb Arc, received widespread critical acclaim and was featured on many year-end lists. It was followed by 2019's All My Heroes Are Cornballs, released to further critical acclaim. ==Early life and education== Hendricks was born in Flatbush, Brooklyn, to Jamaican parents. He spent the majority of his childhood in Flatbush, before moving to Alabama at age 13, where he says he experienced a significant amount of racism which later had a great effect on his music. Hendricks moved to Louisiana and enlisted in the United States Air Force at age 18. He served a tour of duty in Iraq and also spent time in Kuwait, Germany, Japan, and North Africa, before being honorably discharged. Though he previously claimed to have a master's degree in journalism, Hendricks has since clarified that, though having studied the subject while deployed, he was not officially awarded a degree. ==Career== Hendricks developed an interest in music production at the age of 15, and he began producing after he learned how to sample. While in the military, he created his YouTube channel joechillworld in July 2009 where he uploaded his beats, songs and music videos. During his military stay in Japan, he was producing and writing music under the name Devon Hendryx. In the military, he met fellow rapper and producer Enso Sinatra. They made music together and formed the group Ghost~Pop. In 2015, he moved to Baltimore, where he began to make music under his moniker JPEGMafia, under which he released his mixtape Communist Slow Jams in April 2015. Only a month later, he released his mixtape Darkskin Manson which was inspired by the Freddie Gray protests in Baltimore that were happening right as he had moved there. Following a number of mixtapes, Hendricks released his debut studio album, Black Ben Carson, in February 2016 via Deathbomb Arc featuring a much harsher, distorted sound than his other projects. Four months later, he released a collaborative EP with fellow Baltimore-based rapper Freaky titled The 2nd Amendment. Hendricks moved from Baltimore to Los Angeles for his next studio album. In January 2018, he released his second studio album Veteran. In an article on Bandcamp, he said \\"I wanted to show I'm not just a one-trick pony. I always do weird shit. I usually just keep it to myself. This time, I just let the filter go.\\" At the time of its release, Veteran was considered JPEGMafia's most experimental album to date, receiving widespread critical acclaim. After the release of Veteran, Hendricks started working on his next album. He recorded 93 songs, and whittled it down to 18 tracks. He mixed and mastered it at the end of Vince Staples' tour, posting percentage updates frequently on his Instagram. Prior to the release, he would label the project as a \\"disappointment\\" in interviews and his social media. The first single from the album, \\"Jesus Forgive Me, I Am a Thot\\", was released on August 13, 2019. He promoted the album by uploading a series of listening sessions to his YouTube channel where his friends were discussing and reacting to the album. All My Heroes Are Cornballs was released on September 13, 2019 to further critical acclaim, and was his first album to chart. In October 2019, he embarked on the JPEGMafia Type Tour to support his new album. In March 2020, Hendricks started a weekly vlog series on his YouTube channel called HTBAR (How To Build A Relationship). The series feature JPEGMafia talking to other artists and friends about various topics, mostly about music, life and politics. Each episode's soundtrack consist of unreleased songs, demos and instrumentals produced by JPEGMafia. Artists that have featured on the vlog series include Danny Brown, Kenny Beats, Lykke Li, Orville Peck, Saba and more. Hendricks has appeared on The Cave, a YouTube Series made by Kenny Beats. Hendricks has appeared on the September 30th 2020 episode of All Elite Wrestling's AEW Dynamite as a spokesman for AEW wrestler Darby Allin. {{cite web  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zufi4ONQTaM Hendricks has cited Kanye West, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Throbbing Gristle, MF DOOM, Lil B, SpaceGhostPurrp, Chief Keef, Hanson, Ice Cube, and The Backstreet Boys as influences. ==Personal life== Hendricks currently lives in Los Angeles, California. ==Discography== ;Studio albums * Black Ben Carson (2016) * Veteran (2018) * All My Heroes Are Cornballs (2019) ==References *Official website Category:African-American male rappers Category:Alternative hip hop musicians Category:American army personnel of the Iraq War Category:American hip hop record producers Category:Avant-garde musicians Category:East Coast hip hop musicians Category:Hardcore hip hop artists Category:People from Flatbush, Brooklyn Category:Indie rappers Category:Living people Category:Rappers from Baltimore Category:Underground rappers Category:1989 births Category:21st- century American rappers Category:21st-century American male musicians Category:American musicians of Jamaican descent ","title":"JPEGMafia"},{"id":"56824938","text":"Melissiatika railway station () is a suburban railway station in Volos in Thessaly, Greece.

Smith was active as an artist in Lynchburg, Virginia in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In 1895 she and Bernhard Gutmann founded the Lynchburg Art League. During the 1890s she studied art in Paris for two years, and during that same decade she became chairman of the art department at Randolph-Macon Woman's College. A cousin of the institution's first president, William Waugh Smith, she held that \\"the only way to develop taste in art is to study paintings frequently, seriously, and at leisure,\\" and it was she who suggested William Merritt Chase as the artist for his formal portrait, presented to the school in 1907 by the senior class of that year. The first art professor on the college's faculty, it was she who instigated the purchase of Men of the Docks by George Bellows in 1920, an event which marked the foundation of the school's Maier Museum of Art. It was also under her direction that the college held its First Annual Exhibition in 1911, believed to be the first exhibition of modern art held on a college campus anywhere in the United States. Furthermore, in 1893 Smith opened her lectures to the women of Lynchburg, which one source claims may have been the first organized system of adult education in Virginia. During her academic career Smith also taught French at the College, and invited prominent artists of her acquaintance to come and speak to the student body. At her death she was buried in the Warrenton Cemetery in Warrenton, Virginia. Smith's pupils included Georgia Weston Morgan, herself to become a prominent figure in Lynchburg's artistic scene. ==References== Category:1868 births Category:1928 deaths Category:American women painters Category:19th-century American painters Category:19th-century American women artists Category:20th-century American painters Category:20th-century American women artists Category:People from Lynchburg, Virginia Category:Painters from Virginia Category:Randolph College faculty ","title":"Louise Jordan Smith"},{"id":"56824962","text":"Paul Hodea (born 29 June 1998) is a Romanian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder.

She was a daughter of the physician and surgeon, William Heath Byford, of Chicago, Illinois. He was the founder and president of the Woman's Medical College of Chicago. ==Career== In 1889, Leonard was appointed sanitary inspector, being the first woman who ever held that position, and was enabled to carry out many of the needed reforms It was through her instrumentality, aided by the other five women on the force, that the eight-hour law was enforced, providing that children under fourteen years of age should not work more than eight hours a day. That was enforced in all dry-goods stores. Through her endeavors seats were placed in the stores and factories, and the employers were instructed that the girls were to be allowed to sit when not occupied with their duties. She was enabled to accomplish this through the fact that the physicians and women of Chicago were ready to sustain her, and the other fact that her position as a sanitary inspector of the health department made her an officer of the police force, thus giving her authority for any work she found necessary to do. As a result of this eight- hour law, schools were established in some of the stores from eight to ten a. m.. giving the younger children, who would spend that time on the street, two hours of solid schooling. In 1891, Leonard was made president of the Woman's Canning and Preserving Company, which, after one short year from its organization, she left with a factory, four stories and basement, with a working capital of .

Although Harvards were mostly used by the RAF as trainers or target tugs, the aircraft of 1340 Flt in Kenya were armed with bombs and a machine-gun, for operations against the Mau Mau in Kenya in the early 1950s. ==HistoryFirst formation=== RAAF in 1943 1340 Flt was first formed c1945 at the Indian Air Force base at Sulur, Kerala State, India. It was equipped with three Vultee Vengeance Mk. IIIs and a Harvard IIB. The flight was formed to carry out trials of mustard gas attacks for the Chemical Defence Research Department (India) (CDRD, now at Porton Down, Wiltshire), in preparation for expected similar attacks by the Japanese, who had already used it during the Second Sino-Japanese war.Danny42C (12 September 2012, 20:28).

The flight was nominally under the control of 225 Group in Bangalore, part of Air Headquarters, RAF India, but flew under the direction of CDRD. Operations The Vengeances dropped 65-lb canisters and 500 lb clusters of mustard gas, and also sprayed it on Indian troops on the ground to test anti-gas protection such as gas capes and footwear. The unprotected troops, who may have been unaware of the danger, suffered many burns and blisters. The flight transferred to from Sulur to Cannonore (Kannur), Kerala State on 11 October 1945, where an airstrip was created on the maidan, a large public area overlooking the sea. There were two trials ranges, at Kumbla and Porkal, situated on the coast approx 40 miles (65 km) N. of Cannanore. Further chemical weapons trials continued until February 1946 when the surplus stocks of gas were dumped at sea. 1340 Flt disbanded on 31 March 1946.

The Harvard IIB aircraft came from No. 5 Flying Training School RAF (3rd Formation) based at Thornhill, part of the Rhodesian Air Training Group. The Harvards had been previously temporarily based at No. 4 Flying Training School RAF at RAF Heany, near Bulawayo. Although some Harvards from Thornhill had been offered in February 1953 to the Kenyan authorities on the advice of General William \\"Looney\\" Hinde, the Director of Operations, a decision wasn't taken until the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, General Sir John Harding, visited Kenya to see the worsening security situation. Twelve Harvards from Thornhill were recommended to support two infantry battalions and an infantry brigade headquarters (39 Brigade), to restore security. Winston Churchill's cabinet endorsed the move on 10 March, and by the end of the month the establishment of 1340 Flight was formally approved. The flight arrived at RAF Eastleigh, Nairobi, Kenya, on 27 March 1953, commanded by Squadron Leader Charles G. St. David Jefferies, equipped with 12 Noorduyn Harvard IIBs, eight operational and four in reserve, with two being serviced any one time. The aircraft were fitted with bomb racks under the wings to take eight fragmentation bombsPicture of bomb racks at and a single Browning .303 machine gun under the starboard wing, with the ammunition carried inside the wing. Info from a page about the CAC Wirraway, similar to the Harvard, both developed from the NA-16 trainer. Because of the wooded terrain, the Harvards weren't used for two months because General Hinde thought they would be ineffective. The RAF was assisted by five Piper PA-22 Tri-Pacer aircraft belonging to the Kenya Police Reserve Air Wing (KPRW). In October 1953 six RAF pilots were seconded to the KRPW to fly the Tri-Pacers. Being on secondment, the pilots adopted the attitude to discipline of the Kenya Police; it was somewhat more relaxed than that of the RAF. The Tri- Pacers weren't originally armed, although they were later fitted with a single rack for four bombs behind the rear of cabin. 1340 Flight, along with the KPRW Tri-Pacers deployed forward from Eastleigh to Nyeri airfield, which lay between Mount Kenya and the Aberdare Range, and a basic Operations Centre was set up in the nearby town of Mweiga. An RAF Regiment detachment eventually took over airfield defence from the RAF groundcrew. Operations Working with the Army or local security forces on the ground, the Tri-Pacers would drop phosphorus grenades (e.g. No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenade) from the cockpit as markers, followed by the flight of eight Harvards which dropped their bombs on the target. From November 1953 various detachments of Avro Lincoln bombers were also stationed at RAF Eastleigh, armed with fourteen bombs: No. 49 Squadron RAF, No. 100 Squadron RAF, No. 61 Squadron RAF, No. 214 Squadron RAF, and 49 Squadron again from December 1954. There was a lack of coordination between the various armed services until May 1954 when Air Commodore Walter BeisiegelAir Commodore W K Beisiegel (26025) Air of Authority - A History of RAF Organisation. RAFWeb. Retrieved 5 February 2018. was appointed as Senior RAF Officer (SRAFO). He stayed until September 1955 and improved the process of target-marking by the Piper Tri-Pacers and the bombing of the Mau Mau by the Harvards and Lincolns. No. 1340 Flight was disbanded on 30 September 1955. During the course of the Mau Mau emergency, the flight had dropped 21,936 20-lb. bombs and lost five aircraft in accidents. Incidents On 19 April 1954 three Harvards were caught in a down- draught and crash-landed in the Aberdare Range. Three Tri-Pacers were also lost to accidents. ==See also== *List of Royal Air Force aircraft independent flights *List of British Commonwealth Air Training Plan facilities in Southern Rhodesia ==References== ;Notes ;Citations ;Sources ==External links== * Harvards in Kenya with photos Category:Royal Air Force independent flights Category:Military units and formations established in 1945 ","title":"No. 1340 Flight RAF"},{"id":"56825160","text":"Sherp is a Russian manufacturer of all-terrain amphibious vehicles, designed for rough and soggy terrain. It was founded in 2012 in partnership with engineer and Russian designer Alexei Garagashyan. In 2015, the company introduced the Sherp amphibious all-terrain vehicle. The vehicles are sold in Ukraine, Russia, Canada, the United States of America, Australia, Europe and Africa. == Models == SHERP is presented with multiple models. The existing lineup includes: SHERP PRO - This trouble-free machine repeatedly gets to areas where no man has stepped gone before.

Nicholson was born in King William County, Virginia, the fifth of eight children, and was the daughter of Francis West Quarles and Lucy Daingerfield Smith Quarles. She was descended from a family of some prominence in Lynchburg, Virginia. It has been posited that she attended a female academy in her youth, as her work appears to feature the influence of both theorem painting and instructional drawing books. Details of her early life were kept secret by her family, but it appears that early on, prior to her union with Nicholson, she married a poor music teacher, an immigrant from Italy; other \\"colorful\\" happenings have also been hinted at, though with scant evidence. Her second husband was the painter Jacob Cannon Nicholson. The Nicholsons are recorded as working as portraitists in Amherst, Virginia in 1839, and together the couple advertised their services as both portraitists and miniaturists in the Lynchburg Virginian. Otherwise it appears that she worked largely in Baltimore, in which city she died. Among the couple's children was John A. Nicholson, later to be elected a member of the United States Congress representing Delaware. A handful of Susannah Nicholson's paintings exist in public collections today. These include six portraits of members of the Quarles family, done during her Virginia sojourn, currently owned by the Huntington Museum of Art in West Virginia. The Maryland Historical Society owns a portrait of Laura Jane \\"Jennie\\" Harris, dating to c. 1853, while the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum owns a genre painting titled Woman Reading a Book; this latter is the only non-portrait work known by the artist's hand. ==References== Category:1804 births Category:1858 deaths Category:American women painters Category:19th-century American painters Category:19th-century American women artists Category:Artists from Baltimore Category:Painters from Maryland Category:People from King William County, Virginia Category:Painters from Virginia Category:Folk artists Category:American portrait painters Category:Women outsider artists ","title":"Susannah Fauntleroy Quarles Nicholson"},{"id":"56825185","text":"Whitney Brook is a creek that flows into Schenevus Creek in Maryland, New York. ==References== Category:Rivers of New York (state) Category:Rivers of Otsego County, New York ","title":"Whitney Brook (New York)"},{"id":"56825187","text":"Shen Wai International School (SWIS; ) is an international school in Nanshan District, Shenzhen, China.

It was published in 1831 and is one of the Études philosophiques of La Comédie humaine. ==Plot summary== The story is set in 1793 in Carentan, in Normandy. A local aristocrat, Madame de Dey lives at her estate at Carentan to ensure that it is not confiscated by the government. Her son is taking part in a Royalist uprising. She refuses visitors for two days, and buys a hare at the market. This arouses suspicions that she is either sheltering a Royalist priest or hiding a lover. When visited by a local merchant, she admits that she has received a letter from her son. He has written that he was captured during a failed attack on Granville, but that he will escape, and take shelter with her. He mentions a three-day period during which he should be expected. She holds a social gathering at her home on the third night that her son is expected to arrive. She acts calmly, and all but the local prosecutor leave early. The prosecutor warns that he will have her house searched the next day. He hints that he might save her. He politely leaves when there is a knock on the door. In the meantime, a group of conscripts is expected at the city, and one reports to a local official. He is billeted to stay at Madame de Dey's home. The visitor who has knocked at Madame de Dey's door is taken to her son's room. She greets him, and is shocked to discover that it is not her son, but a Parisian conscript who has been billeted to her home. She dies that night, and on the same night her son is shot in Morbihan. ==Historical Background== The story is set during the French Revolution. The main character's son is involved in the Vendéen Royalist Uprising. The story takes place in November 1793, shortly after a failed Royalist attack on Granville.Sylvia Raphael, Note from translation of The Conscript, Selected Short Stories ==Bibliography== * Raphael, Sylvia. \\"Introduction\\".

Sarkis (30 January 1940 – 11 March 2018) was an American restaurateur and dog racetrack owner who founded the Back Bay Restaurant Group and owned Wonderland Greyhound Park. ==Early life== Sarkis was raised in Milton, Massachusetts. His father, Abraham Sarkis, was a well-known Boston bookmaker. His sister, Dorothy Morkis, was an equestrian who competed in the 1976 Summer Olympics. Sarkis received a bachelor's degree in business from Georgetown University and a master's in business from Boston College. While at Georgetown, Sarkis witnessed the gentrification of the Georgetown neighborhood and was inspired to do the same in Back Bay. ==Business careerBack Bay Restaurant Group=== In 1964, Sarkis purchased Boraschi's restaurant in Boston. In 1968, he opened his second restaurant, Charley's, on Newbury Street. In 1992 he spun off his restaurant business into the Back Bay Restaurant Group, which went public at $17 a share. By 1999 the company stock had dropped to $3.50 a share and Sarkis took the company private for $38 million. By 2002, Back Bay Restaurant Group consisted of 35 restaurants on the East Coast, including the Abe & Louie's, J.C. Hillary's, Atlantic Fish Co., Coach Grill, Joe's American Bar & Grill, and Papa Razzi chains. In 2011, Sarkis sold 33 of his restaurants, which included 15 Joe's American Bar & Grill locations, 12 Papa Razzi restaurants and his flagship enterprise, Abe & Louie's to the Tavistock Restaurants, LLC. In March 2012 he sold seven Papa Razzi locations to the Newport Harbor Group. In December 2013, he closed his final two Massachusetts restaurants, Papa Razzi and Joe's American Bar and Grill in Hanover. His two remaining restaurants, both located in New Jersey, were closed at the end of March 2018. ===Wonderland Greyhound Park=== In 1977, Sarkis purchased Wonderland Greyhound Park for $1.7 million. In 1990, 40 people, including Sarkis' father and Wonderland's general manager, were indicted on charges of running an illegal gaming operation at the track. Sarkis was not charged in the case however, according to him \\"I think Wonderland always tarnished [my record]...It is what it is. My father was my father.\\" When Sarkis' restaurant business went public in 1992, he stepped away from the track's day-to-day operations, but remained its majority shareholder and chairman. Commercial dog racing was made illegal by the Massachusetts Greyhound Protection Act, a 2008 ballot measure that passed 56% to 44%. Live races ended at the Wonderland Greyhound Park on September 18, 2009, and the park closed its doors on August 19, 2010, laying off the remaining 75–80 workers. ===Foxboro Park=== In 1990, Sarkis, entered an agreement to lease Foxboro Raceway from a group run by Eddie Andelman. He hoped to use the track for Thoroughbred racing (which had not been held in Massachusetts since Suffolk Downs closed in 1989), off-track betting, and harness racing. He upgraded the track to include a grandstand pub, circle lounge area, new front- stretch chute, two teletheaters, 155 mutuel machines, and 50 personal betting machines (more than any other U.S. track at that time and the first such machines at any track in New England). The track reopened on May 27, 1992, under the name Foxboro Park. Foxboro Park was unprofitable due to an outbreak of an equine virus, a low level of betting, and significant cost overruns during construction. In 1996, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft purchased the track and moved to evict Sarkis on the grounds that he did not have a valid lease. On July 29, 1997, Sarkis was ordered to vacate the property. ==Personal life== In 1964, Sarkis married Nancy Hennessey. The couple had six children. They divorced in 1998. The following year, Sarkis married Fortune president and publisher Jolene Sykes. The couple resided in Palm Beach, Florida. In September 1995, Sarkis was diagnosed with a brain tumor. He chose a successor and announced his illness to employees and investors. He underwent surgery the following month to extract the tumor, which was found to be benign. After a few months of chemotherapy, radiation, and other treatments, Sarkis was able to return to work. As part of Bay Back Restaurant Group's sale to Tavistock, Tavistock required that Sarkis' three children that worked for Bay Back Restaurant Group sign noncompete clauses. All three refused and Sarkis moved against them. One son, who had been effectively running the company, quit after his father threatened to fire him. Sarkis also suspended a daughter from her job without pay and sought to have another son removed from his position on the Back Bay Architectural Commission. In 2010, Sarkis suffered a reoccurrence of his brain tumor. He died on March 11, 2018, of complications from brain cancer. He was 78 years old.https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/north-palm-beach-fl/charles- sarkis-7788603 Following his death, the remains of the Back Bay Restaurant Group were shut down for good. ==References== Category:1940 births Category:2018 deaths Category:American horse racing industry executives Category:American restaurateurs Category:Boston College alumni Category:Georgetown University alumni Category:Deaths from brain tumor Category:People from Milton, Massachusetts Category:People from Palm Beach, Florida Category:People in greyhound racing ","title":"Charles Sarkis"},{"id":"56825286","text":"Gobiobotia guilingensis is a species of small freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae.

His father was a painter who for twenty years was a teacher at the local Academy and also served as a director of that Academy. Frans received his initial art training from his father along with his younger brother Jan (or Jan Frans). His brother became a very successful artist.Alain Jacobs, Verhas family at Oxford Art Online Young woman in a kimono Verhas studied initially at the Academy of Fine Arts in his hometown Dendermonde and then at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of Antwerp. One of his teachers at the Antwerp Academy was Nicaise de Keyser, a painter of mainly history paintings and portraits and one of the key figures in the Belgian Romantic-historical school of painting. Verhas settled in Schaerbeek in 1867.Alain Jacobs, Frans Verhas in: Dictionnaire des peintres belges Frans Verhas lived and worked for various periods in Paris in the late 1870s and during the 1880s. He was a close friend of the French writer Arsène Houssaye, for whom he executed decorative frescoes in his residence on avenue de Friedland in Paris.Revue universelle: recueil documentaire universel et illustré, Volume 7,Georges Moreau Larousse., 1897, p. 90 The decorative program consisted of pastiches of the Flemish and Venetian masters. Frans Verhas died on 22 November 1897 in Schaerbeek. ==Work== Frans Verhas was known for his portraits of women and genre paintings set in luxurious bourgeois homes. He also painted animals, some history paintings and still lifes. He created a number of frescoes with history themes in residences during his stay in Paris in the 1670s and 1680s. Reading in the living room His principal subject matter and style of painting was influenced by the Belgian painter Alfred Stevens, who had made a career as a society painter of elegant women in Paris. He and his brother Jan Verhas were known for their paintings of small family scenes depicting the joyous hubbub of girls and boys with their perfect transparent and pearly skins and controlled facial expressions. Other Belgian artists who were also followers of Alfred Stevens included Gustave Léonard de Jonghe and Charles Baugniet. Like Frans Verhas they evoked the vision of women adorned and painted in a manner that accentuates their coquettishness and seductiveness, like adulated idols.Camille Lemonnier, L'école belge de peinture 1830–1905, G. Van Oest & C, 1906, pp. 89–90 Inconsolable Frans Verhas' cleverly constructed compositions treat with an extreme precision the rich interiors, enriched with satins and goblins, skins of animals and marbles that frame the elegant crinoline worn by the female sitters. He was particularly skilled in the rendering of the textures of various materials such as satin, marble and other precious materials in his works. Verhas received various commissions for religious paintings for churches in his hometown Dendermonde and for historical paintings for the City hall of Dendermonde. His history paintings treat their subjects with a powerful realism. ==Notes * Category:1827 births Category:1897 deaths Category:Flemish painters Category:Flemish portrait painters Category:Belgian portrait painters Category:Belgian genre painters Category:Orientalist painters Category:People from Dendermonde Category:19th-century Belgian painters ","title":"Frans Verhas"},{"id":"56825482","text":"French Polynesia requires its residents to register their motor vehicles and display vehicle registration plates.http://www.worldlicenseplates.com/world/PA_POLY.html Current plates are European standard 520 mm × 110 mm, and use French stamping dies.

Born in South Carolina, Cooper married his first wife, Lucinda, and moved first to Tennessee and then to Courtland, Alabama. In November 1835, Cooper joined Courtland doctor Jack Shackelford's Alabama Red Rovers, a filibuster force raised to support Texas' effort to secede from Mexico Cooper remained in camp with the Rovers until December 12, 1835 when the unit set out for Texas, stopping first in New Orleans and arriving at Dimmit's Landing on Lavaca Bay on January 19, 1836. From there, the Red Rovers joined James Fannin's command and on March 19–20, fought in the Battle of Coleto Creek where Cooper suffered minor wounds. The Texians had been caught on open prairie and, after Mexicans reinforcements arrived on the second day, were overwhelmed and forced to surrender. Mexican president Antonio López de Santa Anna had ordered General José de Urrea to treat the rebellious Texians as pirates instead of soldiers and to have them executed in accordance with the law rather than kept as prisoners of war. On March 27, Cooper survived the massacre of 425 men at Goliad, running away as the bodies of his companions fell. Cooper soon linked up with three other surviving members of Red Rovers, Zachariah S. Brooks, Wilson Simpson, and Isaac D. Hamilton. Cooper and the others traveled by night, narrowly avoiding detection and recapture, sometimes by only a few feet. After a two week journey, moving from one abandoned village to the next in search of food and forced to abandon Hamilton, due to his wounds, Cooper and the other two Red Rovers finally linked back up with Texian forces at the Brazos River. Hamilton would ultimately survive after being recaptured and again escaping. Cooper was granted land by the Republic of Texas for his service and farmed until his death. He married three times, was twice a widower, and fathered 5 children, all with his first wife. Cooper lived in Colorado and Hays Counties before finally moving to his son-in-law's farm in Llano County. At least one source claims that when he died in 1896, he was the last living survivor of the Goliad Massacre. The same source claims that near the end of his life Cooper was living on a \\"pitiful pension\\" of $150 a year from the state of Texas leaving him in poverty. Cooper is buried in the Llano City Cemetery in Llano, Texas.

This is in contrast to conventional impulsive transfers in the orbit which uses thermal rocket engines to develop impulse of the order of 300-400s. Such type of transfer uses low-thrust propulsion systems such as electrically powered spacecraft propulsion and solar sail. Low-thrust relative transfer uses the orbital relative motion equations which are the non-linear set of equations that describes the motion of the chaser spacecraft relative to the target in terms of displacements along the respective axis of the accelerated frame of reference fixed on the target spacecraft. In 1960, W. H. Clohessy and R. S. Wiltshire published the Clohessy-Wiltshire equations, which presents a rather simplified model of orbital relative motion, in which the target is in a circular orbit, and the chaser spacecraft is in an elliptical or circular orbit. Since, the quantity of available thrust is limited, the transfer is occasionally posed as an optimal control problem subjected to the required objective and constraints. == Explanation == Relative motion in the orbit means the motion of a spacecraft orbiting a planet relative to the other spacecraft orbiting the same planet. There can be one primary spacecraft known as the target and the other spacecraft with the task of performing the required maneuver relative to the target. Based on the mission requirement, the various relative orbital transfers can be rendezvous and docking operations, and maintaining station relative to the target. Unlike using a thrust-impulse to instantaneously change the velocity of the spacecraft, in non-impulsive transfer, there is a continuous application of thrust, so that, the spacecraft changes its direction gradually. Non-impulsive transfers relies on the low-thrust propulsion for the operation. Some of the mentionable low-thrust propulsion methods are, ionic propulsion, Hall-effect thruster and solar-sail systems. The electrostatic ion thruster uses high-voltage electrodes to accelerate ions with electrostatic forces, and achieve a specific impulse within the range of 4000-8000s. == Mathematical Models == The continuous low-thrust relative transfer can be described in mathematical form by adding components of specific thrust which will act as control input in the equations of motion model for relative orbital transfer. Although a number of linearized models have been developed since 1960s which gives simplified set of equations, one popular model was developed by W. H. Clohessy and R. S. Wiltshire, and is modified to account for continuous motion and can be written as: \\\\ddot{x} = 3n^2x+ 2n\\\\dot{y} + u_x \\\\ddot{y} = -2n\\\\dot{x}+u_y \\\\ddot{z}=-n^2z+u_z where: * x, y and z are the relative distance component of the chaser in the target fixed frame of reference * u_x, u_y and u_z are the specific thrust in the form of control input along x, y and z-axis of the target fixed frame of reference * n is the orbital frequency of the target orbit === Optimal relative transfers === Since, in continuous low-thrust transfers the thrust availability is limited, such type of transfers are usually subjected to certain performance index and final state constraints, posing the transfer as an optimal control problem with defined boundary conditions. For the transfer to have optimal control input expenditure, the problem can be written as: J = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\int_{t_0}^{t_f}(\\\\vec{u}^T \\\\cdot R\\\\cdot \\\\vec{u}) dt subjected to dynamics of the relative transfer: \\\\dot{\\\\vec{x}} = A\\\\vec{x} + B \\\\vec{u} and boundary conditions: \\\\vec{x}(t_0) = \\\\vec{x}_0 \\\\vec{x}(t_f)=\\\\vec{x}_f where: * \\\\vec{x} is the state-vector defined as \\\\vec{x} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} x & \\\\dot{x} & y & \\\\dot{y} & z & \\\\dot{z} \\\\end{bmatrix}^T * \\\\vec{u} is the control input vector defined as \\\\vec{u} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} u_x & u_y & u_z \\\\end{bmatrix}^T * R is the weight matrix * A is the state matrix obtained from the Clohessy- Wiltshire equations, such that, A = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 3n^2 & 0 & 0 & 2n & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -2n & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -n^2 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} * B is the input matrix, such that, B = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0&0&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1&0&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&0&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&1&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&0&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&0&1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} * t_0is the time of start of transfer * t_f is the time of end of transfer * \\\\vec{x}_0 is the initial value of the state vector * \\\\vec{x}_f is the final value of the state vector Sometimes, it is also useful to subject the system to control constraints because in case of continuous low-thrust transfer, there are always bounds on the availability of thrust. Hence, if the maximum quantity of thrust available is u_{max}, then, an additional inequality constraint can be imposed on the optimal control problem posed above as: \\\\vec{u}(t)\\\\leq u_{max} Additionally, if the relative transfer is occurring such that the chaser and the target spacecraft are very close to each other, the collision-avoidance constraints can also be employed in the optimal control problem in the form of a minimum relative distance, r_{min} as: \\\\vec{x}(t)\\\\geq r_{min} and because of obvious reasons, the final value of state-vector cannot be less than r_{min}. == See also == *Bi-elliptic transfer *Delta-v budget *Geostationary transfer orbit *Halo orbit *Lissajous orbit *List of orbits *Orbital mechanics ==References== Category:Astrodynamics Category:Orbital maneuvers ","title":"Low thrust relative orbital transfer"},{"id":"56825664","text":"Benjamin James Davis (born 24 November 2000) is a Thai professional footballer who plays for English club Fulham. He most recently represented Thailand at the U23 level. ==Personal life== Davis was born in Phuket, Thailand, and migrated to Singapore at the age of five with his family. Davis studied at the Singapore Sports School from 2013 to 2015 before moving to London's Harrow High School in 2016. In 2017, he was awarded a two-year scholarship with Fulham's academy. Davis is the second-youngest of four children. His mother, Sopee Davis, is Thai, while his father, Harvey Davis, is English. ==Club career== Davis started his professional career training at JSSL Singapore, a youth soccer academy owned by his father based in Singapore that has partnerships with Fulham and Singapore Premier League side Tampines Rovers. He later joined the Football Association of Singapore's (FAS) Junior Centre of Excellence, and went on to represent various national age group teams. In 2017, Davis earned a two-year academy scholarship with Fulham after impressing in trials. He was the first ever Singaporean player to sign for a Premier League side. In his first season, Davis made 10 appearances for the club's Under-18 South League team, scoring a header against West Ham's Under-18 side and recording a passing accuracy of 90 percent. In 2018, Fulham announced that Davis, alongside other academy players, were offered professional contracts, where they would now earn a weekly wage as well as continue to play for the club's Under-18 and Under-23 side. He signed his first professional Fulham contract in June 2017 and is listed on the club's website as an English national. On 13 October 2019, Davis confirmed that he had registered to play as a local player with the English Football Association. ==International career== Davis currently holds passports from the United Kingdom, Thailand, and Singapore but represents Thailand internationally. During his training stint with JSSL Singapore and FAS Junior Centre of Excellence, Davis represented Singapore in several 2016 AFC U-16 Championship qualifiers in 2015. In 2017, Davis earned a call-up to Singapore's U-19 side to play in several 2018 AFC Under-19 Championship qualifiers. In 2018, Davis received a surprise call-up to the senior Singapore national team for a run of AFC Asian Cup qualifiers, but he did not play in any of the matches. In September 2019, Davis was called up to the Thailand U23 national team for the SEA Games training camp. In 2020, Davis represented Thailand at the 2020 AFC U-23 Championship, appearing in a 1–1 draw against Iraq in the group stage as well as a 1–0 loss to Saudi Arabia in the quarter final, cap-tying him to Thailand. == Controversies National Service=== As a Singaporean citizen, he would have been compulsorily enlisted into National service upon turning 18. His application to defer National Service to continue develop his professional career as a footballer was rejected as he \\"does not meet the criteria for long-term deferment from full-time NS\\". His father sought to draw parallels to the deferment given to Joseph Schooling, who used the opportunity to win Olympic medals and at other international swimming meets for Singapore. Mindef commented that Davis' contract with Fulham is no different from other pre- enlistees' personal pursuits. Despite being supported by the Football Association of Singapore, a further appeal was denied as well, on the consideration that through actions by him and his father, Davis wanted the deferment to fulfill his own professional career with no intention to serve National Service. Since 18 February 2019, Davis has been deemed as a National Service defaulter by MINDEF. MINDEF reasoned that Davis did not meet the criteria for long-term deferment from full-time NS due to it being a personal interest pursuit to further advance his professional career, and that it was unfair to any other Singaporean pre-enlistees who put their personal pursuits on hold to serve NS dutifully. In a later statement, MINDEF added that the deferment rejection was also based on grounds that Davis' father \\"would not commit to a date\\" on when his son would return to Singapore to serve NS, coupled with subsequent remarks to the media that he would encourage his son to renounce his Singapore citizenship in order to pursue his career. In response to MINDEF's statement, Davis' father claimed that the family were unable to commit to a date for Davis to enlist as there was a possibility that he could be offered a new two-year contract in 2019, loaned to, or sold to another club. Davis' father also highlighted that he agreed that his son should serve national service, but could not commit to a date as the family \\"would like to give him the best opportunity to play at the highest possible professional level in the United Kingdom and Europe\\". This was in contradiction to MINDEF's deferment policy, which only allows for a defined period of deferment, after which sportsmen must return to fulfill their national service duties. On 11 January 2019, Davis had not appealed for deferment again. A month later on 18 February 2019, MINDEF released an official statement stating that Davis has committed offences under the Enlistment Act for failing to report for National Service and staying overseas without a valid exit permit. He is liable upon conviction to a fine of up to $10,000 and/or imprisonment of up to three years. Subsequently, on 18 February 2019, the Football Association of Singapore (FAS) officially issued a press release that it is extremely disappointed with Benjamin Davis’ default of his NS obligations. They stated that it is thoroughly irresponsible on the part of Davis, and also reneges on his (and his father's) assurance to the FAS that Davis would discharge his NS commitments and play for the Singapore national team. Having lived in Singapore for many years, Davis had benefited from the resources used to educate and train him as a footballer over this period of time. He was invited to play for the Singapore national team, which he agreed. The FAS had supported Benjamin Davis’ application to defer NS on this basis. While the matter will now be dealt with by MINDEF, the FAS wished to state categorically that it do not condone such conduct nor did it ever arise in their discussions with Davis that he would seek to avoid his liability. In mid-2019, Ben Davis eventually chose Thailand after disputes over his attempts to defer and escape mandatory national service. He also declared that he has no intention to return to Singapore despite being a citizen and spending his formative years there, or to fulfill his National Service obligations in the near future to develop his career and have no regrets doing so. ==References *Ben Davis at soccerway.com Category:2000 births Category:Living people Category:People from Phuket Province Category:Thai footballers Category:Thailand youth international footballers Category:Singaporean footballers Category:Thai people of English descent Category:Singaporean people of Thai descent Category:Singaporean people of English descent Category:Naturalised citizens of Singapore Category:Association football midfielders Category:Thai expatriate sportspeople in the United Kingdom Category:Fulham F.C. players ","title":"Ben Davis (footballer, born 2000)"},{"id":"56825667","text":"Réunion requires its residents to register their motor vehicles and display vehicle registration plates.

In partnership with Alexander Croll, John Wright built at least three ships at Bungwahl, before selling his share of the sawmill and shipwright business at Myall Lakes. In 1875, he was the first white settler of the area now known as Tuncurry. He took out a 99-year lease on the waterfront land and built a timber mill, shipyard, slipway and associated buildings. A wharf ran about 50 feet along the length of the waterfront at Tuncurry, with a receiving shed, with a skin shed at one end which housed cattle skins to be sent to Sydney. == Vessels == His first boat built at Tuncurry was the \\"Stanley\\", which carried timber to Sydney and returned with general cargo. This was replaced by the first ship named Tuncurry. John Wright built a number of vessels used on the North Coast including the Bellinger, Tuncurry II, Our Jack and the Comboyne. After Wright's death in 1910, his son Ernest continued the business with the building of the Narani, Wallamba, Glenreagh, Allenwood, Nambucca 1, Nambucca 2 and the Uralba. Additionally other craft were built, including small tugs, lighters, yachts and launches. The company name was changed to E.

The 99-year lease was approaching finality, and John Wright junior decided to close the shipyard and return the land to the crown. In 1960 all buildings were demolished. In February 2018, the 'US Army WT85' - 'Protrude'/'Koolya', the last of the Wright ships sunk at its mooring at Gosford. The water front land where the mill and shipyard stood at Tuncurry was gazetted as an area for public recreation and in 1962 was renamed John Wright Park. ==References * == Gallery == Image:Coastal_steamer_NARANI_(9559320406).jpgHMAS Narani Image:HMAS Uralba 1945.jpgHMAS Uralba Image:HMAS_Allenwood.jpgHMAS Allenwood Image:Tuncurry_(ship).jpgthe first Tuncurry, built 1903 Category:Engineering companies of Australia Category:Shipyards of New South Wales Category:Shipbuilding companies of Australia Category:Mid North Coast ","title":"John Wright and Son Shipyards"},{"id":"56825818","text":"Aussie Salvage Squad is an Australian factual television series which explores the world of marine salvage and rescue in Australia, which screened on 7mate in 2018.

In total, five package bombs exploded, killing two people and injuring another five. The suspect, 23-year-old Mark Anthony Conditt of Pflugerville, Texas, blew himself up inside his vehicle after he was pulled over by police on March 21, also injuring a police officer. ==Bombings== On March 2, 2018, 39-year-old Anthony Stephan House was killed by picking up an apparent package bomb at his home. Austin Police Department Assistant Chief Joseph Chacon floated a theory that House might have bombed himself, perhaps while assembling the device. He also told residents not to worry. The police response was characterized by multiple commentators as anemic and inadequate, with the possible reason being racial bias. On March 12, 17-year-old Draylen Mason was killed and his mother injured by an explosion, and another explosion that day seriously injured 75-year-old Esperanza Herrera, who was visiting her elderly mother's house. The second of the March 12 bombs was reportedly addressed to a different address. A suspected tripwire-activated package bomb injured two men (a 22-year-old and a 23-year-old) in a residential neighborhood in southwest Austin on March 18. The men suffered serious, although not life-threatening, injuries.

Following this fourth blast, Austin Police warned the public of a \\"serial bomber\\" possessing \\"a higher level of sophistication, a higher level of skill\\" than initially thought. On March 20, around 12:25 AM, a bomb exploded in a package at a FedEx Ground facility in Schertz, Texas, injuring one employee. The package was intended for an address in the city of Austin. Later that day, another package bomb was intercepted and defused at a separate FedEx facility in southeast Austin. The two packages were sent by the same person from a FedEx store in Sunset Valley. ===Timetable=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\"  Date ! scope=\\"col\\"  Location ! scope=\\"col\\"  Deaths ! scope=\\"col\\"  Injuries ! scope=\\"col\\"  Type - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center;background:#f00;color:#fff;\\"  1   Private residence in Harris Ridge, Austin, Texas  1  0  Package bomb - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center;background:#f00;color:#fff;\\"  2   Private residence in East MLK, Austin, Texas  1  1  Package bomb - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center;background:#f00;color:#fff;\\"  3   Private residence in Montopolis, Austin, Texas  0  1  Package bomb - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center;background:#f00;color:#fff;\\"  4   Near a road in Travis Country, Austin, Texas  0  2  Tripwire-activated bomb - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background:#f00;color:#fff;\\"  5   FedEx Ground facility in Schertz, Texas  0  1  Package bomb - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center;background:#000;color:#fff;\\"  6   FedEx Ground facility in Austin, Texas  colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background: #ececec; color: #2C2C2C; vertical-align: middle; font-size: smaller; text-align: center; \\" class=\\"table-na\\"  Deactivated  Package bomb - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center;background:#f00;color:#fff;\\"  7  ~  Near I-35 Frontage Road in Round Rock, Texas  1  1  Package bomb } ;Notes ==InvestigationInitial theories=== After the first bombing, the Austin Police Department (APD) announced it was investigating the death of House as a possible homicide. Chief Brian Manley said \\"we have no reason to believe this is anything beyond an isolated incident that took place at this residence, and no reason to believe this is in any way linked to a terrorist act. But we are not making any assumptions. We are conducting a thorough investigation to rule that out.\\" On the following Monday, March 5, Austin police identified the first victim as Anthony Stephan House, and said the death was being treated as suspicious. The first police theory was that House was an unintended victim who was killed by a bomb meant for someone else, perhaps a suspected drug dealer who lived in the neighborhood. Assistant Chief Joseph Chacon said police \\"can't rule out that Mr. House didn't construct this himself and accidentally detonate it, in which case it would be an accidental death.\\" Later, police began to investigate House's finances. ===Serial bombing connections=== After the third bombing, the APD began to investigate the connections between the victims. House's father was close friends with Mason's grandfather. Both of the elder men attend the same church and are prominent members of the African-American community in Austin. Police also cautioned the public against opening suspicious packages, and advised them to call the police instead. Because the bombs appeared to target the east side of Austin, which predominantly consists of poorer, African-American and Latino residents, local activists questioned whether the police advisory and investigation was delayed. By March 20, the police had received more than 1,200 calls about suspicious packages. Over 500 agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) assisted local police in the investigation. Representative Michael McCaul called it \\"probably the biggest investigation since the Boston bombings.\\" Former Deputy Director of the FBI Weldon L. Kennedy told news outlets he believed the culprit was a single, highly organized and efficient person because of the rapid pace of the bombings, use of package bombs, and apparent proficiency in the creation of explosives. By March 20, Texas Governor Greg Abbott had allocated $265,000 in government spending for the investigation. Austin police officially connected the March 2 bombing following the bombings on March 12. The first three packages were not mailed, but instead placed near victims' homes. Two of the first three bombs were triggered upon being picked up, and another triggered upon being opened. The fourth bomb was activated by tripwire. The fifth bomb was triggered in a sorting facility in Schertz, and the sixth was discovered and disarmed in a similar sorting facility in Austin. A FedEx store in the Austin suburb of Sunset Valley was cordoned off early in the morning of March 20 after local police tracked down the origin of the package that exploded at the sorting facility in Schertz. Police first offered a reward of $65,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction of the bomber or bombers. Later, this sum was increased to $100,000 and the Texas Governor's office added another $15,000. ==SuspectPolice search and death of suspect=== Police discovered the bombs used some common household ingredients. As part of the investigation, agents collected and reviewed receipts and sales records from stores for suspicious purchases of those components. This review identified Mark Anthony Conditt as a person of interest. Specifically, a large purchase of nails (to be used as shrapnel in the bombs) by Conditt at a Home Depot in Round Rock alerted investigators, as well as uncommon batteries used in the bombs that came from Asia. A federal search warrant was obtained for Conditt's IP address, and the evidence gathered indicated he had used Google to search for information on shipping. Investigators also obtained a witness sketch of the man. Conditt was captured on security videotape at the FedEx store in Sunset Valley, where he had shipped two explosive devices. The surveillance footage captured a red 2002 Ford Ranger with no license plate; investigators examined records for all matching cars in Texas for white males possibly in their 20s. The footage also captured the man wearing pink construction gloves sold at Home Depot stores; by examining \\"hours of surveillance video from Home Depot locations in and around Austin\\" investigators were able to find footage showing what appeared to be the same man. This evidence allowed investigators to narrow the range of persons of interest to a small number of people. At least one neighbor of Conditt noticed several people sitting in parked cars along the street on the night of March 20, which she now believes were unmarked police vehicles quietly staking out his house. Early on March 21, police moved in to make an arrest. They tracked him to a hotel room in Round Rock (north of Austin), then onto Interstate 35, where they pulled him over at around 2:00a.m. (CDT). As SWAT officers approached, he detonated a bomb in the vehicle, killing himself and injuring one officer, prompting other officers to fire upon the vehicle. The Austin Police Department closed a southbound section of the interstate where FBI and ATF agents were dispatched to investigate. ===Biographical sketch and motives=== Mark Anthony Conditt, born in June 1994 (age 23), lived in Pflugerville, Texas, outside Austin. He grew up in a very religious Christian family. The eldest of three children, he attended Austin Community College from 2010 to 2012, leaving without graduating but in good academic standing. He was home-schooled by his mother, who in February 2013 \\"officially graduated\\" him from high school. He wrote blog posts in 2012, where he identified as a conservative who was \\"not that politically inclined\\"; he argued for the death penalty, and argued against same-sex marriages and sex offender registries. He reportedly was part of a club called Righteous Invasion of Truth (R.I.O.T.), apparently named after a Carman song. The club's members, home-schooled kids, practiced survivalism and held Bible studies. Conditt moved out of his family's home a few years before the bombings and into a house nearby that he bought with his father and lived in with two roommates. He spent several years as an employee of Crux Manufacturing, which makes semiconductors, but he was fired eight months before the bombings for poor performance. He had no criminal record. Police found a 25-minute video on Conditt's phone in which he described the devices and confessed to the bombings, but the video does not explain how he chose his victims. Austin police chief Brian Manley described the video as \\"the outcry of a very challenged young man talking about challenges in his life that led him to this point.\\" He declined to label Conditt a domestic terrorist, because \\"he does not at all mention anything about terrorism, nor does he mention anything about hate.\\" Texas Governor Greg Abbott wondered \\"Was his goal to terrorize, or did he have some other type of agenda? Obviously, there was terror.\\" The video will not be released during the investigation. On March 29, after criticism of his earlier statements, Chief Manley reversed his stance and called Conditt \\"a domestic terrorist for what he did to us\\". ==Aftermath== In response to the bombings, FedEx instituted a new policy on April 2, 2018, requiring all retail customers to provide government photo identification that includes their return address to ship packages. ==Contemporary incidents== On March 17, Live Nation Music, a company organizing events for the annual South by Southwest film and music festival (which ran from March 9 to 18), received a bomb threat via email. Additional threats were made by phone to the eBay customer service center in Austin by the same subject. Police searched the area mentioned in the email and found nothing of concern, but planned performances by The Roots and Ludacris, among others, were canceled. Police arrested 26-year-old Trevor Weldon Ingram the next day; Ingram is charged with making a terroristic threat, a third-degree felony, in connection with the email. Police do not believe Ingram had any link to the explosions in Texas. On March 20, a man was burned by a device described as an \\"artillery simulator device\\" in a donation box at a Goodwill in South Austin, and was taken to St. David's South Austin Medical Center. ATF agents and police officers quickly responded to the scene, and firefighters of the Austin Fire Department (AFD) evacuated the building of civilians. The Austin Police Department announced shortly afterward via Twitter that this appeared unrelated to the serial bomber. ==See also== *Improvised explosive device *Ted Kaczynski, American domestic terrorist who used package bombs from 1978 to 1995 *Luke Helder, American former student known as the Midwest Pipe Bomber of May 2002 *2001 anthrax attacks, similar case in which parcel/courier carriers were used to attack ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Why 'They' Aren't Calling It Terrorism':A Primer Ben Radford, April 2, 2018.

The operation started on 11 March 1968 and ended on 7 April 1968. ==Background== While their Tet Offensive attacks on Saigon had been quickly repulsed, in early March, more than 20 Vietcong (VC) battalions remained near Gia Định Province, threatening the city. The 101st Regiment, the Đồng Nai Regiment and elements of the 165th Regiment were in southern Bình Dương Province, north of Saigon. Several battalions were in Thủ Đức District northeast of Saigon. Five or 6 unidentified battalions were in Long An Province southwest of Saigon. The 271st and 272nd Regiments of the 9th Division, the D16, 267th, and 269th Main Force Battalions were in eastern Hậu Nghĩa Province northwest of Saigon. While most of these units had suffered heavy losses in the Tet Offensive, their continued presence applied pressure on Saigon and prevented the reestablishment of South Vietnamese Government control. COMUSMACV General William Westmoreland instructed II Field Force commander LTG Frederick C. Weyand and ARVN III Corps commander LTG Lê Nguyên Khang to sweep the districts surrounding Saigon. The 1st, 9th and 25th Infantry Divisions supported by the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (11th ACR) would provide most of the maneuver battalions, with subordinate units in many cases pairing up with ARVN units. The 199th Light Infantry Brigade, worked with the elite South Vietnamese Marine Brigade and the Airborne Division in Gia Định Province. The 2nd and 3rd Brigades, 1st Infantry Division partnered with the ARVN 7th and 8th Regiments, 5th Infantry Division in Bình Dương Province. The 3rd Brigade, 9th Infantry Division partnered with the ARVN 50th Regiment in Long An Province. The 3rd Squadron, 11th ACR moved into southeastern Hậu Nghĩa Province to support the ARVN 49th Regiment, 25th Infantry Division. The 2nd and 3rd Brigades, 25th Infantry Division worked with a cavalry squadron from the ARVN 25th Infantry Division and territorial units in northern and western Hậu Nghĩa Province. ==Operation== The operation commenced on 11 March. On 12 March, Troop M, 3rd Squadron, 11th Armored Cavalry and an ARVN Regional Force company engaged more than 100 VC from the 267th and 269th Battalions in forest 6km north of Đức Hòa in eastern Hậu Nghĩa Province. The Allied force killed 36 VC and captured 10. From 15–17 March the 3rd Squadron, 11th ACR and ARVN forces engaged the 272nd Regiment between Đức Hòa and Củ Chi, killing 273 VC before losing contact. On 20 March Troops L and M and an ARVN Battalion regained contact with the 272nd Regiment killing 142 VC that day and 57 more in the same area 6 days later. Following these losses the 272nd Regiment withdrew into War zone C. On 24 March the 1st Brigade, 25th Division engaged the 7th Cu Chi Battalion near Trảng Bàng in northern Hậu Nghĩa Province. In late March, Allied intelligence detected VC troop movements south from War Zone C to camps along the Saigon River. On the morning of 25 March, a VC unit attacked two Regional Forces outposts near Trảng Bàng. The ARVN 43rd Ranger Battalion and a U.S. mechanized force from the 4th Battalion, 25th Infantry Division and the 2nd Battalion, 34th Armor Regiment rushed to the area killing at least 287 VC in the ten-hour battle for the loss of 23 ARVN/U.S. killed. On 26 March, east of Hóc Môn ARVN Airborne forces found 128 dead VC who had apparently been killed by air and artillery strikes while moving south towards Saigon. On 27 March the 2nd Battalion, 34th Armor, and two companies from the 2nd Battalion, 14th Infantry Regiment, killed some 97 VC 5km northeast of Trảng Bàng. On 28 March LTG Weyand moved the 199th Light Infantry Brigade from Biên Hòa Province to Tây Ninh Province to help the 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division patrol the area between Tây Ninh and Dầu Tiếng to close the communist infiltration routes from Cambodia into central III Corps. This new operation was named Operation Wilderness. The first week of April saw a sharp drop in enemy contact in the Quyet Thang operational area. Allied intelligence indicated that the VC had withdrawn to more remote areas. Rocket attacks on Saigon had become less frequent as the VC had been pushed back and ARVN forces were now able to reestablish control of the areas around the capital. ==Aftermath== The operation was considered a success and the U.S. claimed 2,658 VC killed. It was followed immediately by Operation Toan Thang I which expanded the security operation across III Corps. The official PAVN history described the operation and Operation Toan Thang I as \\"causing a great many difficulties for our units trying to approach their targets\\" for the May Offensive. ==References== Category:1968 in Vietnam Category:Battles and operations of the Vietnam War in 1968 Category:Battles and operations of the Vietnam War Category:Battles involving the United States Category:Battles involving Vietnam Category:History of Bình Dương Province Category:History of Đồng Nai Province Category:History of Long An Province ","title":"Operation Quyet Thang"},{"id":"56825915","text":"The Grand Hotel et des Palmes is a historic hotel in Palermo, Sicily, on the central Via Roma.

Initially, the building consisted of a two-story low body with an exotic winter garden that reached the sea. At the end of the nineteenth century, the house was sold to the knight Enrico Ragusa, who in 1907 commissioned the transformation of Palazzo Ingham in the Grande Albergo delle Palme to the architect Ernesto Basile.

She participated in movements against sex slavery including the Wednesday Demonstration. She also travelled abroad to attend exhibits that displayed her paintings, participated in international speaking tours, and testified about her experiences. After the end of Japanese colonization in Korea, which occurred from 1910 to 1945, many of the atrocities and injustices began to surface. Several activist groups gathered evidence and encouraged victims to come forward. Both Korean and Japanese people pressured the Japanese government to acknowledge its crimes; however, in 1991 the Japanese Embassy in Seoul denied the existence of an official, militarized form of sexual slavery. Kim Hak-sun responded to the Japanese Embassy's official statement and became the first woman to openly testify about her experience as a 'comfort woman.' She inspired other women, including Kim Soon-duk, to come forward with their stories. 'Comfort Women,' along with their supporters, continue to fight against sexual violence and confront the Japanese government to acknowledge their crimes and compensate the victims. == Background == Kim Soon-duk was born in 1921 and grew up in a poor family in South Kyongsang Province. Her father died when she was a child. When she was twelve, she worked as a housemaid to help her mother and her four siblings. In 1937, Kim Soon-duk was 16-years-old when she met a Korean man who told her that she would be sent to Japan to work as a well-paid factory worker. Instead, the Korean man took her and about thirty other women to a military brothel that he ran in Shanghai and later to another comfort station in Nanking. Although she did not have a formal education, she was smart. She was also pretty. She was chosen to serve high-ranking officers and transported into the army unit by car. She developed an intimate relationship with Izumi, a high-ranking Japanese officer in his fifties, and came to rely on him as her father, husband, and family. She was a 'comfort woman' for three years from 1937 to 1940. In 1940, Kim Soon-duk and four other women from her village were able to return to Korea due to Izumi's love and concern. She received 100 yen and a white envelope that contained official travel permits that allowed her and her peers to secure lodging, food, and travel by train, truck, and boat. In an interview published in 2008, Kim said: > After returning home, I received letters from Izumi constantly. I sent my > replies to him and even sent care packages to him. He would write me > thanking me for them, saying that he enjoyed the toasted grain powder, but > the chili powder, he wrote, was so hot that it almost killed him, jokingly > asking me whether I intended to kill him with it. He would also correct my > Japanese spelling and write humorous letters as well….After I moved to > Seoul, I continued to receive his letters from Nanking until one or two > years before the Liberation. I lost all the letters during the Korean War. In the early 1990s, Kim Soon-duk was taken to Japan to testify about her experiences during the war. She would actively ask for help from Japanese supporters to find Izumi. In January 1995, a representative of the Korean Council acknowledged that she and her colleagues were embarrassed about Kim Soon-duk's conduct and decided not to take her on their future trips to Japan. Surviving 'comfort women,' including Kim Soon-duk, lived in a rental house together in the early 1990s. Buddhist groups helped raise funds to support and establish a social welfare facility called the House of Sharing in 1992. Kim Soon-duk moved into the House of Sharing in 1992 with her friend Park Duri. Park Duri would often jokingly salute Kim Soon-duk, who is five years her senior, and turn to her for advice and assistance. In February 1996, the survivor-residents moved to the new, official House of Sharing that consists of residential wings, a recreation room, a Buddhist sanctuary, educational and training activities, and the first \\"Japanese Comfort Women History Museum in Korea,\\" which opened in August 1998. Kim Soon-duk died in 2004 when she was 83-years-old. A Buddhist ceremony commemorated her death in the House of Sharing’s shrine. == Activism == In the 1990s, Kim Soon-duk was involved with The Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Sexual Slavery in Japan, also known as the Korean Council, which organizes weekly protests in Seoul. She was a devoted participant in the weekly Wednesday Demonstrations in front of the Japanese embassy in Seoul, which started in 1992 and still occurs today. Kim Soon-duk also went on international speaking tours to raise awareness internationally through her testimonials and artwork. She and Kang Duk-kyung received a lot of attention during the earlier years of the movement for their distinct, vivid paintings, which depicted the lives and stories of 'comfort women.' The House of Sharing includes a gallery that exhibits Kim Soon-duk's artwork. The House of Sharing also organizes tours to teach the public about her experiences through her paintings. Her famous painting Unblossomed Flower, also inspired the statue of the young girl that stands in the center of the House of Sharing grounds. == References == Category:1921 births Category:2004 deaths Category:South Korean activists Category:South Korean women activists Category:Comfort women ","title":"Kim Soon-duk"},{"id":"56825968","text":"Halls Creek may refer to: *Halls Creek, Western Australia, a town in Australia *Halls Creek (Ohio), a stream in Ohio *Halls Creek (Utah), a stream in Utah ","title":"Halls Creek (disambiguation)"},{"id":"56825971","text":"Jonah Williams (born November 17, 1997) is an American football offensive tackle for the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League (NFL).

It is owned and operated via its parent company Global Force Entertainment, LLC. The promotion ran several live events and tapings for a potential television show. Jeff Jarrett returned to Impact Wrestling in an executive role in January 2017 and Karen Jarrett announced that GFW had \\"merged\\" with Impact on April 20, 2017. Impact Wrestling assumed the GFW name the following month, but it was dropped when Jeff Jarrett departed the company four months later. Jarrett resumed promoting events under the name in December 2017. == History Formation and live events=== With Jeff Jarrett out as minority investor of TNA Wrestling, he debuted the branding of Global Force Wrestling (business name Global Force Entertainment, LLC) in April 2014 and began promoting the brand and establishing international partnerships with wrestling promotions across the world. The organization had a strategic partnership with 25/7 Productions and David Broome (creator of NBC's The Biggest Loser). Broome stated that the organization planned to create new on- air content 52 weeks per year. By August 2014, GFW announced working agreements with Mexican promotion Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (AAA), Japan's New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) promotion, multiple European promotions, South African promotion World Wrestling Professionals (WWP), and promotions from Australia and New Zealand. As part of GFW's relationship with New Japan Pro Wrestling, it presented NJPW's Wrestle Kingdom 9 at the Tokyo Dome on the American pay-per-view market on January 4, 2015. The pay-per-view featured English language commentary from Jim Ross and Matt Striker. Wrestle Kingdom 9 reportedly drew 12,000 to 15,000 buys in North America. Karen and Jeff Jarrett Throughout May 2015, Jarrett announced talent for their roster, which included Bullet Club members Karl Anderson and Doc Gallows, the Killer Elite Squad, and Chael Sonnen as an expert analyst. Jarrett also announced that four champions (Global, NEX*GEN, Tag Team and Women's Champion) would be crowned at the July 24 tapings. The first Global Force Wrestling house show took place on June 12, 2015, at The Ballpark at Jackson in Jackson, Tennessee, as part of GFW's \\"Grand Slam Tour\\", which entailed holding events at minor league baseball stadiums. In that show's main event, Karl Anderson and Doc Gallows defeated the New Heavenly Bodies. On July 9, 2015, Jeff Jarrett announced that the name of GFW's television program was \\"Amped\\". Tapings for Amped took place at the Orleans Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada on July 24, August 21, and October 23, 2015. In a December 2015 interview, Jeff Jarrett said that they had sixteen one-hour shows filmed at the Las Vegas tapings and hoped to have the programs air globally on television in the future. GFW announced that they had signed an international TV distribution deal with Boulder Creek TV in the UK on September 14, 2015, and with New Zealand's TVNZ Duke on February 18, 2016. Despite this, no tapings of Amped ever aired until 2017, when footage from them was aired as Impact One Night Only pay-per-view specials. Overall, the promotion held 36 live events. ===Association with Impact Wrestling and lawsuits=== After returning to TNA in early 2017 as the promotion's chief creative officer, Jarrett stated that GFW and the newly renamed Impact Wrestling were \\"becoming one day-by-day\\". On the April 20 episode of Impact Wrestling, Karen Jarrett announced that GFW and Impact Wrestling had officially merged. In a press release issued on June 28, Impact Wrestling announced that their parent company, Anthem Sports & Entertainment Corp., had entered into an agreement to acquire the rights to GFW. After the announcement, Impact Wrestling rebranded and took on the Global Force Wrestling name. Jeff Jarrett took an indefinite leave of absence from the company in September and Anthem slowly reverted to using the Impact Wrestling name. Impact Wrestling's rebranding was officially over on October 23, when Impact announced that its business partnership with Jeff Jarrett and GFW was terminated. The deal for Anthem to acquire GFW was never completed and Jeff Jarrett continues to own the rights to GFW. On August 14, 2018, Jeff Jarrett and Global Force Entertainment announced that it had filed a lawsuit against Anthem Sports & Entertainment in the District Court of Tennessee for copyright infringement over the GFW rights, as Jarrett owned all GFW properties since its creation in 2014. It was revealed on February 19, 2019, that Jarrett filed another lawsuit claiming that Impact Wrestling had deleted the master copies of all 16 hours of GFW Amped. Jarrett also sued in attempt to get the trademarks of his name and likeness from Anthem. Anthem counter-sued in July 2019, arguing that they were the rightful owners of the \\"Jeff Jarrett\\" copyright, that Jarrett knew the master tapes had been deleted, that they made no money off of GFW's content and that the looks and trademarks of GFW and their former Global Wrestling Network app are not similar.

Presently he is serving as the Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Colombo. == Birth and childhood == Born to a devoted Roman Catholic family of Stanley John Silva and Eugene Victoria Dias. He was the second child of a family of four and the eldest of three brothers. He initially entered the Roman Catholic School in Willorawatte and later entered St. Sebastian College, Moratuwa where he completed his secondary education. As a child he was very much attached to the St. Charles Borommeo parish, Willorawatte and has been a devoted member of the Legion of Mary. Young Maxwell Silva was greatly attached to the 'Brookside' St. Joseph's Convent- Piliyandala where he served as an Alter Server for many years. == Steps toward vocational ministry == Neither his parents John and Eugene Silva, nor his family observed signs of his calling when he was a child. He entered the St Aloysius Minor Seminary on May 3, 1967 after his General Ordinary Level examination. It is said that the Jesuit priests (related to him from his mother's family) was inspirational in this vocational call and with the blessings of his parents he chose the way to priesthood. He excelled in both studies and in sports. == Ordination and priesthood == In 1971 he gained admission to the Harwarden Intermediate Seminary at Haputhale and on February 9, 1974 he entered the National Seminary in Ampitiya with God's guidance for the formation of the priesthood. He was ordained to the priesthood on July 25, 1981, alongside several other deacons at St. Lucia's Cathedral by Nicholas Marcus Fernando, Archbishop Emeritus of Colombo.

These are the colors of St. Thomas’ College, Kotte of which he served and loved the most. Three colors were chosen by the veteran missionary Rev. Fr. Zacharias Dabrera, the founder of the College. The lower half in Maroon has the, saw, “toothed edged” to remind the bishop of his hometown, Moratuwa, famous for its carpentry. It has a lamp and a threefold flame to symbolize the wisdom of the Holy Trinity, which is the basic of all education to which the bishop has dedicated his life. The lamp has an embossed Holy Spirit with the handle of wheat to symbolize his motto. The maroon signifies Strength and Vigor and the Gold signifies Victory. It has the Na flower to symbolize his devotion to Our Lady of Lanka. === Motto === \\"CIBAVIT EOS EX ADIPE FRUMENITI\\" The motto reads “He fed us with finest wheat”.

From the point of view of anthropometric studies, Japanese people have: * skulls closer to those of Yayoi people than to those of Jōmon people. * skulls closer to those of Southeast Asians than to those of Chinese and Mongolian people. * skulls close to those of Korean people. * proportionately short legs and long torsos. ==Origins== A common origin of Japanese has been proposed by a number of scholars since Arai Hakuseki first brought up the theory and Fujii Sadamoto, a pioneer of modern archaeology in Japan, also treated the issue in 1781.Miller, Roy A. The Japanese Language. Tokyo: Charles E. Tuttle. 1967, pp. 61-62 But after the end of World War II, Kotondo Hasebe and Hisashi Suzuki claimed that the origin of Japanese people was not the newcomers in the Yayoi period (300 BCE – 300 CE) but the people in the Jōmon period. However, Kazuro Hanihara announced a new racial admixture theory in 1984. Hanihara also announced the theory \\"dual structure model\\" in English in 1991. According to Hanihara, modern Japanese lineages began with Jōmon people, who moved into the Japanese archipelago during Paleolithic times from their homeland in southeast Asia. Hanihara believed that there was a second wave of immigrants, from northeast Asia to Japan from the Yayoi period. Following a population expansion in Neolithic times, these newcomers then found their way to the Japanese archipelago sometime during the Yayoi period. As a result, miscegenation was common in the island regions of Kyūshū, Shikoku, and Honshū, but did not prevail in the outlying islands of Okinawa and Hokkaidō, and the Ryukyuan and Ainu people continued to dominate there. Mark J. Hudson claimed that the main ethnic image of Japanese people was biologically and linguistically formed from 400 BCE to 1,200 CE. Currently, the most well-regarded theory is that present-day Japanese are descendants of both the indigenous Jōmon people and the immigrant Yayoi people. On the other hand, a study published in October 2009 by the National Museum of Nature and Science et al. concluded that the Minatogawa Man, who was found in Okinawa and was regarded as evidence that the Jōmon people were not a homogenous group and that these southern Jōmon came to Japan via a southern route and had a slender and more neo-Mongoloid face unlike the northern Jōmon. Hiroto Takamiya of the Sapporo University suggested that the people of Kyushu immigrated to Okinawa between the 10th and 12th centuries CE. A genetic autosomal study on the Jomon people showed that they are a unique group of the East Asian Mongoloid cluster and that they had genetic relations to modern Siberian and Native American samples.Hideaki Kanzawa-Kiriyama, Kirill Kryukov, Timothy A Jinam, Kazuyoshi Hosomichi, Aiko Saso: . In: . Band 62, Nr. 2, 1. September 2016 A 2011 study by Sean Lee and Toshikazu Hasegawa reported that a common origin of Japonic languages had originated around 2,182 years before present. A study conducted in 2017 by Ulsan University in Korea presented evidence that the genetic origin of Koreans is closer to that of southeast Asians. This was additionally supported by Japanese research conducted in 1999 that supported the theory that the origin of the Yayoi people was in southern China near the Yangtze river. This study further supports the already accepted admixture theory between the Jōmon and Yayoi populations. Glacier cover in Japan at the height of the last glaciation about 20,000 years ago The origins of the Jōmon and Yayoi people have often been a subject of dispute, and a recent Japanese publisherfrom the book, 2009, Japanese published by Heidansha. \\"日本人\\". マイペディア. 平凡社.

(Without geographic distinction, which means, the group of people living in islands from Hokkaido to Okinawa may all be considered to be Aboriginals in this case.) *Immigrants from the northern route (北方ルート in Japanese) including the people from the Korean Peninsula, Mainland China and Sakhalin Island. *Immigrants from the southern route (南方ルート in Japanese) including the people from the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, and in some context, India. However, a clear consensus has not been reached. A recent genome study (Takahashi et al. 2019) shows that modern Japanese (Yamato) do not have much Jōmon ancestry at all. Nuclear genome analysis of Jōmon samples and modern Japanese samples show strong differences. Another study suggests that Yamato people have 14-20% Jōmon ancestry assuming that modern Ainu people descend from the Jōmon.斎藤成也、『日本人の源流』、河出書房新社、2017、p.163-164 The existence of two generations of Yayoi immigration were suggested. Earlier one is the immigrants of sea people from the area on the coast of the Yellow Sea possibly related to Siberian people or Southeast Asian people.斎藤成也、『日本人の源流』、河出書房新社、2017、p.184-186.

Moray indicated that modifications in basic cockpit geometry are required to accommodate Japanese and Vietnamese pilots. Moray said that the Japanese have longer torsos and a higher shoulder point than the Vietnamese, but the Japanese have about similar arm lengths to the Vietnamese, so the control stick would have to be moved 8 cm closer to the pilot for the Japanese and 7 cm closer to the pilot for the Vietnamese.

The conservation park consists of land in sections 92, 302, 522, 682, 683, 688 and 850 of the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Kuitpo, and which is an area bounded in the south by a sealed road, Woodgate Hill Road, by the locality's boundary with the locality of Kuitpo in the west and in part to the north, and in the east by an unsealed track, Blackfellows Creek Road. The Heysen Trail, the long distance walking trail, passes through the middle of the conservation park entering from the south via Woodgate Hill Road. Its protected area status began on 12 November 1964 as a wildlife reserve proclaimed under the National Park and Wild Life Reserves Act 1891-1960 in respect to sections 92, 522, 688, and 850. On 3 August 1967, section 302 and all of the land in the wildlife reserve were proclaimed under the National Parks Act 1966 as the Kyeema National Park. On 27 April 1972, it was reconstituted as the Kyeema Conservation Park upon the proclamation of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972. On 4 April 1974, Sections 682 and 683 were added to the conservation park. As of 2016, it covered an area of . Prior uses of the land included use of section 522 both as a \\"labour prison reserve\\" and a camping ground. The labour prison reserve which was known initially as the Kyeema Afforestation Camp and then as the Kyeema Prison Camp was gazetted on 27 October 1932 and operated until 1959 when it was replaced by the Cadell Training Centre. The camping ground was operated by the National Fitness Council of South Australia from 1 September 1962 to 31 July 1964. In 1980, the conservation park's listing on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate argued it to be significant for the following reasons: > A Park containing areas of very dense natural vegetation providing an > excellent refuge for substantial populations of native fauna. Notable > mammals include Isoodon obesulus (endangered in South Australia) and Rattus > leutreolus (northern limit of South Australian range). Notable birds include > the threatened scaly thrush and the uncommon beautiful firetail. Many > uncommon plants are found within the Park, including the endangered Lomandra > multiflora. In 1980, the vegetation of conservation park was described as follows: > A dissected plateau which supports Eucalyptus obliqua  E. baxteri open > forest, frequently associated with E. cosmophylla  E. fascilulosa. Areas of > extremely thick vegetation occur along some drainage lines and in areas of E > cosmophylla  E fasciculosa scrub open areas, some of which are still being > grazed, provide valuable feeding habitat for Macropus fuliginosus. The Park > supports good populations of the typical Mount Lofty faunal assemblages. In February 1983, it was damaged by the Ash Wednesday bushfires and became the focus of “a revegetation project involving local school students.” In the first three years after commencement, “approximately 20,000 seedlings were planted” in an area now officially known as The Childrens Forest. The replanting project continues under the control of a volunteer group known as The Friends of Kyeema Conservation Park which was formed in 1985 and which celebrated thirty years of operation in 2015. The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area. ==See also== *Protected areas of South Australia ==References== * ==External links== *Official webpage *Kyeema Conservation Park webpage on the Protected Planet website *Kyeema Conservation Park webpage on the BirdsSA website *Friends of Kyeema webpage on the Friends of Parks website Category:Conservation parks of South Australia Category:Protected areas established in 1964 Category:1964 establishments in Australia Category:South Australian places listed on the defunct Register of the National Estate ","title":"Kyeema Conservation Park"},{"id":"56826282","text":"iClassical Foundation is a non-profit organisation organised according to the Swiss law, it is domiciled in Crans-Montana. The foundation is committed to producing educational online video tools for musicians, in particular master classes. All operational activities are delegated to iClassical Academy Ltd. The goal is to encourage and enable a generation of young and talented musicians, as well as professionals, teachers and amateurs to enhance their skills and become artists who share their music with audiences all over the world. Moreover, it strives to connect them with some of the world's most accomplished teachers. For the time being, the focus is on master classes for piano, violin, cello, and trumpet. The website and its content are provided in english. == Mission == The mission of iClassical Academy is to provide young musicians from around the world with the opportunity of improving their skills and being appreciated by wider audiences. Advanced students often find themselves excluded from masterclasses because of lack of funds. Additionally, many music schools in emerging countries are unable to afford the cost of employing the best quality teachers. The credo is: \\"We believe that anyone at any time should have access to very good music teachers. == Business model == iClassical Academy works as a club. Memberships is free for access to previews and special content. Access to all masterclasses and webinars requires a fee. == Method == So far, tradition has almost always been to show online the filming of a masterclass for students in the classroom or on the stage. iClassical Academy departs from this in order to have the masterclasses divided into tutorials as well as a separate performance of the student. Their focus is on the teaching part instead of showing a masterclass in its integrality. The motivation is that online teaching according to iClassical Academy should have a different scope that is more focused on the viewer at home. The academy has also introduced the slow motion tool for its videos. It plans to introduce the multicamera tool. They will allow the student to see the hands' positions on the instrument from different angles. == Founders == Edgar Cohen, a native of France is a Medical Doctor, an entrepreneur and passionate about classical music and art. In 2011 he came up with the idea of creating a website to make classical music masterclasses available all over the world, by collaborating with well known professors and artists. He currently lives in Tel Aviv, where he has founded two medical centres. Pierre Perrenoud, a native of Western Switzerland, spent most of his life in Zurich and travelling all over the world for professional reasons (reinsurance) and to satisfy his cultural interests.

I hope and believe that the women’s heavy- and open weight divisions will grow via depth in fighters, fans, popularity, and significance. I feel at this moment we are seen as a “joke” in the sport; there are promoters, organizations, and people who see us as “fat chicks” – unpleasant and distasteful to their eyes. My response to those people is always, ‘To each his own!‘ We are a determined and powerful group of women, in and out of the cage. We will not stop paving this road until we can claim a championship belt.” ==Mixed Martial Arts Career== For her first heavyweight fight, Yarbrough faced Crystal Parson at The Warriors Cage 24 in Porterville California on April 1, 2016.

It is a small species from the waters around northern Australia and Indonesia. ==Description== The little flying squid is said to be dwarf species of flying squid compared to the other species of Todarodes, the largest female recorded to date had a mantle length of 74mm and the largest male measured 68mm mantle. The maximum mantle length is not thought to exceed 100mm, compared to 500mm for the Japanese flying squid. It also has relatively small fins which only have a length equivalent to 25 to 31% of the mantle length (35-40% in the Japanese flying squid). It has a cylindrical, muscular body, typical of related species, which tapers to a short, pointed tail. Its fourth right arm bears a hectocotylus on the distal half and has 11-13 normal suckers on its basal portion, ventral trabeculae which are broadened and joined forming low serrated fan with approximately 20 pairs of trabeculae. The second and third arms on each side are longer than the first and fourth arms being slightly less than half of the mantle length. The largest arm suckers have 9-11 sharp different sized teeth on distal two thirds of their rings. The height of the protective membrane on the arms is uniform and it is not higher than that of the suckers. The manus of the tentacles has 6-8 sucker rows in four series and the rings of the medial suckers on the manus have 16-18 moderately large, subconical teeth which alternate with low plates and are around 2.5 times largers than the marginal suckers in diameter. On the tentacles the protective membranes extends to the carpal region, its height never exceeds the sucker height and it has weak supports. ==Distribution== The little flying squid is found in northern Australia where it occurs in the regions of the continental shelf and upper continental slope. Its distribution extends from the Timor Sea and along the eastern coast of Australia from the Torres Strait south to waters off Brisbane. It has also been recorded in a narrow band extending north from the Timor Sea through the Indonesian archipelago to Mindanao in the southern Philippines. ==Habitat and biology== The little flying squid's biology is little known. All speciemsn caight to date have been caught at depths of between 78m and 357m where the water temperature at depths of 50m was greater than 23 °C and that at the surface could reach 29 °C in the summer. A single trawl has caught up to 54 individuals which suggests that this species forms schools. Any females caught which are larger than 60 mm mantle length have all been sexually mature, with eggs present in their oviducts and all males with mantle lengths greater than 50mm bore mature spermatophores. ==Taxonomy== The little flying squid has been considered to be a subspecies of the Japanese flying squid but distinct differences are evident between the two taxa. More analysis, both morphological and molecular, is required to clarify their relationships. There are specimens from Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Philippines which were described intermediate in some characters between the nominate form and the taxon treated here as Todarodes pusillus. The smaller size and rapid gaining of sexual maturity in this taxa may be a result of living at higher temperatures than the related temperate form. ==References== Category:Squid Category:Molluscs described in 1988 ","title":"Little flying squid"},{"id":"56826374","text":"Quarry Wood is a nature reserve east of West Farleigh, which is south-west of Maidstone in Kent.

From 1986, Yanagi began to exhibit artwork such as those using ants and soil balls that represent dung beetle rolled balls, addressing the issues of “movement” from the perspective of an outsider of the art world’s system. Yanagi had an opportunity to exhibit works at the Hillside Gallery in Daikanyama, where he showed various pieces including a smoke performance piece I Feel Yellow. Yanagi was awarded the Excellence Award in Art Document from the Tochigi Prefectural Art Museum of Fine Arts in 1987. Yanagi moved to United States after he received a scholarship from the Sculpture Department of the Graduate School of Yale University School of Art in 1988, where he studied under Vito Acconci, Frank Gehry, among others. His graduating piece, Wandering Mickey earned him an excellence award. After graduating from Yale, Yanagi held solo exhibitions first in New York’s Storefront for Art and Architecture in 1990, and in 1991 in Los Angeles’s LACE (Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions). It was then that his work, The World Flag Ant Farm (1990) was exhibited. This piece features national flags made of sand being destroyed by ants moving through them. This work was featured on the cover of Art in America, one of the leading art magazines in the States. Yanagi moved to New York where he started to work internationally. The World Flag Ant Farm was awarded the Aperto Award at the 45th Venice Biennale in 1993. He created an art project on Alcatraz Island, San Francisco Bay’s former prison island, in 1996. Yanagi’s “Hinomaru-series” works feature Japanese pop culture icons and attracted attention as it touched on the issues of Japanese social, political and economic ideologies. It has been influential on artists of the same generation including Takashi Murakami and Masato Nakamura. “Hinomaru-series” includes Hi- no-maru 1/36, shown at New York’s Storefront For Art and Architecture just before the Gulf War, Self-Defence at Hillside Gallery in 1990, using Tamiya’s toy military tanks and Banzai Corner at Hosomi Gallery in 1990, with hundreds of Ultraman and Ultra Seven superhero figurines. In 1992, with the aid of the Asian Cultural Council, Yanagi was invited to the PS1 Studio Program in New York. In the same year, he exhibited Hi-no-maru Illumination, a huge Japanese flag in neon at the Fuji TV Gallery. He was also invited to open a solo exhibition at the Naoshima Contemporary Art Museum (now Benesse House at Benesse Art Site Naoshima), which had only newly opened in 1992. His stay on Naoshima inspired an idea for a new work on an island in the Seto Inland Sea. After three years of looking for an appropriate site, he came across Okayama Prefecture’s Inujima, which is dotted with copper refinery ruins dating back to the Meiji Period, and the idea of the Inujima Project was formed. He began traveling between New York and Inujima. In 1995, Yanagi’s vision for the revitalization of the whole island of Inujima by turning the copper refinery ruins into art and using renewable energy, was realized with the support from Benesse Corporation’s CEO at the time, Soichiro Fukutake. In 2008, Inujima Art Project’s “Seirensho”, which combines features of the house of Yukio Mishima and Heritage Industrial Modernization, opened and is now known as Inujima Seirensho Art Museum. The project took a total of 13 years to complete. It became a forerunner of Art Setouchi, the art projects on the islands in the Seto Inland Sea. In 2000, Yanagi became the first foreign artist living in New York to be invited to exhibit at the Whitney Biennial, alongside Cai Guo- Qiang. Yanagi presented his “Study For American Art” series, which included his Three Flags, Jasper Jones inspired piece. In the same year, after the first retrospective exhibition at Hiroshima City Contemporary Art Museum, and just before the September 11 attacks, Yanagi closed his studios in New York and San Francisco, moving to a self-designed studio situated on the north face of the mountains facing the Genkai Sea, in Itoshima City, Fukuoka prefecture. The solar energy system used there is passed on to the Inujima Project. In 2005, after returning to Japan, Yanagi began working as an associate professor in the Faculty of Art at Hiroshima City University. He started contemporary art and theory major in the faculty of Arts and launched the Hiroshima Art Project, utilizing unused facilities due to the exposure to radiation, as sites to exhibit artworks. The Inujima Art House Project during the 1st Art Setouchi in 2010, featured three installations in the Inujima village, by Yanagi in collaboration with architect Kazuyo Sejima. After the completion of the Inujima Project, he took on the challenge of transforming an old junior high school on the remote island of Momoshima Island, Onomichi City, Hiroshima prefecture, to make ART BASE MOMOSHIMA, and work in the Onomichi Channel area. In 2016, Yanagi’s large-scale solo exhibition at Yokohama’s BankART1929 explored the 30 years of his artwork and took up the whole museum. He unveiled Project God-zilla, a work about the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster of 2011. This exhibition was selected as the best exhibition of the year from both the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper and the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper. ==Notable artwork and Public collections== Banzai Corner(1991) - Fukutake Foundation, Japan Hinomaru Illumination(1992) - The Museum of Art, Kochi , Japan Hinomaru Container - Yamato Tumulus Type (1992) - Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo Chrysanthemum Carpet (1994) - National Gallery of Australia Article 9 (1994) The Forbidden Box (1995) - The Fabric Workshop and Museum, Philadelphia, USA Pacific - The Ant Farm Project - (1996) - Tate Modern, United Kingdom Dollar Pyramid (2000) - Virginia Museum of Fine Arts Inujima Seirensho Art Museum (2008) - Fukutake Foundation, Japan Icarus Cell (2016) Project God-zilla - Landscape with an Eye - (2016) ==See also== Vito Acconci Frank Gehry Soichiro Fukutake Yukio Mishima Jasper Jones Venice Biennale == References  Inujima Seirensho Art Museum ART BASE MOMOSHIMA Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese emigrants to the United States Category:Japanese contemporary artists Category:Yale University alumni Category:21st-century American artists Category:21st-century Japanese artists Category:20th-century American artists Category:20th-century Japanese artists Category:People from Fukuoka Category:Artists from Fukuoka Prefecture ","title":"Yukinori Yanagi"},{"id":"56826456","text":"Nuclear factor of activated T cells 2 interacting protein is a protein that in humans is encoded by the NFATC2IP gene. == References  External links == * PDBe-KB provides an overview of all the structure information available in the PDB for Human NFATC2-interacting protein (NFATC2IP) == Further reading == ","title":"NFATC2IP"},{"id":"56826459","text":"NFAT activating protein with ITAM motif 1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the NFAM1 gene. ==Function== The protein encoded by this gene is a type I membrane receptor that activates cytokine gene promoters such as the IL-13 and TNF-alpha promoters.

Recommended.\\" On All About Jazz Mathew Bahl noted: \\"Easy Living, Etta Jones’ wonderful new CD, is a celebration of a reunion and a partnership. The partnership is, of course, Ms. Jones’ longstanding collaboration with Houston Person. Mr. Person has played on and/or produced nearly all of Ms. Jones’ recordings since 1976. The reunion is with pianist Richard Wyands who in 1960 played for Ms. Jones on her breakthrough album, Don't Go to Strangers. Ms. Jones’ nasal, instantly identifiable tone has only grown richer and more textured with age ... she makes the meaning of every song utterly explicit and delivers lyrics with an honesty that defies traditional notions of interpretation. In fact, of today's jazz singers, only Abbey Lincoln can match the sheer authority of Ms. Jones’ singing ...

She was captured and forcefully taken into sexual slavery by a Japanese soldier in the middle of the night. After liberation in 1945, she could not return to her hometown because of what had happened to her as a comfort woman. Kang Duk-kyung later became a human rights activist. She started to live in the House of Sharing in late 1992. While staying at the House of Sharing, she participated in an art therapy program where she began painting. Her art centers on her experiences as a 'comfort woman.' == Background == Kang Duk-kyung was born in Jinju, South Gyeongsang Province in 1929. Her father died when she was a young girl and her mother was remarried. As a result, she lived in her grandmother's house. She was a 14-year-old student at Yoshino School when one of her male Japanese teachers advised her to enter the Hujikosi airplane factory to work. He said it was a decent, well paying job. Kang Duk-kyung stated, “One hundred fifty people got on a ferryboat in Busan because their Japanese teachers said it was a good opportunity to earn money.” She eventually left the Hujikosi airplane factory in 1944 when she experienced hard working conditions and faced hunger. Several months later, at 15 years old, she was captured and taken by a soldier in the middle of the night. This was the beginning of her life as a militarized sex slave. Kang Duk-kyung returned home a year after Korea's liberation, in January 1946. During this time she had also given birth to a baby. In returning home with child, Kang Duk-kyung's mother kicked her out of the house. With little support, Kang Duk-kyung decided to leave her child with a Catholic orphanage in Busan. Kang Duk-kyung stated, “I had no affection for my child at that time.” Her feelings towards her child eventually changed. She was working in a restaurant in Busan and decided to go visit the baby one day, only to be informed that her baby had died. She was told that the cause of the child's death was pneumonia and was not permitted to identify the body. Kang stated “I still don't believe it because I haven't seen my child in real life. Since then, I have been devastated.” Her experience as a 'comfort woman' also left her with lifelong debilitating health issues. Her reproductive system was compromised and she poured most of her money into medical bills throughout her life. Kang Duk-kyung died in 1997 after a long battle with lung cancer. == Activism == Soon after Kim Hak-sun came forward with her story in 1991, Kang Duk-kyung began speaking publicly about her experiences as well. She moved into the House of Sharing along with Kim Bok-dong and Kim Soon-duk. Like the other survivor-residents, Kang Duk-kyung was upset that the Japanese government and military denied their involvement with the torture that she and others had endured during their time as ‘comfort women.’ She committed to advocating and bringing awareness to the issue of sexual slavery and the lives of other ‘comfort women.’ She protested and raised awareness with many broadcast and media interviews. She became one of the movement's most outspoken members, testifying at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva and at an assembly in Japan at the invitation of a Japanese civic group. She fiercely demanded a legal apology from the Japanese government. Kang Duk-kyung faithfully and enthusiastically participated in the Wednesday Demonstrations. Kang Duk-kyung's overall health was failing and she often had to shuffle between being in the intensive care unit and a general ward. Despite this, her enthusiasm and commitment to other ‘comfort women’ and the movement, prevailed. She participated in the Wednesday Demonstration whenever she recovered a bit of strength. In 1996, in the later stage of her cancer battle, Kang Duk-kyung attended the Wednesday demonstration in a hospital ambulance. Kang Duk-kyung was prolific during her time at the House of Sharing in the art therapy program. Her works have been exhibited globally and contribute to raising awareness of the 'comfort women' issue.

The ordinance was officially proclaimed on January 24, 2012. The push for Seoul's ordinance came after both the Gyeonggi Province (2010) and City of Gwangju (2011) enacted their respective ordinances. In addition to political initiatives for the ordinance, there were several groups advocating for its passage, like Common Action for Sexual Minority Students and the Youth Human Rights Group, Asunaro. The objective of the Seoul Ordinance of Student Rights, as it states in its first chapter, is \\"to ensure that all students' dignity and values as human beings are fulfilled and that they can live a free and happy life.\\" The ordinance provides a variety of provisions and protections to students attending kindergartens, elementary schools, and high schools in Seoul. The ordinance protects student’s freedom of conscience and religion as well as their freedom of expression, which includes demonstrations and forms of protest on school grounds. The ordinance also offers protective guidelines against discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation, physical violence (corporal punishment), compulsory studying after school hours, among many other protective clauses. It is important to note that Seoul's Ordinance of Student Rights in not legally binding, but works more as an educational charter for school administrators in Seoul. The ordinance also stipulates rules around a governing Student Human Right Committee that oversees the implementation of the ordinance in schools, as well as handle issues or violations that may surface as the ordinance is in place. The ordinance also includes guidelines for a Student Participation Committee, which is meant to represent Seoul's student population in relation to the Student Human Rights committee. ==Controversy and Backlash== Despite the overwhelming public and political support for the passage of the Seoul Ordinance of Student Rights, there were several instances of community and political pushback. Groups like the Korean Federation of Teachers’ Association (KFTA) adamantly opposed the adoption of the ordinance, citing a poll in which 76% of teachers in Seoul disagreed with the ordinance . The KFTA has also stated that the rights of children in kindergarten in accordance with Seoul's ordinance, are a show of \\"‘human rights populism’ and that [Seoul's ordinance] neglects duty and responsibility in the name of protecting human rights.”“It amounts to ‘human rights populism” that neglects duty and responsibility in the name of protecting human rights.” Other groups like The Association of Mothers Concerned about Education and The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST) also voiced their opposition of the ordinance. ==2017 Amendment== In September, 2017, the Seoul Metropolitan Council amended the Seoul Ordinance of Student Rights to expand on provisions against hate speech. This move was made amidst mounting worries of verbal abuse in Seoul's schools. == Corporal Punishment == Prior to the enactment of the Seoul Ordinance of Student Rights there was a specific ban on all forms of corporal punishment enacted by the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education in July 2010. It was spearheaded by the head of the office, Kwak No-hyun. Chapter 2 Section 2 Articles 6 (Right to be Free from Violence) and 7 (Right to Safety from Danger) are the direct sections which refer to corporal punishment and violence within the ordinance. Article 6 explicitly bans all physical and verbal abuse including; corporal punishment, bullying, sexual violence. Students are to be free from intentional disclosure of information that may lead to harassment due to prejudices of a particular group or social minority. The head of schools must make sure to prevent all physical and verbal abuse as described above. Article 7 states school leaders should maintain a safety management system to ensure student safety. If any accidents are to occur at school, school leaders are to help rescue the victims quickly and cooperate with relevant authorities and local residents to prevent damages. There has been a ban in place prior to the enactment of the Ordinance, but both are hard to enforce, so even though corporal punishment is seen as detrimental to the mental health and learning environment of students there is little to currently stop it from continuing. === Backlash === People who are opposed to the ordnance fear that the banning of corporal punishment will lead to teachers diminished ability to control their classrooms and to punish violent students. Some who are opposed believe that the protections put forth by the ordinance are redundant because there are already laws against discrimination and corporal punishment. Corporal punishment continues, despite the ban and ordinance, in private schools because they often have a set of rules that attending students agree to and the schools often get permission from parents. ===LGBT Protections=== The Seoul Student Human Rights Ordinance is the first student rights ordinance in South Korea to include protection on the basis of gender identity. The inclusion of protections on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation in the Ordinance were highly controversial, with conservative organizations arguing that these protections promote homosexuality and progressive organizations claiming the protections protect LGBT students. In 2011, many student and nonprofit organizations mobilized to pass a Seoul Student Human Rights Ordinance that included protections on the basis of sexual minority status and gender identity. In early 2011, groups like the Korean gay men's organization Chingusai began collecting signatures in favor of the Ordinance from the public and performing signing ceremonies. Major signing campaigns were hosted at Children’s Grand Park on March 6, 2011 and in Seoul Plaza on May 6–7, 2011. The efforts of such events culminated in the acquisition of over 90,000 signatures from Seoul citizens approving the Ordinance and its protections for LGBT students. As the ordinance received increasing public support, the protections for LGBT students were targeted by conservative groups. In order to ensure the inclusion of LGBT protections in the ordinance, multiple LGBT organizations including Chingusai and Solidarity for LGBT Rights of Korea collaborated to hold three emergency meetings on September 14, September 22 and October 4, 2011. Together, LGBT groups organized social media initiatives, spoke at public events such as the 2011 National Workers Convention, and orchestrated protests. === Implementation of the Ordinance === Many cases where the ordinance has been implemented have been observed within the education system. In Seoul, a middle school ethics teacher was investigated by the Office of Education due to her hateful comments addressed toward homosexual individuals. The students reported their teacher to an online portal for petitions called Sinmungo. The informants claimed the teacher said, “homosexuality is an abominable and filthy crime. Homosexuals should be gathered in one place and burned.” Under the Ordinance for Students’ Rights, no minorities could be discriminated against. Homosexual individuals also fell into the minority category and the teacher was investigated. Another case where the Ordinance of Students’ Rights was implemented was in 2016, when an instructor at a private university in Seoul was fired for hate speech. The instructor was hired to teach liberal arts but instead she used her platform to promote a hateful attitude towards homosexuality. During class she referred to homosexuality as a disease and claimed that all homosexual individuals were infected with HIV/AIDS. She pushed her students to complete assignments that forced them to agree with her views, which eventually led to students organizing and protesting to get her fired. She was then fired from her position. The university made it a requirement following that incident for teachers to refrain from engaging in hate speech. === Progress for Minority Students in Higher Education === The Ordinance of Students’ Rights served as a gateway to the Seoul National University Human Rights Guidelines. The importance of having students’ voices be heard is found in the creation of anti-discriminatory legislature such as this. On September 7, 2016 the Seoul National University Human Rights Guidelines were added upon during a meeting which unanimously voted to pass the law that prevents people from discriminating against sexual minorities. This faced a lot of backlash from religious organizations such as the Seoul National University Christian Faculty Association and the Christian Alumni Association. Regardless of the backlash, sexual minorities would be protected under the new guidelines that were passed. There has also been in increase in the election of students who have came out as being homosexual to serve as council members on the university councils. One example of a homosexual individual who has been elected to serve on a university council is Bo-mi—who was elected to be president of the Seoul National University student council. == References  See also == * Ordinance of Student Rights * SOGILAW Annual Review Category:Education in Seoul ","title":"Seoul Ordinance of Student Rights"},{"id":"56826750","text":"Paramavaishnavi Goswamini Devi or Tribhuvana Mahadevi I (Odia: ପ୍ରଥମ ତ୍ରିଭୁବନ ମହାଦେବୀ) was the first female ruler of the Bhaumakara Dynasty in ancient Odisha and the widow of king Santikara I who ascended the throne of Toshali or Utkala between the years 843 A.D to 845 A.D and ruled until 850 A.D after the premature death of her ruling son Subhakara III. Some historians believe that she might have ruled as long as 863 A.D abdicating the throne for her grandson Santikara II after he turned older and eligible to run the administration. She was a very powerful female ruler and found appreciating mentions as a beholder of lavish power and prestige by the Arab and Persian geographer Ibn Khordadbeh and explorer Ahmad Ibn Rustah. She rose to power despite feudal kings of coastal-central parts of erstwhile Tri-Kalinga region rebellions and with the help her powerful father. She compared herself with the Goddess Katyayani (a form of Goddess Shakti) when she ascended the throne at Guheswarapataka mentioned in her Dhenkanal charter. She is also credited for the construction of the Baitala Deula which is one of the oldest surviving temple structures standing erect to this day in old Bhubaneswar and one of the few in Odisha built in Khakara style temple architecture. == Origin and Personality of the Queen == Vaitala Deula or Baitala Temple at Bhubaneswar Built by Tribhuvana Mahadevi in a mixed Kalingan and Dravidian architecture The origin of Tribhuvana Mahadevi I as a royalty is still disputable among historians as it is believed by some that she was the daughter the king Rajamalla I of Mysore while other historians rest their theory that she was the daughter of a king from the early Eastern Gangas from the southern neighbor of the Bhaumakara kingdom. The Dhenkanal charter of queen herself gives an indication about how the Eastern Gangas of Kalinga were first defeated by the earlier Bhaumakara king Sivakara I and then restored to power after they accepted his suzerainty, establishing relationship of good faith between the two royal families which could have ended up in matrimonial alliances. Her descendant Sivakara III mentions in his inscriptions that Tribhuvana mahadevi I was filled with three energies Mantra Shakti (the power of divine chants), Prabhu Shakti (Spiritualism) and Utsaha Shakti (energetic). She was described as a Pitrabhakta (devout child to her parents) meditating at the feet of her parents. Her Dhenkanal charter has associated full imperial epithets to her and describes that as a person she was adorned with hundreds of auspicious signs to be a superior ruler in the world. She was a devout Vaishnavite who worshiped Hari and took the epithet as Paramavaishnavi. == Ascension to the Throne == The Dhenkanal charter issued by Tribhuvana mahadevi I describes her ascension as \\" her lotus-like feet being softly kissed by the crowns and headpieces of the great vassal and feudal kings, bowing down in devoted loyalty before her and the foot-stool of her late husband became radiant with the splendor of the diamonds in those diadems of the subjugated kings\\". In the preceding years before the ascension of her husband Santikara I, the Pala dynasty king Devapala had defeated the reigning king Sivakara II and subjugated the Bhaumakara rulers in Odisha. The dynasty had lost its prestige and power after this defeat which was followed by disorder in the kingdom. The subsequent deaths of Santikara I and Subhakara III as the male eligible heirs, gave rise to rebellion by feudal kings. The inscriptions of later Bhaumakara kings states that the widowed queen took upon the burden of administration of the entire kingdom and shone like Sesha, holding up the entire earth on her hood. The queen herself has credited her father to have come to rescue of the Bhaumakara rule suppressing the rebellions and helping her restore authority and order in the kingdom. == Administration of the Kingdom == According to the charters issued by her and her descendants she is credited to have ensured an effective administration of the kingdom and prosperity of the people. Talcher plate of Subhakara IV states that during her rule the country advanced in administration, enemies were destroyed, the glory of the kingdom spread abroad and the people lived in harmony. She paid special attention in appointment of responsible and honest royal officials and the vassals of the kingdom stayed loyal to her supremacy. She exerted Mrudukara (light taxation) on her people. Her Dhenkanal charter talks about how Bhaumas exhausted treasures of their vast empire on religious works in order to enlighten their own country and others, and decorated the earth by constructing in unbroken continuity, various mathas, monasteries and temples. During her rule and as evident from her grants and charter issued during her rule, she patronized Vaishnavism, Shaivism and Shaktism while the existence of the Jain and Buddhist ideologies in the kingdom remained uninfluenced by any kind of threat. Women in the kingdom were educated and able exert special powers and administrative rights for issuing land grants and charters. She was able to suppress internal rebellions and expel the enemy forces of the Rashtrakutas and Palas with the help of her father securing the kingdom from any external threats. She commanded a standing army of 3,00,000 men and women were also believed to have indulged in military affairs. She restored stability to the kingdom after a long era of chaos and disorder initiating a golden era of stability, economic prosperity and cultural growth. She served as an example for a line of another six descendant female rulers who ruled in the Bhaumakara kingdom in their own rights despite the availability of heirs and two of which even adopted her royal epithet as Tribhuvana Mahadevi. == References == Category:History of Odisha Category:History of India by region Category:Queens regnant Category:9th-century women rulers Category:Ancient Indian women Category:9th- century Indian monarchs ","title":"Tribhuvana Mahadevi I"},{"id":"56826770","text":"Thomas Paul Burgess is an academic, novelist and musician from Belfast, Northern Ireland.

Charles Manthorpe (31 March 1836 – 6 December 1898) was a Congregationalist minister remembered for his 36-year pastorate in Glenelg, South Australia. ==History== Manthorpe was born and grew up in Norwich, East Anglia, and began his working life as a teacher in nearby Peafield, and was engaged as a lay preacher in nearby villages. Encouraged and guided by his pastor, Rev Mr. Alexander, he studied for the Christian ministry and after a few years was appointed to the Congregational Church at Long Stretton, then in 1856 was called to Newport, Essex, where he was ordained and succeeded the old Rev. Mr. Hopkins. Glenelg Congregational church c. 1870 This was at a time when missionaries were competing to develop churches in the farthest reaches of the British Empire, and at Rev. J. L. Poore's urging Manthorpe accepted a call to South Australia in 1858. On arrival he was posted to the churches of Happy Valley and Morphett Vale, whose incumbent, the Rev. A. R. Philps had been transferred to Truro. In 1861 he was appointed co-pastor of the old Freeman Street (now Gawler Place, Adelaide) church, whose pastor C. W. Evan was in poor health. In May 1862 he was called to take over the Glenelg church, which was in serious trouble: the popular and enthusiastic Rev. Charles Edwin Palmer, who had on the basis of a swelling congregation taken out a large loan to replace the 1848 church, built by H. J. Moseley, then abruptly resigned to become ordained in the Church of England. By April 1861 the Sunday School was disbanded and the congregation shrunk to a dozen shouldering a debt of £1,300. Manthorpe commenced at Glenelg in May 1862, and immediately had the church interior finished and made more attractive. Under his pastorate the congregation returned and the Sunday School re-established and within a year the debt had been reduced by £500. He had a new manse built at a cost of £1,050. By 1877 the building was clearly inadequate to the purpose and plans were made for a replacement on the adjoining block at a total cost of £6,900. In September 1879 the new building measuring with seating for 700, now St Andrews Uniting Church, was opened at 92 Jetty Road, Glenelg. During his 36-year pastorate Manthorpe returned to England twice; on the first, undertaken in 1875 with his son Charles Edward, the ship's cargo of wool caught fire and the Aurora, on her maiden voyage, had to be abandoned off the Azores and the journey completed on another vessel. His second was undertaken in 1891 as a delegate to the International Council of Congregational Churches in London. Shortly after his return he resigned, leaving in 1892, though he remained the titular pastor until April 1898. For several years he was without a charge, preaching at special services and acting as temporary replacement as opportunity arose, notably the tiny New Parkside Congregational Church which had hitherto relied on lay preachers. Gradually attendance increased, and again the necessity for a larger building became evident. The foundation stone for the new building was laid by Mrs. S. J. Way. At its first service on 27 November 1898 Manthorpe was due to read the first lesson, but he was so frail, his eyesight so poor, and his voice so weak that his friend F. W. Cox was obliged to take over the duty.

She is an ex-Muslim atheist, feminist and humanist activist, and co-founder of advocacy group Faith to Faithless. She has also written under the pseudonym of Laylah Hussain. == Biography == Saleem was born in London into a Pakistani Sunni Muslim immigrant family. From age 6 to 11 she attended Deobandi Arabic-led madrasas, where she learnt the Arabic language and was taught Salafi Islam. When she was 11 years old, Saleem entered the Islamic girls' private boarding school Jamia Al-Hudaa in Nottingham. Around 12, she began having doubts about the truth and ethics of religion, especially the condemnation of homosexuality, but her questioning was branded \\"corruption\\" and she felt repeatedly repressed to \\"not pollute the minds of other girls\\". She was expelled in 2006 at the age of 15, accused of \\"narcissism\\" for owning a disposable camera and consequently publicly humiliated in front of the entire school. She went on to study Koranic interpretation at Farhat Hashmi's Al-Huda Institute in Mississauga near Toronto, Canada, which was intended to last a year. Finding the lessons in Urdu difficult, however, after two months she transferred to the Al-Huda Institute's campus in Pakistan to complete the course and, segregated and isolated from her family, she found herself \\"sucked in\\" by the repetition and religious zeal. She started to willingly wear the face veil (niqab), and in hindsight she considered her 17-year-old self to be a fundamentalist who wanted to proselytise when she returned to the UK. Back in Britain, where Saleem was no longer in a religiously restricted environment and had free access to books, media and television, her earlier doubts resurfaced. She started studying sociology, which examined religion from several new perspectives such as feminism and Marxism, and first exposed her to the concept that religions could serve as a means of social control. In the library, she came across Richard Dawkins' book The God Delusion, which first exposed her to the idea that God could be a human delusion and might not actually exist, and the theory of evolution, which she did not understand, and decided to spend a great deal of time on studying further. After that, she educated herself on cosmology, and read Carl Sagan's Pale Blue Dot; the sight of the iconic Pale Blue Dot photograph was the last straw, brought her to disbelief and made her a sceptic. By the age of 19, Saleem had reached a point where she no longer believed in Islam, and moved away from it. She believes that \\"The Islam that I grew up in, that had been, you know, shoved down my throat for years, was actually being shoved down my throat to actually control me. To control what I did, what I wore, who I spoke to, and what I ate and how I thought.\\" Saleem attended Brunel University in west London where she obtained a first class honours degree in English. She is a market researcher for Kantar having previously done parliamentary research work for the House of Lords. She is also a contributor and advice columnist to Sedaa, a website featuring writers from Muslim backgrounds. == Secular activism == her Islamic school in October 2014. In October 2014, Saleem first spoke out about her treatment at her Nottingham boarding school at the Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain's Secular Conference 2014. In November 2014, she also wrote a more detailed exposé about it in The Times under the pseudonym of Laylah Hussain. Saleem claimed that pupils were only taught various Islamic subjects from a fundamentalist perspective, indoctrinated them with anti-gay, anti-Christian and anti-Jewish views, and had no geography, history, art, sport or music classes. The science class omitted evolution and sex education, and she was taught that men are permitted to beat their wives. Due to the concerns she raised, the school was subjected to an unannounced inspection in April 2015, and rated as 'inadequate' by Ofsted as a result. When a second inspection in April 2016 did not show sufficient improvements, Jamia Al-Hudaa Residential College was threatened with partial or full closure. The school's management attempted to appeal the decision, while Saleem urged the Department for Education to \\"move swiftly now to protect these pupils.\\" Maryam Namazie interviews Aliyah Saleem about her Islamic school. In 2015 Saleem, with her colleague Imtiaz Shams, an ex-Muslim atheist from Saudi Arabia, co-founded the advocacy group Faith to Faithless. The organisation provides support for people leaving Islam and other minority religions, challenges discrimination faced by non-religious people and aims to create awareness of the issues involved in leaving religion. Saleem and Shams began by holding \\"coming out\\" events at universities, where ex-Muslims and other apostates could tell their stories in the presence of peers who had also been through deconversion. In 2015 Saleem represented Humanists UK (then the British Humanist Association) at a diversity chamber debate in the House of Lords in which she spoke about the discrimination and persecution faced by many ex-Muslim atheists in the UK and around the world. The following year she represented Faith to Faithless at a further debate in the Lords about the particular problems ex-Muslims face when leaving religion. In late 2015 and early 2016, Saleem recorded two videos offering strategies for Muslim or ex-Muslim women who no longer want to wear the hijab – she herself had worn a headscarf from the age of 11 – but are wary of the negative social consequences they may face for doing so. In April 2016 Saleem appeared in the BBC Radio 4 two-part documentary programme about the Deobandis, the isolationist traditional Muslim community that was responsible for her schooling and which controls the majority of Islamic religious schools in the UK. == Works == * == See also == * Ali A.

Before entering public office, Ogata was an officer in the Yemen office of UNDP. == Baby in assembly controversy == Ogata was the center of a November 2017 controversy in the City Assembly. Unable to obtain a nursery spot, she entered an assembly session with her infant son to highlight the difficulties facing children-raising working Japanese parents and the lack of nursery spaces. Soon after taking her seat, the council speaker Yoshitomo Sawada and his colleagues confronted her to ask why she had brought her infant into the chamber. After several minutes, Ogata yielded and was escorted to the speaker's office. She then returned to the delayed session alone after leaving her son in a friend's care. Sawada later apologised for opening the session 40 minutes late, but another assemblyman was heard to implicitly blame Ogata instead for the episode. The assembly did not have a rule prohibiting members to enter the chamber with their children, but the assembly considered the baby as a visitor, who is required to sit in the gallery. The local incident unexpectedly gained national and international prominence. It was cited as a proof that the current environment is hostile for Japanese women juggling between their careers and families, and even worse for those in politics. Commentators observed that Ogata's actions illustrated how the impact Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's womenomics policies were still limited. Ogata also criticised the fact that women with children were rarely consulted in policy making. Ogata was later reprimanded by the assembly for disrupting proceedings. The assembly passed a proposal in February, banning any non- members from entering the debating chamber as a response to the November incident. == References  External links == * Official website in Japanese.

MG Hay came to believe that the 271st had moved to a large clearing designated Landing Zone X-Ray ()(a different location from the landing zone of the same name that was the scene of the Battle of Ia Drang), where he suspected that the VC would be preparing to ambush a helicopter landing and so he ordered Col. Sidney Marks' 3rd Brigade to LZ Rufe () and then proceed overland to LZ X-Ray. On the morning of 17 June preceded by a moving barrage, the 1st Battalion, 16th Infantry Regiment, entered LZ X-Ray. The 1/16th Infantry established a perimeter 30-50m into the tree line around the clearing and waited for the 2nd Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment to arrive. As the first units of 2/28th Infantry arrived X-Ray, a patrol reported a group of VC approaching from the northwest. At 13:00 the VC attacked, penetrating the northern and northwestern perimeters before being forced back by artillery and gunship support. The VC then launched a second attack against the southeast perimeter and despite heavy defensive fire overran the defending platoon with the survivors withdrawing into the center of the perimeter to form a new defensive line. At 13:45 air strikes forced the VC to begin to withdraw and they disengaged under cover of a steady mortar barrage. U.S. losses were 35 killed. A search of the immediate area found 226 VC dead. Over the next few days the Americans found more VC dead, in one assembly area 35 were found killed by artillery and airstrikes. Airstrikes and ambushes were set on the 271st Regiment's likely withdrawal routes, but there was minimal additional contact. ==Aftermath== The operation concluded on 26 June 1967. It was considered a success with a total of 347 VC killed and 1 captured against U.S. losses of 57 killed. ==References== Category:1967 in Vietnam Category:Battles and operations of the Vietnam War Category:Battles and operations of the Vietnam War in 1967 Category:History of Bình Dương Province ","title":"Operation Billings"},{"id":"56826861","text":"Joséphine Fodor Joséphine Fodor (13 October 1789 or 1793 – 10 August 1870), also known under the name Joséphine Fodor-Mainvielle, was a French 19th- century lyrical artist (soprano).Alice-Marie Hanson, Musical Life in Biedermeier Vienna) (), Cambridge University Press, 1985, == Biography == Geneviève Joséphine Fodor, the daughter of composer and violinist Josephus Andreas Fodor (1751–1828) and Louise Edme Marmet, was born in Paris in 1789 or 1793.Several books and references mention 1789, which corresponds to the year deducted from the age indicated in her death certificate, but most of the works published in the 19th century give priority to 1793.

The Church teaches that while homosexual sexual acts, like all sexual acts outside of marriage, are sinful, having a homosexual orientation itself is not a sin. The Church's teaching has been described as \\"straightforwardly conservative\\" yet \\"quite complex and perhaps more nuanced than many other conservative denominational's perspectives\\". ==Catechism of the Catholic Church== The current Catechism of the Catholic Church summarizes the Church's teaching on homosexuality as follows: The earlier first provisional edition issued in 1992 had contained the line \\"They do not choose their homosexual condition; for most of them it is a trial.\\" This was changed in the 1997 definitive edition to say instead \\"This inclination, which is objectively disordered, constitutes for most of them a trial.\\" ===\\"Objectively disordered\\" and \\"intrinsically disordered\\"=== It has been said that within the Church's teaching on homosexuality there \\"are hidden nuances which 99 percent of the Catechism’s readers cannot be expected to fathom.\\" Included in this are the phrases \\"objectively disordered\\" and \\"intrinsically disordered,\\" terms which rise from the language of Catholic moral theology and Catholic philosophy. In this usage, the term \\"disordered\\" indicates a departure from the norm and not, as usage in English could suggest, sinful, demeaning, or sickly. In Catholic theology of sexuality, all sexual acts must be open to procreation and express the symbolism of male- female complementarity. As acts between two members of the same gender cannot meet these standards, the acts are described as \\"intrinsically disordered.\\" In a 2006 commentary, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger argued that some had misinterpreted the term \\"intrinsically disordered\\" to imply that the homosexual tendency could be good or even neutral. Gay people and others have found the terms to be \\"'offensive,' 'hard on the ears' or 'disrespectful'\\" and, because of this, they often feel ostracized. At the 2015 Synod on the Family, Archbishop Charles Chaput said that the phrase \\"intrinsically disordered\\" turns people off and \\"probably isn’t useful anymore.\\" While making clear that any new language adopted should make clear the Church's teaching, he said that this particular phrase should be put \\"on the shelf for a while, until we get over the negativity related to it.\\" ==Catholic theology of sexuality== According to the Catholic theology of sexuality, all sexual acts must be open to procreation and express the symbolism of male-female complementarity. Sexual acts between two members of the same gender cannot meet these standards. Homosexuality thus constitutes a tendency towards this sin. The church recognizes the difficulty of maintaining lifelong celibacy for LGBT people. According to Church teaching, \\"sexuality affects all aspects of the human person.\\" This is especially true of the \\"capacity to love and procreate and in a more general way the aptitude for forming bonds of communion with others. The Church points to several passages in the Bible as the basis for its teachings, including Genesis 19:1-11, Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13, I Corinthians 6:9, Romans 1:18-32, and I Timothy 10. ==Development of the Church's teachingPersona humana=== In 1975, during the pontificate of Pope Paul VI, the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued the document Persona humana (Human Person) dealing with sexual ethics. It stated that acceptance of homosexual activity runs counter to the church's teaching and morality. It drew a distinction between people who were homosexual because of \\"a false education [...] a lack of normal sexual development\\", or other curable non-biological causes and people who were innately or \\"pathological[ly]\\" homosexual. Little else was said about sexual orientation. It criticized those who argued that innate homosexuality justified same-sex sexual activity within loving relationships and stated that the Bible condemned homosexual activity as depraved, \\"intrinsically disordered,\\" never to be approved, and a consequence of rejecting God. As humans have free will, they can choose whether or not to act upon those attractions. Critics have argued that the \\"negative connotations\\" of the language in Persona Humana--for instance, referring to homosexuality as an \\"anomaly\\" that gay people \\"suffer[ed]\\" from--contrast with more neutral and even positive interpretations of homosexual orientation over the next ten years. However, these \\"overly benign\\" interpretations were to be challenged in 1986. ===On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons=== Benedict XVI, who as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was one of the signatories of the 1986 letter of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith on the Pastoral Care of Homosexuals In October 1986, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith released a letter addressed to all the bishops of the Catholic Church entitled On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons. This was signed by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger as prefect. The letter gave instructions on how the clergy should deal with, and respond to, lesbian, gay, and bisexual people. Designed to remove any ambiguity about permissible tolerance of homosexual orientation resulting from the earlier Persona Humana--and prompted by the growing influence of gay-accepting groups and clergy--the letter was particularly aimed at the church in the United States. It affirmed the position that while homosexual orientation is not in itself a sin, it is nevertheless a tendency towards the \\"moral evil\\" of homosexual activity, and therefore must be considered \\"an objective disorder\\". The letter went on to say that when homosexual activity is the result of deliberate choice, it is not made inculpable by natural sexual orientation. Furthermore, the letter argues that this natural homosexual orientation is \\"essentially self-indulgent\\" since homosexual sexual acts are not procreative and therefore not genuinely loving or selfless. The letter condemned physical and verbal violence against gay people and that \\"such treatment deserves condemnation from the Church's pastors wherever it occurs.\\" At the same time, it asserted that condemnation of violence did not mean that the homosexual orientation was good or neutral or that homosexual sexual acts should be permitted. The letter also said that accepting homosexual acts as morally equivalent to married heterosexual acts was harmful to the family and society and warned bishops to be on guard against, and not to support, Catholic organizations not upholding the Church's doctrine on homosexuality--groups which the letter said were not really Catholic. This alluded to LGBT and LGBT-accepting Catholic groups such as DignityUSA and New Ways Ministry, and ultimately resulted in the exclusion of Dignity from Church property. Critics have described the document as teaching \\"that a gay male or lesbian sexual identity is not to be celebrated, nor is it properly seen as a source of pride\\". The claims that accepting and legalizing homosexual behaviour leads to violence were seen as controversially blaming gay people for homophobic violence and encouraging homophobic violence. Referring to the AIDS epidemic, the letter, McNeill writes, blamed AIDS on gay rights activists and gay-accepting mental health professionals: \\"Even when the practice of homosexuality may seriously threaten the lives and well-being of a large number of people, its advocates remain undeterred and refuse to consider the magnitude of the risks involved\\". Andrew Sullivan called this comment \\"extraordinary for its lack of compassion\\" and added that \\"some of [the letter's] clauses read chillingly like comparable church documents produced in Europe in the 1930s.\\" ===1992 \\"Considerations\\"=== In a statement released in July 1992, \\"Some Considerations Concerning the Catholic Response to Legislative Proposals on the Non-Discrimination of Homosexual Persons,\\" the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith expanded previous teaching. It was originally only intended to be issued to the United States bishops, but it soon became public. The document said it was demeaning to homosexuals to assume that they were incapable of restraining themselves sexually and therefore the fact of being homosexual did not prevent gay sex from being sinful. It added that homophobic violence in either word or action was \\"deplorable,\\" saying that \\"neither the Church nor society at large should be surprised\\" when anti-gay hate crimes increase in the wake of gay civil rights legislation. It stated that discrimination against gay people in certain areas, such as selecting adoptive or foster parents or in hiring teachers, coaches, or military service members, is not unjust, and thus can be permitted in some circumstances. ===Synods on the Family=== At the 2014 Synod on the Family, the interim report asked if the Church was capable of guaranteeing gay Catholics \\"a place of fellowship in our communities\\" and \\"accepting and valuing their sexual orientation, without compromising Catholic doctrine on the family and matrimony.\\" It added that gay people have \\"gifts and qualities to offer the Christian community.\\" Cardinal Donald Wuerl argued that it was \\"not so much a change in the teaching of the Church, but a way of saying it that is far more inviting, far more welcoming.\\" The interim report's statements on homosexuality were described by gay rights advocates as \\"a seismic shift in tone toward acceptance of gays.\\" One priest commentator said that the language used \\"represents a revolutionary change in how the church addresses the LGBT community,\\" pointing to the document's lack of use of phrases such as \\"intrinsically disordered.\\" At the larger follow up Synod on the Family in 2015, the rejection of \\"exclusionary language\\" towards gays was a topic of discussion. One Synod member, who was not publicly identified, said that gay Catholics \\"are our children. They are family members. They are not outsiders. They are our flesh and blood. How do we speak about them [positively] and offer a hand of welcome?\\" According to Archbishop Mark Coleridge of Australia, there was strong support in the early days of the assembly for using a \\"less condemnatory approach,\\" especially regarding language, when pastorally caring for and speaking about gay Catholics, on the order of 70% in favor and 30% opposed. The final report repeated Church teaching that every person, gay or straight, should be treated with dignity and not face unjust discrimination, but also reaffirmed that marriage was between a man and a woman. It did not describe how the Church should minister directly to them, but did say that there should be outreach. ==Local perspectivesEurope===  Austria  In Austria, the blessing of same-sex unions has been offered in at least two parishes in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Linz. In May 2020, Austrian Romac catholic theologian Ewald Volgger published with support of Roman Catholic bishop Franz Lackner a book The benediction of same sex partnerships with liturgical advices, how a worship for blessings of same-sex partnerships can be.NesWaysMinistry: Archdiocese of Salzburg Publishes New Book on Church Blessings for Same-Gender Couples  Netherlands  The Dutch Catechism, first published in 1966, was the first post-Vatican II Catholic catechism and was an expression of the magisterium of the Dutch bishops, who commissioned and authorized it. The 1973 edition, issued after a Vatican review of the original text, dealt with the issue of homosexuality: \\"It is not the fault of the individual if he or she is not attracted to the other sex. The causes of homosexuality are unknown ... The very sharp strictures of Scripture on homosexual practices (Gen. 1; Rom. 1) must be read in their context.\\"  Germany  In January 2018, German bishop Franz-Josef Bode of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Osnabrück argued in an interview that blessing of same-sex unions in Catholic churches in Germany should be considered. In February 2018, Cardinal Reinhard Marx, chairman of the German Bishops' Conference agreed that such blessings should be looked at at the local level on a case by case basis.In June 2020, bishop Georg Bätzing from Roman Catholic Diocese of Limburg said, blessings of same-sex unions in Roman Catholic church should be allowed.Domradio.de: Reformen im Blick, 11.

April 2020 In June 2020, German bishop Helmut Dieser in Aachen said blessing of same-sex partnerships should be allowed in the Roman catholic church.Domradio.de: Reformen im Blick, 11. Juni 2020 ===United Kingdom=== Richard Scorer wrote that the leadership of the English Church has been \\"notably less homophobic than the Vatican\\", and that, in 1992, on publication of a statement by Cardinal Ratzinger, which Scorer said justified discrimination against homosexuals, Cardinal Basil Hume was said to be \\"appalled by the language and tone of the document\\" and privately distanced himself. In April 1997, Hume issued A note on the teaching of the Catholic Church concerning homosexuality. It stated that the Church recognises the dignity and right to respectful treatment of all people and does not see their \\"objective disorder\\" of homosexual people as making them wholly disordered. It also said that sexual activity ought only to take place within an opposite-sex marriage and said that the Church cannot \\"acknowledge amongst fundamental human rights a proposed right to acts which she teaches are morally wrong.\\" ===United States=== In 1976, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops wrote to American Catholics that gays \\"should have an active role in the Christian community.\\" In 1991, they called on \\"all Christians and citizens of good will to confront their own fears about homosexuality and to curb the humor and discrimination that offend homosexual persons. We understand that having a homosexual orientation brings with it enough anxiety, pain and issues related to self-acceptance without society bringing additional prejudicial treatment.\\" In 1997, the US Catholic Bishops Conference published a letter entitled Always Our Children, as a pastoral message to parents of gay and bisexual children with guidelines for pastoral ministers. It told parents not to break off contact with a gay or bisexual son or daughter; they should instead look for appropriate counseling both for the child and for themselves. The letter said that, while homosexual orientation is not sinful, homosexual activity is immoral. It added that \\"it is not sufficient only to avoid unjust discrimination. Homosexual persons 'must be accepted with respect, compassion and sensitivity'\\" and that \\"nothing in the Bible or in Catholic teaching can be used to justify prejudicial or discriminatory attitudes and behaviors.\\" Gay Catholics, the bishops said, should be allowed to participate actively in the Christian community and, if living chastely, hold leadership positions. It also noted \\"an importance and urgency\\" to minister to those with AIDS, especially considering the impact it had on the gay community, and the bishops \\"reject[ed] the idea that HIV/AIDS is a direct punishment from God.\\" ==See also== *History of the Catholic Church and homosexuality *Pastoral care for gay Catholics *Dissent from Catholic teaching on homosexuality *Homosexuality and Roman Catholic priests *Gay bishops *Political activity of the Catholic Church on LGBT issues *List of LGBT Catholics ==NotesReferencesWorks cited== * Category:LGBT and Catholicism ","title":"Catholic teaching on homosexuality"},{"id":"56826953","text":"Wellman is an unincorporated community in Massie Township, Warren County, in the U.S. state of Ohio. ==History== Variant names were \\"Henpeck\\", \\"Hen Peck\\", and \\"Wells\\".

It served in some of the bitterest fighting on the Western Front during World War I, including the Somme, Ypres and the German Spring Offensive. Before World War II it was converted to air defence, in which role it served during The Blitz and in Burma, where it employed anti- aircraft guns for 'bunker-busting'. Postwar, it continued to serve in Anti- Aircraft Command until 1955. ==Precursor units== The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs) composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett.Spiers, pp. 163–8.Westlake. A large number of independent RVCs were raised in the West Riding of Yorkshire, including the 'Barnsley Rifles' and the 'Rotherham Rifles' and in August 1860 some of these were grouped into the 4th Administrative Battalion, Yorkshire West Riding RVCs, based at Doncaster (dates are those of the first officers' commissions):Beckett, Appendix VII.Frederick, p. 324.Westlake, pp. 262–6. * 18th (Pontefract) Yorkshire West Riding RVC, 2 March 1860 * 19th (Rotherham) Yorkshire West Riding RVC, 29 February 1860London Gazette, 6 March 1860. * 20th (Doncaster, Great Northern Railway) Yorkshire West Riding RVC, 5 February 1860 * 21st (Doncaster Burgesses) Yorkshire West Riding RVC, 5 February 1860 * 36th (Rotherham) Yorkshire West Riding RVC, 19 October 1860, joined 4th Admin Bn 1862 * 37th (Barnsley) Yorkshire West Riding RVC, 21 November 1860, transferred from 3rd Admin Bn 1863 * 40th (Wath-upon-Dearne) Yorkshire West Riding RVC, March 1863, based at Hoyland Nether until 1866 The 20th RVC was recruited largely from employees of the Great Northern Railway (GNR) at Doncaster Works and was commanded by the railway's locomotive superintendent, Archibald Sturrock.Army List. The other units in the battalion were mainly recruited from coal mining and related industries. A Rotherham Rifle Band was formed and by August 1861 it was competing in brass band competitions.Brass Band Results. Walter Spencer-Stanhope (1827–1911) of Cannon Hall and Horsforth Hall, a Captain in the 2nd West Riding Yeomanry, who had raised the 36th RVC, was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel commanding the 4th Admin Bn on 11 February 1863. He later became Member of Parliament for the Southern Division of the West Riding (1872–80).London Gazette, 16 November 1860.London Gazette, 24 February 1863.Spencer Stanhope Mausoleum. A drill hall was built at Wharncliffe Street, Rotherham, in 1873, prior to which the 18th and 36th RVCs had used the Court House and Corn Exchange in the town. A drill hall was also built in Eastgate, Barnsley, in 1897.Barnsley at Drill Hall Project.

He finally retired from the command in 1895 and became Honorary Colonel of the battalion. He was knighted (KCB) in 1904.London Gazette, 21 June 1904. and died in 1911. Under the 'Localisation of the Forces' introduced by the Cardwell Reforms, the 8th was linked with the 2nd (Hallamshire) West Riding RVC, the 3rd West Yorkshire Militia and the Regular 65th (2nd Yorkshire, North Riding) and 84th (York & Lancaster) Regiments into Brigade No 7 (West Riding of Yorkshire). When the 65th and 84th were amalgamated to create the York and Lancaster Regiment in 1881 as part of the Childers Reforms, the 8th West Riding RVC was formally attached to it, becoming the 2nd Volunteer Battalion, York & Lancaster Regiment in 1883. An additional company was raised in 1884, and a Rotherham Cadet Corps existed from 1894 to 1899. The Stanhope Memorandum of December 1888 introduced a Mobilisation Scheme for Volunteer units, which would assemble in their own brigades at key points in case of war. In peacetime these brigades provided a structure for collective training.Beckett, pp. 135, 185–6.Dunlop, pp. 60–1; Appendix A.Spiers, pp. 228–9. Under this scheme the Volunteer Battalions of the York & Lancaster Regiment were included in the East Yorkshire Brigade. Volunteers from the battalion served in a Service Company alongside the Regulars of the regiment during the Second Boer War, gaining the battalion its first Battle Honour South Africa 1900–1902.Leslie. ==Territorial Force== When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908,Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. the battalion was split up: the companies from Rotherham (3), Barnsley (2) and Wath-upon-Dearne became 5th Battalion, York & Lancaster Regiment, while the companies from Doncaster (5) and Pontefract together with two companies from 1st VB King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry (KOYLI) became 5th Bn KOYLI.London Gazette 20 March 1908.

The two York & Lancaster TF battalions, together with those of the KOYLI, formed the III West Riding Brigade in the West Riding Division.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 85–91.49 Division at Long, Long Trail. ==World War IMobilisation=== Towards the end of July 1914, the units of the West Riding Division left their headquarters for their annual training camps, but on 3 and 4 August they were ordered to return; on 4 August immediate mobilisation was ordered. The 5th York & Lancasters mobilised at Rotherham under the command of Lt-Col C. Fox, TD, who had been CO since 1 April 1914.Magnus, p. 28 Shortly afterwards, TF units were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service and the majority of the battalion did so. On 15 August 1914, the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix while the parent unit took '1/'. In this way duplicate battalions, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas. Later they were mobilised for overseas service in their own right, and 3rd Line or Reserve units were formed.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6.Magnus, pp. 39, 71–2. ===1/5th Battalion=== After mobilisation, the 1st West Riding Division concentrated in the South Yorkshire area, and began training for war. On 31 March it was informed that it had been selected to proceed to France to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), and the battalion landed at Boulogne on 14 April. On 18–19 April platoons from the III West Riding Bde were attached to 8th Division for training in the routine of trench duties. On 28 April the West Riding Division took over its own section of the line at Fleurbaix. It now formed part of IV Corps, which attacked at the Battle of Aubers Ridge on 9 May. While the other two divisions of IV Corps made the actual attack, the West Riding Division took over the greater part of the corps' trench line. It was supposed to follow up and occupy the captured enemy line, but the breakthrough did not occur.York & Lancaster Rgt at Long, Long Trail.Magnus, pp. 45–6, 50. On 12 May the division was designated 49th (West Riding) Division and the brigade became 148th (3rd West Riding).Magnus, p. 40. For the next nine months the 49th Division took part in no major operations but was almost continuously engaged in day-to-day trench warfare, much of it in the Ypres Salient, with the considerable casualties that this entailed.Magnus, pp. 54–6. On 19 December the division received a sudden attack with the new German phosgene gas, followed by heavy shelling, but no serious infantry attack followed.Edmonds, 1916, pp. 158–62. In January 1916 the division was withdrawn for its first period of complete rest since it first entered the line.Magnus, p. 57. Somme At the beginning of February the battalion machine gunners left to join 148 Brigade Machine Gun Company.Magnus, p. 87. That month the division moved to the Somme sector, 1/5th York & Lancasters under Lt-Col Shuttleworth Rendell proceeding to Oissy. Here the division spent the next few months alternating trench duties with working parties and training for the forthcoming Somme Offensive. For this the 49th Division formed the reserve for X Corps, which was tasked with seizing the Thiepval Spur, after which the 49th was to pass through and continue the pursuit. The 1/5th York & Lancasters moved up to assembly trenches in Aveluy Wood before dawn on the day of the attack (1 July), and at 13.30 moved up to the British front trenches alongside the River Ancre, Lt-Col Rendell taking C and D Companies to the south while Major Shaw took A and B Companies to the north. The battalion attempted to assist 108 Bde of the 36th (Ulster) Division, which had made good progress but had become cut off. After the failure of the first day, the York & Lancasters spent the next week in confused fighting along the Ancre. On 6 July, the battalion sent forward two bombing parties totalling seven officers and 80 other ranks to capture a trench: of these only 22 other ranks returned, the CO, Lt-Col Rendell, being left behind wounded in a German dugout, and Maj Shaw killed. By the time the battalion was relieved at 20.30 on 8 July it had suffered a total of 307 casualties.Edmonds, 1916, pp. 394–9, 411–3.Magnus, pp. 87–94. William Orpen, A Trench, Thiepval – German wire. By 14 July the British had taken the Leipzig Redoubt on the Thiepval Spur, and while the offensive continued 49th Division remained holding this area, with a number of small actions and suffering a good deal of shelling, at the same time preparing trenches and dumps for a renewed attack. This attack was made on 3 September, at the end of the Battle of Pozières, but 5th York & Lancasters was not directly involved in the failed action. 49th Division continued minor operations towards Thiepval during the Battle of Flers-Courcelette (15–22 September) before the offensive petered out.Magnus, pp. 100–7. Ypres The ruins of Poelcapelle before the battle. During the summer of 1917 the 49th Division was earmarked for operations along the Flanders coast that failed to materialise. In October it was moved to the Ypres sector to join the Third Ypres Offensive. It took part in the Battle of Poelcapelle on 9 October, with 148 Bde on the left and 146 (1st West Yorkshire) Bde in the centre of the attack. The troops had a long night approach march in rain across appalling ground under shellfire, and only just reached the jumping-off tapes in time for Zero. When the attack went in at 05.20, the rain stopped so that the German defenders had perfect visibility. 148 Brigade was immediately stopped by a flooded stream, leaving 146 Bde to advance alone. They managed a few hundred yards before being stopped by a broad belt of undamaged German barbed wire. The division was now pinned down under fire from artillery, riflemen hidden in shell craters, and from machine guns in German pillboxes on the higher ground ahead. Although some of these pillboxes were taken, the division's attacking troops were back at their start line by the afternoon, having suffered heavy casualties.Liddle, pp. 221, 281–2.Magnus, pp. 138–41.Wolff, pp. 223, 226–8, 233–5. Spring Offensive Once 2/5th Bn York & Lancasters was disbanded at the end of January 1918 (see below), the 1/5th became simply '5th Bn' once more. 49th Division remained in the Ypres area during the winter of 1917–18 and was therefore not involved in the first stage of the German Spring Offensive. However, when the second phase (Operation Georgette, or the Battle of the Lys) began on 9 April, it soon began to put pressure on the southern part of the Ypres Salient. Brigade groups from 49th Division were sent south to support other British formations. On 10 April it was the turn of 148 Bde, which moved to Neuve Eglise; that night 5th York & Lancasters was attached to 74 Bde of 25th Division fighting near Steenwerck, south of Nieppe (the Battle of Estaires). The battalion carried out a 'dashing' attack on Cabaret du Saule on 11 April. It remained attached to 74 Bde through the Battle of Bailleul, fighting stubbornly on the Mont De Lille on 14 April, until relieved on 16 April, earning the praise of 74 Bde's commander.Becke, Pt 3a, p. 142.Magnus, pp. 184–86. After a five-day pause, the German offensive was renewed on 25 April. 5th York & Lancasters was with 148 Bde in corps reserve at Poperinghe and was not involved in the action at Mont Kemmel when the German Alpenkorps seized the dominating hill (the Second Battle of Kemmel Ridge). However, the Germans were unable to follow up this success and over the next three days 148 Bde was able to improvise a line behind the ridge, pushing Lewis gun teams well forward to command the valley. When the Germans attacked on 29 April (the Battle of the Scherpenberg), they were stopped dead by rifle and machine gun fire.Blaxland, p. 131.Magnus, pp. 190–2. Hundred Days Offensive The battalion returned to the fighting during the Allied Hundred Days Offensive. During the pursuit to the River Selle, 49th Division was ordered to attack on 12 October, but patrols found that the enemy had disappeared, so the barrage was cancelled and zero hour was brought forward. The division established a line along the edge of the high ground overlooking the Selle, the opposite bank of which was strongly held. However, when 147 (2nd West Riding) and 148 Bdes went forward next morning they were observed and suffered severely from a German barrage and fire from machine guns across the river that had been missed by the British barrage. They made little progress and were eventually withdrawn to a position only slightly ahead of their starting line. However, the division seized Saulzoir and established small bridgeheads over the Selle on the night on 14/15 October.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 259, 262, 264.Magnus, pp. 218–9. After the BEF had forced the river line (the Battle of the Selle), there was a pause before the next bound of the pursuit. On the night of 1/2 November 148 Bde returned to the line in front of Valenciennes. Its task was to seize the defended steelworks, which had repulsed the rest of the division the day before. The attack (the Battle of Valenciennes) went in at 05.30 and was successful, though the steelworks was not secured until 16.00. On 3 November the brigade went forward again under the command of 56th (1st London) Division, meeting no opposition as they pursued the defeated enemy.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 459–61.Magnus, p. 219. The division was relieved after this attack, and its infantry was still resting near Douai when the Armistice with Germany came into force on 11 November. Demobilisation began in January 1919 and was virtually complete by the end of March. The 5th York & Lancasters was disembodied on 20 June 1919. ===2/5th Battalion=== 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division's pelican sign (called a duck by the troops): 'when t'duck puts foot down, t'war'll be ower'. The 2/5th Bn York & Lancasters was formed at Rotherham on 3 October 1914. and became part of the 2/3rd West Riding Bde in the 2nd West Riding Division. These were later numbered 187 Bde and 62nd Division respectively.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 41–8.62 Division at Long, Long Trail. Until April 1915 they had no weapons with to train. Some Lee-Enfield rifles were then received, but these were withdrawn in May, and until the beginning of 1916 the 2nd Line Territorials had to make do with .256-in Japanese Ariska rifles, keeping their ammunition in their pockets until 1914 pattern webbing equipment arrived. With these antiquated weapons the 62nd Division was under orders to move at short notice to defend the East Coast, for which railway trains were kept in readiness. Training was also disrupted by the frequent calls to supply reinforcement drafts to the 1st line serving on the Western Front. In May 1915 the Home Service men of 187 Bde were withdrawn to form 26th Provisional Battalion serving in coast defence in North East England. In October, the division's 2nd Line battalions were reduced to 600 all ranks, the unfit men being posted to the 26th Provisional Bn and the surplus to the 3rd Line, which became the draft-finding unit.Magnus, pp. 73-4.Army Council Instructions, January 1916, Appendix 18. In May 1915 the division moved into camp in 'The Dukeries' area of Nottinghamshire, where it trained until October, when it concentrated round Retford. It then went into the Tyne defences where it dug an entrenched defence line in December. It moved to Larkhill Camp on Salisbury Plain for battle training in January 1916 and finally received SMLE Mk III rifles and Lewis guns, but in June it was sent to the East Coast defences once more, where it was scattered round East Anglia. Here battle training was less convenient and it was again called upon to provide drafts to the Western Front. In October it moved inland to Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire.Magnus, pp. 74–6. Finally, in October 1916, orders were received to bring the division up to full establishment and prepare for overseas service. Embarkation began at Southampton on 5 January 1917, and the division completed its concentration in France on 18 January.Magnus, pp. 76–7. It took its place in the line in the Somme sector opposite Serre. Shortly afterwards, the German army began a planned retreat to the Hindenburg Line (Operation Alberich) and from 15 February to 19 March the division's units were engaged in patrol work and stiff actions against rearguards while advancing across the devastated (and booby-trapped) ground until that line was reached. The division was then shifted to the line opposite Bullecourt in the southern part of the Arras sector.Magnus, pp. 117–23. Bullecourt Part of 62nd Division was involved in the failed first attack at Bullecourt on 11 April and in repulsing the German counter- attack at Lagnicourt on 15 April, but 187 Bde was not engaged in major action until the main Battle of Bullecourt opened on 3 May. The division spent the preceding 17 days in rehearsals and the whole division attacked in waves behind tanks and a heavy barrage, with 187 Brigade on the left. The first wave advanced at 03.37 (eight minutes before Zero) to cross of No man's land. They reached the first German line but had lost cohesion before they reached the second. Brigade HQ ordered a second attack in two waves, but this 'ended miserably in shell-holes' and at about 16.00 the division withdrew to a railway embankment where it was relieved. It was not until 17 May that the division finally cleared the village, and operations against the Hindenburg Line continued until 28 May.Magnus, pp. 131–6. After rest and reorganisation, 62nd Division returned to the line in June and began a period of several months of trench-holding.Magnus, pp. 145–6. Cambrai Mark IV Tank (female) training at Wailly 21 October 1917 for the Battle of Cambrai. 62nd Division moved into hutments at Beaulencourt in October 1917, where it trained for open warfare in preparation for the forthcoming Battle of Cambrai, including training with the Tank Corps at Wailly. On the night of 17/18 November 187 Bde took up its positions in Havrincourt Wood.Cooper, pp. 65–7.Magnus, pp. 146–8.Miles, p. 33. The surprise attack was launched at dawn on 20 November, with no preceding bombardment; the artillery crashed down on its targets at zero hour. The brigade advanced with Mark IV tanks of G Battalion and a company of I BattalionTank Corps towards its first objective, Havrincourt village. Despite galling fire from Havrincourt Chateau, the KOYLI battalions and tanks took the village by 08.30. Shortly afterwards the second wave of York & Lancasters and supporting tanks passed through, with 2/5th as the right-hand battalion, moving north across the communication trenches between the Hindenburg line and the German support line and meeting little resistance. Within two hours the battalion had secured the second objective at the cost of fewer than 80 casualties. By 11.30 the British had taken almost the whole of the Hindenburg Main and Support Lines over the frontage of the attack. 186th (2/2nd West Riding) Brigade then passed through to the next objective at Graincourt. Further progress was held up by the failure of 51st (Highland) Division to take Flesquières, leaving 62nd Division's right flank uncovered.Cooper, pp. 97–9, 109–10.Magnus, pp. 149–51.Miles, pp. 28, 60–1, 84–7. 19 Company at Cambrai, at Landships of WWI. The divisional objective for the second day of the attack (21 November) was Bourlon Wood, led by 186 Bde with 185 (2/1st West Riding) Bde in close support and 187 Bde in reserve. However, there were fewer tanks available and progress was slower than on the first day. Anneux was taken but Bourlon Wood remained out of reach. At dawn on 22 November, a heavy barrage and counter-attack hit the leading units of the division and a company of 2/5th York & Lancasters was sent forward to help restore the situation. This fighting ended any further advances. 62nd Division was relieved by 40th Division in a tricky operation that night.Cooper, pp.129–31, 141.Magnus, pp. 151–2.Miles, pp. 93, 111–4, 121–6. The division was back in Bourlon Wood on 27 November for another attempt to complete its capture. 187 Brigade led on the left at 06.20 with 16 of the remaining tanks to take Bourlon Village. It was dark and snowing: by 10.00 the attack had failed and the brigade had been driven out of Bourlon. It was relieved at the end of the day. The division had however succeeded in taking the last of Bourlon Ridge, which had been fought over for a week. The exhausted West Riding division was then relieved (under a hail of German gas shells) before the German counter-attack took back all the hard-won ground a few days later.Cooper, pp. 156–63.Magnus, pp. 157–8.Miles, pp. 147, 156–9, 167. Disbandment By the beginning of 1918 the BEF was suffering a manpower crisis and the decision was made to break up one battalion in each infantry brigade. 2/5th York & Lancasters was selected and on 3 February its men were drafted as reinforcements to the 1/4th and 1/5th Bns York & Lancasters in 49th Division, and 2/4th Bn in 187 Bde. ===3/5th Battalion=== The 3/5th Bn was formed at Strensall on 25 March 1915 and then moved to Clipstone Camp in Nottinghamshire where its role was to train drafts for the 1st ad 2nd Line battalions. On 8 April it was renamed the 5th Reserve Bn York & Lancasters and on 1 September it was absorbed by the 4th Reserve Bn. ===26th Provisional Battalion=== In 1915 the Home Service men of the 5th York & Lancasters, together with those of several other West Riding TF battalions, were combined into the 26th Provisional Battalion at York, which served in home defence with 2nd Provisional Brigade. It appears to have been disbanded before the Military Service Act 1916 swept away the Home/Foreign service distinction, and all TF soldiers became liable for overseas service, if medically fit. ==Interwar== TF units reformed on 1 February 1920 and the following year the TF was reorganised as the Territorial Army. 5th Battalion York & Lancasters were once again in 148th (3rd West Riding) Bde of 49th (West Riding) Division.Titles and designations, 1927. ===Anti-Aircraft conversion=== During the 1930s the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence for Britain's cities was addressed by converting a number of TA infantry battalions into AA units. The 5th York & Lancasters was one of the battalions selected, becoming 67th (The York & Lancaster Regiment) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, Royal Artillery on 10 December 1936 and completing the conversion by December 1937. It consisted of HQ Battery with 187th, 188th and 189th AA Batteries and 67 Machine Gun Battery at Rotherham and formed part of 31st (North Midland) AA Group in 2 AA Division. 67 Machine Gun Bty was converted into 198 AA Bty on 1 May 1937. When Royal Artillery (RA) gun brigades were redesignated as regiments on 1 January 1939, the AA groups were redesignated as brigades. 31 AA Brigade transferred to the newly formed 7 AA Division during 1939.Frederick, pp. 755–8, 772.Litchfield, pp. 262–3.2 AA Division 1936–38 at British Military History7 AA Division 1939 at British Military History ==World War IIMobilisation=== 3.7-inch HAA gun preserved at Imperial War Museum Duxford. The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62–3. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65–6, 371. On mobilisation, 67th AA Rgt deployed in the Sheffield Gun Zone as part of 39 AA Bde in 7 AA Division (shortly afterwards reverting to 2 AA Division), with 23 heavy AA guns deployed.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files.39 AA Bde War Diary 1939–41, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 166/2272.Routledge, Table LIX, p. 377; Table LX, p. 378. The brigade already referred to its AA gun regiments (equipped with 3-inch, 3.7-inch or 4.5-inch guns) as HAA (to distinguish them from the newer light AA or LAA units that were being formed); this became official across the Royal Artillery on 1 June 1940. However, due to the shortage of equipment at this stage of the war, HAA units sometimes had to provide Lewis gun Light machine gun (LMG) detachments in the LAA role to defend Vital Points (VPs). On 17 September 67th HAA Rgt temporarily took over the VPs at Orgreave, South Yorkshire, and by early 1940 was also manning sites at Thorncliffe, West Yorkshire, Chesterfield and elsewhere. At the beginning of March 1940 the brigade's first Gun-laying Mk I radar set became operational in the Sheffield Gun Zone. ===Battle of Britain and Blitz=== Formation sign of 2 AA Division. Incursions by Luftwaffe aircraft over the Humber Estuary became more frequent in May and June 1940. By the end of June 67th HAA Rgt had given up responsibility for VPs, and due to rotation of batteries 198 HAA Bty was under 62nd (Northumbrian) HAA Rgt in the Humber Gun Zone, while Regimental HQ was commanding its own 187 and 189 HAA Btys, and 173 HAA Bty from 62nd HAA Rgt, with a total of 23 HAA guns. In July it was also joined by 'D' Bty Royal Marines. As the Battle of Britain got under way, night intruders appeared over the Sheffield Gun Zone and were fired upon without effect.Collier, Appendix IX. When the night Blitz began over London in September, the gunners of 188 and later 189 HAA Btys were loaned to 1 AA Division to man guns covering the London Inner Artillery Zone, while 270 and two Troops of 286 HAA Bty from 91st HAA Rgt in the Humber Gun Zone arrived to augment 67th HAA Rgt at Sheffield. The CO of 67th HAA Rgt was acting as AA Defence Commander (AADC), Sheffield Gun Zone, with his HQ at the drill hall at Rotherham. During November, AA Command scraped together a further 16 mobile 3.7-inch guns for Sheffield, to be manned by various batteries under the AADC. Devastation in Sheffield city centre during the Blitz. Sheffield and Rotherham were badly bombed on the night of 12/13 December (the start of the Sheffield Blitz), with continuous raids from the east and south between 18.00 and 04.00, These began with incendiary bombs to mark the targets, followed by high explosive bombs. The Humber guns engaged some of the raiders on their way to the target, and the Sheffield guns fired over 3700 rounds; two aircraft were claimed as shot down. Apart from a couple of bombs on an English Steel Company works there was little damage to industry, but there were around 400 civilian casualties, about 100 of them fatal. The bombers returned with incendiary bombs on 15/16 December.Collier, Chapter XVII.Collier, Appendix XXX. 188 HAA Battery returned from detachment after the first raid, and the inexperienced 117th HAA Rgt arrived in January and had been trained on the gunsites by experienced gunners. There was some further bombing in the Sheffield area on the nights of 9/10 and 15/16 January, though the actual targets of these raids were Manchester and Humberside respectively. The regiment sent a cadre to 209th Training Regiment at Blandford Camp to provide the basis for a new 387 Bty; this was formed on 14 November 1940 and later joined 121st HAA Rgt On 8 February 1941, 67th HAA Rgt transferred to 50 Light AA Bde covering Derby and Nottingham.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex D.Routledge, Table LXV p. 396.2 AA Division 1940 at British Military History. The Luftwaffe attempted to bomb Derby on the night of 8/9 May, but most crews attacked Nottingham in error, leading to the Nottingham Blitz – one of the last significant raids of the Luftwaffe's Blitz campaign. By this stage 50 LAA Bde was concentrating on LAA guns and searchlights, and 67th HAA Rgt had transferred to a new 66 AA Bde controlling the HAA guns.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/79. ===Overseas=== 67th HAA Regiment left AA Command in July 1941 and joined the War Office Reserve preparatory to going overseas.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional Units), 25 March 1941, with amendments TNA files WO 212/5 and WO 33/2323. The establishment for overseas regiments was only three batteries, so 198 HAA Bty remained in the UK and on 14 September joined a new 136th HAA Rgt. This regiment never went overseas and was disbanded in 1946.Order of Battle of Non- Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, TNA file WO 212/80.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex M.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional units), 2 April 1942 with amendments, TNA files WO 212/515. 67th HAA Regiment embarked as part of the reinforcements for the British forces in Egypt, arriving on 23 December under the command of Lt-Col H.H.M. Oliver. However, it only stayed a month: the rapid progress of the Japanese invasion of Malaya begun on 7/8 December meant that reinforcements were urgently needed for India and 67th HAA Rgt was among the units re-embarked. It landed at Bombay on 1 February 1942.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 202; Annex F.Joslen, p. 484.Playfair, p. 121.Farndale, Far East, Annex K, p. 370.Joslen, p. 520. ===Burma=== On arrival, 67th HAA Rgt immediately moved to Calcutta, where it came under 1 Indian AA Bde, which was responsible for the air defence of the industrial areas and airfields of the city. Shortly afterwards it moved up the Manipur Road under the newly arrived 9 AA Bde that took responsibility for the Assam/Burma frontier.Routledge, p. 236. As the Japanese advanced though Burma, they began air raids against Allied airfields and facilities in Assam from October 1942, and these progressed to South-East Bengal, Chittagong and Calcutta itself by December. 9 AA Brigade deployed batteries of 8 HAA guns at each of 15 airfields, as well as defending key supply points for the First Arakan offensive. 187 HAA Bty was detached with IV Corps.Routledge, pp. 236–7; Table XXXVII, pp. 252–3.Woodburn Kirby Vol II, p. 259. After the failure of the Arakan offensive there was a pause during the Monsoon. Then in October the newly created Fourteenth Army moved forward again, with 67th HAA Rgt (less 189 HAA Bty, which remained with 9 AA Bde until late November 1943) moving up to the Imphal area under IV Corps. Battle of Imphal In early 1944, the Japanese launched Operation U-Go to forestall the Allied advance. Fourteenth Army based its defences on the Imphal Plain, with IV Corps well forward. As Corps HAA regiment, 67th HAA Rgt was deployed to defend the airfields around Imphal. When the Japanese attacks swept round these vital airfields they became the centres of defended localities, and the regiment's guns provided Counter-battery fire and defensive fire, as well as AA defence. By June, when the Kohima–Imphal road was reopened, the regiment claimed 13 'kills' from 839 AA rounds fired, but had already fired over 5000 rounds on ground targets in the Battle of Imphal. XXXIII Indian Corps now took over the lead, 67th HAA Rgt being relieved of its AA duties and transferring to this corps in the medium artillery role. It used field-gun fuzes for its ammunition for 'bunker- busting' as the Japanese were evicted from their positions in the Manipur hills.Farndale, Far East, pp. 182, 217.Routledge, pp. 242–6; Table XXXIX, p. 254.Woodburn Kirby, Vol III, Appendix 19. Advance to Tiddim 5th Indian Division continued to advance on Tiddim during the Monsoon rains. 67th HAA Regiment forced its way along the Tiddim road in support, mostly shooting at ground targets, but also providing working parties and vehicles to help the advance, 'its great Matador gun tractors skidding and winching their way along tracks with their 3.7-inch HAA guns'.Farndale, Far East, p. 234. It helped to reduce the enemy garrison at Tiddim with accurate long-range ground fire and then 'climbed the high ground of the Kennedy Peak feature with 5th Indian Division, no easy task as tracks had to be bulldozed to take heavy vehicles, the steep slopes required vehicles and guns to be winched up them and enemy bunkers had to be blasted clear by concentrated fire. Supplies of all kinds, including AA ammunition, were delivered by air to maintain the advance'.Routledge, pp. 246–8. Tiddim fell on 17 October and Kennedy Peak was captured in early November.Farndale, Far East, pp. 228–34.Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, pp. 45, 49–50, 152 7.2-inch howitzer firing in Burma, 1945. As the next phase of operations (Operation Extended Capital) was being prepared, 67th HAA Rgt reverted to being an infantry unit, handing over all its equipment to 1st West African HAA Rgt. However, in December a detachment of 187 HAA Bty returned to Imphal and took over two of the recently arrived 7.2-inch howitzers, which were to be used for 'bunker-busting' on IV Corps' front. The howitzer detachment left Imphal on 24 December and moved up via Tamu and the Kabaw Valley into the Irrawaddy bridgehead at Pagan.Farndale, Far East, p. 244.Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, Appendix 21. Moving these heavy guns through the jungle and Paddy fields into firing positions took enormous labour, and often required extra recovery vehicles and bulldozers. Sergeant E. Parnell of 187 HAA Bty recalled that normally the howitzers went forward at first light to join the infantry, who would identify the target, usually a bunker. This would be engaged over open sights, sometimes after an air strike or field guns had blown away any camouflage to reveal the target. On one occasion the detachment cooperated with a Stinson L-5 Sentinel Air Observation Post aircraft to obtain a direct hit on a Japanese 155mm gun hidden under a building on stilts at Chauk. During these engagements there was pressure to achieve early hits and to couple the gun up to its tractor and withdraw before the Japanese retaliated with mortar fire.Farndale, Far East, p. 245. Meiktila In January 1945 the rest of the regiment resumed its AA role with 16 x 3.7-inch HAA guns and moved up from Imphal to rejoin IV Corps at the Irrawaddy. The guns and GL radar trailers covered , often having to be 'double tractored' and winched up gradients of 1 in 5. 187 HAA Battery was deployed to defend Sinthe airfield as soon as it was captured, 188 HAA Bty covered the river crossings at Myitche, and 189 HAA Bty was detached to 17th Indian Division across the Irrawaddy at Pauk and went speeding on with it to Meiktila to cut off the Japanese force in Mandalay. As it covered the route, the motorised striking force was dependent on air supply. Meiktila airfield was captured on 24 February, and 189 HAA Bty deployed to protect it. The battery came under repeated air and ground attacks and was frequently mortared and shelled before the Capture of Meiktila was completed on 4 March. After Meiktila, Fourteenth Army was able to advance on Mandalay, which fell on 21 March.Farndale, pp. 251, 266–7.Lewin, pp. 215–24.Routledge, p. 248.Routledge, Table XL, p. 255.Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, pp. 255, 266–9. On 20 March the regiment handed its 7.2-inch howitzers over to 52nd (London) HAA Rgt, which replaced 67th in IV Corps.Farndale, Far East, p. 282. At the end of April the regiment was at Myingyan under Fourteenth Army, and in May it came under the command of 24 AA Bde, which took over air defence in the Meiktila area. However, with the Monsoon rains approaching, the policy of Allied Land Forces South East Asia was to send long-serving British units back to India and replace them with Indian units. On 17 May, 67th HAA Rgt was flown back to India, although a cadre of the regiment arrived in Rangoon on 13 June after its capture the previous month.Routledge, p. 249–50. The Surrender of Japan came in August 1945, and the regiment with its three batteries was placed in suspended animation in India between 31 October 1945 and 1 February 1946. ==Postwar== When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the regiment reformed at Rotherham as 467 (The York & Lancaster Regiment) (Mixed) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA, ('Mixed' indicating that members of the Women's Royal Army Corps were integrated into the unit). It formed part of 65 AA Bde (the former 39 AA Bde) at Doncaster.Frederick, p. 1016.444–473 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.Litchfield, Appendix 5.30–66 AA Bdes at British Army 1945 on. When AA Command was disbanded on 10 March 1955, there was a reduction in the number of AA units in the TA. 467 HAA Regiment merged into 271 (Sheffield) Field Rgt, becoming 'R' (5th York & Lancaster) Bty. On 1 May 1961, R Bty amalgamated with 865 Locating Bty, RA, and reverted to infantry as B (Barnsley) Company of the Hallamshire Battalion, York & Lancaster Rgt.Frederick, p. 999.266–288 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.Litchfield, p. 261. ==Honorary Colonel== The following officers served as Honorary Colonel of the battalion: * Sir Walter Spencer- Stanhope, KCB, VD, former CO, was appointed as Honorary Colonel of the 2nd VB on 13 February 1895, and continued as Hon Col of the 5th York & Lancasters when it was formed in 1908.London Gazette, 17 November 1908. * Lt-Col T.W.H. Mitchell, VD, appointed 22 April 1914 * Lt-Col C. Fox, TD, appointed 22 April 1921 * Col S. Rhodes, CB, DSO, TD, appointed 12 November 1930 ==Uniforms and insignia== The uniform of the 8th Yorkshire West Riding RVC was scarlet with green facings. The 2nd VB adopted the white facings of the York & Lancaster Regiment. When the 5th Bn was converted to artillery in 1936, all ranks continued to wear York & Lancaster Rgt cap badges with RA collar badges and shoulder titles. The cap badges were replaced by RA badges in 1940. During World War II 67th HAA Rgt is believed to have worn a regimental flash consisting of a flaming grenade badge embroidered in yellow on a green over blue diamond with the colours separated by a thin yellow horizontal line. ==NotesReferences== * Army Council Instructions Issued During January 1916, London: HM Stationery Office, 1916. * Maj A.F.

The soundtrack album was initially released on vinyl LP in 1981, and has since been reissued six times in both CD and LP formats. == Creation == The Lucifer Rising film project had its genesis in 1956 when Kenneth Anger conceived of making a film that would be antithetical to his previous film, Scorpio Rising, a dark film exploring death image fixations in the outlaw motorcycle culture. In contrast, the filmmaker wanted his new film to be a celebration of a rebellious \\"bringer of light\\" themed imagery. In early 1967, Anger attended The Invisible Circus, an erotic-themed counterculture event held at Glide Memorial Church, where Bobby Beausoleil was performing with his band, The Orkustra. Impressed by Beausoleil's performance, Anger approached him about playing the starring role in his new film. After some discussion, Beausoleil agreed on the condition that he would create the soundtrack for the project. They worked on the film project together through the summer of that year but the collaboration fell apart in the fall, coinciding with the rapid disintegration of the counterculture scene in San Francisco.https://bbreferencearchive.tumblr.com/post/154781394445/the-saga-of- a-soundtrack In 1972, Kenneth Anger approached Jimmy Page of the rock band Led Zeppelin with a proposal to compose the soundtrack for his resurrected film project, Lucifer Rising. Anger announced in a 1972 interview with Variety magazine, that Page would be composing the soundtrack and also stated that the film was near completion. He also (erroneously) claimed that Page was involved in the creation of the film itself. Composition for the album was halted when Anger, following a dispute with Page's wife Charlotte, was thrown out of the basement of Page's London mansion. Page had previously allowed Anger to reside in the basement for at least the duration of the film's production, although the particulars of the arrangement are unclear. Nevertheless, following his eviction, Anger began to criticize Page and his wife in the press. Anger said, \\"I'm beginning to think Jimmy has dried up as a musician. He has got no themes, no inspiration, no melodies to offer.\\" After learning of Page's exit from the production of the soundtrack, state prisoner Bobby Beausoleil wrote to Anger from Tracy Prison (also known as Deuel Vocational Institution) in San Joaquin County, California. Beausoleil suggested that he should compose the soundtrack for Lucifer Rising, as the two had originally agreed a decade earlier. He told Anger that be believed he could obtain approval from the prison administration to record his compositions within the institution. Anger provided a modest $3,000 for the purchase of recording equipment.https://bbreferencearchive.tumblr.com/post/154781394445/the-saga-of- a-soundtrack Beausoleil enlisted the sponsorship of Minerva Bertholf, a teacher at the prison, to facilitate the purchase of recording equipment. Permission to proceed with the project was granted by the Warden. Beausoleil formed the Freedom Orchestra with fellow inmates, and recorded the album in the prison using instruments built in the prison handicraft shop. Anger was enthusiastic about the project, and he would occasionally visit Tracy Prison to discuss the project with Beausoleil. Following the debut of the film with its soundtrack in 1980, the 44-minute soundtrack to Lucifer Rising was released on vinyl LP in 1981 by Lethal Records. Most of the initial copies were sold by Anger at the screenings of his film. In 2005, the soundtrack was reissued by Beausoleil with additional outtakes from the 1967 iteration of the Lucifer Rising soundtrack in a two-disk CD package on the Arcanum label. In 2009, Beausoleil released a 4-LP anthology comprising all of the project recordings that were made during the creation of the Lucifer Rising soundtrack entitled The Lucifer Rising Suite, on The Ajna Offensive label.https://www.discogs.com/Bobby-Beausoleil-The-Lucifer-Rising- Suite/master/1383845 A CD version of The Lucifer Rising Suite was released in 2014.https://store.cdbaby.com/cd/bobbybeausoleil9 In 2017, Bobby Beausoleil, again in collaboration with The Ajna Offensive, released a commemorative reissue of the original soundtrack as a continuous mix on Vinyl LP https://www.theajnaoffensive.com/products/bobby- beausoleil-9https://www.discogs.com/Bobby-Beausoleil-Lucifer- Rising/release/9623727 and Limited Edition CDhttps://www.theajnaoffensive.com/products/bobby- beausoleil-4https://store.cdbaby.com/cd/bobbybeausoleil16. == Theme == The music of Lucifer Rising is closely linked with the occult elements found in Anger's film of the same name. Beausoleil sought to draw on his own mystic life experiences to tell the story of \\"mythical Lucifer awakening in his pit of despair, rekindling his torch, and rising like a phoenix from the ashes of his own unmaking to begin his long journey from the dark recesses of the underworld — shedding his pride along the way in his uncompromising desire to regain the Beloved.\\" Beausoleil sought to do this by creating dark and sinister sounding music that gradually evolves to a brighter and more uplifting finale. Lucifer Rising is primarily instrumental rock with an otherworldly orchestral feel.https://bbreferencearchive.tumblr.com/post/154781242450/the-lucifer- rising-suite-a-journey-out-of ==Reception== Critic J. Scott McClintock gave the soundtrack album 4.5 stars out of a possible 5 for Allmusic.com. Trying to judge the music on its own merits apart from Bobby Beausoleil's criminal history, McClintock wrote that he was \\"a talented arranger and a fine guitarist\\", creating music reminiscent of both early Pink Floyd and composer Claude Debussy. ==Soundtrack listingPersonnel== *Kenneth Anger – director and filmmaker *Bobby Beausoleil – soundtrack composer, electric guitar, bass guitar, synthesizer, recordist *Steve Grogan – electric guitar *Rick Sutton – electric piano, synthesizer *Andy Thurston – drums *Chuck Gordon − bass *Tim Wills – Fender Rhodes *Randy Charlton − drums *Robert Gadbury − sparks *Page Wood – film poster design; also used on cover of 1981 soundtrack LP *Michael Moynihan – liner notes (2005 Arcanum reissue) *Robert Ferbrache - reissue mastering == References  Bibliography === # Category:1981 soundtrack albums Category:Soundtracks by American artists Category:Fantasy film soundtracks ","title":"Lucifer Rising (Bobby Beausoleil soundtrack)"},{"id":"56827007","text":"Joseph C.

Initially also known as Incubo (Nightmare) or Duate, Tedua is known as one of the members of the collective Wild Bandana, along with Izi, Vaz Té, Sangue and Ill Rave. == Biography == Tedua, pseudonym of Mario Molinari, was born in Genoa. At the age of three he was entrusted to a family, with whom the young Mario will remain for a very short span of time. He later spent a few years with his maternal grandmother in Milan, before returning in his teens in the town of Cogoleto, in the suburbs of Genoa, where he grew up coming into contact with those who will then be members of Wild Bandana. Aged 13 Mario met Vaz Tè at school, through whom he will meet Izi. The three, who will then be joined by other boys, will begin to devote themselves to musical activity, giving themselves soon stage names: Molinari chose Incubo (Nightmare), name which he later dropped in favor of Duate. == Musical style == The musical style of Tedua approaches essentially to the drill. From this point of view, the critics haven't been unanimous regarding the style of Tedua, expressing sometimes satisfaction, sometimes disapproval of the artistic innovation of the rapper. Drill sounds, however, respond to the flow of consciousness that underlies the music of Tedua, which is always a verbal expression of thoughts and experiences of life. Tedua has often claimed to have been stylistically inspired by the Italian rapper Dargen D'Amico, from whom he inherited the vision of music as a stream of consciousness: not surprisingly, in the Mowgli disc is contained a piece, Acqua (malpensandoti), whose refrain is a resumption of D'Amico's Malpensandoti. In addition to the Milanese rapper, Tedua's sources of inspiration include Chief Keef and Fedez. ==Discography As a soloist === Studio album * 2017 – Orange County California * 2018 – Mowgli Mixtape * 2014 - Medaglia d'Oro * 2015 – Aspettando Orange County * 2016 – Orange County Mixtape * 2020 – Vita Vera Mixtape * 2020 - Vita Vera Mixtape - Aspettando La Divina Commedia Singles * 2016 – \\"Pugile\\" * 2017 – \\"Bimbi\\" * 2017 – \\"Wasabi 2.0\\" * 2017 – \\"La legge del più forte\\" * 2018 – \\"Burnout\\" * 2018 – \\"Acqua (malpensandoti)\\" * 2018 – \\"Fashion Week RMX\\" * 2018 – \\"Vertigini\\" * 2019 - \\"Elisir\\" === With the Wild Bandana === * 2017 – Amici miei * 2020 - ‘’Manhattan (single from Vita Vera Mixtape) ==References== Category:Italian rappers Category:1994 births Category:People from Genoa Category:Living people ","title":"Tedua"},{"id":"56827030","text":"Kottayam Central Diocese is one of the 30 dioceses of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church.

Originally the sink stood in the large lecture room of the old Kamerlingh Onnes Laboratory. It was taken to the new building when the physicists moved to the Leiden Bioscience park in 1977. Here it still stands in the current large lecture room (The De Sitterzaal of the J.H. Oortgebouw), continuing the tradition of washing the hands of visiting famous scientists. A short list of 'sink users' consists out of Paul Ehrenfest, Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, Hendrik Antoon Lorentz and Albert Einstein. But also more recently nobel prize winners like Brian Schmidt and Albert Fert. In 2015 plans were announced for a new science campus which will replace the current one in 2025. After some inquiries it was clear that the faculty board had no plans of moving the sink once more to the upcoming physics department and therefore a petition was started to 'save the sink'. Because of this the sink appeared in local and national media several times. The petition got 197 autographs within one month and was later presented to the faculty board. The science faculty accepted the petition and moved the sink to the De Sitter lecture room in the new Oort building, where it can keep serving the physicists like it did years before. ==See also== * Einstein's Blackboard == References == Sink Category:Leiden University ","title":"Einstein's Sink"},{"id":"56827210","text":"T3 type no. 321 (formerly 102) at Udine in 2016 This article lists rolling stock of Società Veneta.

Her father was a Catholic while her mother, a niece of the painter Frederick Burton, was rigorously Protestant. All the children were brought up in the Church of Ireland. The men, emigrated and remained unionist while the women were active nationalists. Most famous were the two youngest, the artist Grace Gifford, and the journalist and broadcaster Sydney Czira. Gifford grew up in Rathmines and went to school at Alexandra College. She trained as a domestic economy teacher and worked for seven years at a series of positions in Co. Meath. ==Nationalism== Gifford experienced the living conditions of the landless rural poor while lodging in labourers' cottages during this time. As a result, she became a supporter of the campaigns of the land agitator and nationalist MP Laurence Ginnell. She was also influenced by her sisters nationalism and feminism. With them, she became involved with the Irish Women's Franchise League, and got to know Countess Constance Markievicz. She got parts in stage plays, including ‘Eleanor's enterprise’ by George Birmingham in the Gaiety Theatre, a play produced by the countess's husband, Count Casimir Markievicz. During the 1913 Dublin lock-out she assisted James Larkin enter the Imperial Hotel, on August 31 to address the crowd. He entered in disguise, that of an elderly and infirm clergyman. Gifford posed as his niece. She spoke to the hotel staff to prevent Larkin's strong Liverpool accent giving away his identify. This was the speech which precipitated the \\"Bloody Sunday\\" police baton charge. Gifford went on to be a founding member of the Irish Citizen Army (ICA). This group was attractive to many women due to the feminist beliefs of James Connolly. She gave lessons on camp cookery in Liberty Hall and found jobs for recruits coming in from abroad. As a result of this work she, very fatefully, introduced Michael Collins to her future brother-in-law Joseph Plunkett who went on to serve together in the 1916 Easter Rising; Collins was Plunkett's aide-de-camp. Gifford was the only one of her sisters actively to participate in the rising itself. She was with the ICA's St Stephen's Green contingent alongside Countess Markievicz. Throughout the week she supervised the garrison's provisions in the College of Surgeons' building, commandeering food from shops and bread vans, and by courier from other garrisons. She also ensured the delivery of provisions to troops both in the college with her and in outlying posts. Gifford was one of the women arrested at the surrender and jailed in Kilmainham Gaol. At the same time, in the same prison her sister Grace married Joseph Plunkett hours before his death. Only twelve women were detained after the main release women prisoners on 8 May 1916. Gifford was one of those transferred to Mountjoy Prison until her release on 4 June 1916. Afterwards she continued to be as involved in the campaigns. After her time in prison, Gifford travelled through England to the USA where she and other women veterans of Easter week lectured throughout America. While there she married Joseph Donnelly, of Omagh, Co. Tyrone in 1918. In 1921 she and their year-old daughter Maeve left him to return to Ireland. ==Later life== Frederick Gifford died in September 1917 and left her £800. However Gifford was not well off. She became a broadcaster and journalist for the national radio and the Irish press. Holding to her upbringing Gifford remained a staunch Protestant, unlike four of her sisters, who had married Catholics. She became devoted to preserving the historical record of the independence movement. Noticing the huge number of visitors for the 1932 Eucharistic Congress she organised a small exhibition there of 1916 memorabilia for the National Museum of Ireland. She was irritated by the display of Catholic religious artifacts there. She campaigned for a permanent exhibition of recent Irish nationalist history. Gifford coordinated a substantial body of material pertinent to nationalist organisations, the Easter rising, and the war of independence, which now forms the core of the present collection. Over the years Gifford was secretary of the Old IRA Association, a member of the Old Dublin Society, and a founder of the Kilmainham Gaol Restoration Society. She also looked after stray and neglected dogs and cats. She died on 23 June 1971 at the Gascoigne nursing home in Rathmines, Dublin, aged 90. ==References== Category:1880 births Category:1971 deaths Category:Irish republicans Category:Women in war 1900–1945 Category:Women in war in Ireland Category:People of the Easter Rising Category:People of the Irish War of Independence Category:Irish Citizen Army members ","title":"Nellie Gifford"},{"id":"56827460","text":"Alfred Cohen was an American artist whose art was firmly rooted in the European tradition; he was inspired in particular by the commedia dell'arte; and by the colour and handling of the Post-Impressionists and Expressionists. == Biography == Cohen was born on May 9, 1920 in Chicago.Obituary, Daily Telegraph (8 February 2001), 31 His father, a furniture dealer, had emigrated from Latvia to America, where he married the daughter of another Latvian emigre. Cohen attended the Art Institute of Chicago, but left to enlist in the US Army Air Corps. He served from 1942 to 1945 as a navigator in Flying Fortresses and Liberators based in the Pacific Theater. After the war Cohen returned to the Art Institute, where he studied under Louis Ritman, Boris Anisfeld (who collaborated with Leon Bakst) and Egon Weiner. In 1949 he was awarded a fellowship to study in Europe, where he was to spend the rest of his life. He lived in France and Germany, and travelled widely throughout the Continent. Cohen and his first wife, Virginia Adler, lived in Sam Francis' old studio on the Boulevard Arago in Paris, where he studied at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière. == Artistic career == Cohen's work was representational and figurative, owing most to Raoul Dufy, Bonnard, Marc Chagall, Oskar Kokoschka, Georges Rouault and Chaim Soutine. His favourite subjects were ports and river banks, vibrant flower compositions and searching portraits. . In the 1950s Cohen staged one-man exhibitions in Germany and Paris. French critics described him as an 'intimist', 'ranking among our best painters',Masques et Visages, 1958; clipping in the Archive of the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation and hailing his paintings as 'good, direct and natural'.Le Peintre, 1958; clipping in the Archive of the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation. In 1958 he had his first one-man exhibition at the Ben Uri in London, where two years later he decided to settle. His exhibition at the Obelisk Gallery in 1960 was the first of several sell-out shows in Britain. Cohen had already met with considerable success in Germany and France. But with the large canvases of his Aspects of the Thames exhibition in 1961 Cohen really began to win critical acclaim in Britain too. Alfred Cohen, 'Docklands Night', 1961, oil on canvas, 28 x 36 in; 71.1 x 91.4 cm; private collection; on loan to the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation Anita Brookner wrote in the Burlington Magazine that Cohen was 'a fresh and accessible artist of considerable accomplishment, whose abstract impressionist compositions were enlivened by an acute charm of colour'.Anita Brookner, Burlington Magazine, 1961 The Tatler admired 'the rich sense of colour that makes his work immediately striking and lastingly memorable' and again noted the combination of abstract design and representation which remained important throughout his career: 'Look . . . at almost any few square inches of a Cohen canvas and you have a little gem of abstract painting'.Robert Wraight, Tatler, 1961 Edward Lucie-Smith, in Arts Review, found the paintings 'strikingly well constructed', adding: 'the architecture is nearly always firm and logical. . . . I admire these pictures most as virtuoso demonstrations of technical skill. They have immense panache and glitter, and yet they are self- consistent'.Edward Lucie-Smith, Arts Review, 1961 The New Daily appreciated the 'visionary quality' of their effects of light.C. R. Cammell, New Daily, 1961. Cohen followed this with an exhibition at the Brook Street Gallery in 1963, on the theme of the commedia dell'arte. The Daily Telegraph described the technical achievement of his images as 'formidable', and declared him 'one of the best draughtsmen at work today', adding that 'Only Picasso in one or two early works has in our time touched such depths through the characters of the Commedia dell'Arte'.Terence Mullaly, Daily Telegraph, October 1963. Conroy Maddox, wrote in Arts Review that 'The paintings are a show of force and theatricality. . . . Cohen has certainly gained a sensuous richness and a robust and vigorous way of handling his material'.Conroy Maddox, Arts Review, 1963. Alfred Cohen, 'Polichinelle (Red Punch)', 1963, acrylic on hardboard, 40 x 30 in; 101.6 x 76.2 cm. Alfred Cohen Art Foundation The inspiration of the commedia dell'arte was to recur throughout Cohen's work. But once again he resisted the temptation to repeat a successful formula, and completely reinvented his painting yet again. Now he turned his attention to the landscape of Kent, where he settled with his second wife, Diana Saunders, in 1963. His exhibition of 'Recent Paintings' at the Brook Street Gallery in 1965 sounded a note that was to remain important in Cohen's work, focusing on the English countryside and country people. His attraction to Britain never waned. 'I don't want to leave it. America is no longer my home. I feel more of a foreigner there than I do anywhere in Europe.'Philip Oakes, 'Cohen GB', Sunday Times (29 Dec 1968)' clipping in Archive of the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation. But he was also attempting to capture the features of the land that most perplexed him. First, its postwar air of decline: 'It is crumbling from the inside, and crumbling in style. It's elegant, but there's danger in the elegance.' But also the challenge represented by its crowded seclusion. As the writer Philip Oakes explains: 'He evolved a new style, using paint like a sculptor, laying down slabs of colour, carving it with his brush so that the fields and hedges and houses seemed to be hewn from the canvas'.Oakes, 'Cohen GB'. Cohen's British landscapes were well-received too, with critics continuing to praise his compositional intelligence. Pictures on Exhibit said: There are very few artists of today's generation with the ability to synthesise the quality of 20th Century Ecole de l'Europe in the sense that the late impressionists and the post-impressionists did it for their epoch. Alfred Cohen is one of them, and maybe this explains his success with a wide category of collectors. Their enthusiasm is unstinting . . . . These are recognizably contemporary paintings. Cézanne's tough palette is neatly handled and we are charmed without experiencing for a split-second any doubt that these are really good paintings. . . . There are few enough painters like him nowadays; hardly one capable of capturing the British scene in such an attractive and authoritative way.P. Sheldon-Williams, Pictures on Exhibit, 1965; clipping in the Archive of the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation. Cohen had nine one-man exhibitions in London, and others in Heidelberg, Hannover, Paris, Toronto, Montreal, Tokyo, Cape Town, Belfast, and many other cities and towns in England, including Cambridge, York, Harrogate, Leeds, Rye, and King's Lynn. He had two-person exhibitions with Josef Herman, Patrick Hall, and Mary Newcomb. And his work was also included in many international mixed exhibitions, such as one at the U.S. Embassy in London of 'Five Americans in Britain', with R. B. Kitaj and others. Alfred Cohen, 'Near Goudhurst', 1965, oil on board, 9.75 x 11.in; 24.8 x 29.9 cm. Private Collection. In the late 1960s he joined Roland, Browse and Delbanco, in Cork Street, which combined exhibitions of artists such as Rodin and Matthew Smith with work from contemporary artists such as Phillip Sutton, Keith Grant and Cohen's friend Josef Herman. The first of his four exhibitions there was in 1969. It continued the exploration of the country. 'He was always effective and satisfying', wrote the Jewish Chronicle, 'but his Kentish landscapes have been a consistent breakthrough . . . . He has things in common with several good artists, but most noticeable with what de Stael might have painted had he been able to sustain himself at his best. For Cohen now uses that thick impasto in jewel-like colour-blocks that are subtly balanced. The variety of blues and greens, and of reds, that he can weigh in his balance is astonishing'.Jewish Chronicle, 1969; clipping in the Archive of the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation. But he also began to return to the Channel coast, seen from both sides, and in new ways. James Burr, in Apollo, noted: Many subjects have engaged the expressionist fervour of Alfred Cohen; in these recent paintings, the boats and houses of the coastlines of France predominate. He reacts with a fierce passion to direct experience that is organized into a formal structure. . . . His emotional power and exuberantly vigorous response infuses his paintings with an intensity that makes much contemporary expressionism look feeble.James Burr, Apollo, 1969. Alfred Cohen, 'Coastal Picture', 1966, oil on board, 8 x 10 in; 20.3 x 25.4 cm. Private Collection. It was this return to coastal paintings that was to characterize much of his later work. Marina Vaizey reviewed his second show at Roland, Browse and Delbanco in 1972 for the Financial Times, commenting on how the works 'play on the borders of abstract and representational art', and noting: 'He is particularly fond of a deep range of blues, and sea-greens, and the compositions have a deliberate naiveté that is charming but never cloying'.Marina Vaizey, Financial Times, 1972. The Jewish Chronicle said: 'Like Marquet, Cohen paints beautifully, but more warmly. . . a man who is passionately concerned about painting well, and who has also a first-rate sense of colour, deep and rich, belonging to the earth and the sea'.Jewish Chronicle, 1972; clipping in the Archive of the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation. Of Cohen's last exhibition with Roland's in 1976, Brian Wallworth wrote in Arts Review: Paintings and drawings of astonishing vivacity and assurance. . . . Each one is a fully resolved picture of an obviously very intense visual sensation felt by the artist. . . . delicious . . . What a perceptive, revealing and loving eye this American turns on the people, places and atmospheres of Kent! . . . there is a fine wildness about Cohen's pictures that instantly commands attention. . . .Brian Wallworth, Arts Review, 1976. Alfred Cohen, 'Folkestone', 1974–75, oil on hardboard, 16 x 20 in; 40.6 x 50.8 cm. Private Collection. That exhibition represented yet another new departure. As Peter Stone wrote: 'Alfred Cohen is unique. I can think of no other artist whom I have followed since his beginning and found to be literally better in each succeeding exhibition. . . . Here is a new line of free and easy drawings of characters like cartoons. You can't pass them without a chuckle'.Peter Stone, Jewish Chronicle, 1976. In the mid-1970s Cohen took up print-making. His hand-coloured etchings, often of flowers, were sold worldwide. He also turned his sense of space and design to the renovation of houses. In 1978 he and Diana moved to Wighton, north Norfolk, where they converted an old schoolhouse into a studio, print workshop, and art gallery. They later discovered that this was the house where Henry Moore had lived as an art student in the 1920s, and where he had begun to sculpt. When landscaping the garden, the Cohens unearthed a marble carving that had been left unfinished and they returned it to Moore.Ian Collins, Guardian (7 March 2001), 24. Like many painters, he loved the light in Norfolk, its skies, and above all its coast. He often exhibited there. Tony Warner found his exhibition at the King's Lynn arts centre in 1991 'invigorating', describing how it: 'glows with colour. . . . There is an obvious joy in the visual world. . . . each painting is carefully crafted. Layers of paint build up to an intricate pattern of complementary colours. The structures are worked out with an almost mathematical precision, each part firmly measured against the painting as a whole'.Tony Warner, Eastern Daily Press, 1991. Of his only one-man exhibition at the School House Gallery, in 1994, the Eastern Daily Press commented: 'Alfred Cohen is recognized as one of the finest colourists and draughtsmen living in England. . . .'Colin Chinery, Eastern Daily Press, 1994. His collectors latterly included Sir Keith Joseph, Judge Stephen Tumim, Lord and Lady Norwich, and John Madden. Cohen continued painting, drawing, etching, and producing screenprints, collages, and assemblages up until his death, on 25 January 2001 at King's Lynn. While the paint surfaces became flatter, less illusionistic, their materiality more insistent, his attention to effects of light, water, and colour, was as intense as ever. Alfred Cohen, 'Catia's Terrace, 1991, oil on canvas, 22 x 25 in; 55.9 x 63.5 cm. Private Collection. == Reception == Obituaries appeared in all the major broadsheets. The Times praised his 'vibrant flower compositions and searching portraits', as well as his 'evocative scenes of the Thames'.Times (5 March 2001), 21. The Independent recalled that 'Once in Europe he . . . made his reputation in its galleries, where his unmistakably chunky, jewel-like canvases were for several decades much sought-after'.David Buckman, Independent (26 April 2001), The Thursday Review, 6. The Daily Telegraph concurred, recording how 'His work became increasingly sought after, by such notable collectors as James Mason, Stanley Baker, and Sam Wanamaker', adding: 'A gregarious man, and a friend to many other artists, Cohen also possessed a photographic memory and an encyclopaedic knowledge of Hollywood cinema. His conversation, like his art, bubbled with wit and satire. He hated pomposity or prejudice and was passionately liberal in his beliefs'.Obituary, Daily Telegraph (8 February 2001), 31. The Jewish Chronicle described how he 'produced a prodigious number of vibrant and colourful paintings. . . . Well received in France, he was equally acclaimed when he moved to London. . . . His hand-coloured etchings . . . were popular in Europe, the US and Japan'.Jewish Chronicle (9 March 2001), 29. And the Guardian called him 'a brilliant colourist and deft draughtsman', admiring his 'vibrant oils of the Seine, the Thames and the Channel ports, and some telling portraits', as well as his 'restless energy' and the wit of his cartoons and constructions. Two retrospective exhibitions have since been held: the first at the School House Gallery from May–June 2001; the second at the London Jewish Cultural Centre from October 2001 – March 2002. Derek Gillman, Director of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art, wrote for the first: 'He was a grand artist, a great colourist, a forceful designer, and a highly acute observer of places and people. He also made very fine prints, with the same intelligence and wit.'Archive of the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation. Lady Vaizey, opening the London exhibition, spoke of how Cohen's work was 'filled with warmth, life, affection, pleasure in the beauties and good realities of the present day'. Howard Jacobson, in the Independent, praised his 'wonderfully violent paintings': he painted sensuously, in paint rather than in epigrams, and, like many of the best artists still alive in the last quarter of the 20th century, had to take a back seat to that institutionalised facetiousness we know as conceptualism. . . . It should, of course, be Tate Modern that exhibits him, but he's a little hot for their whitened aesthetic. . . . And not only too hot, but too possessed of the satiric daemon. For me, although you can see the influences of Vuillard and Kokoschka and Soutine on Cohen, his best work has Daumier behind it, the vigorousness of caricature and the savage grotesqueries of the commedia dell'arte. . .Howard Jacobson, The Independent, 02 February 2002, The Weekend Review, p. 5.

Richard Pickersgill was born in 1749 in West Tanfield, near Ripon, to Richard and Ann Pickersgill (née Lee). Pickersgill was the nephew of John Lee, the servant of George Jackson, a senior officer in the Admiralty. It is believed that his uncle managed to position him through his relationships on his first ships. In 1766, at the age of 17, he participated in the circumnavigation of the world under Captain Samuel Wallis on the Dolphin. Two years later, on August 26, 1768, Pickersgill belonged as a Master's mate to the Endeavor team, which set off with James Cook to its first South Sea voyage. On this trip he also impressed Cook, who had a high opinion of his skills as a surveyor, his dealings with the indigenous peoples they encountered, and his judgment. When Robert Molineux, the Master of the Endeavor, died on the return journey to England, Pickersgill was promoted to Master on April 16, 1771. After his return to London Pickersgill was promoted on Cook's recommendation to Lieutenant. On July 13, 1772 Cook began his second expedition with the Resolution and Richard Pickersgill belonged as the third Lieutenant back to the team. He did not accompany Cook on his third voyage, but in April 1776 took command of the ship Lyon and was sent to Baffin Bay on the east coast of Canada. Richard Pickersgill died in 1779 at the age of 30, when he accidentally fell into the Thames when he entered a ship and drowned.

It is affiliated with the Union of Evangelical Baptists of Spain. The seminary campus is located in Alcobendas in the Comunidad de Madrid, Spain. ==History== In 1922, the Baptist Theological Institute (Instituto Teológico Bautista) is founded in Barcelona by Board of Foreign Missions (presently called the International Mission Board) of the Southern Baptist Convention of the USA.John H. Y. Briggs, A Dictionary of European Baptist Life and Thought, Wipf and Stock Publishers, USA, 2009, p. 476 The faculty was composed of Nils Bengston, Ambrosio Celma, Everett Gill and Percy Buffard, founder of the Spanish Christian Mission, based in Valdepeñas (Ciudad Real). In 1925 Baptist missionary Vincent Leroy David arrived in Spain and took up the position of director. By 1926 the seminary had fourteen students and, two years later, ten. At this time the faculty of teachers was formed by Vincent L. David, his wife, Nils Bengston and Emilio Mora. One program aimed at training men for the pastorate, while the other trained lay leaders for work at the various Baptist missions. The seminary was very dependent on aid from North American and was negatively affected by the Great Depression. The contributions of the FMB to the Baptist work in Spain decreased by 33%, and the Baptist Theological Institute of Barcelona had to temporarily cease functioning in 1929. In the fall of 1948 the seminary was reopened with six students after nineteen inactive years. The new director was Dr. Jorge Jennings who had been sent to Spain by the FMB. Classes resumed in a rented building in a popular neighborhood of Barcelona which served both as a study center student housing. Soon the seminary had its own building on Camp Street in Barcelona, bought by the FMB, which in 1957 was expanded and modernized. By then the seminary's director was Dr. Roy Wyatt. The restrictions in Francoist Spain to the Spanish, non-Catholic confessions were hardened in the 1950s, but nonetheless the seminary continued to function. In the 1960s the seminary was closed on two occasions due to internal problems (1959-1961 and 1962-1963). In 1976, the school moves from Barcelona to the city of Alcobendas in the Comunidad de Madrid. The new installations of what would be a seminary and Baptist center were inaugurated in this town on the outskirts of Madrid. While this decision did not satisfy some Spanish Baptists, but the time and the urban development of the city ended up affirming the Baptist leaders who defended the convenience of placing the most representative institution of Baptist work in the center of the country. In 1978 Mr. José Borrás Cerveró was appointed director, becoming the first Spaniard to accede to this position in fifty-six years. Since then, the successive directors of the Baptist Seminary have been Spanish, and its staff of teachers has also been reinforced with native staff. In 1997, the seminary takes the name of Theological Seminary of UEBE (Seminario Teológico UEBE).Ftuebe, BREVE RESEÑA HISTÓRICA, ftuebe.es, Spain, retrieved December 3, 2018 ==Campus== The campus is located at 134 Calle Marqués de la Valdavia in Alcobendas and is 15 to 20 minutes away from central Madrid by train (cercania). \\"The Seminary is close to parks, schools, recreational facilities, and various, metro, train, and bus stations. The Seminary building is both residential and educational.\\" ==Academics== Since 1922, the seminary has been training most of the Spanish Baptist pastors and leaders, but also of other evangelical denominations, offering formation programs that respond to the current ecclesial and ministerial needs inside and outside Spanish territory. In a 2014 interview Dr. Julio Díaz Piñeiro, director of the seminary, said, \\"Churches must recognize theological education as part of the teaching ministry of the church, and theological institutions, on the other hand, be at the service of congregations, not of themselves or of a misunderstood intelligentsia.\\" The seminary offers two accredited degree programs: Bachelor of Theology and Master of Theology.

An early Indian member of the Bombay Natural History Society he had a special interest in medicinal plants, he published many papers on botany and a major work on Indian medicinal plants was posthumously published by his colleague Major B.D. Basu. He illustrated many of the plates in the book. He also wrote many books on Medical sciences in English & Marathi. Besides being a surgeon & botanist, he was a poet; he wrote poetry especially in Marathi. == Life and work == Kirtikar was born in Bombay and studied at the Grant Medical College before travelling to England in 1874 where he became a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1876. He joined the Indian Medical Service at a time when it had few Indians and served in the 19th Native Infantry at Solapur and saw action in the Afghan War (1878-1880) and was awarded for gallant behaviour in the Battle of Maiwand. He then became a Civil Surgeon at Thane from 1881. He also served as 2nd Surgeon at the JJ Hospital and as Professor of Anatomy, Botany and Materia Medica at the Grant Medical College around 1886. He was made Fellow of the Bombay University in 1897 and served as Health Officer for Bombay. He was a contemporary and protege of Dr Sakharam Arjun at the Grant Medical College but during the famous case of Rukhmabai, step-daughter of Dr Arjun, Kirtikar was a hostile witness in court and supported Dadaji Bhikaji, the groom of Rukhmabai. In 1902 he was promoted to Brigade Surgeon- Lieut.Colonel. He retired in 1904. He took an interest in social and literary pursuits apart from science. He was a member of the Anthropological Society of Bombay, the Bombay Natural History Society and served as a Trustee of the Aryan Education Institute and as director of the Deccan Education Society and published several non-botanical works including poetry titled Indirakavya, Bhakti Sudha, and Vilaplahiri. He was also a member of the Masonic lodge of western India from 1886. He took an interest in fungi, cryptogams and algae that grow in hot-water springs at Bhiwandi. He also made microscopic observations on pollen. In 1896 he made a trip to Australia and wrote an article on his experiences in the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society. Kirtikar wrote a series on the poisonous plants of Bombay and was working on medicinal plants. His work on medicinal plants was however published only after his death through the work of his colleague Major Baman Das Basu (1867-1930) in 1918. A second edition was published in 1935 and this was largely rewritten by Ethelbert Blatter, J.F. Caius and K.S. Mhaskar. ==References External links == * Scanned copy of Indian Medicinal Plants (1918) Category:Indian Medical Service officers Category:19th-century Indian botanists Category:20th-century Indian botanists Category:Scientists from Mumbai Category:Medical doctors from Mumbai Category:Marathi people Category:19th-century Indian medical doctors Category:20th-century Indian medical doctors ","title":"Kanhoba Ranchoddas Kirtikar"},{"id":"56827562","text":"Mariano Ondo Mosuy Angong (born 29 June 1999) is an Equatoguinean footballer who plays as a defender for Liga Nacional de Fútbol club Cano Sport and the Equatorial Guinea national team. ==Career== He has played club football for Cano Sport Academy and Shkupi.http://fcshkupi.com/ondo-dhe-shkupi-nderprejne- bashkepunimin/ He made his international debut for Equatorial Guinea in 2017. ==References== Category:1999 births Category:Living people Category:Association football defenders Category:Equatoguinean footballers Category:Equatorial Guinea international footballers Category:Cano Sport Academy players Category:Macedonian First Football League players Category:FK Shkupi players Category:Equatoguinean expatriate footballers Category:Equatoguinean expatriate sportspeople in North Macedonia Category:Expatriate footballers in North Macedonia ","title":"Mariano Ondo"},{"id":"56827586","text":"Benjamín Edu Ndong Ndoho (born 13 March 1999) is an Equatoguinean international footballer who plays for Cano Sport Academy as a forward. ==Career== Born in Ebebiyín, he has played club football for Rio Ave. He is a product of Cano Sport Academy.

Ottmar Bühler (1884–1965), his father, was a distinguished Professor of Public Law - notably of Tax Law - at the university. Soon after Winfried was born his elder brother died, something which he very seldom mentioned but which nevertheless haunted him through his life. However, the timing of his birth meant that he narrowly avoided wartime conscription into the army or \\"Volkssturm\\" (militia). He attended the classics oriented \\"Beethoven Gymnasium\\" (secondary school) in Bonn, successfully completing his school leaving exams (\\"Abitur\\") at an unusually young age. He was still too young to be permitted to progress to a university immediately. During the Summer Term 1947 he joined a student building gang working on the reconstruction of the destroyed buildings at Bonn University. This guaranteed him the chance to enroll for the Winter Term. Having done so, he began by studying Philosophy and classical Philology. Later he broadened his academic scope to include Romance studies. He was taught at Bonn by the philologists Wolfgang Schmid and Hans Herter. He then moved on to Tübingen University where he was taught by Walther Ludwig. The two became lifelong friends. Bühler's subsequent student career also took in Hamburg, Lyon and Munich. He was by all accounts a serious and committed student. At Munich Bühler was taught by Rudolf Pfeiffer, who had recently returned from a lengthy period of political exile at Oxford University. He had been obliged to leave Munich in 1937 because Lili Pfeiffer, his wife, had been classified as Jewish by the authorities, which put their lives in danger if they remained in Germany. During his time in Oxford Pfeiffer had further enhanced his already formidable academic reputation, notably with further published work on the Callimachus papyri. For Winfried Bühler to be accepted as a student by Pfeiffer is taken by contemporaries as an indication that he had already himself been marked out as a student of exceptional ability and potential. In Autumn 1954 Bühler passed his Level 1 teaching exam. On 1 March 1955 he was appointed to a position as an academic research assistant at Munich in classical Philology. His doctorate followed in 1957. His dissertation, supervised by Pfeiffer, was a scholarly and rigorously detailed exploration of the epyllion on Europa by Moschus. The dissertation was in due course published as a book. Unusually, however, this took a further three years because Bühler completely rewrote it, to take account of new research and discoveries and, based on these, new evaluations of the handwritten tradition and Hellenistic usages. He received his habilitation, again from Munich, in 1962. This was followed by a two year research fellowship funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (\\"German Research Association\\"). He remained in Munich till 1966. That year he accepted an associate professorship at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he met Paul Friedländer. He returned to Germany just one year later, responding to an invitation from Hamburg University where in 1968 he was appointed to a professorship of classical philologist. Distinguished predecessors at Hamburg included Bruno Snell and Hartmut Erbse. Early on during his Hamburg years, in 1970, he rejected an attempt by the University of Bern to lure him away. Bühler remained at Hamburg till his retirement in 1991. He taught only till 1989, however, which was when funding from the Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft made it possible for him to progress without interruption his main project at that time, which was his work on the Proverbs of Zenobius. After 1991 he retired back to Munich. == Works == Greek mythology and Paremiography lay at the heart of Bühler's research. He was respected, in particular, as a leading contributor to the Lexikon des frühgriechischen Epos (\\"Lexicon of early Greek Epic Poetry\\"). Since 1982 he has engaged in producing a critical compilation of the sayings of Zenobius, which now extends to three volumes. == Memberships and honours == Bühler was a member of the Joachim Jungius Socierty of Arts and Humanities (\\"Joachim-Jungius-Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften\\") in Hamburg from 1972, serving as its president between 1982 and 1985. He was a full member of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities from 1980, having been a corresponding member since 1974. In 1985 he became a corresponding member of the British Academy He became a corresponding member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities in 1988. He also, in 2002, received an honorary doctorate from the University of Thessaloniki. == Output (selection) == * Die Europa des Moschos. Text, Übersetzung und Kommentar. Wiesbaden 1960 (Hermes.

These male writers sometimes found, in their Catholicism, a means of writing about their attraction to and desire for relationships with other men. Wilde had Catholic tendencies throughout his life and converted on his deathbed. He wrote about himself in De Profundis, during his imprisonment and hard labor, as akin to Christ embodying suffering, and invoked Christ's transformative power for the oppressed. Wilde's sometime lover, the poet John Gray, was Catholic. Raffalovich compared the physicality and the ecstasy of devotion to Christ to same-sex erotic desire. Hopkins's work was strongly marked by physicality and eroticism in its religious references, and the poet, who was reminded of Christ by other men whom he found beautiful, dwelt on the physicality of Christ's body and intimacy of his comfort and love. *Radclyffe Hall, author of The Well of Loneliness, was also a convert to Catholicism. Joanne Glasgow writes that for Hall and other lesbians of the early twentieth century, such as Alice B.

The game sees players build and manage their industrial empire as they attempt to grow and expand in the early 20th century. The game was released to early access on February 9, 2018, primarily through Steam and GOG until it was released as a full release on May 2, 2019. == Gameplay == In Rise of Industry, players begin with a sum of money and a map on which to build which is shared with several AI controlled towns and villages. It is your aim as the player to build an industrial empire by supplying these towns and villages with the products they demand. There are currently two main game modes, Career and Sandbox. In career mode, the player must choose a specialism in which to begin their empire. There are four specialisms to choose from: Gathering, Farming, Industry and Logistics. While all remain open for the player to use, the chosen specialism will grant more Research & Development points, which are used to upgrade in the tech tree. In Sandbox mode, all unlocks are available and the player can build without research and financial limitations. A game is played on a map which is broken up into regions, each requiring the player to buy a permit in order to build within that region. There are two permit types; a full build permit which enables you to build anything within that region and a logistical permit which will allow the placement of network elements such as railway tracks and roads but not buildings. The player can then start to place buildings such as factories, farms, gatherers etc. and then sell products to towns and villages requiring them. The price paid for your products is set by a global supply and demand system. The more of a product that is available, the less money you will receive, however towns will pay a premium for good that aren't as plentiful. The towns won't just rely on the player to get produce though. They will look to either produce a demanded item themselves, or look for a trade connection with neighbouring towns. Trade routes play a large part in the game as a function to move your products from A to B. The player can create a trade route for a variety of transport including trucks, boats, trains and zeppelins with each mode of transport having an advantage over another depending on the distance and capacity needed for each route. == Development == The game was originally named Project Automata in early development. Its name was changed to Rise of Industry in early 2017. Rise of Industry was released as a pre-alpha version on indie video game store, itch.io in order to gain player feedback in order to improve gameplay before the official early access release. During this time, Rise of Industry became the most purchased game of 2017 on Itch. == Reception == Rock Paper Shotgun said that Rise of Industry's early access release was \\"full of neat ideas\\" but that \\"they might wait until further updates to play again\\". PC Gamer called it a \\"fairly deep sim\\", although they thought that the lack of flexibility in the game \\"could put people off\\". Hardcore Gamer however praised Dapper Penguin Studios for \\"their total openness to their community\\" and \\"great willingness to listen to player feedback\\", stating \\"this is exactly how an Early Access release should be handled\\". == References == Category:2019 video games Category:Business simulation games Category:Linux games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Windows games ","title":"Rise of Industry"},{"id":"56827850","text":"Shrimaan Shrimati Phir Se is an Indian Sitcom which premiered on 13 March 2018 on SAB TV.

Some practitioners of Nichiren's teachings regard Ongi kuden as one of the most important treatises in Nichiren's writings, because it reveals the essential principles of Nichiren's teachings.(cf.) ==Structure== Ongi kuden is a series of lectures on important sentences and phrases of the Lotus Sutra, and includes the following lectures: * The meaning of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo * Each of the twenty-eight chapters of the Lotus Sutra (231 items) * The Immeasurable Meanings Sutra and the Universal Worthy Sutra * The essential passage in each of the twenty-eight chapters of the Lotus Sutra ==Concepts== Ongi kuden elucidates the following theories and concepts, with the ways of practices: * The Buddhism of sowing is superior to the Buddhism of the harvest in the Latter day (Mappō)This is a superiority Nichiren's followers have argued that Nichiren formulized the law and phenomena described in Buddhist teachings, namely Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, in order for everyone to practice and achieve the enlightenment. However, some have misunderstood that the practitioners must follow Nichiren's teachings exclusively and renounce the others, but the intention of superiority is to incorporate the value of everything with proper evaluation - which is called the position of Zettai myo - and Nichiren suggested to cherish the Shakyamuni's teachings or every other valuable thoughts and philosophy, and respect people, as a view that everyone can attain Buddhahood (no genetic inability for enlightenment). Frankly speaking, it can be explained as a metaphor that we can enjoy the movement of stars or utilize the power of pendulum (i.e. the phenomena preached in the Lotus Sutra) holistically with Newton's Equation of motion (i.e., Nam-myoho-renge-kyo). * Three Great Secret Laws (Dharmas) * Honzon (The object of devotion) in terms of the Person (Nin Honzoncf.

In addition, this is explained with the Q&A; that Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is placed at the beginning of the Ongi kuden because it is the core of all (of Shakyamuni's) teachings, and is the essence of the Lotus Sutra.

In 1848, Joseph purchased 80 acres from his father at this location. Between 1870 and 1872, he had a house built for himself, his wife, and their three children. Joseph Yerkes died in 1899. The house remained in the Yerkes family until 1959. By the late 1980s, the house had been abandoned for several years and was deteriorating. It was purchased in 1987 with the intention of preserving it; however, preservation efforts never got off the ground. The house was destroyed by fire On August 24, 1989.

The main section measured 34 feet by 32 feet, with a 1-1/2 story rear kitchen ell measuring 20 feet by 21 feet. The front entrance was through double doors in the base of the tower, to one side of which was a small front porch has Gothic, ogee-arch detailing. The windows in the facade were all tall, narrow, double-hung one-over-one units with projecting caps supported by small brackets. Above, the house's broadly projecting eaves were supported by paired brackets, beneath which were centrally positioned roundel decorations.

It was released on Netflix on March 16, 2018, after premiering at the Sundance Film Festival. ==EpisodesReceptionCritical reception=== Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes surveyed 44 critical responses and judged 98% of them to be positive, with an average rating of 7.92 out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Wild Wild Country succeeds as an intriguing examination of a forgotten piece of American history that must be seen to be believed.\\" Nick Allen of RogerEbert.com wrote \\"by handling this story so intelligently and by opening its heart to a very complicated idea of good and evil, Wild Wild Country has a profound, mesmerizing power itself\\". In 2018, Wild Wild Country won the Creative Arts Emmy Award for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series. ===Criticism=== Some have criticized Wild Wild Country for leaving out critical information regarding the activities of the Rajneesh followers, particularly regarding sexual assault of women and children as well as possible intent to unleash an AIDS epidemic. Journalist Win McCormack wrote that \\"Where the filmmakers have fallen down on the job is in the area of interpretation. They have not addressed squarely some of the more important issues raised by their film, and have left others out completely. The latter category includes a few of the cult’s most odious practices, as well as the true extent of the threat it posed not only to its immediate neighbors in Oregon, but to the entire world.\\" Jane Stork, one of the main sources for this documentary, reported in her autobiography Breaking the Spell: My Life as a Rajneeshee and the Long Journey Back to Freedom (2009) that her own children were sexually abused during her time in Rajneeshpuram.Sussex, Lucy (April 19, 2009). \\"Breaking The Spell : My Life As A Rajneeshee, And The Long Journey Back To Freedom - BOOKS\\".

They are retrotransposons that invade a eukaryotic host genome and may only replicate once the virus has infected the host. These genetic elements exist to infect and replicate in their host genome and are derived from ancestral elements unrelated from their host. Metavirus may use several different hosts for transmission, and has been found to be transmissible through ovule and pollen of some plants. Metavirus contains five families of the Ty3/Gypsy element with either one or two open-reading frames; these families are mdg1, mdg3, blastopia, 412, and micropia. Each of the five families contains either one or two open-reading frames, gag3 and/or pol3. There is evidence to support that amino acid deprivation in the elements host genome has frequently caused a frameshift towards the Ty3 element. Metavirus corresponds with the Ogre/Tat gene lineage. == Morphology == Species of Metavirus are single-stranded RNA retrotransposons. They have an icosahedral and linear conformation and are not enclosed in an envelope. Their diameter is approximately 50 nm and they are usually between 42 and 52 nm in length. These genetic elements contain a core and capsid. == Species == The following species are recognized: *Arabidopsis thaliana Athila virus *Arabidopsis thaliana Tat4 virus *Bombyx mori Mag virus *Caenorhabditis elegans Cer1 virus *Cladosporium fulvum T-1 virus *Dictyostelium discoideum Skipper virus *Drosophila buzzatii Osvaldo virus *Drosophila melanogaster 412 virus *Drosophila melanogaster Blastopia virus *Drosophila melanogaster Mdg1 virus *Drosophila melanogaster Mdg3 virus *Drosophila melanogaster Micropia virus *Drosophila virilis Ulysses virus *Fusarium oxysporum Skippy virus *Lilium henryi Del1 virus *Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ty3 virus *Schizosaccharomyces pombe Tf1 virus *Schizosaccharomyces pombe Tf2 virus *Takifugu rubripes Sushi virus *Tribolium castaneum Woot virus *Tripneustis gratilla SURL virus == Evolution == Because of their high mutation and recombination rate and their ability to conduct horizontal gene transfer, the evolutionary history of many retroelements may be challenging to trace (Benachenhou et al., 2013). Scientists often look to the genomes of Metavirus to compare nucleic acid sequences to the sequences of other viruses, constructing lineages and proposing common ancestors. Multiple taxa of Metavirus have genomic sequence that are homologous to other genera of Metaviridae and a suggest common ancestor and/or coevolution. Scientists often look at capsid proteins for evidence of Metavirus evolution. Much of the lineage of Metavirus remains unsolved and is presently being researched. === Studies === Mascagni et al. (2017) conducted researched to find homologs and identify strands in sunflower species. In the experiment, DNA was extracted from various helianthus species and the genomes of retrotransposons were identified using BLASTX analysis. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using neighbor-joining clustering method and a bioinformatic pipeline was constructed to allow genomic analysis. Two elements, SURE and Helicopia, were identified and placed into the Gypsy and Copia superfamilies, respectively. Thus, the SURE element belongs to the Gypsy group, of the Ogre/Tat lineage, of the genus Metavirus. Further analysis led Mascagni et al. (2017) to identify mutations and conclude that the Metavirus lineage evolved before Sirevirus. Mascagni et al. (2017) also found evidence that the SURE elements and Helicopia elements had hybridized, potential for new lineages. Nefedova and Kim (2009), conducted a study on Drosophila melanogaster to further identify lineages of Metavirus. Homologs were identified from previously extracted DNA of retrotransposons and Drosophila melanogaster and phylogenetic trees were constructed. Metaviruses possess the env gene, allowing them to be infective, which Nefedova and Kim (2009) concluded was obtained from horizontal gene transfer from baculoviruses. Metavirus contains the roo element which is thought to have been obtained from gene transfer from Errantivirus, or more likely, the two genera share a common ancestor. ==ReferencesICTVdB Index of Viruses * Descriptions of Plant Viruses Category:Metaviridae Category:RNA reverse-transcribing viruses Category:Virus genera ","title":"Metavirus"},{"id":"56828574","text":"The Fiji Pro 2016 was an event of the World Surf League for 2017 World Surf League.

He was a highly talented horse whose career was adversely affected by his difficult temperament. He did not appear until the autumn of his two-year- old season but made an immediate impact as he finished third in the Middle Park Stakes and then won the Dewhurst Stakes. In the following spring he won the Craven Stakes and the 2000 Guineas but lost his chance in the Epsom Derby when he became highly agitated before the start. He went on to finish third in the Eclipse Stakes and second in the St Leger before winning the Newmarket St Leger on his final appearance. He died at the age of five in 1916 after a single season at stud. ==Background== Kennymore was a bay horse bred in England by his owner Sir John Thursby, 2nd Baronet. The colt was trained by Alec Taylor Jr. at Manton in Wiltshire. He was a difficult horse to manage and was described as having a \\"vile temper\\". He was sired by Thursby's stallion John o'Gaunt who finished second in both the 2000 Guineas and Epsom Derby in 1904. The best of his other progeny was probably Swynford. Kennymore's dam was a granddaughter of Brown Bess, who was a half-sister to the 2000 Guineas winner Scot Free. ==Racing career1913: two-year-old season=== On 17 October, on his racecourse debut, Kennymore finished third behind Cocyra and Stornoway in the Middle Park Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. Ridden by Albert Whalley in the Dewhurst Plate over seven furlongs at the same track two weeks later he started at odds of 4/1 and won \\"comfortably\\" from Corcyra and Carrickfergus. After the race the colt was described as \\"a fairly formidable opponent for classic honours\\", although The Tetrarch (unbeaten in seven races) was regarded as by far the best British juvenile of the year. ===1914: three-year-old season=== Sir John Thusby, who owned and bred Kennymore Kennymore's classic prospects improved in early spring of when it became clear that The Tetrarch was having serious physical problems and was unlikely to stand further training. The colt began his second season in the Craven Stakes over the Rowley Mile in April in which he was ridden by Frank O'Neill and won at odds of 1/2. It was noted however that he had been troublesome and difficult to control before the start. On 29 April, in the presence of King George V, the colt was partnered by the French jockey Georges Stern when he contested the 106th running of the 2000 Guineas over the same course and distance. With The Tetrach absent as predicted, he stated the 2/1 favourite against seventeen opponents. Kennymore led from the start and held off a challenge from Corcyra to win the race by a short head, with two lengths back to Black Jester in third. After the race the colt was promoted to favouritism for the Epsom Derby and his position was consolidated when The Tetrarch was withdrawn from the race in mid-May. On 27 May Kennymore started 9/4 favourite for the Derby over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse. The start of the race was delayed for more than twenty minutes as the starter struggled to control the thirty-one runners leading Kennymore to become increasingly fractious, lashing out with his hooves and attempting to attack other horses. According to some reports however, the trouble was started when the colt was kicked by another horse, his distress being exacerbated by the rowdy behaviour of the \\"utterly inconsiderate\\" crowd. He was facing in the wrong direction and left a long way behind the other horses when the race began and after rushing up into sixth place approaching the straight he faded to finish twelfth behind the French outsider Durbar. On 17 July Kennymore returned to the track for the Eclipse Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park. As at Epsom, he misbehaved and delayed the start by his \\"furious antics\\" and refusal to line up alongside the other horses: it was only with some difficulty that his jockey, Jimmy Clark, persuaded him to race when the starting barrier went up. Although the race was open to older horses the finish was dominated by three-year-old colts, and Kennymore finished third behind Hapsburg (second in the Derby) and Honeywood. Clark commented \\"he seemed disinclined to race...he disppointed me\\" but added that the colt would be better suited by \\"a long, galloping course\\". Alec Taylor decided to equip Kennymore with blinkers when the colt was moved up in distance to contest the St Leger Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs at a Doncaster Racecourse on 10 September. He tood the lead from the start and set a \\"rasping\\" pace but tired in the straight and finished second, beaten five lengths by Black Jester. After the race Kennymoe's connections were reportedly critical of the forcing tactics employed by Kennymore's jockey Fred Templeman. On 2 October, Kennymore ended his season by winning the Newmarket St Leger over one and three quarter miles against moderate opposition. ==Assessment and honours== In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Kennymore an \\"inferior\\" winner of the 2000 Guineas. ==Stud record== Kennymore was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion. He had little chance to prove himself, however, as he died in the late summer of 1916 after siring only one crop of foals. ==PedigreeReferences== Category:1911 racehorse births Category:1916 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 1-a Category:2000 Guineas winners ","title":"Kennymore"},{"id":"56828696","text":"Clifford Linedecker is an American investigative journalist and author of true crime books. ==Biography== Linedecker was born in Plymouth, Indiana and graduated from Plymouth High School in 1950.

He was the descendant of Ksemankara Deva who is believed to be the founder of the Bhaumakara rule in ancient Odisha and also the earliest organizer of the Varna system in the region. Sivakara Deva I pursued a career of conquest in the eastern part of India establishing the Bhaumakaras as the supreme power in the whole region during his lifetime. He conquered the kingdom of Radha(Rarh) and subjugated the Eastern Ganga rulers of Kalinga as his vassals. He was a devout Buddhist who adopted the epithets of Paramopasaka and Paramatathgata meaning a devout worshiper of Buddha which has been mentioned in the Neulpur charter of the Bhaumakaras. He sent a Buddhist scholar as an emissary to the Chinese emperor Te-tsong or Dezong with valuable Mahayana Buddhist manuscripts and established a new era of maritime trade and cultural relationship between ancient Odisha and China. == Military Achievements == Sivakara Deva I is glorified as a military champion in eastern India across the inscriptions left by his descendants and others. The Talcher plates issued by one of his descendant Sivakara III compares him with the king Puru and states that he defeated and enslaved his enemies with his might. He is also described as an efficient archer in the battlefield being able to shoot multiple sharp arrows by drawing the bowstring till his ear. === Conquest of Rarh === Sivakara Deva I marched with a huge army on Rarh and conquered the opponent after a high pitched battle with the forces of Rarh which was situated in the northern part of the Bhaumakara territory. Historian R.C.Banarjee identifies the mention of Rarh in the Bhaumakara inscription with the territory that comprised around the modern Bankura district confined between the rivers Ajay and Rup Narayan. He married Jayavallabhi who was the princess of Rarh kingdom after defeating the enemy. Historians have placed the northern extent of the Bhaumakara kingdom during this era to be Dandabhukti or the area surrounding modern Medinapur and hence established that invasion of Rarh by Sivakara Deva I was just raid in order to subjugate the kingdom as feudal state under the Bhaumakara rule. === Conquest until River Godavari in the South === Sivakara Deva I sent his son Subhakara Deva I to conquer the southern territories of the early Eastern Ganga dynasty rulers which was also known as Svetaka Mandala or the heartland of Kalinga kingdom. The Dhenkanal charter of Tribhuvana Mahadevi I provides a poetic indication of a fierce battle between the armies Kalinga comprising large number of war elephants and that of Utkala's Bhaumakara dynasty which ended in the later's victory. The entire region from the rivers Rushikulya to Godavari was subjugated by the Bhaumakaras though allowing the Eastern Gangas to continue ruling as vassals under them. An Eastern Ganga king named as Jayavarmadeva mentioned himself as the vassal of Sivakara Deva I in his Ganjam grant and by whose permission he gave away the grants. == Relations with Tang Dynasty of China and personality == Sivakara Deva I is also recorded to have sent an eminent Mahayana Buddhist scholar named as Prajna with the manuscript called Gandavyuha Sutra to the Tang court of emperor Dezong in China personally autographed by him. The monk Prajna who was a scholar in Buddhist studies at the monastery of Ratnagiri stayed in China for sometime and also translated the Buddhist manuscript Shat- paramita Sutra into Chinese. Sivakara Deva I is mentioned in the Chinese records as \\"the fortunate monarch who does what is pure, the lion\\". This initiation of overseas cultural exchange indicates the existence of regular maritime routes for trade and cultural exchange between ancient Odisha and China. The king is recorded to have many qualities of that employed both his heart and mind. He encouraged new talents and was always accompanied by several scholars. He was effort bound to solve the difficulties of his people and always tried to meet their hopes. The Angul inscription of his descendant Dharma Mahadevi praises him as \\"Unmattasimha acquired the ever-lasting renown and resembled the moon covering all regions with great lustre and delighting people by dispelling the heat.\\" The Dhenkanal charter of Tribhuvana Mahadevi I also praises him for the good qualities like spending money on the construction of various spiritual places, monasteries and temples. He avoided excess personal luxury and taxation of his subjects. == References == Category:History of Odisha ","title":"Sivakara Deva I"},{"id":"56828728","text":"T. H.

Sympathetic to the Taiwanese people and deeply critical of Kuomintang rule, A Pail of Oysters was suppressed in the 1950s before gaining new life after the end of martial law in Taiwan. ==Aim of the novel== Sneider hoped that the book would reduce the suffering of Taiwanese people under the Kuomintang. He wrote to George H. Kerr, later author of Formosa Betrayed, saying the viewpoint in the novel \\"will be strictly that of the Formosan people, trying to exist under that government. And … maybe, in my small way, I can do something for the people of Formosa.\\" Jonathan Benda, in his introduction to the 2016 edition of the book, argues that Sneider's novel intended \\"to make Americans think in particular about the regime they supported in Taiwan, but more generally about what the U.S. role in Asia should be\\". ==Reception== On release the book received positive critical reviews, but was banned in Taiwan and was attacked by the China Lobby in the United States. One academic familiar with the impact of the book commented in 2003 that \\"copies of A Pail of Oysters have disappeared from most libraries, probably on instructions issued to the student spies paid by the KMT to monitor Taiwanese on US college campuses\\". ==Reemergence in the 2000s== After the end of martial law in Taiwan the book was published in translated editions in both Mandarin Chinese (in 2002) and Taiwanese (2003).

From 2019-2020, an agreement to buy the dam and reservoir by the Four Lakes Task Force, a \\"county-delegated authority\\" under the State of Michigan, from Boyce Hydro L.L.C. was in place, However, in May of 2020, the lake was destroyed when the earthen dam used to impound it overtopped and then collapsed.

It said it had requested permission from Michigan's EGLE, which failed to issue it. Despite the lack of a permit, it said it lowered the water \\"due to concern for the safety of its operators and the downstream community\\", and it proceeded to sue EGLE in federal court on April 29, 2020.

Probably built in the second half of the 18th century, it served as a tavern on what was then a major through road, and housed the town's first post office. It is now operated as a museum by the local historical society. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. ==Description and history== The Fobes-O'Donnell House is located in what is now a rural setting of northern Oakham, on the south side of the junction of Old Turnpike Road and Hunt Road. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. The main facade is five bays wide, with symmetrically placed windows around the center entrance, A single-story porch extends across the front, with late 19th-century Victorian bracketing and slender columns. The interior follows a typical central chimney plan, with a narrow entrance vestibule, kitchen to the left, and parlor to the right. A single-story ell extends to the left side. The house stands on of land, substantially reduced from more than the 100 acres it was historically associated with. The exact construction date of the house is unknown, but appears from stylistic evidence to date from the second half of the 18th century. It was probably built by John Murray, a wealthy landowner from nearby Rutland. Murray held Loyalist sympathies during the period of the American Revolution, eventually fled to Canada. His property was seized by the state, and was acquired by Joseph Fobes in 1799. Fobes operated a tavern on the premises, serving travelers on the turnpike, which was a major route between Boston and Hadley. In 1813, he became Oakham's first postmaster, operating the post office out of this building. The building was sold out of the Fobes family to the O'Donnells in 1894. Members of both of these families were active in local civic affairs, serving in town offices. The house was given to the Oakham Historical Society in 1994 by the O'Donnells. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Worcester County, Massachusetts ==References== Category:Houses in Worcester County, Massachusetts Category:Oakham, Massachusetts Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Worcester County, Massachusetts Category:Historic house museums in Massachusetts ","title":"Fobes-O'Donnell House"},{"id":"56828971","text":"Six Pack is a 1992 studio album by American jazz vibraphonist Gary Burton. ==Reception== Daniel Gioffre of Allmusic wrote \\"Gary Burton's peculiar connection and affinity for great guitarists is a proven historical fact, as he has been responsible for bringing such fantastic musicians to the world stage as Larry Coryell and Pat Metheny.

Kurt Rosenwinkel makes like Metheny on the first track, the up-tempo Mitch Forman composition \\"Anthem.\\" Any predictability to the song disappears in the presence of the rhythm section of Jack DeJohnette, Steve Swallow, and Mulgrew Miller. One doesn't generally think of the vibes as a blues instrument, and to be fair, it's really not, but Burton gives it the old college try on the title track, where his vibes intersect surprisingly well with Bob Berg's tenor sax and B.B. King's guitar. There is absolutely nothing weighty about this song at all, but it is fun and swinging nevertheless (who says jazz has to be serious all the time?). John Scofield also shows up on the track, and his distinctive tone and phrasing work perfectly in this setting. Other selections include such notables as Jim Hall, Ralph Towner, and Kevin Eubanks, and all of their contributions are solid in their own way. One sometimes wishes that this record was a little less GRP, with Larry Goldings' keyboards and Berg's sax being the most frequent offenders, but there are plenty of hot moments on Six Pack that make this record worth searching out, especially for fans of jazz guitar.

Trump; Docket # 1:20-cv-02658 (CJN)=== On Sunday, September 27, 2020, Judge Nichols, granting in part the motion of plaintiffs TikTok and ByteDance, issued a preliminary injunction partially enjoining (i.e., temporarily stopping) the Department of Commerce's implementation of President Trump's August 6, 2020 Executive Order prohibiting certain transactions related to TikTok. The portion of the prohibition that Nichols enjoined would have barred Apple and Google from offering TikTok in their app stores, and would have taken effect just before midnight that night. The case is continuing. ===Donald J. Trump v. Committee on Ways and Means, et al; Case # 19-2173 (D.D.C.)=== On August 1, 2019, Nichols issued a temporary order which barred the State of New York from handing over state tax returns to the U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means and established a briefing and hearing schedule. The State, through its Attorney General and co-defendant Letitia James, promptly asked Nichols to dismiss the lawsuit or transfer it to a federal court in New York, on the ground that it cannot be maintained against them where the defendants neither reside nor act. On November 11, 2019, Nichols dismissed the lawsuit, finding that the court did not have jurisdiction over the New York Attorney General or the Commissioner of the New York Department of Taxation and Finance. == Memberships == Nichols has been a member of the Federalist Society; once from 2003–2008 and again since 2018. == See also == * List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States == References  External links == * * Category:Living people Category:1970 births Category:20th-century American lawyers Category:21st-century American lawyers Category:21st-century American judges Category:Dartmouth College alumni Category:Federalist Society members Category:George W.

It is ranked number 29 on Rolling Stone's list of 100 Greatest Brazilian Albums. ==Background== Considered a watershed in MPB for fusing various elements of African sound with samba, Os Afro-sambas was recorded by Baden Powell, Vinícius de Moraes, and Quarteto em Cy in 1966. In the mid-1960s Vinícius was fascinated by an LP of samba de roda songs with candomblé influences from Bahia. Baden Powell had also gone to Bahia and heard the songs of the Bahian candomblé. From this mutual enchantment with samba and religiosity found in Bahia, the Afro-sambas project emerged. The eight songs have a rich and unique musicality: a mix of candomblé and umbanda instruments (like atabaques and afoxés) with timbres common to Brazilian music (agogôs, saxophones and tambourines). The opening track, Canto de Ossanha is ranked number 9 on Rolling Stone's list of 100 greatest Brazilian songs. Baden Powell re-recorded this album in 1990, again accompanied by Quarteto em Cy, but this time singing the lead vocal himself, Vinícius having died. ==Track listing== All tracks are jointly authored by Baden Powell and Vinícius de Moraes. # Canto de Ossanha - 03:23 # Canto de Xangô - 06:28 # Bocoché - 02:34 # Canto de Iemanjá - 04:47 # Tempo de amor - 04:28 # Canto do Caboclo Pedra-Preta - 03:39 # Tristeza e solidão - 04:35 # Lamento de Exu - 02:16 ==Personnel== * Vocals - Vinícius de Moraes, Quarteto em Cy and mixed choir * Guitar - Baden Powell * Flute - Nicolino Copia * Tenor saxophone - Pedro Luiz de Assis * Baritone saxophone - Aurino Ferreira * Double bass - Jorge Marinho * Drums - Reisinho * Atabaque - Alfredo Bessa * Little atabaque - Nelson Luiz * Bongô - Alexandre Silva Martins * Pandeiro - Gilson de Freitas * Agogô - Mineirinho * Afoxé - Adyr José Raimundo * Arrangements and musical direction - Guerra Peixe * Production and artistic direction - Roberto Quartin and Wadi Gebara Netto * Recording technician - Ademar Rocha * Photos - Pedro de Moraes * Cover - Goebel Weyne * Liner notes - Vinícius de Moraes == References == Category:1966 albums Category:Vinicius de Moraes albums Category:Samba albums ","title":"Os Afro-sambas"},{"id":"56829307","text":"Joseph Fox (7 November 1775 – 11 April 1816) was an English dental surgeon, known also as a philanthropist. He was a pioneer writer and lecturer on dentistry. ==Early life== He was the son of Joseph Fox, a dentist, and his wife, Mary Rogers, daughter of John Rogers, a Baptist minister of Southwark, and was born in Crooked Lane, in the City of London. A medical student at Guy's Hospital by 1794, he became dresser to the surgeon Henry Cline. The lectures he gave on the teeth, from 1799, supported by Astley Cooper who was another of Cline's pupils, were the first to be delivered for a London medical institution. According to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, there was no British precedent, and possibly none worldwide. Fox built up a private dental practice in London. He belonged to the Particular Baptist church of John Rippon, in Carter Lane, London. ==Education and the Lancasterian system== In 1807 Fox was taken by Sir John Jackson, 1st Baronet to hear Joseph Lancaster lecture, in Dover. He then met Lancaster and his supporter William Corston in London, and heard the extent of Lancaster's financial difficulties with his education society. With Corston and William Allen, Fox helped put the society, which became in time the British and Foreign School Society, on a sound basis. The initial committee consisted of: Allen, Corston, Fox, Jackson, with Joseph Foster and Thomas Sturge. Lancaster himself chafed under the committee's tutelage, and became resentful. By 1812 he branched out with a boarding school at Tooting, without approval. Francis Place joined the committee that year, and a rupture became inevitable by 1814, with Lancaster resigning amid acrimony and alleged scandal. In 1814, Fox and Allen bought into the New Lanark project. They were part of a consortium, including also Forster, put together by Robert Owen, to buy out the original New Lanark investors. The educational interests were relevant to Owen, who had been rebuffed by the Anglican Bell system, closed to dissenters. Fox supported Allen in his successful effort to make Owen allow religious education and the Bible in New Lanark's schools. ==Death== Fox died on 11 April 1816, at his house in Argyle Street, London. ==Associations== Fox was a member of the Askesian Society, and from 1798 was a supporter of Edward Jenner, making his house available for vaccinations. In 1800 he joined the Royal Institution. He corresponded with Josiah Wedgwood II, in particular on the topic of porcelain false teeth. From 1809 and its founding, to 1812, Fox was Secretary of the London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews. He had Thomas Fry as colleague from 1810. ==Works== Illustration from The natural history of the human teeth (1803) by Joseph Fox *The Natural History of the Human Teeth (1803) *The History and Treatment of the Diseases of the Teeth (1806). This and the Natural History were major early works of British dentistry, illustrated and giving details of procedures. There were British and American editions, and a French translation. In the tradition of Thomas Berdmore, Fox wrote without extensive citation of authorities, meeting later objection from the French dentist Joseph Audibran. *A Comparative View of the Plans of Education, as Detailed in the Publications of Dr. Bell and Mr. Lancaster (1808) *A Vindication of Mr Lancaster's System of Education from the Aspersions of Professor Marsh, the Quarterly, British, and Anti-Jacobin Reviews, &c.;, &c.; (1812) Written by Fox under a pseudonym, Against Herbert Marsh and other Anglican clergy. The letters making up the work were first published in The Statesman. There is a comparison of the Lancastrian system with that of Andrew Bell, a Scottish Episcopalian. This and the previous book were contributions to a controversy, along the divide caused by nonconformism, in which Robert Southey involved himself, in the Quarterly Review. ==Family== Fox married in 1808 Ann Gibbs. They had a son and a daughter. ==Notes== Category:1775 births Category:1816 deaths Category:British dentists Category:British writers ","title":"Joseph Fox (dental surgeon)"}]`),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},P={class:"card-container"};function R(s,a,o,c,u,i){const g=y("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Life Quotes🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",P,[(t(!0),n(h,null,f(i.visiblePoems,(r,m)=>(t(),w(g,{key:m,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const D=d(F,[["render",R]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/61.md","filePath":"people/61.md"}'),I={name:"people/61.md"},G=Object.assign(I,{setup(s){return(a,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(D)]))}});export{L as __pageData,G as default};
