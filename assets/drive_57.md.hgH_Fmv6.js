American Express Co., 585 U.S. ___ (2018), was a United States Supreme Court case regarding the nature of antitrust law in relationship to two-sided markets. The case specifically involves policies set by some credit card banks that prevented merchants from steering customers to use cards from other issuers with lower transaction fees, forcing merchants to pay higher transaction fees to the banks. While Visa and MasterCard settled with the United States Department of Justice in 2010, American Express defended its practice by arguing that the anti-steering policies benefited its cardholders, the higher transaction fees helping to maintain member services. While the Department of Justice and several states prevailed during a District Court trial in 2015 citing harm to the merchants, the Appeals Court reversed the District Court's ruling in 2016 by ruling that the plaintiffs had not shown harm to both sides of the two-side market, a novel test in antitrust law. This decision led to some of the states to appeal to the Supreme Court. The case was heard by the Court in February 2018. The Court issued its decision on June 25, 2018, affirming the Appeals Court's ruling that steering provisions do not violate antitrust laws. With this decision upheld, the two-market test could be applied to other venues, particularly to the high tech sector where two- side markets are common. ==Background== Within the United States, credit card transactions are controlled by four main financial institutions: Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover, making it an oligopoly. Credit cards work as a two-sided market, with the institutions providing benefits to consumers (by allowing them to access lines of credit to make instant purchases) and merchants (by providing them the funds for that purchase instantly). The institutions support this by taking a transaction fee off the merchant's funds, with the fee varying between each institution. Of the four institutions, Discover was the latest offering, created in 1985. To try to compete with the other three institutions on the market, Discover developed a low-cost transaction fee model compared to the other three institutions, which gave incentive for merchants to steer customers towards using Discover cards. To counter this, Visa, MasterCard, and American Express all developed anti- steering contractual language to merchants that prevented them from steering customers into using other cards; this included informing their customers of the different fees and offering discounts and other incentives by using other cards. This also affected the promotion of other cards offered within the institution's network, such as using debit cards with lower fees compared to credit cards. ==District Court== In October 2010, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), after receiving numerous complaints that the anti-steering language violating antitrust laws and following two years of investigation, filed a civil antitrust lawsuit against Visa, MasterCard, and American Express in United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The DOJ asserted that with in transaction fees each year, the practices of these three institutions prevented merchants from reducing their own costs of business, and requiring them to raise prices to consumers. The DOJ's suit was joined by the states of Connecticut, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio and Texas. Visa and MasterCard immediately settled with the DOJ without any fines, agreeing to remove the anti-steering language imposed on merchants. However, American Express defended its practice, and continued to fight the lawsuit. During the pre-trial period, additional states also joined the other plaintiffs, including Arizona, Idaho, Illinois, New Hampshire, Montana, Nebraska, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, and Utah; Hawaii had also joined but later dismissed its claims before the trial. In February 2015, following a seven-week trial hearing, the District Court ruled in favor of the DOJ and states, finding that American Express's anti-steering terms violated antitrust laws. Judge Nicholas Garaufis wrote that the language was \\"an unlawful restraint on trade\\" and considered the language to violate Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. American Express asserted that it would appeal the decision. Garaufis issued a permanent injunction on American Express from enforcing its anti-steering language in April 2015. ==Appeals Court== American Express's appeal was heard in the 2nd Circuit Appeals Court in December 2015. After the oral testimony, the Appeals Court lifted the injunction placed by Judge Garaufis. The full ruling of the Appeals Court in September 2016 reversed the lower court ruling; the Appeals Court argued that the plaintiffs had not shown harm that American Express's anti-steering had to merchants or consumers, and that the government would have been required to show how higher prices to merchants set by the transaction fees would harm consumer or not benefit them. The Appeals Court also argued that merchants overburdened by high transaction fees could simply cease accepting that card. This decision was considered to have created a new type of rule that could make it difficult to seek antitrust litigation; with credit cards being a two-sided market serving two distinct sets of customers, a successful antitrust argument would have to show how both sides of the market were harmed. The DOJ petitioned the Appeals Court to reconsider the case at an en banc hearing, believing that their decision looked at both merchants and consumers, instead of focusing only on the impact to merchants alone, and that the onus should be for American Express to show how its anti-steering clauses would promote competition. The Appeals Court refused to reconsider its decision by January 2017. ==Supreme Court== While the Department of Justice and other states dropped the suit, eleven states continued to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States and filed petition to hear the case in June 2017; Ohio (leading the petition for appeal), Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, Rhode Island, Utah and Vermont. The States' appeal raised questions of the Second Circuit's decision in conflict with past case law, and that Supreme Court guidance was needed on how antitrust measures should be applied a two-sided market, which was becoming a significant portion of the national economy. The Supreme Court accepted the case in October 2017. Oral arguments were heard on February 26, 2018; court observers reported that both sides were equally asked tough questions, and it was difficult to determine which direction the Court would take. Questions asked in the oral session were principally from Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch. The Court issued its 5-4 decision on June 25, 2018, affirming the Appeals Court's ruling, and that the American Express steering provisions did not violate antitrust law. The majority opinion, written by Justice Clarence Thomas and joined by Justices Roberts, Kennedy, Alito, and Gorsuch, found that the petitioners had not shown any harm of the steering provisions that otherwise would not have occurred if no steering provisions were in place, nor have the provisions stifled competition in the market. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote the dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan, taking issue with how the rule of reason had been applied for this case throughout its judicial history. ==Impact== While a direct financial impact related to the (as of 2018) in transaction fees would be affected by the Court's decision, analysts have observed that this case could impact antitrust measures in the tech sector. There, many companies could argue they are a two- sided market, such as Amazon.com which links vendors to customers. Should the Court rule for American Express and uphold the Second Circuit's ruling, it would make it difficult for antitrust litigation to be enforced since plaintiffs would need to show harm to both sides of the market. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Anti-competitive practices Category:Credit cards in the United States Category:United States antitrust case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court Category:2018 in United States case law Category:American Express ","title":"Ohio v.

CUT&RUN- sequencing; combines antibody-targeted controlled cleavage by micrococcal nuclease with massively parallel DNA sequencing to identify the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins. It can be used to map global DNA binding sites precisely for any protein of interest. Currently, ChIP-Seq is the most common technique utilized to study protein‚ÄìDNA relations, however, it suffers from a number of practical and economical limitations that CUT&RUN-sequencing; does not. ==Uses== CUT&RUN-sequencing; can be used to examine gene regulation or to analyze transcription factor and other chromatin-associated protein binding. Protein-DNA interactions regulate gene expression and are responsible for many biological processes and disease states. This epigenetic information is complementary to genotype and expression analysis. CUT&RUN; is an alternative to the current standard of ChIP-seq. ChIP-Seq suffers from limitations due to the cross linking step in ChIP-Seq protocols that can promote epitope masking and generate false-positive binding sites. As well, ChIP-seq suffers from suboptimal signal-to-noise ratios and poor resolution. CUT&RUN-sequencing; has the advantage of being a simpler technique with lower costs due to the high signal-to-noise ratio, requiring less depth in sequencing. Specific DNA sites in direct physical interaction with proteins such as transcription factors can be isolated by Protein-A (pA) conjugated micrococcal nuclease (MNase) bound to a protein of interest. MNase mediated cleavage produces a library of target DNA sites bound to a protein of interest in situ. Sequencing of prepared DNA libraries and comparison to whole-genome sequence databases allows researchers to analyze the interactions between target proteins and DNA, as well as differences in epigenetic chromatin modifications. Therefore, the CUT&RUN; method may be applied to proteins and modifications, including transcription factors, polymerases, structural proteins, protein modifications, and DNA modifications. ==Workflow == Visual Representation of the CUT&RUN; sequencing workflow. CUT&RUN; is an adaptation and improvement on chromatin endogenous cleavage (ChEC) which uses a DNA-binding protein genetically fused to micrococcal nuclease (MNase). These transcription factor-MNase fusion proteins can cleave DNA around the DNA-binding site of the protein of interest. In the adapted process, purified MNase is tagged with Protein A (pA) which targets an antibody that has been added to the cell and is specific for the DNA-binding protein that is of interest. There are seven general steps to the CUT&RUN; process. ===Cleavage under targets and release using nuclease=== The first step required is the hypotonic lysis of the cells of interest to isolate the nuclei. The nuclei are then centrifuged, washed in a buffer solution, complexed with lectin-coated magnetic beads. The Lectin-Nuclei complex is then resuspended with an antibody targeted at the protein of interest. The antibody and nuclei are then incubated in the buffer for approximately 2 hours before the nuclei are washed in buffer to remove unbound antibodies. Next, the nuclei are resuspended in the buffer with Protein-A-MNase and are incubated for 1 hour. The nuclei are then again washed in buffer to remove any unbound protein-A-MNase. Next, the nuclei in tubes are placed in a metal block and placed in ice-water and CaCL2 is added to initiate the calcium dependent nuclease activity of MNase to cleave the DNA around the DNA-binding protein. The protein-A-MNase reaction is quenched by adding chelating agents (EDTA and EGTA). The cleaved DNA fragments are then liberated into the supernatant by incubating the nuclei for an hour before the nuclei is pelleted by centrifugation. The DNA fragments are then extracted from the supernatant and can be used to construct a sequencing library. ===Sequencing=== Unlike ChIP- Seq there is no size selection required before sequencing. A single sequencing run can scan for genome-wide associations with high resolution, due to the low background achieved by performing the reaction in situ with the CUT&RUN- sequencing; methodology. ChIP-Seq, by contrast, requires ten times the sequencing depth because of the intrinsically high background associated with the method. The data is then collected and analyzed using software that aligns sample sequences to a known genomic sequence to identify the CUT&RUN; DNA fragments. === Protocols === There are detailed CUT&RUN; workflows available in an open-access methods repository. * CUT&RUN;: Targeted in situ genome-wide profiling with high efficiency for low cell numbers * CUT&RUN; with Drosophila tissues * AutoCUT&RUN;: genome-wide profiling of chromatin proteins in a 96 well format on a Biomek * Bench top CUT&RUN; with antibodies-online CUT&RUN; Sets ==Sensitivity== CUT&RUN-Sequencing; provides low levels of background signal because of in situ profiling which retains in vivo 3D confirmations of transcription factor-DNA interactions, so antibodies access only exposed surfaces. Sensitivity of sequencing depends on the depth of the sequencing run (i.e. the number of mapped sequence tags), the size of the genome and the distribution of the target factor. The sequencing depth is directly correlated with cost and negatively correlated with background. Therefore, low-background CUT&RUN; sequencing is inherently more cost-effective than high-background ChIP-Sequencing. Peak calling representation for H3K27me3 targeted sequencing results, comparing CUT&RUN; to traditional ChIP. Note That CUT&RUN; appears to deliver improved signal-to-noise ratio than traditional ChIP. This advantage translates to lower sequencing costs. ==Current research== There have already been a number of research projects that have made use of the new CUT&RUN; technology. In humans, researchers looking at fetal globin gene promoters have used CUT&RUN; to investigate the involvement of the protein BCL11A in mediating the function of the HBBP1 gene region, highlighting a potential target for therapeutic genome editing for hemoglobinopathies. A research group has used CUT&RUN; to identify intermediates involved in nucleosome disruption during DNA transcription, validating a general strategy for structural epigenomics. In humans and in African green monkeys, researchers using CUT&RUN; determined that the CENP-B protein (an important protein in centromere formation) and binding sites are specific to great ape centromeres, addressing the paradox that CENP-B, which is required for artificial centromere function, is non-essential. ==Computational analysis== As with many high-throughput sequencing approaches, CUT&RUN-seq; generates extremely large data sets, for which appropriate computational analysis methods are required. To predict DNA-binding sites from CUT&RUN-seq; read count data, peak calling methods have been developed. Peak calling is a process where an algorithm is used to predict the regions of the genome that a transcription factor binds to by finding regions of the genome that have many mapped reads from a ChIP-seq or CUT&RUN-seq; experiment. MACS is a particularly popular peak calling algorithm for ChIP-seq data. SEACR is a highly selective peak caller that definitively validates the accuracy of CUT&RUN; for datasets with known true negatives. To identify the causal DNA-binding motif for CUT&RUN-seq; peak calls one can apply the MEME motif-finding program to the CUT&RUN; sequences. This involves using a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) along with the Motif Alignment and Search Tool (MAST) to identify motifs in a reference genome that match the acquired sequence reads. This process allows the identification of the transcription-factor binding motif, or if the binding motif was previously known, this process can act to confirm the success of the experiment ==Limitations== The primary limitation of CUT&RUN-seq; is the likelihood of over-digestion of DNA due to inappropriate timing of the Calcium-dependent MNase reaction. A similar limitation exists for contemporary ChIP-Seq protocols where enzymatic or sonicated DNA shearing must be optimized. As with ChIP-Seq, a good quality antibody targeting the protein of interest is required. ==Similar methods== * Sono-Seq: Identical to ChIP-Seq but without the immunoprecipitation step. * HITS-CLIP: Also called CLIP-Seq, employed to detect interactions with RNA rather than DNA. * PAR-CLIP: A method for identifying the binding sites of cellular RNA-binding proteins. * RIP- Chip: Similar to ChIP-Seq, but does not employ cross linking methods and utilizes microarray analysis instead of sequencing. * SELEX: Employed to determine consensus binding sequences. * Competition-ChIP: Measures relative replacement dynamics on DNA. * ChiRP-Seq: Measures RNA-bound DNA and proteins. * ChIP-exo: Employs exonuclease treatment to achieve up to single base-pair resolution * ChIP-nexus: Potential improvement on ChIP-exo, capable of achieving up to single base-pair resolution. * DRIP-seq: Employs S9.6 antibody to precipitate three-stranded DND:RNA hybrids called R-loops. * TCP-seq: Principally similar method to measure mRNA translation dynamics. * DamID: Uses enrichment of methylated DNA sequences to detect protein-DNA interaction without antibodies. == See also == *Biotechnology portal *ChIP-on-chip *ChIP- Seq *CUT&Tag; *ChIL-Seq == References == Category:DNA sequencing ","title":"CUT&amp;RUN sequencing"},{"id":"56731480","text":"A Place Called Fantasy is a full-length album by experimental bassist/musician MonoNeon.

SLPs have features that give them advantages as investment vehicles and have been criticized for having inadequate anti-money laundering rules. Unlike other UK limited partnerships, SLPs have legal personality, which allows them to hold assets and enter into contracts in their own right. ==History== SLPs are governed by the Partnership Act 1890 and the Limited Partnership Act 1907. Prior to 2017, the ownership of SLPs was not disclosed in company filings. On 26 June 2017 regulatory changes required that SLPs disclose persons with significant control to Companies House. Changes to the regulations were followed by a significant drop in the number of newly registered SLPs. ===Illicit use=== SLPs have been used to launder proceeds from criminal activities worldwide, including the proceeds of a $1 billion heist of major Moldovan banks. According to Transparency International, ‚Äúthese superficial companies have enabled theft, bribery and organised crime to thrive around the world under the veneer of a legitimate UK enterprise‚Äù. The investigative website Bellingcat \\"found SLPs trading in high-risk money laundering areas, operating unregulated trading and gambling websites, a large proportion of identifiable SLPs in business as trade intermediaries... SLPs appearing in the Ukrainian criminal courts, generic websites with no clear details of their trading activities... SLPs for sale online as shelf companies, SLPs involved in political lobbying, and others more directly involved in large scale criminal activity\\". ==Popularity== Chart of new registrations of SLFs produced by Bellingcat for their investigation into SLPs. SLPs sharply increased in popularity between 2016 and 2017, with a 430% increase in registrations in that time. They are reportedly popular vehicles for money laundering for criminals from the former Soviet bloc. Due to possessing distinct legal personalities, SLPs have been used as investment vehicles in Lloyd's of London since 1997. The requirement to file Persons with Significant Control documents from 2017 led to a large drop in the number of new registrations. ==Criticism== Transparency International UK policy director Duncan Hames has criticized SLPs, stating that \\"money launderers have been attracted to them because of the secrecy and the veneer of legitimacy they offer\\". MP Alison Thewliss described their reported abuse as \\"an issue of significant concern for the UK Government and the authorities\\". ==References== ==Further reading== *Forms for Scottish limited partnerships *Legal position (in French) *Taxation and Company formation (in German) *Call for Evidence Response from Law Society of Scotland Category:Types of business entity Category:Partnerships ","title":"Scottish limited partnership"},{"id":"56731522","text":"FS Class 103 was a class of 2-2-2 steam locomotives of the Italian State Railways (FS), originally built for the Strade Ferrate dello Stato Piemontese (SFSP). ==History== Fifteen locomotives were built in Britain between 1853 and 1855 by Sharp, Stewart and Company and were numbered 34 to 38 and 80 to 89 by the SFSP, which used them for the haulage of fast trains. In 1865 they passed to Societ√† per le strade ferrate dell'Alta Italia (SFAI) which numbered them from 91 to 105. In 1864, SFAI purchased another five units and numbered them 106 to 110. In 1885 they were taken over by Rete Mediterranea (RM) where they were numbered 519 to 538. In 1905, only 5 units survived to be taken over by Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), which registered them as Class 103 with numbers from 1031 to 1035. Since these were obsolete machines, they were all scrapped by 1910. ==Technical details== The driving wheels had a diameter of just under 2 metres and this allowed them to reach 80 km/h. The design of the engines was typically British with outside frames and inside cylinders. The tender carried 7 tons of water and 3 tons of coal. They developed 300 horsepower. ==References== Category:2-2-2 locomotives 103 Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1853 Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Italy Category:Rete Mediterranea steam locomotives Category:Sharp Stewart locomotives ","title":"FS Class 103"},{"id":"56731538","text":"Alan Hill (born 22 June 1955) is an English former professional footballer, spending most of his footballing career (and all of his professional footballing career) playing in the English Football League with Wrexham, making over 200 total appearances for the club. ==Career== Hill signed for Wrexham as a schoolboy.

In the 1880s Elizabeth Cary Agassiz, director of the Harvard Annex (which would become chartered as Radcliffe College in 1894), negotiated for the use of space for her students in the Museum of Comparative Zoology. Prior to the acquisition of this space, science laboratories were taught using inadequate facilities, converting spaces such as bathrooms in old houses into physics laboratories, which Harvard professors often refused to teach in. == Physical space and arrangements == The laboratory space was converted from an office or storage closet, and was sandwiched between other invertebrate storage rooms. This small space was poorly-lit and often cramped, as this was the only space Radcliffe women technically had access to. In 1908, in response to pressure from Radcliffe administrators to construct a women's restroom, Alexander Agassiz launched an inquiry about which spaces women were occupying within the building. Agassiz rejected the construction of this restroom because it would obstruct light from hallway windows, despite the fact that the closest women's restrooms to the Radcliffe Zoological Laboratory were within the Natural History Museum galleries, two floors below. Agassiz found that, while Harvard men occupied 14 rooms, Radcliffe women were spilling over from their single designated laboratory space into 3 other rooms. Herbert Spencer Jennings highlighted that segregating instruction by gender was challenging due to the limitation of space, noting that Agassiz felt that the resources within the Museum of Comparative Zoology should not be ceded to Radcliffe, stating that 'it cannot expect us to sacrifice M.C.Z. for its needs in anyway'. == Institutional affiliations and degrees == Radcliffe did not grant PhDs until 1902. Between 1894 and 1902, multiple students completed all course and thesis requirements for a PhD degree in the department of Zoology, without receiving the title. Margaret Lewis Nickelson studied the nervous system of marine invertebrates, publishing three papers in well-regarded journals. Florence Mayo, Annie Henchman, and Julia B. Platt also conducted original research on topics varying from canine teeth of sheep to the nervous systems of slugs. While zoology courses became standard for Radcliffe students by the early 20th century, the refusal to grant doctoral degrees resulted in very little funding or institutional support for long-term research projects for women. This lack of funding led students such as Fanny Langdon to pursue long daily commutes after she moved in with relatives in Jamaica Plain, five miles away from the laboratory in Cambridge. Edith Nason Buckingham was the first to receive a Radcliffe PhD in Zoology in 1910. == References == Category:Radcliffe College and Institute Category:Zoology organizations ","title":"Radcliffe Zoological Laboratory"},{"id":"56731631","text":"Alexandra Bell (born 1983) is an American multidisciplinary artist.

Work was temporarily halted by an attack of pneumonia, after which Faur√© went to his favourite resort, Annecy-le-Vieux, in August, resuming work on the piece.Nichols, Roger. Notes to Hyperion CD CDA30029, 1999 His original plan had been a trio for piano, cello and either a clarinet or violin, but he quickly abandoned the clarinet option and wrote for the classical piano trio. Faur√© wrote to his wife, who remained in Paris, \\"The trouble is that I cannot work for long at a time. My worst tribulation is a perpetual fatigue.\\" The musical scholar Roger Nichols comments that the composer's fatigue is not detectable in the completed work, except to the extent that \\"there are no more notes than necessary, according to the well-known Mozartian formula\\".

After the Second World War he took a special interest in the effect of rationing on the health of the population and was an active campaigner for the extension of mobile canteen services to older people who could not queue for rations. He had a special interest in ophthalmology and worked as a general practitioner in Battersea, London for over four decades. == Early life == Gulati, known popularly as \\"Lall\\", was born around 1896 in Shaipur, near Lahore, Punjab, India. His exact date of birth is uncertain. He was the tenth son of Dola Ram Gulati and he had one younger sister. ==Career== In 1916, Gulati became a medical officer in the Indian Medical Service after completing his medical training in Lahore. In 1919, he was in Amritsar at the time of the Amritsar massacre. In 1920, for reasons unknown, he worked his passage to the United Kingdom where he arrived in Liverpool penniless and walked to London. His qualifications were not recognised in the UK and therefore he repeated his further education and medical training at Charing Cross Hospital. Friendless and without money, he did unskilled work at night to pay for his studies. Eventually qualifying with LRCP and MRCP in 1926, he entered general practice in the largely working-class district of Battersea in London. Gulati was an active member of the St John and Red Cross organisations. He campaigned to extend mobile canteen services to older people who could not queue for rations in post-war Britain. He was later, in addition, closely connected with the Royal Westminster Ophthalmic Hospital after passing the diploma in ophthalmic medicine and surgery in 1945. == Politics == In 1934, Gulati was elected a councillor for the Conservative Party. However, he resigned from the party in 1947 because of their lack of support for the National Health Service He was a member of the Food Control Committee, where he was concerned about post-war rationing effects on the health of the population and he joined the Socialist Medical Association and the Labour Party, becoming a Labour member of the London County Council for Battersea South and later standing unsuccessfully for parliament. He was a magistrate and a freemason. As an active member of the committee of the Indian YMCA in London, he witnessed its replanning and building. == Family and personal == Gulati married Norah Louisa Knobel on 1 August 1931, at St Michael's Church, Battersea. They had two sons and two daughters, one of whom died at the age of four in 1938. His elder son also became a doctor, specializing in orthopedics. His younger son is a solicitor, and followed his father into local politics, becoming mayor of Reigate & Banstead in 1984. His granddaughter, Anita Gulati, attributed her grandfather's resilience partly to meditation, saying: \\"my grandfather used to close his consultation room door for 20 minutes to meditate\\". ==Death and legacy== He died suddenly on 13 June 1967 at the age of 70. Following an interview with his son, Gulati's story was mentioned in Julian M. Simpson's Migrant architects of the NHS; South Asian doctors and the reinvention of British general practice (1940s-1980s), and used to show how imperial legacies and medical migration shaped the UK's healthcare in the first four decades following the founding of the NHS. == References == Category:1896 births Category:1967 deaths Category:Indian emigrants to England Category:Freemasons of the United Grand Lodge of England Category:Labour Party (UK) councillors Category:British general practitioners Category:Physicians of Charing Cross Hospital Category:Medical doctors from Punjab, India Category:Conservative Party (UK) councillors Category:Members of London County Council Category:British people of Punjabi descent Category:Indian Medical Service officers Category:YMCA leaders ","title":"Harbans Lall Gulati"},{"id":"56731794","text":"College subway station. The National Hockey League (NHL)'s Toronto Maple Leafs has been the point of subject for a number of media in Canadian popular culture, including artworks, books, novels, and songs. ==Film== Comedian Mike Myers has often included references to the Toronto Maple Leafs in his films. References to the Toronto Maple Leafs have been made typically in association with the city of Toronto, such as the case in the beginning of the 2010 spy film Fair Game. During the scene, CIA agent Valerie Plame was being questioned by a suspicious weapons trafficker. He asks her if she is an American, and after responding that she is Canadian, he asks her about the Leafs. She replies that she is not a fan. The rivalry between the Maple Leafs and the Montreal Canadiens was also featured in the National Film Board of Canada's adaptation of The Hockey Sweater by Roch Carrier. Completed a year after the book's publication, the National Film Board of Canada adapted the story into a ten-minute animated short film called The Sweater. It was animated by Sheldon Cohen and voiced by Carrier. The film became one of the National Film Board's most popular works and has won numerous awards. It was named the Best Animated Film at the 1981 British Academy Film Awards. Another film where the hockey club was heavily featured was in Face-Off, a Canadian film about a rookie Maple Leafs player and his romance with a musician. The film featured several players from the NHL, including Bobby Orr, George Armstrong, and Gordie Howe. The 1993 film Gross Misconduct focused on the life of former Maple Leafs left wing Brian Spencer. The hockey club was also featured in the 2006 television documentary series Hockey: A People's History, by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Comedian Mike Myers, a fan, often included references and even an entire plot line in his films. In Austin Powers in Goldmember, the ticker below the news item on a television reads, \\"Maple Leafs win Stanley Cup\\". In another scene, the character Mini-Me wears a Maple Leafs sweater. In addition to the references included in several films, the Maple Leafs also played a central role in Myers' 2008 film The Love Guru, where he played a guru hired to help the Maple Leafs' star player. ==Literature== Roch Carrier, author of The Hockey Sweater, as a child in a Maple Leafs sweater. References to the Leafs in literature includes Foster Hewitt juvenile hockey novel, He Shoots, He Scores!. Published in 1949, it featured the members of the team, including actual managers and players. In 1963, Scott Young wrote A Boy at the Leafs' Camp, a children's book giving a behind-the-scenes insight into the sport. Several books concerning the Maple Leafs have been written, and later readapted into film. In 1971, Young and George Robertson co-wrote an adult hockey-romance novel, Face-off, about the experiences of a star rookie player, Billy Duke, with the Leafs. The novel became a movie in 1971 with Art Hindle as Billy Duke. The film featured many of the players. Jim McKenny, body- doubled for Hindle for the on-ice action scenes because of his resemblance to Hindle. Owner Ballard had a part as the team doctor. In 1979, Roch Carrier wrote the short story The Hockey Sweater about a Montreal Canadiens fan who is mistakenly sent a sweater of their rival, the Maple Leafs. Originally published in French as \\"Une abominable feuille d'√©rable sur la glace\\" (\\"An abominable maple leaf on the ice\\"), it referred to the Maple Leafs sweater a mother forced her son to wear. The boy is forced to weat the sweater and faces persecution of his peers and coach, also fans of the Canadiens. The boy is presumably based on Carrier himself when he was young. In 1980, the story was turned into an animated short by the National Film Board of Canada. An excerpt of the book is featured on the Canadian five-dollar Canadian Journey bills, a series of banknotes issued from 2002 to 2013. ==Radio shows== In 1946, the comedy team of Wayne and Shuster performed a sketch on their CBC radio program in which the imaginary hockey team, the Mimico Mice, competed against the Leafs. Foster Hewitt provided the play-by-play of the game, with real player names used for the Leafs and Wayne and Shuster voiced the entire Mimico team. ==Song== In the video for the hit Leo Sayer song ‚ÄúWhen I Need You‚Äù (1976), he walks on the beach in Brighton, U.K. wearing a Toronto Maple Leafs sweater under his half done-up jacket. In 1990 live videos for the song \\"F*!#in' Up\\", Neil Young sports a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey. In 1992, Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip released the song \\"Fifty Mission Cap\\", which memorialized Bill Barilko. Barilko scored the series winning goal for the 1951 Stanley Cup Finals before disappearing months later. On October 17, 2017, several days after the death of The Tragically Hip's lead singer Gord Downie, the Maple Leafs held a moment of silence prior to their game, as well as lower the banner of Barilko's retired number. Other songs which reference the team includes Out for a Rip by hip-hop artist B.Rich, who stated his desire to see the club win the Stanley Cup, stating that \\"if the Leafs win the Cup,\\" he would jump in a lake. In a rare French-language example, Qu√©becois singer Bob Bissonnette praises the club, and the tradition of Hockey Night in Canada in his song 'Maple Leafs.' Canadian musician Joni Mitchell also mentions the Leafs in the song ‚ÄúRaised on Robbery‚Äù which is featured on her 1974 album Court and Spark. ==Visual art== College station of the Toronto subway system feature a pair of murals called Hockey Knights in Canada, named after Hockey Night in Canada; one depicting the Toronto Maple Leafs on the southbound side and facing the Montreal Canadiens on the northbound side, depicting the rivalry between the two clubs. They were created by Charles Pachter in 1984, when the Toronto Maple Leafs still played at nearby Maple Leaf Gardens. ==See also== * Ice hockey in popular culture ==References== Category:Ice hockey mass media Category:Sport in popular culture ","title":"Toronto Maple Leafs in popular culture"},{"id":"56731818","text":"National Cycle Network (NCN) Route 10 is a Sustrans National Route that runs from Cockermouth to North Shields.

His debut came on 4 April 1993 away to Rugby on the final day of the 1992-93 Courage League season. Jelley was regular understudy for Graham Rowntree with one of the two starting every game at loosehead prop between 2 September 1993 - 6 November 1996 until the emergence of Perry Freshwater forced Jelley onto the tighthead side of scrum. A shoulder injury kept Jelley out of action for four months and limited him to only three starts in Tigers 1997-98, however the following campaign was his best with a club-leading 35 appearances in the 1998-99 season, including 20 starts, as Leicester won the Premiership that season. Jelley's appearances became more limited as Freshwater was preferred as reserve loosehead and Ricky Nebbett was signed to cover tighthead. His final Leicester appearance was in 23 January 2003 at Welford Road in the Heineken Cup against Neath. ===Wakefield and Rotherham=== Jelley joined Wakefield on loan for the 2002‚Äì03 National Division One season.

The property, now reduced to , was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. ==Description and history== The Captain Thomas Fanning Farmstead is located in a rural setting in northern Ledyard, near the town line with Preston. It is set on four acres on the east side of Shewville Road, one of which houses the buildings of the farmstead around a grassy meadow. The house is a 1-1/2 story Cape style wood frame structure, with a central chimney. It is oriented with its main facade angled away from the road, toward the southeast. That facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance. A shed-roof section extends the building to the rear (toward the street). Outbuildings spread around the meadow include an 18th-century barn, and several 19th-century farm buildings: a corn crib, blacksmith shop, sheds, and another small barn. Some of the outbuildings stand on older foundations than what their construction methods suggest. The documented history of the property begins in 1746-47, when Thomas Fanning purchased from Jonathan Brewster of Preston, with a barn standing on it. A portion of the house (roughly the western three bays) was built by Fanning not long afterward, and was probably widened to five bays by Fanning's son Frederick, who took over the property in 1789. He sold the property to his brother-in-law in 1793. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in New London County, Connecticut ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in New London County, Connecticut Category:American colonial architecture Category:Houses completed in 1746 Category:Houses in New London County, Connecticut Category:Ledyard, Connecticut ","title":"Capt.

The North Korean academic perspective often asserts that the Lelang Commandery did not hold land in the Korean Peninsula but rather held land in the Liaodong Peninsula around the Liao River.

The area around the city is uninhabited and lean. The whole complex is situated on a plateau about long. ==History== On the south end of the northern half, there is a great fort, a prehistoric site from the Bronze and Iron Age. On the north end, there is a small fort. The fort itself has two parts: a medieval southern and northern Ottoman part. The medieval town has a ground plan of an irregular rectangle over 40 meters long and a width of about 35 meters.http://nationalpark- una.ba/addDocuments/uploads/14666750291810023626.pdf From the tower on the west side is the beginning of the remains of a large pen that was added along with the medieval city in the Ottoman period. First mentioned in written sources in 1495 and named after the whiteness (or tint) by which it stood out above Bjelajsko field. Ownership is attributed to Vladislaus II‚Äôs Treasurer, who in 1495 is recorded paying to Ga≈°par Peru≈°iƒá the sum of 30 forints \\"to preserve his city of Belaj\\" (egregio Caspar Perusyth pro conservatione castri sui Belay dati sunt 30 fl.).

Between 1530 and 1537, Bjelaj (Bilaj) came under Ottoman rule, becoming part of the Sanjak of Bosnia, the villagers and the cadillac Neretva. Already in 1540, it is mentioned for the first time on Bjelaj nahija, and later it is mentioned as Nahija Bjelaj-Blagaj, but soon falls under the cadiluk Kamengrad, which is mentioned as a cadil in the Bosnian or Klis sandbag. From 1562, Naƒëija Bjelaj was connected to the cadillac Novosel, who was in the clich√© sand≈æak. It was noted that in 1577 a crew of 370 Ottoman mercenaries was placed in the fortress under the dizdar command. From 1592, the city was part of the Bihac captaincy, and from the 18th century to the composition of the Petrovac captaincy. Dizdar Bjelaj (Bilaja) Alijaga was in the demining commission with the Republic of Venice. In 1747 in Bjelaj there was a crew of 30 members and Dizdar Hasanag.

The medieval city has a layout of irregular rectangles over 40 m long (north-south) and about 35 m wide (east-west). The entrance to the city is in the northward. ===Medieval part=== It is half- closed, with partially preserved arches and doorways. In the northwest corner, there is a massive round tower 2/3 off the ramparts, about 16 m high. The entrance to the tower is at a height of about 4 m above the current level of the land. According to the outer form, it is assumed that the inside of the tower was divided into three levels: the ground floor or basement, the level at the entrance level, and the space above the entrance because the ceiling can be seen on the canvas wall continuously. East of the entrance are the remains of a narrow, hollow, heavily-walled area as high as the ramparts (15-16m). That space was built up beside the rampart. Only the upper part of it was preserved and probably served for the rise of soldiers to the top of the wall on which they were coarse, and sometimes small loopholes. On the ground are the remains of the eastern part of the longitudinal wall that forms a whole with the vertical rest of the described wall beside the wall. These remains of a wall on the ground share the easternmost part of the interior of the city from the west. After a few meters they are lost to the south, and on the west side towards the tower, they do not see traces. The impression is that it was part of some enclosure that protected the penetration into the city. The western side of the city was harder defensive because the enemy could draw from the back. The western ramparts are therefore monolithic and end up with clods, of which only a very small part has been preserved. Beneath the level of the chestnut tree, there are a number of stone consoles on the top of the ramparts that served as a wooden backbone. Below them is a series of shorter brackets embedded in a rampart. The eastern rampart was facing Bjelaysko polje. On it are 4 large loopholes semi-rounded. and on the west side towards the tower, they do not see traces.

They are designed to shoot from a wooden or stone platform in a standing position. On some of them, the vertical and horizontal, nicely carved stone blocks and slabs that were used as frames are still on the inside of the ramparts. Above the loophole is a horizontal array of holes for the ceiling beams above which there are stone consoles. From the ramparts, there is a view of the entire Bjelas field and the surrounding area. The southern slum is completely demolished. Towards the tower next to the western ramparts is the remains of the tank. The fortresses and towers of an older fortress were built of travertine blocks and broken stone. In front of the northern rampart and entrance to the old part of the city, there is a ditch that is saturated, but its contours can be identified. ===Ottoman part=== From the tower on the west side are the remains of a large patch which was built alongside the medieval city in the Ottoman era. The precinct is located north of the older part of the city, almost regular in a four-legged shape, 110 m long, about 40 m wide. Only parts of the western ramparts are preserved, up to a height of 2 m. According to the material, they are completely different from the walls of the medieval city. They were built from a finely broken stone blended with plenty of plaster. There was a small mosque in the backyard. Today, at its place, the hollow is filled with a bunch of stones. The entrance to the pavement was on the north wall. He was overwhelmed by a \\"shaggy bow\\". In this place, the overhead remains of the ramparts are barely visible or only its traces. The most well-preserved part of the Ottoman times is south and north of the medieval trench, along with the west side of the plateau.

She met Sophie Mereau in Jena, where she published poems and short stories in modern journals. However, she failed to find a publisher to sponsor her work in her lifetime.

Davis was born at Ware, Massachusetts. In 1863, at the age of 16 years, he enlisted in the 1st Massachusetts Volunteer Cavalry. As a cavalryman and later a second lieutenant of volunteers, he served in 25 battles and engagements during the American Civil War. Appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point two years after the War, Davis graduated in 1871 and was commissioned a second lieutenant of the 5th U.S. Cavalry. Immediately after his marriage to Ella Prince of West Springfield, Massachusetts, in July 1871, Lieutenant Davis spent two years on the Wyoming and Arizona frontiers with the 5th Cavalry. His next tour was at West Point, where he served for five years as Assistant Professor of Spanish, teaching French, geology, chemistry and mineralogy as well. Promotion to 1st Lieutenant in 1878 brought with it another five-year tour on the Western frontier. The return to West Point in 1883 gave Davis a chance to head the History Department as principal assistant professor, and to serve as assistant professor of law, instructing also in geography and ethics. During this tour he completed his Outline of International Law. Simultaneously with his promotion, Captain Davis was rotated to the Western Territory in August 1888. Only four months later, however, Davis's professional abilities were recognized and required in Washington. He was appointed a Major, Judge Advocate General's Department, and transferred to the Office of the Secretary of War. Davis took advantage of the Washington tour to obtain his LL.B. and LL.M. degrees at Columbian (now George Washington University) Law School. He was made Lieutenant Colonel and Deputy Judge Advocate General in 1895, but left Washington the next year to serve as Professor of Law at West Point. It was during the next few years that Davis completed his major publications. His Elements of Law and Elements of International Law (1897) were followed by his definitive Treatise on the Military Law of the United States in 1898. In addition, Davis authored several historical and professional works on the tactical use of cavalry. The War of the Rebellion, a 70-volume compilation of the official records of the Union and Confederate Armies, was principally his work and was published in his name in 1880-1901. Davis was promoted to Colonel in 1901, and a few months later became a Brigadier and Judge Advocate General, a post he was to occupy for a decade. (His appointment followed that of Thomas F. Barr of Massachusetts and John W. Clous, a native of Germany, each of whom served as Judge Advocate General for one day in May 1901 in order to retire with the rank of Brigadier General.) General Davis guided his department through the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, and handled the investigation and trial of the notorious cases arising out of that war. He also represented the United States as delegate plenipotentiary to the Geneva Conventions of 1903 and 1906, and the Hague Convention of 1907. On February 14, 1911, General Davis retired with a promotion to major general.

Both Ames' father and maternal grandfather, Joseph Bushnell (1831-1918), came from old New England families and became wealthy during the Pennsylvania Oil Rush. Ames' great- grandfather was the Pittsburgh industrialist Daniel Bushnell. After Elias Ames' death in 1891 at age 39, Peter's mother moved the family to Morristown, New Jersey, where her children had a privileged upbringing in the town that was then known as an \\"inland Newport.\\". Ames attended the Stevens Institute of Technology, graduating in 1911. ==Career== In 1912, Ames moved to London to take a position with a firm in the city. In 1917, he joined the elite Grenadier Guards of the British Army and fought in France during the First World War. In June 1920, at the height of the Irish War of Independence, Ames moved to Dublin, Ireland on assignment from the British military intelligence, serving as an undercover agent for the MI5. Along with the other members of the Cairo Gang spy ring, Ames worked to track the operations of Irish Republican Army militants and maintain British control in Dublin. The activities of the Cairo Gang were soon detected by Irish Republican Army leaders, however, who formulated a plot, led by Michael Collins, to eliminate the covert group. On the morning of Sunday, November 21, 1920, IRA gunmen stormed into the house at 38 Upper Mount Street where Ames and another agent were staying. Ames attempted to reach for the .45-caliber Colt pistol he had hidden beneath his pillow, but was held down by the gunmen before he could get to his weapon. After being made to stand facing the wall of his bedroom, Ames was shot six times in the back and killed. Front door of the house at 38 Upper Mount Street where Ames was killed. One of the assassins, Vinny Byrne, wrote an account of the murders: > As I opened the folding-doors, the officer, who was in bed, was in the act > of going for his gun under his pillow.

She is also the younger sister of David Hogg, who also attended Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. In 2018, Hogg was a freshman at Stoneman Douglas High School when a gunman came onto campus and started shooting. Hogg was in a television production class when the shooting started; the fire alarm was activated and she believed it was possibly a prank because they had had a fire alarm drill earlier in the day. However, once in the stairwell after evacuating due to the alarm, she realized that it was not a prank after she saw students running out of the building. She went back to her classroom and unlocked a closet in the room and hid with other students. Hogg reunited with her brother and father later that day. She lost four friends in the shooting. == Gun control advocacy == After the shooting, Hogg became an activist against gun violence in the United States and became a co-founder of the March for Our Lives protests. She co-authored a book with her brother, David Hogg, called #NeverAgain: A New Generation Draws the Line published by Random House. Hogg testified as a witness before the United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response and Recovery in September 2019, following new legislation in the United States Senate that addressed school safety. Before the hearing, she spoke at a rally against gun violence alongside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Speaking to members of the subcommittee, Hogg said, \\"I think if we did enough, I wouldn't be here. I wouldn't have lost my friends.\\" She also told members that lawmakers need to take steps including hiring mental health professionals to provide grief counseling to students and provide security that does not militarize schools, in opposition to Governor of Florida Ron DeSantis signing a bill into law public school districts to arm teachers.

In 2013, she released the single Momentum and in 2014 she starred at the large metal festival Wacken Open Air. == Musical acts == At the end of 2012, Bechtold performed her first performance with Delain. In 2013, for the first time, she filled in for Timo Somers, Delain's main guitarist. During the same period, she performed several concerts with the Purest of Pain group. In October 2014, she was contacted by Isaac Delahaye (Epica, ex-MaYaN) who had to leave MaYaN for other priorities. She played with two concerts in January 2015 as a replacement. At the second concert, the band asked her to become a permanent member. In the summer of 2014, she became part of Anneke van Giersbergen's The Gentle Storm, with van Giersbergen's husband Rob Snijders. She then played several concerts with Delain alongside Somers. In 2015, she again accompanied Delain at other concerts with Sabaton. From October 2015 until June 2019, Bechtold was officially a permanent member of Delain. == Instruments == Bechtold uses guitars from the Dutch custom guitar shop VanderMeij Guitars, based in Amsterdam. She is mostly seen on stage with her white sevenstring multiscale VanderMeij Magistra. As an amplifier, she uses the ENGL 650, Ritchie Blackmore Signature. For effects use only, Bechtold uses Strymon El Capistan digital tape echo and Octaver Polish Taurus. She uses Ernie Ball strings and Dunlop Jazz plectrums. == References == == External links == * Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:Dutch rock guitarists Category:Women guitarists Category:Rhythm guitarists Category:People from Blaricum Category:21st-century women musicians Category:21st-century guitarists Category:Mayan (band) members Category:Delain members ","title":"Merel Bechtold"},{"id":"56732496","text":"Charles Bracht (7 January 1915 - 7 March 1978) was a Belgian alpine skier.

The massacre is also known as the Massacre of Koreans in 1923. The massacre occurred over a period of three weeks starting on September 1, 1923, the day on which a massive earthquake struck the Kant≈ç region. During this period, soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army, police and vigilantes murdered an estimated 6,000 ethnic Koreans and Japanese socialists. The massacre was denied by Japanese authorities almost immediately after it occurred, while it was celebrated by certain elements in the public. It continues to be alternately denied and celebrated by right-wing groups today. ==September 1: Korean labor union offers food relief== Korean laborers in Yokohama had joined a stevedore union led by the Japanese organizer Yamaguchi Seiken. Yamaguchi was a left-wing organizer and at the May Day rally in 1920 some of his union members had shouted anti-colonial slogans, incurring arrests and abuse from Japanese police. On September 1, 1923, immediately after the earthquake, Yamaguchi organized his union to provide food and water to the neighborhood, including commandeering supplies from ruined buildings. Police regarded the labor union as a \\"nest of socialists\\" and were likely unsettled by the well-organized food relief program. ==September 1-2: Police spread false rumors and give permission to kill== Kanagawa Prefectural Police chief Nishizaka Katsuto reported that on the night of September 1 he gave his district chiefs \\"a certain mission to deal with the emergency situation,\\" the details of which he refused to describe. Towards the end of his life, Nishizaka told an interviewer that \\"someone must have said that 'Korean malcontents' were dangerous in such a time of confusion.\\" According to multiple reports from Japanese witnesses, beginning on the night of September 2 police officers in Yokohama, Kanagawa and Tokyo began informing residents that it was permissible to kill Koreans. Some orders were conditional, such as killing Koreans who resist arrest, but others were more direct: \\"kill any Koreans who enter the neighborhood\\" or \\"kill any Koreans you find.\\" Also on the night of September 2, as police organized a vigilante band to kill Koreans in the Noge region of Yokohama, one of the organizing police officers told a newspaper reporter that Koreans had been caught with a list of neighborhoods to burn, carrying gasoline and poison for wells. In the town of Yokosuka, police officers told locals that Korean men were raping Japanese women, inciting Japanese men to form vigilante lynch mobs. In Bunky≈ç, the police falsely reported that Koreans had poisoned the water and food supply. Nishizaka's final report on the massacre acknowledges in a secret appendix that these rumors were all false. == September 2-9: Japanese lynch mobs massacre Koreans and others == As a result of the police-initiated rumors, beginning on September 2 Japanese citizens organized themselves into vigilante bands and accosted strangers on the street. Those who were believed to be Korean or Chinese were murdered on the spot. Vigilantes armed themselves with bamboo spears, clubs, Japanese swords, and guns. People who wore Korean or Chinese clothes were immediately killed, along with members of minority groups such as Ryukyuans whose spoken dialects were difficult for other Japanese people and foreigners to understand. On the morning of September 3, the Home Ministry issued a message to police stations around the capital encouraging the spread of rumors and violence, stating that ‚Äúthere are a group of people who want to take advantage of disasters. Be careful because Koreans are planning terrorism and robbery by arson and bombs.\\" Koreans, Chinese, and Ryukyuans wore Japanese clothing in order to hide their identities. They also tried to properly pronounce shibboleths such as \\"ÂçÅ‰∫îÂÜÜ\\" and \\"‰∫îÂçÅÈä≠\\" (15 yen and 50 sen), with difficult elongated vowels. Those who failed these tests were killed. During that time, not only Koreans but also Chinese, Ryukyuans, and foreigners were all marked as Koreans. Some journalists who came to Tokyo were mistaken for Koreans and killed due to differences in their pronunciations. The vigilantes were indiscriminate with regards to gender and age. When the massacre reached its peak, the rivers Sumidagawa and Arakawa which flowed through Tokyo were stained with blood. The filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, who was a child at the time, was astonished to witness the irrational behavior of the mob. :With my own eyes I saw a mob of adults with contorted faces rushing like an avalanche in confusion, yelling, ‚ÄúThis way!‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, that way!‚Äù They were chasing a bearded man, thinking someone with so much facial hair could not be Japanese‚Ä¶.Simply because my father had a full beard, he was surrounded by a mob carrying clubs. My heart pounded as I looked at my brother, who was with him. My brother was smiling sarcastically‚Ä¶. Some Koreans sought safety in police stations in order to escape the slaughter, but in some areas vigilantes broke into police stations and pulled them out. In other cases, police officers handed groups of Koreans over to local vigilantes, who proceeded to kill them. The arrival of foreigners and other people in Tokyo meant death. The police continued to assist the killings or responded to reports of murder passively. In contrast, the Yakuza, who accepted Koreans among their membership, protected Koreans from the lynch mobs. Both vigilantes and Japanese Army troops burned Korean bodies in order to destroy the evidence of murder. Official Japanese reports in September claimed that only five Koreans had been killed, and even years after, the number of acknowledged deaths remained in the low hundreds. After the massacre, Korean survivors painstakingly documented the extent of the massacre. Based on their testimonies, Japanese eyewitness accounts, and additional academic research, current estimates of the death toll range from 6,000 to 9,000. Between 50 to 90 percent of the Korean population of Yokohama was killed. == September 3-16: Police and army assassinate left-wing leaders == Amidst the mob violence, regional police and the Imperial Army used the pretext of civil unrest to liquidate political dissidents. Socialists such as (Âπ≥Êæ§Ë®à‰∏É) and the Chinese communal leader Wang Xitian (ÁéãÂ∏åÂ§©), were abducted and killed by local police and Imperial Army, who claimed the radicals intended to use the crisis as an opportunity to overthrow the Japanese government.Mikiso Hane, Reflections on the Way to the Gallows: Rebel Women in Prewar Japan, University of California Press, Berkeley, 1988, p.176 (Hane references the memoirs of Japanese socialist Tanno Setsu) In a particularly egregious instance known as the Amakasu Incident, the married couple Sakae ≈åsugi (Japan's first Esperanto teacher) and Noe It≈ç, both anarchists and feminists, were executed by Imperial Army officer Masahiko Amakasu along with their six- year-old nephew. The bodies of the parents and child were thrown in a well. The incident created national outrage and Amakasu was sentenced to ten years in prison, but he served only three. ==September 18-November: Show trials and unpaid labor== Beginning on September 18, the Japanese government arrested 735 participants in the massacre. However, the government had no intent of sentencing the participants as they would murderers. In November, the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun reported that during the trials, the defendants and the judges were both smiling and laughing as they recounted the lynchings. The prosecution recommended light sentences. As knowledge of the lynch mobs spread through the Korean community, thousands attempted to flee the city. The Tokyo police tasked a collaborationist group called S≈çaikai with arresting escaping Koreans and detaining them in camps in Honjo, Tokyo. Tokyo police chief Maruyama Tsurukichi ordered the S≈çaikai to confine Koreans to the camps to prevent them from spreading news of the massacre abroad. The S≈çaikai eventually ordered 4,000 Koreans to perform unpaid labor cleaning up the city ruins for over two months. == Aftermath: Denial and frameup == On September 5, after the Prime Minister of Japan acknowledged that unlawful killings had occurred, Tokyo officials met secretly to discuss a way to deny and minimize the massacre. Laying out their plans in a memorandum, they agreed to minimize the number of dead, blame the rumors of Korean violence on the labor organizer Yamaguchi Seiken, and frameup innocent Koreans and accuse them of actually rioting. This plan was executed in the following months. A ban on reporting the death count was obeyed by all newspapers, while officials claimed only five people had died. On October 21, almost two months after the massacre began, local police arrested 23 Koreans, simultaneously lifting the ban so that the initial reporting on the full scale of the massacre was mixed with the false arrests. Yamaguchi was publicly blamed by Japanese officials for starting the rumors of Korean mobs, but this logically incoherent charge was never formalized. After being held in prison for several months he was finally prosecuted only for redistributing food and water from ruined houses to earthquake survivors without permission of the homeowners. In July 1924 he was sentenced to two years in prison; it is unknown if he survived his imprisonment. Korean newspapers in Seoul were blocked from receiving information about the massacre by local police. Two Koreans who personally escaped Tokyo and rushed to Seoul to report the news were arrested for \\"spreading false information\\" and the news report about them was completely censored. When word of the massacre did reach the Korean peninsula, Japan attempted to placate the Koreans by distributing films throughout the country showing Koreans being well treated. These films were reportedly poorly received. The Governor-General of Korea paid out compensation to 830 families of massacre victims, although the Japanese government on the mainland only admitted to about 200 deaths. The Governor-General also published and distributed propaganda leaflets with \\"beautiful stories\\" (bidan ÁæéË´á) of Japanese protecting Koreans from lynch mobs. Police chief Nishizaka himself distributed bidan stories of heroic police protecting Koreans, which he later admitted in an interview were carefully selected to omit unflattering aspects. ==Japanese whitewashing and denialism== After the massacre, Navy Minister Takarabe Takeshi praised the Japanese lynch mobs for their \\"martial spirit,\\" describing them as a successful result of military conscription. Paper plays called kamishibai were performed for children which portrayed the slaughter with vivid, bloody illustrations. Performers would encourage children to cheer for the lynch mobs as they killed \\"dangerous\\" Koreans. In 1927, an official history of Yokohama City claimed that the rumors of Korean attackers had \\"some basis in fact.\\" In 1996, historian J. Michael Allen remarked that the massacre is \\"hardly known outside Korea.\\" Books denying the massacre and repeating the government frame story of 1923 became constant bestsellers in the 2010s. In April 2017, the Cabinet Office deleted historical evidence and acknowledgement of the massacre from their website. Beginning 2017, Tokyo mayor Yuriko Koike broke decades of precedent by refusing to acknowledge the massacre or offer condolences to the descendants of survivors, saying that whether a massacre occurred is a matter of historical debate. In July 2020, Koike was re-elected as mayor of Tokyo in a landslide victory.https://www.asahi.com/senkyo/tochijisen/2020/kaihyo/ In September 2020 a Japanese group held a rally in Sumida, Tokyo calling for a memorial to the massacre to be demolished, saying that the massacre never happened and the memorial constituted \\"hate speech against our ancestors.\\" ==Literary and artistic portrayals== Prewar narratives by Koreans frequently appealed to a Japanese readership to heal the wounds which were caused by ethnic divides, while in the immediate postwar period the \\"emperor system\\" was blamed for brainwashing massacre participants to act against their better instincts. After the 1970s such appeals to people's higher consciences faded away, and the massacre became part of a marker of indelible difference between the Japanese and Korean peoples and the Japanese people's willful ignorance of the massacre. Ri Kaisei's 1975 novel Exile and Freedom exemplifies this turning point with a central monologue: \\"Can you guarantee that it won't happen again right here and now? Even if you did, would your guarantees make Korean nightmares go away? No chance...\\" As the massacre passed out of living memory in the 1990s, it became hidden history to younger generations of Zainichi Koreans. In the 2015 novel Green and Red (Midori to aka „ÄéÁ∑ë„Å®Ëµ§„Äè), by Zainichi novelist (Ê∑±Ê≤¢ÊΩÆ), the Zainichi protagonist learns about the massacre by reading about it in a history book, which serves to give excess weight to her fears over anti-Korean sentiment. Fukazawa emphasizes that the narrator is driven to discover this history out of anxiety rather than having any preexisting historical understanding. Director Oh Chongkong (Âê≥ÂÖÖÂäü, Ïò§Ï∂©Í≥µ) made two documentary films about the pogrom: Hidden Scars: The Massacre of Koreans from the Arakawa River Bank to Shitamachi in Tokyo (Kakusareta tsumeato: Tokyo aragawa dote sh≈´hen kara Shitamachi no gyakusatsu Èö†„Åï„Çå„ÅüÁà™Ë∑°: Êù±‰∫¨ËçíÂ∑ùÂúüÊâãÂë®Ëæ∫„Åã„Çâ‰∏ãÁî∫„ÅÆËôêÊÆ∫, 1983) and The Disposed-of Koreans: The Great Kanto Earthquake and Camp Narashino (Harasagareta Ch≈çsenjin: Kant≈ç Daishinsai to Narashino sh≈´y≈çjo Êâï„ÅÑ‰∏ã„Åí„Çâ„Çå„ÅüÊúùÈÆÆ‰∫∫: Èñ¢Êù±Â§ßÈúáÁÅΩ„Å®ÁøíÂøóÈáéÂèéÂÆπÊâÄ, 1986). There have been several plays about the massacre. The playwright and Esperantist Ujaku Akita wrote Gaikotsu no buch≈ç (È™∏È™®„ÅÆËàûË∑≥) in 1924, decrying the culture of silence by Japanese; its first printing was banned by the Japanese censors. It was translated into Esperanto as Danco de skeletoj in 1927. The playwright Koreya Senda did not write about the violence explicitly, but adopted the pen name \\"Koreya\\" after he was mistaken for a Korean by the mob. In 1986, a Japanese playwright, Fukuchi Kazuyoshi (Á¶èÂú∞‰∏ÄÁæ©), discovered his father's diary, read the account of the massacre which is contained in it and wrote a play which is based on his father's account. The play was briefly revived in 2017. In 2014, non fiction writer Kat≈ç Naoki documented the massacre in his book September on the Streets of Tokyo (Kugatsu, T≈çky≈ç no roj≈ç de ‰πùÊúà„ÄÅÊù±‰∫¨„ÅÆË∑Ø‰∏ä„Åß). This book has also been translated into Esperanto. As of 2020, Kat≈ç continues to advocate on behalf of victims' families and fight against historical revisionism. == See also == * Great Kant≈ç earthquake * Nanking Massacre * Gando Massacre General: * Ethnic issues in Japan * Human rights in Japan * Japanese war crimes * List of massacres in Japan == References == Category:Massacres in Japan Category:Mass murder in 1923 Category:1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake Category:Anti-Korean sentiment Category:Massacres in the 1920s ","title":"Kant≈ç Massacre"},{"id":"56732611","text":"Milo≈° Havel (3 November 1899 ‚Äì 25 February 1968) was a Czech film producer and studio executive. Havel was a director of the film production company Lucernafilm, which was founded by his father in 1912. He was also a chairman of the film studio A-B, which built its new studios in Barrandov in 1932. He remained in charge of the studio during German occupation of Czechoslovakia. After World War II his wartime activities were criticized heavily, and he was put on trial for charges relating to collaboration with Nazi Germany. Though acquitted, he was banned from working in the film industry. He left the country and settled in Munich. He was the uncle of Czech president V√°clav Havel. ==Career== Havel ran the movie theater Lucerna Palace in Prague and later established the Barrandov Studios. During the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, Havel was forced to sell his share in Barrandov Studios but he remained in charge, and protected its staff from forced labour in Germany. At that time, Barrandov Studios produced newsreels and propaganda films for the government of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia as well as Czech productions. Havel was later credited with using his influence in the Protectorate to enable L√≠da Baarov√°, the former mistress of Joseph Goebbels, to perform in what have become some of her best films. Following World War II, Havel was denounced from a variety of quarters for his wartime activities; though sometimes the accusations were politically motivated, even Havel family friend Jarom√≠r Kopeck√Ω privately confided in V√°clav Havel his opinion that Havel was a Nazi collaborator. Havel attempted to emigrate, but his exit visa was denied. In March 1949, he was arrested and put on trial on charges related to collaboration with Nazi Germany. The prosecution also alleged that he had used Lucerna Palace to fulfill his \\"perverted cravings\\" for young men. Ultimately cleared of the charges against him due to lack of evidence, he was nevertheless banned from working in the film industry as \\"morally unfit\\", and Barrandov Studios was nationalized. Havel attempted to skip the country in 1949, but was arrested by Soviet authorities and deported back to Czechoslovakia where he was sentenced to one year of labor. Released early due to poor health, he went to stay with the family of V√°clav Havel, receiving a mixed welcome on his arrival with V√°clav Havel's mother telling Havel the family had experienced \\"enough troubles already because of you\\". Havel left the country a second time in 1952, ultimately settling in Munich where he filed suit against UFA GmbH for not paying for its wartime use of Barrandov. Havel used the proceeds from his successful lawsuit to go into business in Munich. ==Personal life and legacy== Havel was the uncle of V√°clav Havel. In 1999, V√°clav Havel organized a hundredth birthday party for his late uncle. A film on the life of Milo≈° Havel, with a screenplay by Jan Nov√°k, has been in development since 2016.

The connections with the sparsely populated inland and towards the north consist of barely accessible paths. The district capital Badhaadhe lies to the northwest. Offshore are reefs and the Bajuni Islands, which extend northeastward to Kismayo. On the northern edge of the town, there are extensive charcoal storage sites; charcoal is produced in the hinterland and exported from Burgabo to the Arabian Peninsula via dhow. This export is banned by the United Nations Security Council because the Islamic terror group Al-Shabaab is financed by the proceeds.\\"Report of the Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea pursuant to Security Council resolution 2182 (2014): Somalia.\\", Document S/2015/801, 10 October 2015. p. 42.

The archaeogical site (known by the early 20th century name Port Dunford) contains a number of ancient ruins, including several pillar tombs. Prior to its collapse, one these structures' pillars stood 11 meters high from the ground, making it the tallest tower of its kind in the wider region. Additionally, the area features a square edifice covered with a low, dome-shaped vault. It is one of the main local standing structures. In 1913, Haywood reportedly found at Port Dunford a large collection of old coins, along with a vessel similar to a Greek amphora. He later disposed of the amphora pieces, and the vessel was also said to have been crushed during a storm. In 1930, Hayward showed the coins to an official with the British Museum, H. Mattingly. 87 pieces in total, they ranged in date from the 3rd century BCE to the early 4th century CE. Among the coins were 17 copper mints from the Ptolemy III to Ptolemy V dynasties of Ptolemaic Egypt, five pieces of uncertain origin dating from the 1st to 3rd centuries BCE, six pieces that had been minted under Imperial Rome between the reigns of Nero and Antoninus Pius, forty-six coins ranging from Roman Emperors Maximinus II to Constans, six mints derived from the Egyptian Mamluk Sultanate, and seven pieces from Ottoman Egypt. ===Early trading=== Based on the archaeological finds, Mortimer Wheeler suggested that Port Dunford was likely a trading station from at least the Roman period. In 1955, he and Dr. A.G. Mathew in turn visited the area. They discovered porcelain, pottery and building remains dating from the 16th century onwards. ===19th century=== Following an agreement between the German East Africa Company and Sultan Ali ibn Ismail of Kismayo at the end of 1886, a German trading station called Hohenzollernhafen\\"Port Durnford.\\" Meyers Konversations-Lexikon 1905. was establishedJutta B√ºckendorf. \\"Schwarz-weiss- rot √ºber Ostafrika!\\": deutsche Kolonialpl√§ne und afrikanische Realit√§t.

At that time, the entire southern part of the Somali coast was nominally in the hands of the Sultanate of Zanzibar, but the Germans circumvented that problem by concluding a protection treaty with Ali ibn Ismail, who was hostile to Zanzibar. After the Heligoland‚ÄìZanzibar Treaty of 1890, the area came under British suzerainty and the port was renamed Port DurnfordEncyclopaedia Britannica Tenth Edition. Volume 34: Maps. Plate 56. (also Port Dunford or WubushiEncyclopaedia Britannica Tenth Edition. Volume 34: Maps. p. 490.). ===20th century=== In 1905, the area was described as follows: Port Durnford formed part of the East Africa Protectorate (first part of Tanaland province and later Jubaland) until, along with the rest of Jubaland, was ceded to the Italians in 1924 when it became known as Bur Gavo. First part of Trans-Juba, it became part of Italian Somaliland in 1926 and, with independence in 1960, part of Somalia. ===21st century=== At the beginning of the 21st century, the town numbered just under 4,000 residents, similar to the population at the start of the 20th century (about 3,500 residents). In the Somali Civil War, the city was a haven for various Islamist groups, and the population fell to around 300 in 2011. Expeditionary Kenya Defence Forces and Somali Armed Forces of the Federal Government of Somalia, supported by French naval artillery and U.S. air strikes, occupied the area of Burgabo at the end of October 2011 in the campaign against Al-Shabaab terrorists.\\"Kenyans head for showdown in Somalia.\\" UPI. 27 October 2011.

Sarah remarried, her second husband being Viscount Falkland, whom she married on 10 October 1752 as his second wife; he had previously been married to Jane Butler. Thereafter, Sarah's surname became Cary, and she was known as Viscountess Falkland. Viscount Falkland had four surviving children from his first marriage and none from his second marriage. Her will, proved in June 1776, contained bequests to a number of charitable causes, including St George's Hospital and Christ Church Hospital, as well as bequests to many individuals who were friends or servants. Her house, Widford Hall, was left to a relative on her mother's side, William Hucks. She stipulated that she should be buried at St Mary's Church, Widford, Essex, and that her grave should take the form of a pyramid. The resulting monument was designed by George Gibson and erected in 1778. Her husband, the viscount, lived until 1785. ==References== Category:1776 deaths Category:English countesses Category:English viscountesses ","title":"Sarah Howard, Countess of Suffolk"},{"id":"56732654","text":"Clayton Custer (born June 28, 1995) is an American professional basketball player for ≈ölƒÖsk Wroclaw of the Polish Basketball League. He played college basketball for Loyola University Chicago. A point guard, Custer is the 2018 Missouri Valley Conference Player of the Year. ==High school career== Custer played high school basketball at Blue Valley Northwest High School in Overland Park, Kansas, where he and future Loyola teammate Ben Richardson led the team to back-to-back state championships. Custer ultimately committed early to play for coach Fred Hoiberg at Iowa State. He also received offers from Oklahoma State and Kansas State, and Kansas coach Bill Self told him he was good enough to play for the Jayhawks but they had too many guards at that moment. ==College career== As a freshman in the 2014‚Äì15 season, Custer played sparingly behind the Cyclones' Mont√© Morris, one of the top point guards in the Big 12 Conference. He chose to transfer following the season, after scoring 13 points in 12 games. Custer ultimately chose to re-join Richardson under coach Porter Moser at Loyola after Moser took him to lunch and met with his parents. After sitting out the 2015‚Äì16 season per National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) transfer rules, Custer immediately joined the Ramblers' starting lineup, allowing star Milton Doyle to play off the ball. He averaged 11.6 points and 3.1 assists per game as a sophomore. As a redshirt junior, Custer led the Ramblers to the Missouri Valley Conference regular- season title, despite missing five games to an ankle injury. Custer was named the MVC Player of the Year. Following a run through the 2018 MVC Tournament, Custer and the Ramblers entered the 2018 NCAA Tournament as an 11 seed. After a first-round win over the Miami Hurricanes, Custer led the team to a 63‚Äì62 second-round win over Tennessee. Custer hit the game-winner with 3.7 seconds left to advance the Ramblers to the Sweet 16. He ended up leading the Ramblers to the Final Four while averaging 13.2 points and 4.2 assists per game.

It originated as the northernmost low of a stationary front over the Midwest on March 1, which moved eastward into the Northeast later that night. A new low pressure system rapidly formed off the coast on March 2 as it slowly meandered near the coastline. It peaked later that day and brought hurricane-force winds to coastal New England before gradually moving out to sea by March 3. Producing over of snow in some areas, it was one of the most significant March snowstorms in many areas, particularly in Upstate New York. In other areas, it challenged storm surge records set by other significant storms, such as Hurricane Sandy. It was unofficially named Winter Storm Riley by The Weather Channel. https://weather.com/storms/winter/news/2018-03-01-winter-storm-riley- noreaster-high-winds-coastal-flooding-heavy-snow Although the most severe damage was caused by flooding as well as snow, unusually high tides and storm surges along the coast, wind and downed trees caused massive inland power outages, with the number of outages as high as 1.9 million at one point. By March 4, least 9 people were known to have been killed as a result of the storm, with 5 of them being killed by falling trees or branches. Recovery efforts were later hampered as a second nor'easter began to impact the area just a few days after the first one struck. ==Meteorological history== A stationary front was draped over the central United States on the last day of February 2018. During this time period, dangerous flash flooding occurred as a result. On March 1, one of the northernmost lows split from the boundary and began tracking northwards. Tracking into colder air near the border between the U.S and Canada, snow broke out in the eastern half of the Midwest; the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) began issuing storm summaries later that day. Overnight into the early morning hours of March 2, a new low formed and rapidly strengthened off the coast of New Jersey, while snow began to slowly increase in coverage near Pennsylvania and southern New York. Rapid deepening of the low continued as it moved slowly westward, before it bottomed out around or so later that evening. Intrusion of cold air caused heavy wet snow to break out closer to the coast, resulting in snow engulfing much of the Tri- State Area, including New York City and areas further south. Winds also increased as the pressure gradient of the system increased, with gusts reaching as high as in some areas. Gradually, the storm also began to move out to sea, with the precipitation shield of the system receding from the coast. Consequently, by the early morning hours of March 3, the WPC terminated storm summaries on the storm after it moved far enough away from the East Coast, while also maintaining peak intensity. The system weakened over the next few days, before it split into two systems on March 5, one of which became a hurricane-force low. ==Preparations and impact== === Mid-Atlantic === Amtrak suspended rail service along the Northeast Corridor between Washington, D.C. and Boston, along with Keystone Service trains between New York City and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on March 2 because of the storm.

He has been involved in several Republican presidential campaigns. He has strong ties to the National Rifle Association and Russian interests and in 2017 was subject to federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Erickson also has been involved in a variety of business projects that have drawn legal scrutiny, and in November 2019 he pleaded guilty to federal charges of wire fraud and money laundering in connection with an effort to defraud investors in an oil development scheme. In July 2020 he was sentenced to seven years in federal prison followed by three years of supervised release.https://www.argusleader.com/story/news/2020/07/06/former- political-operative-paul-erickson-maria-butina-sentencing/5383306002/ == Education == Erickson's hometown is Vermillion, South Dakota. He attended the University of South Dakota and then transferred to Yale University, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics and political science in 1984. In 1980, while at USD, Erickson coordinated a youth campaign for Representative Jim Abdnor. For a year between his time at USD and Yale, Erickson served as the national treasurer of the College Republicans in Washington, D.C., whose staff at the time included Grover Norquist, Ralph Reed, and Jack Abramoff. Abramoff later wrote, \\"To every college Republican who contacted the national office, Paul Erickson was by far the most impressive person they had ever encountered in politics.\\" Also while in college, Erickson wrote \\"Fritzbusters\\", a comedy routine that was critical of Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale which had similarities to the then newly released film Ghostbusters (1984). Erickson and some fellow College Republicans performed Fritzbusters at the 1984 Republican National Convention and later as a warm-up act for Ronald Reagan at some rallies during the 1984 United States presidential election. The campaign stopped running Fritzbusters after more than 100 students wearing Fritzbusters shirts heckled Mondale in September 1984. Erickson earned a law degree from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1988. == Political consulting == In addition to his political work while in college, Erickson worked in 1985 as the deputy campaign manager for Richard Viguerie‚Äôs unsuccessful campaign for Lieutenant Governor of Virginia. Frustrated by the tax increase led by President George H. W. Bush, Erickson served as the national political director / campaign manager for the 1992 presidential campaign of Pat Buchanan. A biographer of Buchanan later said Erickson was \\"the best there was at the price Pat could afford.\\" Erickson later served as an advisor to Mitt Romney for both of his presidential campaigns. He is also a former board member of the American Conservative Union, the group that organizes the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). He was a friend of Andrew Breitbart. Stephen Moore, founder of the right-leaning limited-government group Club for Growth often relies on what he calls Erickson's ‚Äúclever and creative ideas.‚Äù However, Lee Schoenbeck, a former Republican Watertown Representative to the South Dakota House of Representatives, has called him \\"the single biggest phony I‚Äôve ever met in South Dakota politics.\\" Casey Phillips, a South Dakota Republican political consultant, has said of Erickson, \\"He likes to put people in touch with people. He‚Äôs a person that‚Äôs at the center of relationships all over the place.\\" == Business undertakings == Erickson worked as an executive producer of Red Scorpion (1988), an anticommunist action film produced by Jack Abramoff. From 1993 to 1994, Erickson acted as a media adviser, agent, and lawyer for John Wayne Bobbitt, whose wife Lorena had cut off his penis with a kitchen knife. Erickson booked Bobbitt on an international \\"Love Hurts\\" tour during which Bobbitt made appearances on television shows such as The Howard Stern Show. In 1994, Erickson obtained a $30,000 contract with Jack Abramoff to lobby for entrance into the United States by Mobutu Sese Seko, the military dictator of the Democratic Republic of the Congo who had been banned from the entering the United States due to the corrupt and dictatorial nature of his regime. Mobutu sought a visit to the United Nations to claim credit for this offer, but his visa request was ultimately denied due to his past human rights abuses. ===Senior care and medical technologies=== In 1997, Erickson founded Compass Care, a senior living company based in South Dakota dedicated to developing non-nursing home care options for seniors in the Midwest. This venture led to senior care consulting spinoffs, independent living communities and the licensing of medical technology. Erickson and his companies have amassed at least seven civil court judgments against them over the years. In two such cases, lawsuits by investors in Compass Care alleged that Erickson had predicted investment returns of 25‚Äì100% but that neither investor received any returns and that Erickson had reneged on his promises to refund the original investments. One investor won a judgment for $115,417 in 2003 while another obtained a judgment for $190,000 in 2008. Two of Erickson's lawyers withdrew from the second case, one after Erickson wrote him a bad check. On February 6, 2019, Erickson was indicted by a grand jury in the US District of South Dakota for wire fraud and money laundering in connection with his activities with Compass Care and for defrauding investors of Investing with Dignity, a start-up wheelchair development and manufacturing venture. He pleaded not guilty and was released on bond. == NRA and Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign == Erickson has strong ties to both the National Rifle Association and the Russian gun rights community. He has supported Maria Butina, a former assistant to Aleksandr Torshin and the founder of a Russian gun rights group called \\"The Right to Bear Arms\\". In 2016, Erickson and Butina set up a South Dakota business named \\"Bridges, LLC\\", which Erickson later said was created to provide financial assistance for Butina's graduate studies. During Donald Trump's presidential campaign in 2016, Erickson attempted to develop a back-channel between the NRA and the Russian government. In May 2016, Erickson sent an e-mail with the subject line \\"Kremlin Connection\\" to Trump campaign adviser Rick Dearborn asking Dearborn and then-Senator Jeff Sessions for advice on setting up a meeting between Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin at an annual NRA convention. After Trump won the presidential election in November 2016, Erickson said he was advising his transition team. Erickson, Butina, and Torshin have been part of an investigation by the Senate Intelligence Committee into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Torshin has also been the subject of a probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigations into whether the Russian government attempted to illegally funnel money to the NRA in order to help Trump win the presidency. In July 2018 Butina was arrested by the FBI and charged with conspiring to act as an unregistered agent of the Russian Federation. In Butina's indictment, federal prosecutors said an unnamed American political operative, later identified as Erickson, had worked with Butina to arrange introductions to influential people inside the U.S. and to advance Russian interests. Butina pleaded guilty in December 2018, saying that she had engaged in a conspiracy against the United States with Erickson and Torshin. Meanwhile Erickson was under investigation by federal law enforcement agencies for the same offense. == Religious activities == Erickson served a term on the board of directors of the Institute for Lutheran Theology. In 1997 Erickson helped to organize a religious revival service on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., sponsored by the Promise Keepers, an Evangelical Christian men's organization. Hundreds of thousands of men participated in the day-long service. == Personal life == Erickson is single and has never married. He has homes in New York, Los Angeles, and Sioux Falls, South Dakota. According to prosecutor charges against Butina, Erickson and Butina lived together. Butina's defense alleged a long time relationship with Erickson. ==See also== *Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections == References == ==External links== * Category:1962 births Category:American gun rights activists Category:American lawyers Category:American lobbyists Category:American political activists Category:Living people Category:South Dakota Republicans Category:People associated with Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections Category:People from Vermillion, South Dakota Category:University of Virginia School of Law alumni Category:Yale University alumni ","title":"Paul Erickson (activist)"},{"id":"56732670","text":"Port Durnford (sometimes Port Dunford) may refer to: *Port Durnford, a town in uMhlathuze Local Municipality, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa *Port Durnford, now Burgabo, a town in southwestern Somalia ==See also== *Punta Durnford ","title":"Port Durnford"},{"id":"56732691","text":"Jillian Cornish (born 1950) is a New Zealand biomedical researcher.

The law expands the definition of trafficking to anyone who benefits financially from prostitution, regardless of intent, and sex workers have not only opposed the further criminalization of their work, but also the portrayal of all sex workers as victims that the law perpetuates. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Northern California (ACLU-NC) and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) filed a federal class-action lawsuit to block implementation of unconstitutional provisions of Proposition 35 in mid-2013 and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco heard oral arguments on September 10, 2013. As of February 12, 2014, further information on the outcome of this lawsuit are yet to be published. A media article published on February 8, 2014, provided details of a police sting operation in the Sonoma County area of California and the police officers involved experienced difficulties with the very high number of respondents to the false advertisement that they published on the Internet. After several hours, 10 men were arrested, followed by the arrest of former prosecutor and judicial candidate John LemMon‚Äîthe authorities involved stated that the market is overwhelming. At the same time, the county District Attorney's Office is establishing a version of the FOPP for Sonoma County and the program will be active in mid-2014. On February 11, 2014, sex worker activists protested a San Francisco anti-trafficking panel discussion held by the San Francisco Collaborative Against Human Trafficking, as they believe that it will further criminalize adults in the sex industry. Maxine Doogan, an organizer with the Erotic Service Providers Union, stated: \\"Their goal is to disappear the whole sex industry by criminalizing the people that participate in it. Targeting our customers is a flawed approach.\\" Doogan also included in a press release announcing the protest that the term \\"john\\" as a descriptor for sex work clients is demeaning and dehumanizes customers. ===Legal challenge=== The Erotic Service Providers Legal, Educational and Research Project on behalf of 3 ex-sex workers and a client, challenged the state's prostitution laws in court. They submitted that the prostitution laws violate the rights of people to engage in consensual sex and cited a Supreme Court 2003 ruling that revoked laws against gay sex acts. In October 2017, the Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco allowed the challenge to proceed. However the U.S. Court of Appeals rejected the challenge in January 2018 on the grounds that prohibition of prostitution was in the public interest. ==Sex Workers Outreach Project== A chapter of the Sex Workers Outreach Project (SWOP)‚Äîa national advocacy group and decriminalization effort founded by and for sex workers in 2003‚Äîexists in the Bay Area of San Francisco and its members meet on a monthly basis. The chapter represents the sex-positive and activist ethos that underpins the local sex-workers' movement that also included the East Bay's Lusty Lady cooperative that, while it was open, remained the only business of its kind globally to be fully unionized and worker-owned. San Francisco is where the American sex-workers' rights movement was founded and decriminalization measures in Berkeley and San Francisco were garnering support as early as 2004. ==John school== In the city of San Francisco, a First Offender Prostitution Program (FOPP), also known as \\"john school\\", has been established as a court diversion program for apprehended clients of the sex industry. The SAGE Project, one of the founders of the initiative, defines the FOPP as a \\"demand reduction strategy\\" and explains the program's philosophy in the following manner: > FOPP was founded on the theory that if male consumers had a better > understanding of the risks and impact of their behavior when soliciting > prostitution, they would cease to do so ... Understanding that everyone has > different motivations, triggers and fears that inspire them to act, FOPP > utilizes a variety of perspectives so that consumers are exposed to a range > of experts who engage with the issue from different angles. This approach, > the founders believed, would deliver a holistic understanding of the > commercial sex industry that would empower sustained behavior change for a > diverse set of individuals ... The FOPP model educates consumers on the > harmful effects their actions have on themselves, those engaged in the sex > industry, and their community. ==See also== * Barbary Coast, San Francisco * Prostitution in the United States * Tenderloin, San Francisco ==References== Category:California society ","title":"Prostitution in California"},{"id":"56732970","text":"Valentina Bergamaschi (born 22 January 1997) is an Italian football striker who plays for A.C. Milan Women of Serie A. In 2018 A.C. Milan obtained the playing licence of ACF Brescia Femminile, whom Bergamaschi had joined in 2017 after three seasons in Swiss football with Rapid Lugano, FF Lugano 1976, and FC Neunkirch. With Neunkirch she won the Nationalliga A championship and the Swiss Women's Cup in 2016‚Äì2017. A member of the senior Italy women's national football team since 2016, Bergamaschi also has third place medals from the 2014 UEFA Women's Under-17 Championship and the 2014 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. == Club career == Bergamaschi, who was born in Varese but grew up and lived with her parents in Cittiglio, began competitive activity by joining FC Caravate, a club that promotes football in the homonymous Italian town, playing with boys from the age of nine years old. In May 2011, Bergamaschi was called up to the representative under-15 team of Lombardy to participate in the Torneo delle Regioni (Tournament of the Regions) held in Chianciano Terme from 26 June to 3 July 2011. During the tournament, which the representative of Lombardy won by beating the Veneto in the final, Bergamaschi scored one of the goals and was noticed by the selectors of the Italy women's national under-17 football team, being called at the end of the tournament for a training camp with coaches Enrico Sbardella and Rita Guarino. As a promising young player from Lombardy, Bergamaschi was contacted by a number of football clubs in higher divisions, but decided to sign for Alto Verbano, a club that was about to compete in the 2011‚Äì2012 Serie D Italian regional Championship, then at the lowly fifth level of Italian women's football. With Bergamaschi showing her qualities from the first match of the season Alto Verbano topped the league table, and retained their position until the end of the championship, gaining promotion to Serie C for 2012‚Äì2013. During the 2014 summer transfer market, she joined Rapid Lugano of the Swiss Nationalliga B. Bergamaschi helped the club secure promotion to Nationalliga A at the end of the 2014‚Äì2015 season. Before the start of 2015‚Äì2016, the women's team left the men's club, becoming Lugano 1976. Bergamaschi decided to remain with the newly independent club for the following season. Ahead of the 2016‚Äì17 campaign, she transferred to FC Neunkirch. She won a league and Swiss Women's Cup double in the 2016‚Äì2017 season with Neunkirch, also finishing league top-scorer with 24 goals.

He made his debut at the 1984 Summer Paralympics where he won five golds, then returned at the 1992 Games in Barcelona where he medalled in all ten events in which he competed. Morgan's success at these Games included setting six world records; throughout his career he set a total of 14 world records. He was inducted into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 2008 and the United States Association of Blind Athletes' Hall of Fame in 2011. ==Biography== Morgan was born in San Gabriel, California, and was taught to swim in the ocean at Huntington Beach by his parents. He joined the local swim team and worked as a junior lifeguard. The family moved to Argentina, his father's home country, when Morgan was 13. Morgan was finding success as a competitive swimmer and he completed a 20K marathon river swim at the age of 15. While exercising, an accident with a springed exerciser he was holding left Morgan with two detached retinas. Over the next two years his eyesight deteriorated, until in 1980 at age 18 he lost all vision. In 1984, while studying mathematics at University of California, Irvine, he was selected for the All-American Team for open water swimming. Morgan was competing as a blind swimmer in B1 category events when he attended the International Games for the Disabled, subsequently known as the Paralympic Games, in 1984. He found great success, finishing the tournament with five gold medals. In 1988 he attended the University of California, Berkeley to do his master's degree and consequently missed the Paralympic Games that year. After completing his studies in 1991, he took part in a open water marathon in Argentina which he completed in 12th position with a time of 8 hours and 24 minutes. Morgan returned for the 1992 Games in Barcelona, again finding success by winning eight golds in backstroke, butterfly, freestyle, and medley events, as well as silver in two breaststroke distances. Morgan was inducted into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 2008 and the United States Association of Blind Athletes' Hall of Fame in 2011. Aside from swimming, Morgan has pushed himself in other athletic endeavours, including tandem cycling and the successful ascent of Mount Kilimanjaro. ==References== ==External links== * \\"6th Annual Common Sight, Common Vision\\" (video) United States Association of Blind Athletes, December 2, 2011 * Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:People from San Gabriel, California Category:Paralympic swimmers of the United States Category:Paralympic gold medalists for the United States Category:Paralympic silver medalists for the United States Category:Paralympic medalists in swimming Category:Living people Category:Medalists at the 1984 Summer Paralympics Category:Medalists at the 1992 Summer Paralympics Category:Swimmers at the 1984 Summer Paralympics Category:Swimmers at the 1992 Summer Paralympics ","title":"John Morgan (swimmer)"},{"id":"56733002","text":"The 1947 Turkish Football Championship was the 13th edition of the competition.

He was closely associated with fellow corsair Michel de Grammont. ==History== Brigaut first went to sea in 1679, surviving a shipwreck before joining the flibustier (French buccaneer) fleet of Sieur de Grammont. Over the next few years he was part of their expeditions attacking Cumana, Maracaibo, and Cartagena. By 1683 he had risen to the position of quartermaster aboard the ship La Mutine commanded by Michiel Andrieszoon. Andrieszoon sailed up the American east coast to Boston to resupply in late 1684. While there Brigaut purchased a 40-ton sloop of his own. Now in command of his own vessel, he and other buccaneers gathered off the coast of Caracas for another raid which never materialized. The pirates dispersed, and Brigaut left to find Grammont, with whom he sailed in a 1685 attack on Campeche alongside Laurens de Graaf. While there Brigaut transferred to command of a captured Spanish galliot. Afterwards he sailed for Roatan, where he rendezvoused with Grammont‚Äôs ship Le Hardi. Grammont and Brigaut conspired to attack the Spanish again at Saint Augustine, Florida, possibly with help from English colonists in Charleston. They arrived off Florida at the end of April 1686. Grammont sent Brigaut ahead to Matanzas Inlet to capture guides and interpreters and gather intelligence on Saint Augustine. Brigaut‚Äôs men captured several Indians and Spaniards but were attacked by a contingent of Spanish soldiers. Brigaut‚Äôs forces retreated to their ship; during the night a storm forced his ship aground. The Frenchmen tried to come ashore but met resistance, then failing to free the galliot, they returned to the beach and marched overland to await rescue by Grammont. The Governor of Florida sent additional soldiers who attacked Brigaut and his men, slaughtering over forty of them (including their Spanish prisoners) and leaving alive only Brigaut, a black sailor named Diego, and a young boy. The Spanish Governor interrogated Brigaut and Diego, at first mistaking Brigaut for Spanish turncoat Alonso de Avesilla thanks to Brigaut having flown Spanish flags to disguise his ship. Brigaut revealed their plan to attack Saint Augustine and confirmed the involvement of men from the Carolinas. He also confessed that La Salle had established a French colony in Mississippi, which alarmed the Governor. Brigaut and Diego were hanged at the end of May 1686. Grammont himself tried approaching the coast in Le Hardi but was run aground just as Brigaut had been; his ship was lost with all hands. The Lords Proprietors wrote to Governor James Colleton of South Carolina early the following year, warning him to restrain his colonists from dealing with pirates or attacking the Spanish. They cautioned that: > ‚Ä¶the people of Carolina have received the pirates who have unjustly burned > and robbed the houses of the Spaniards. Could any rational man doubt that > the Spaniards would seek revenge, and would be justified in seeking it, if > this be true? We have also been informed that a design was on foot in > Carolina to take St. Augustine, which our Government was ready to > countenance, being persuaded that they were justified by our clause > permitting invaders to be pursued beyond the bounds of our province.

The film is based on the novel of the same name by Yrsa Sigur√∞ard√≥ttir. ==Plot== Freyr, a doctor in a city in Iceland, assists local police when an elderly woman is found hanged inside of an old church. Crosses are found carved into her back, which is assumed to be the result of abuse, but when the dead woman's husband insists he never touched her, policewoman Dagny links the death to the mysterious disappearance of a young boy, Bern√≥dus, who vanished decades earlier. Dagny shows him a photograph of Bern√≥dus's classmates, with eight of their faces scratched out with crosses. She explains that the classmates were known for bullying Bern√≥dus, who had crosses carved on his back from his ultra-religious, abusive father (who blamed him for the death of his wife in childbirth). Six of the eight have been killed in mysterious accidents and were all found with crosses carved into their backs. Freyr, who is still reeling from the unsolved disappearance of his own son, Benni, while Benni was playing hide-and-seek with a friend, begins to see visions of Bern√≥dus. In the second plotline, married couple Katrin and Gar√∞ar (recovering from a recent estrangement), along with Katrin's best friend L√≠f, move to a small, abandoned hamlet to renovate an old, decades-abandoned house to turn into a bed and breakfast. While exploring the area, Katrin stumbles upon an old cemetery, with one of the graves missing a headstone. She begins to experience paranormal incidents around the area, including seeing Bern√≥dus's ghost near the creek along with the missing headstone and hearing strange sounds in the house, which cause her to fall down the stairs and sprain her foot. As the house gets no cell phone reception, the group is unable to call for help. Katrin also ventures into the house's cellar, where she finds the body of Bern√≥dus, who is carrying a picture of his mother, who resembles Katrin. The group is shaken by the discovery, but are again unable to get into contact with others. Katrin refuses to stay in the house any longer, and they move to another unoccupied home nearby. Freyr continues to experience his own strange incidents. Benni's autistic friend only reveals that Benni was last seen in a \\"green submarine.\\" The seventh bully of Bern√≥dus is found dead after an apparent suicide attempt, and Freyr finds dozens of newspaper clippings about Benni's disappearance in one of his rooms. Freyr also learns that the eighth bully was √örs√∫la, a woman he knows who is suffering from schizophrenia. An addled √örs√∫la tells him that Benni is \\"at the bottom\\" of \\"somewhere green,\\" but Freyr is unable to get more out of her; a clairvoyant who claims to be in contact with Benni's ghost gives similar information. Meanwhile, Katrin learns that Gar√∞ar and L√≠f were having an affair during their estrangement, which leaves her feeling betrayed. However, Gar√∞ar and L√≠f are still in love, and while Katrin is away, they plan to run away together and abandon Katrin. As they discuss their feelings, they are attacked by what appears to be a young boy who throws a stone through their window before running away to a nearby whale house. Gar√∞ar and L√≠f give chase and encounter Bern√≥dus's ghost inside. The chimney then collapses on top of both of them. Katrin discovers Gar√∞ar dead and L√≠f mortally wounded. Katrin runs to try to find cell phone reception to call for help using L√≠f's phone, but in doing so discovers that L√≠f was pregnant with Gar√∞ar's baby, and the two were planning to run away together. A devastated Katrin leaves without calling, and goes to sleep in the cellar with Bern√≥dus's body. Freyr awakens in the middle of the night and goes for a jog, where he once again sees Bern√≥dus's ghost and gives chase. Bern√≥dus leads him to a trapped √örs√∫la, who claims that Bern√≥dus is always with her; she reveals that she was the last one to see him before his disappearance, and saw him hiding in a boat, which she kept a secret for decades. Ursula also adds that Bernodus had been 'woken up' by the arrival of Benni's ghost to the house. Bern√≥dus disembarked at the abandoned hamlet, which held the grave of his late mother, whose headstone Katrin discovered; alone, he wandered around the empty house before perishing in the cellar. Meanwhile, Benni's friend draws a green submarine, which his mother sends to Dagny. In a moment of inspiration, Dagny realizes that what he is describing is not a submarine, but a septic tank. She examines the gas station footage where Benni was last seen, and the footage reveals Katrin, Gar√∞ar and L√≠f; they were carrying a septic tank with them to renovate the house with. It is revealed that Katrin, Gar√∞ar and L√≠f's plotline took place years earlier. Gar√∞ar and L√≠f's bodies were discovered, but Katrin was never found. Dagny posits that Benni crawled inside the septic tank in the gas station while the three were inside having a meal and died. They make their way to the abandoned house, where Benni's body is found inside the septic tank. Devastated but finally having closure, Freyr sits inside the house. Something draws him to the cellar, where the bodies of Katrin and Bern√≥dus lay, but he shuts its door without looking inside. He leaves with Benni's body (including his blue-jacketed ghost, implying that he's no longer stuck), as the ghosts of Katrin and Bern√≥dus hold hands and sadly watch him go. ==Cast== * J√≥hannes Haukur J√≥hannesson as Freyr * √Åg√∫sta Eva Erlendsd√≥ttir as L√≠f * Elma Stefania Agustsdottir as Sara * Thor Kristjansson as Gar√∞ar * Anna Gunnd√≠s Gu√∞mundsd√≥ttir as Katr√≠n ==Reception== On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 86% based on 7 reviews, with an average rating of 6.25/10. The website incorrectly spells the title \\"Eg man big\\". Cath Clarke from The Guardian gave the film three out of five stars and wrote: \\"Maybe it‚Äôs a matter of personal taste, but for me, the spectre of a supernatural explanation felt like a plot cop-out. Or perhaps the movie simply lacks a truly shocking moment of horror. It‚Äôs entertaining enough, but certainly didn‚Äôt have me reaching for a jumper.\\" Frank Scheck from The Hollywood Reporter said: \\"I Remember You certainly traffics in clich√©s, such as its central character of an emotionally tortured investigator dealing with tragic events in his past. But the horror elements are relatively fresh to the genre, with director Axelsson teasing them out in intriguingly subtle fashion until the ending in which the various plot strands are satisfyingly tied together.\\" Noel Murray from Los Angeles Times wrote: \\"But while the horror elements certainly could have been more horrifying, \\"I Remember You\\" does have a strong sense of place and character. The genre's a little twisted, but the film should still appeal to fans of books about moody detectives, doggedly pursuing justice against a frosty backdrop.\\" Andy Webster from The New York Times, stated: \\"The Icelandic director Oskar Thor Axelsson is clearly fluent in horror conventions. But he has commendable restraint, and his latest film, ‚ÄúI Remember You,‚Äù transcends genre pyrotechnics even as it incorporates elements of Nordic noir.\\" ==ReferencesCategory:2017 films Category:2017 horror films Category:2010s mystery films Category:Icelandic films Category:Icelandic horror films Category:Icelandic- language films Category:Mystery horror films ","title":"I Remember You (2017 film)"},{"id":"56733194","text":"Victory Park (, ) is a park in Riga, located on the left bank of the Daugava, in the district of ƒÄgenskalns.The modern area of the park is 36.7 hectares. ==History== When Latvia was in the Russian Empire, the park was known as Riga Petrovsky Park (, ). It was created in 1909 on the eve of a large-scale celebration of the bicentennial anniversary of the actual accession of the Governorate of Livonia to the Russian Empire. The official opening ceremony of the park complex took place in the middle of 1910 in the presence of Tsar Nicholas II, and the Mayor of Riga George Armitstead. In 1923, the park was renamed Victory Park in honor of the victory in 1919 over the West Russian Volunteer Army under the command of Colonel Pavel Bermondt-Avalov during the Latvian War of Independence. Before the Second World War, a reconstruction of the park was carried out, aimed at creating a new socially significant leisure center for the population of the Latvian capital. During the Soviet occupation, the Riga City Council decided to rename the park after the XXII Congress of the CPSU. In 1985, a monument in honor of the soldiers of the Soviet Army was opened. At this point, the Riga City Council renamed the park to Victory Park again. ==References== Category:Parks in Latvia ","title":"Victory Park (Riga)"},{"id":"56733205","text":"S√∂derstr√∂m is a river in central Stockholm that connects Lake M√§laren with the Baltic Sea.

She served with the Red Cross in Europe during World War I, and was decorated by Elisabeth of Bavaria, Queen of Belgium and by the Mayor of Le Havre. She was instrumental in instituting public nursing services on Kauai and in getting a hospital built on the island. ==Family background== She was born November 4, 1882, in the Kingdom of Hawaii, on the island of Kauai, as one of six children of Samuel Whitney Wilcox (1847‚Äì1929) and Emma Washburn Lyman Wilcox (1849‚Äì1934). Mabel's mother was a seminary student in Chicago in 1871 when the Great Chicago Fire occurred. Her father was a Kauai sugar planter, manager of a cattle ranch, and sheriff of Kauai for 25 years. Maternal grandparents David Belden Lyman (1803‚Äì1884) and Sarah Joiner Lyman (1805‚Äì1885), and paternal grandparents Abner Wilcox (1808‚Äì1869) and Lucy Eliza Hart Wilcox (1814‚Äì1869), had been sent to Hawaii by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions in Massachusetts. She was the niece of businessmen George Norton Wilcox and Albert Spencer Wilcox. Her sisters and brothers were high-achieving individuals. Sister Lucy Etta Wilcox Sloggett (1877‚Äì1933) was a civic leader on Kauai, and also the World War I secretary of the Maui chapter of the American Red Cross.; ; Sister Elsie Hart Wilcox (1879‚Äì1954) served as a senator in the Hawaii territorial legislature. ; Her older brother Ralph Lyman Wilcox (1876‚Äì1913) was a plantation overseer on Kauai; brother Charles Henry Wilcox (1880‚Äì1920) served in the Hawaii National Guard, managed sugar plantations, and had been a representative in the territorial legislature; brother Gaylord Parke Wilcox (1881‚Äì1970) was Chairman of the Board of Grove Farm, Ltd. ==Education and early career== She received her early education at home from a private instructor, transferring later to Punahou School on Oahu, followed by three years at Oakland High School in California, completing her basic education at the college preparatory Dana Hall School in Massachusetts. Her parents discouraged her from a career in nursing, but she persisted in pursuing her profession at Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, receiving her RN degree in 1911. According to Johns Hopkins, she was the first Hawaii resident to graduate from the school. Upon graduation, she remained in New York for several years, affiliated with the Buffalo Red Cross War Relief organization. In 1915, she returned home to Kauai as an employee of the Territorial Board of Health. Instituting the island's first public nursing services, she was influential in raising funds and getting the territorial legislature to allocate land to build the Samuel Mahelona Memorial Hospital at Kapaa. ==World War I== With the outbreak of World War I, Johns Hopkins pediatrician Edwards A. Park, working with the American Red Cross Belgian Commission, headed the Children's Hospital in Le Havre as a facility for refugee Belgian children. He appointed Mabel as head nurse in supervision over 15 other nurses, among whom was Ethel Moseley Damon of Honolulu. They provided medical care and a safe haven for the children, often putting themselves in harm's way behind enemy lines to assist refugee women. In recognition of their war-time services, Mabel and Ethel were decorated with the Queen Elisabeth Medal by the Queen Elisabeth of Belgium and the Bronze Medal of the City of Le Havre by the Mayor of Le Havre.; ==Postwar career == Returning home to Kauai, she became the trustee and treasurer of Samuel Mahelona Memorial Hospital, and a probation officer of the Kauai County Juvenile Court. In the ensuing decades, she served in administrative and advisory capacities of numerous boards and institutions. Mabel and her sisters renovated the Wai‚Äòoli Mission House, which had been the boyhood home of their father. The house is now part of the Waioli Mission District on Kauai. She died at home on December 28, 1978, and is buried on the island of Kauai. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Category:1882 births Category:1978 deaths Category:American nursing administrators Category:Nursing educators Category:People from Kauai Category:People of the Territory of Hawaii Category:Hawaiian Kingdom people Category:Dana Hall School alumni ","title":"Mabel Isabel Wilcox"},{"id":"56733354","text":"The Experiment to Detect the Global EoR Signature (EDGES) is an experiment and radio telescope located in a radio quiet zone at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory in Western Australia. It is a collaboration between Arizona State University and Haystack Observatory, with infrastructure provided by CSIRO. EoR stands for epoch of reionization, a time in cosmic history when neutral atomic hydrogen gas became ionised due to ultraviolet light from the first stars. == Low-band instruments == The experiment has two low-band instruments, each of which has a dipole antenna pointed to the zenith and observing a single polarisation. The antenna is around in size, sat on a ground shield. It is coupled with a radio receiver, with a 100m cable run to a digital spectrometer. The instruments operate at , and are separated by 150m. Observations started in August 2015. === 78 MHz absorption profile === In March 2018 the collaboration published a paper in Nature announcing the discovery of a broad absorption profile centered at a frequency of 78\\\\pm1MHz in the sky-averaged signal after subtracting Galactic synchrotron emission. The absorption profile has a width of 19_{-2}^{+4}MHz and an amplitude of 0.5_{-0.2}^{+0.5}K, against a background RMS of 0.025K, giving it a signal-to- noise ratio of 37.

It is a timed event. The roper starts in the box and the runner must start from a designated spot determined by the field judge. Some rules allow a runner to start anywhere in the arena. The event begins when the steer breaks the barrier. The roper must rope the steer. Any type of catch is legal. The roper must then \\"dally\\" which is to make several loops around the saddle horn with the rope. The runner must then grab the ribbon off the calf's tail. The runner then races back to the box, and the time is stopped once the runner crosses the barrier. Many organizations, like the National Little Britches Rodeo Association allow coed teams. == Equipment == The equipment is the same used by team ropers: * Rope - made of synthetic fibers, used to rope the steer. * Horn wraps - protective wraps that go around the horns of the steer to prevent rope burns and reduce the risk of a horn breaking when roped. * Roping gloves - To prevent rope burns on the hands of the riders * Western saddle - Roping saddles have a particularly strong design with double rigging and other specialized features, including a rubber wrap around the saddle horn to keep the dally from slipping, and usually a wooden rawhide-covered saddle tree or a reinforced fiberglass tree. * Bell boots and splint boots are placed on the horse's legs for protection == Rules == There are various organizations that sanction team roping events at local, regional and national levels. Some of the rules common to most groups include: * The roper must start from inside the box * Depending on the organization the runner may be allowed to start anywhere in the arena or may be limited to a starting location indicated by the judge * If the barrier is broken there is a 10-second penalty * Most organizations allow what is called \\"catch as catch can\\" which means any roping catch is legal. == See also == * Rodeo * Calf roping * Team roping * Breakaway roping * Goat tying == References == Category:Rodeo events Category:Roping (rodeo) Category:Mounted games ==External Links== *National Little Britches Rodeo Association *National High School Rodeo Association ","title":"Dally Ribbon Roping"},{"id":"56733380","text":"Without Mercy is a 1925 silent film melodrama directed by George Melford and starring Dorothy Phillips and Vera Reynolds.

It is absolutely artistic. It is also grim. It is also an active, challenging watch. It is, as far as I can tell, all the things everyone's favorite dark prestige television is.\\" In a more mixed assessment, The Globe and Mails John Doyle offered the series restrained approval saying, \\"Sacred Lies is a good, multilayered drama, although the vaguely supernatural quality to Minnow's past is milked a bit too hard.\\" In an overall negative review, Indiewires Ben Travers gave the series a grade of \\"C-\\" and criticized it saying, \\"This half- hour drama is ineffective in teasing its larger mystery, and its dialogue can be laughably blunt. Die-hard fans of the book may stick around to see how it all plays out, but that would take a level of commitment usually seen...in cults!\\" ==Other media== ===Aftershow=== The Official Sacred Lies After Show is a companion aftershow series that airs live on the series' official Facebook page on Sunday evenings.

Does planning how to cope with anticipated barriers facilitate health-related behaviour change? A systematic review, Health Psychology Review, 7:2, 129‚Äì145, ==Approach== Coping planning aims to meet the needs of people who ask for help with distress, including suicidal ideation. By addressing why someone asks for help, the focus stays on what the person needs rather than on what the helper wants to do. It provides an alternative to the widely used, but non-evidence-based risk-assessment approach to suicide prevention.Franklin, J. C., Ribeiro, J. D., Fox, K. R., Bentley, K. H., Kleiman, E.

They are rated as low (coping independently), moderate (may need additional low-intensity professional support), or high (needs immediate high-intensity professional support). ==Applications== In addition to suicide prevention training for health professionals, coping planning has been used to train journalists, and to help a range of people cope better, including carers, university students, and with children to improve emotional regulation. ===In suicide prevention=== Coping planning is designed to contribute to suicide prevention in a number of ways. Firstly, it provides a framework to support people whenever they seek help, rather than waiting until they are considered high-risk for death by suicide.Stallman, H. M. (2017). Meeting the needs of patients who have suicidal thoughts presenting to Emergency Departments. Emergency Medicine Australasia, 29(6), 749.

It combines the horse's athletic ability and the horsemanship skills of a rider in order to safely and successfully maneuver a horse through a series of five obstacles. The rider must remain mounted the entire time. It is similar to Trail competition at horse shows, but with emphasis on speed rather than style. == Modern event == Today the trail course is mostly a youth rodeo event. The National Little Britches Rodeo has both a senior girl trail course competition and a junior girl trail course competition. The only difference is the jump is removed from the junior girls' event. Some college rodeo programs also compete in the trail course. == Obstacles == There are five obstacles that must be navigated. The obstacles can be placed in any order, and are usually rearranged between rounds. The obstacles are: A sample pattern of how the obstacles could be arranged in the Trail Course. * Bridge - The bridge is six feet long and four feet wide. 3 poles will be placed on each side of the bridge * Gate - The gate must be at least four feet wide and four feet high. The rider must unlatch the gate, maneuver her horse through the gate and then re-latch the gate, without dismounted. * Mailbox - A standard metal U.S. postal service approved mailbox is used. The rider must carry a 3 X 5 card. The rider must open the mailbox, deposit the mail, and close the mailbox. * Back up barrels - Two 55 gallon drums placed 4 feet between them. The rider must back their horse through the barrels. * Jump - A 1 1/2\\" PVC pipe is placed at a height of 24 inches. The rider and horse must jump over the pipe.

He was one of eight children born to Oliver DeLancey Kane (1816‚Äì1874) and Louisa Dorothea (n√©e Langdon) Kane (1821‚Äì1894). His brothers were Walter Langdon Kane, DeLancey Astor Kane, John Innes Kane, Woodbury Kane. His sisters were Louisa Langdon Kane, Emily Astor Kane (who married Augustus Jay and was the mother of Peter Augustus Jay), and Sybil Kent Kane. He was the grandson of Walter Langdon and Dorothea (n√©e Astor) Langdon and the great-grandson of John Jacob Astor. He was a cousin of Lt. Col. John Jacob Astor IV. His paternal lineage descended from John O'Kane who emigrated to the country in 1752 from County Londonderry and Antrim, Ireland. During the American Revolutionary War, O'Kane (who dropped the \\"'O\\" once in America) was living at Sharyvogne, his estate in Dutchess County, which was confiscated after the War due to his Loyalist times. His eldest son, John Jr., stayed and became one of the most prominent merchants in New York. The family lived at \\"Beach Cliffe\\", designed by Detlef Lienau, which was one the earliest Newport cottages \\"to attain a sort of Beaux-Arts purity.\\" After prep school in New York, Kane attended and graduated from the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland in June 1866. After his service in the Navy, he entered Cambridge University in England where he graduated in 1873. After returning the United States, he studied law at Albany Law School. ==Career== After the Naval Academy, Kane was assigned the grade of ensign and began working on the staff of Admiral David Farragut. He resigned from the U.S. Navy in 1868. After the Navy, he attended university in England then returned to the United States for law school, and was admitted to the bar. Even though he was admitted, due to his \\"ample means\\", he did not practice his profession. In 1874, he became a member of the New York Yacht Club, where he served as Commodore and an officer for many years. During the beginning of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, he volunteered as an Ensign and in ten days, was promoted to Senior Lieutenant, serving on the staff of Admiral Charles Dwight Sigsbee, serving until the end of the war. Kane was honorably discharged on November 15, 1898. ===Society life=== In 1892, Kane, along with two of his brothers and their wives, were included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. He was a member of the Union Club, Metropolitan Club, the Knickerbocker Club, the New York Yacht Club, and the American Geographical Society. ==Personal life== Kane lived at the Kane family mansion at 23 West 47th Street in Manhattan. In 1889, he was described as: > \\"He is an enthusiastic yachtsman, and is an excellent whip. He has traveled > much, is a discriminating collector of books, and is exceptionally well- > like, being very affable and a raconteur of unusual eloquence.\\" Kane, who suffered from cirrhosis hepatitis, died of intestinal hemorrhages in a sleeping car in Manassas, Virginia about thirty miles from Washington, DC on November 15, 1906.

He passed the 1646 Jinshi examination and gained a reputation for his focus on the examination system. Wei served in his first administrative position in 1648 when he was the placed as the principal examiner for the Shanxi province. In the same year, he wrote about his views on how to best reform the examination system, particularly the examination used by the military, raising it to a level more closely in line with the civil examination, the banning of the publishing of examination essays by non-governmental entities, and the publication and introduction of the Xiaojing into a regular rotation of questions based on the Classic in examinations. In 1655, Wei was promoted to the post of principal vice censor-in-chief and was responsible for the administration of the metropolitan military examination in that year. In 1659, Wei made a petition to the emperor critical about infanticide and the drowning of little girls in the southeastern provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian. The Shunzhi Emperor agreed with Wei and issued an edict against Infanticide. Sometime between 1659 and 1661, Wei left his position as censor and held no position in office. When the Shunzhi Emperor died in 1661, Wei was recalled to serve as censor during the regency period of the reign of the Kangxi Emperor. ==Career under Kangxi== During the regency period of the Kangxi reign, Wei Yijie used his high position as principal vice censor-in-chief to influence the regency leadership in reforming the Examination system that was in place. In his work \\"Keju yi\\", Wei expresses his disdain of the examination format used at the time, which placed great emphasis on the Eight Legged Essay, recommending instead examinations which focused more on the policy aspects of the exams by placing them in the first session of examinations and moving the Eight legged Essay to a later session of the exam. Wei's preference to policy questions was due to his belief that scholars chosen for their response to these questions would benefit the dynasty because these scholars would be very knowledgeable about the issues that affected China. In 1663, the Ministry of Rites announced a format change to the examination system that matched what Wei had proposed, which would take place in the 1664 and 1667 exam years. Wei was an advocate for the resumption of the requirement for Bannermen to take examination, which had been rescinded in 1657 due to provincial instability, in order to obtain office in the central government. Wei believed that for the dynasty to continue to exist, Bannermen would need to adhere to the same standards that other officials met in order to maintain an effective central government. In 1663, due to the influence of Wei proposals, translations for the examinations were made in Manchu, Mongolian, and Hanjun. Later in the Kangxi reign, translations were discontinued and all Bannermen were required to take examinations in Han Chinese. In 1665, Wei was made a Grand Secretary of the Nei Mishuyuan, one of the Inner Three Academies. In 1670, Wei was promoted to Minister of Rites and conducted ceremonial and literary assignments such as editing the Shunzhi Veritable Record. Wei fell ill in early 1671 and resigned from his position in the Ministry of Rites and subsequently retired from official service and was given the title of Grand Mentor of the Heir Apparent in 1672 for his service to the Qing Dynasty. Wei remained in retirement until his death on April 27, 1686. ==Religious views== Wei Yijie was officially a follower of orthodox Neo-Confucian philosopher Zhu Xi, but is believed to have been a secret Christian in his private life. Wei is known to have compared Christianity and Confucianism in a positive manner in a testimonial on the seventieth birthday of the Jesuit missionary Johann Adam Schall von Bell. ==References== Category:1616 births Category:1686 deaths Category:Chinese Confucianists Category:Neo-Confucianism Category:Qing dynasty essayists Category:Grand Secretaries of the Qing dynasty Category:People from Baixiang County ","title":"Wei Yijie"},{"id":"56733791","text":"Emperor is the debut EP by the black metal band of the same name.

It is named after the meteorologist Edward N. Lorenz who worked on its mathematical formulation in the 1950s. Schematic representation with examples == Description == === Introduction === Any atmospheric circulation system, whether it is a small- scale weather system or a large-scale zonal wind system, is maintained by the supply of kinetic energy. The development of such a system requires either a transformation of some other form of energy into kinetic energy, or the conversion of the kinetic energy of another system into that of the developing system. On a global scale, the atmospheric circulation must carry energy polewards, because there is a net gain of energy in the tropics through incoming solar radiation and net loss of energy in high latitudes through thermal emission. At low latitudes, where the Hadley cell takes shape, the poleward transport of energy is done by the mean meridional circulation. At mid-latitudes in contrast, the influence of longitudinally asymmetric features, referred to as eddies, is dominant over the mean flow. For a closer examination, it is useful to split all parameters (e.g. P) into their zonal- mean (denoted by an overline, e.g. ) and their departures from the zonal mean due to orography, land-sea contrasts, weather systems and any other eddy-like features (denoted by a prime, e.g. P'). ===Energy reservoirs=== The available potential energy is the amount of potential energy in the atmosphere that can be converted into kinetic energy. In a statically stable atmosphere, the zonal-mean available potential energy is approximated as: :\\\\overline{P}=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\int_A \\\\frac{\\\\rho_0}{N^2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\overline{\\\\Phi}}{\\\\partial z^{*}}\\\\right)^2\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}V where \\\\int_A\\\\mathrm{d}V is the integral over the Earth's entire atmosphere, œÅ0 is the mean density of air, N is the buoyancy frequency, a measure of static stability, Œ¶ is the geopotential and z* denotes a log-pressure coordinate. Eddy available potential energy P' is approximated as: :P'=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\int_A \\\\frac{\\\\rho_0}{N^2}\\\\overline{\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Phi'}{\\\\partial z^{*}}\\\\right)^2}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}V Zonal-mean kinetic energy is approximated as: :\\\\overline{K}=\\\\int_A\\\\rho_0\\\\frac{\\\\overline{u}^2}{2}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}V where u and v are the zonal and meridional components of air velocity. Eddy kinetic energy K' is approximated as: :K'=\\\\int_A\\\\rho_0\\\\frac{\\\\overline{u'^2}+\\\\overline{v'^2}}{2}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}V ===Sources, sinks and conversion of energy=== The description of the Lorenz Energy Cycle is completed by a mathematical formalism for the generation of potential energy through diabatic heating, its conversion to kinetic energy through vertical motion of air and the dissipation of kinetic energy through friction. A conversion of zonal-mean energy to eddy energy and vice versa is possible where eddies interact with the mean flow and displace warm/cold air. == References == Category:Atmospheric circulation ","title":"Lorenz energy cycle"},{"id":"56733922","text":"Lucius Pullaienus Gargilius Antiquus was a Roman senator, who held a number of offices in the imperial service during the reign of Antoninus Pius.

It was recorded live in 1977, and released in 2007. It reached number 3 on the Billboard Blues Albums chart. ==Production== In January 1977, blues guitarist and singer Muddy Waters released the studio album Hard Again. It was very well-received, and helped revive Waters' career. It won a Grammy Award for Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording. Hard Again was produced by Johnny Winter. Winter and James Cotton both played on the album, on guitar and harmonica respectively. In March 1977, Waters, Winter, Cotton, and the other musicians who had played on Hard Again went on a concert tour to promote it. The songs on Breakin' It Up, Breakin' It Down were recorded at three of those concerts ‚Äì March 4 at the Palladium in New York City, March 6 at the Tower Theater in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, and March 18 at the Masonic Temple Theater in Detroit. The concert tapes languished in the vaults of several different record companies, until they were released thirty years later. In August 1977, Winters released a studio album recorded by the same group of musicians, titled Nothin' but the Blues. ==Critical reception== On AllMusic, Richie Unterberger said, \\"It might have been spurred by a Muddy Waters album, but in fact Waters, Winter, and Cotton all took vocals ‚Äì sometimes alone, and sometimes on the same song ‚Äì on stage, and these 11 songs feature the vocals of each of the three in about equal measure.... It's undeniable, however, that Waters was, even at this relatively advanced age, by far the most commanding singer of the trio.\\" In All About Jazz, Doug Collette wrote, \\"Waters, Winter and Cotton share the music as well as the stage ‚Äì a crucial distinction in the dynamics that radiate from \\"How Long Can a Fool Go Wrong\\". There is familiar material here, including \\"Can't Be Satisfied\\" ‚Äì Waters' signature tune and first hit ‚Äì \\"Trouble No More\\", and the rousing (albeit somewhat predictable) encore, \\"Got My Mojo Workin'\\". There's a palpable sense that these songs are not only finding a new audience, but being rediscovered by the musicians, hence the reciprocal excitement builds through the sequencing of tracks.\\" In Vintage Guitar, Dan Forte said, \\"Not a dull moment is to be found, as Muddy reprises his first hit, \\"Can't Be Satisfied\\", and shares vocals with Perkins on \\"Caledonia\\"; Winter serves up the Freddie King slow blues \\"Love Her with a Feeling\\" and J.B. Lenoir's bopping \\"Mama, Talk to Your Daughter\\"; and Cotton fires up \\"Rocket 88\\" and mines the deepest of all shuffles on \\"How Long Can a Fool Go Wrong\\". On Blinded by Sound, Josh Hathaway said, \\"\\"Caledonia\\" is one of the high points on this set and best examples of what Waters' presence means to a song. His performance is vital and magnetic and his interplay with Cotton and Pinetop is priceless!... Blues lovers will ‚Äì and should ‚Äì flock to this disc.

That same year he was elected vice president of RCIU Local 206, and two months later, at the age of 19, he became its full- time secretary treasurer. In 1960, he was appointed international representative for the RCIU, focused on southern Ontario, and in 1969 he returned to Local 206 to become its president. In 1970, the Canadian region of the RCIU was created with Evans elected as the union's first Canadian director. When the RCIU merged with the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North America in 1979 to create the UFCW, Cliff was elected director of region 19, and an international vice president, at the new union's founding convention. As director of region 19, Evans set a new standard for worker organizing in Canada, scaling the region's total membership from 5,000 in 1957 to 65,000 in 1986. Evans also led UFCW through one of the largest union battles in Canadian history, which took place during the 1980s and involved the Canadian Auto Workers raiding more than 25,000 UFCW members in Newfoundland who worked as fisherman. In 1988, regions 18 and 19 of the union merged to create the UFCW Canadian council and a singular national office, and Evans was elected the union's first director representing the entire Canadian membership. Evans served as the UFCW Canadian director until his retirement in 1992. == Awards == Evans was awarded the Order of Ontario in 1996 for his commitment to workers and, in particular, his role in creating the Canadian Commercial Workers Industry Pension Plan, which, since its founding, has become Canada's largest multi-employer pension plan with more than $2.3 billion in assets, 275,000 members, and 180 participating employers. ==References== Category:Members of the Order of Ontario Category:Canadian trade unionists Category:1937 births Category:2018 deaths Category:United Food and Commercial Workers Category:United Food and Commercial Workers people ","title":"Clifford R.

One police officer received minor injuries from the blasts. == Background == Ethnic Rakhine insurgent groups have been fighting the government of Myanmar since the early 1950s. Bombings are not uncommon in Myanmar due to the various ongoing insurgencies in the country, but they have been a rare occurrence in Rakhine State. However, Rakhine State has experienced an increase in guerrilla-style attacks by insurgents since 2016. == Bombings == One of the bombs exploded at around 4:30 am (MMT) in the backyard of a residence belonging to Tin Maung Swe, a state government secretary, whilst the other two went off near a high court and a land record office. The blasts slightly injured a police officer. Authorities suspected that Swe was targeted because of his high position in the local administration. Three unexploded bombs were recovered and defused by authorities afterwards. == Investigation == Seven suspects were arrested by the Myanmar Police Force immediately after the bombing, whilst two others were detained later in the investigation. Naing Soe, a senior leader of the Arakan National Council (ANC) was among those arrested. On 26 March 2018, the police released five of the nine suspects, including Naing Soe, after they failed to find evidence against them within 30 days as police procedure requires. The released suspects were originally charged under Myanmar's counter-terrorism laws, but their release was ordered by the court after the police failed to show evidence linking them to the bombings.

His father died when he was two years old. After his father's death, Brcin was brought up by an uncle who was a carpenter and mason. As a child, Brcin helped him carve simple wooden objects during the winter months. He immigrated to the United States in 1913 to join an older brother who was working at a bank in Gary, Indiana. In 1917, Brcin studied sculpture at Chicago's Art Institute, where he received a fellowship allowing him to pursue his studies for one year in Serbia, France and Italy. He obtained a Bachelor of Fine Arts from The Art Institute of Chicago and a Master of Arts from Ohio State University.https://books.google.ca/books?id=sxXSAVBZxK8C&q;=john+david+brcin&dq;=john+david+brcin&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwi6qMPVnrrmAhXaU80KHSpOCW44ChDoAQhRMAcBrcin became a member of the National Sculpture Society in 1935.

In 1929, Brcin became the official sculptor during the construction of the Joslyn Art Museum in Omaha, Nebraska. He carved the building's pink marble exterior panels, featuring figures of Native Americans and European settlers. He also sculpted the memorial tablet to George Joslyn, various column and pilaster capitals, and the rosette designs of several entrances. According to the Chicago Herald-Examiner, \\"Brcin‚Äôs carvings are a new thing; they are full of dynamic thrust, a smooth sharp-edged symmetry which admirably interprets the spirit of an age governed by machinery.\\"http://artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=11‚à´_new=26441‚à´_modo=2#.WpneKlTwbcc Brcin also designed the museum's \\"Sioux Warrior\\" statue which was only completed in 2009 using his original plaster prototype.

The outdoor sculpture illustrates the career of Henry Horner, the 30th governor of Illinois. Originally erected in Grant Park, the memorial can now be found in Horner Park. In addition to commission work, Brcin was hired in 1922 to teach modeling and drawing at the Minneapolis School of Art.

The season was unique because it was the first time Tyra Banks allowed both men and women to compete against each for the first place. Throughout the show, Hindorff was forced to mature his inner-self to stand against the criticism of fellow male models and especially judge Rob for being too \\"feminine\\" and having a lack of masculine poses for the photoshoots He described it in an interview: \\"I went through an identity crisis that almost completely destroyed me when I was on that show. All of that said, my experience on Top Model was incredible and life changing. It was a very positive thing. I just wish I could've desensitized myself to all of the pressure I was receiving to 'man up' or to ‚Äòact straight.‚Äô\\" Tyra Banks also helped Hindorff get through some tough times during the show: \\"She told me that what I had to offer was polarizing‚Ä¶and that I should use that to my advantage. That advice has served me very well! She was also the one who recommended that I get into event hosting and red carpet hosting! I've made most of the money I've earned in 2015 through hosting at events and on red carpets so she definitely knew what she was talking about! I love her endlessly.\\" After his run on the 20th cycle of ANTM he returned for three cameos on the next season. === After ANTM === He went on to do several modeling jobs, including hosting the 2015 Queer Fashion Show and being on the cover of GPhilly. === Music career === In February 2015, he released his first single \\"I¬¥m Sorry\\" and followed it with \\"Carpe Diem\\" on July that same year.

In other words, it is a stereotype about a stereotype. They have been shown to have adverse effects on individuals that hold them, including on their levels of anxiety in interracial conversations. Meta-stereotypes held by African Americans regarding the stereotypes White Americans have about them have been found to be largely both negative and accurate. People portray meta-stereotypes of their ingroup more positively when talking to a member of an outgroup than to a fellow member of their ingroup. == Ingroup vs. outgroup in meta-stereotyping == The ingroup vs. outgroup phenomenon, originally described by sociology and social psychology, has been closely tied to human stereotyping and meta-stereotyping tendencies. While \\"ingroup\\" is commonly defined as a social group to which an individual belongs, the \\"outgroup\\" is a social group with which the individual does not identify. The criteria for group membership include but are not limited to one's race, culture, nationality, ethnicity, age, gender, religion, and sexual orientation. The tendency to favor one's own social group is called an ingroup bias, and it can be both explicit (conscious and controllable) and implicit (unconscious and instinctual). The realistic conflict theory, social identity theory, and optimal distinctiveness theory aim to explain the ingroup bias and its possible negative impacts on the outgroups. Favoritism of one‚Äôs own group does not always lead to discrimination of and hostility towards outgroups. However, racial prejudice was found to be closely related to the development of social cognition in children around the age of 5 years. Social projection, which is a tendency to attribute one‚Äôs own feelings and attitudes to others, is also important for understanding how the ingroup vs. outgroup phenomenon relates to meta-stereotyping. Humans tend to project and share their own social attitudes to the other members of the ingroup. For example, members of a dominant Australian group who held more negative attitudes toward members of a low status Australian group perceived greater ingroup agreement and support for their attitudes . Social projection is important for understanding of the role of ingroup vs. outgroup in meta-stereotyping. Tajfel (1981) stated that \\"no social group is an island\\", and, therefore, it is likely that members of a particular group are aware of the opinions other groups held about them (e.g. the members of punk subculture may believe that the dominant non-punk culture perceives them as rioters). When an ingroup believes that the outgroup perceives the members of the ingroup negatively, it can reversely increase the negative stereotypes, prejudice, and hostility about the outgroup. For example, a dominant group of White Canadians held negative stereotypes about a lower status group of Aboriginal Canadians when the dominant white group thought that the lower status Aboriginal group held negative feelings towards them. Such behavior is traditionally called \\"outgroup meta-prejudice\\". \\"Ingroup meta-prejudice\\" also exists, and it describes the way the individual members of the ingroup understand the ingroup‚Äôs collective stereotypes about a particular outgroup. For example, individuals belonging to Indonesian Sunni Muslim group held negative stereotypes about the way their own group perceived two outgroups; Ahmadiyya and Christians. Interestingly, research indicates that that ingroup meta-prejudice can mediate the effects of outgroup meta- prejudice on prejudice (i.e. ingroup members‚Äô beliefs about the way the ingroup perceives the outgroup can influence the stereotypes and the meta- stereotypes about the outgroup held by the ingroup). For example, a member of a biker group may believe that his group of bikers thinks that outsiders perceive them as criminals. Such interaction between ingroup and outgroup meta-prejudice can strengthen prejudice and stereotypes in an individual. Furthermore, ingroup members may attempt to modify the perceived stereotype held by the outgroup about the ingroup (i.e. meta-stereotype) to their advantage by confirming the positive traits and disconfirming the negative ones. For example, a group of undergraduate Belgian students (ingroup) were more likely to confirm self-identified meta-stereotypical traits about the Belgian population in front of a French audience (outgroup) when the trait was positive and disconfirm it when it was negative. Such attempts to present the ingroup in a more favorable light was not present when the audience was Belgian (ingroup). Meta-stereotypes can have positive effects on the interaction between the ingroup and outgroup as well. Italian students (ingroup) were found to experience more enjoyment from expected interaction with African immigrants (outgroup) when informed that the outgroup perceives them positively. Members of minority (ingroup) who endorsed a high-dependency meta-stereotype (i.e. belief that the ingroup is dependent on the outgroup) also tend to seek more help from the outgroup, even if help-seeking reversely confirms the dependency meta-stereotype. == Effects of meta-stereotypes on the individual == The holding of certain types of meta-stereotypes has been shown to have adverse effects. For example, people who are exposed to negative meta- stereotypes about their own group tend to have lower identification with their ingroup, and that individuals may avoid seeking needed help if by doing so they may confirm negative stereotype of their group. Other studies have shown that individuals facing meta-stereotypes tend to feel more anxious interacting with members who were not from their own racial group, and that individuals who identified negative meta-stereotypes tended to be angrier and have fewer positive attitudes towards the outgroup. Meta-stereotypes have also been associated with lower anticipated enjoyment in intergroup interactions, higher levels of anxiety in interracial conversations, and negative racial attitudes. Meta-stereotypes have also been linked to negative effects in the workplace. Meta-stereotypes were linked to lower employability beliefs for stigmatized groups. For example, women and minorities in the workplace showed increase self-doubt, lower self-esteem, and undermined attitudes towards their ability to obtain a job. Research has also shown that meta-stereotypes affect older age individuals. Due to meta-stereotypes about age, older workers were found to perceive less work opportunities, which leads to a greater desire to retire. In general, negative meta-stereotyping is associated with more negative individual self-view. Awareness and endorsement of meta-stereotypes have been linked to negative effects on the individual. Research supported that awareness of negative meta-stereotypes was both directly and indirectly linked to poorer health and increased alcohol use. The research revealed that being aware that others held negative stereotypes about an individual‚Äôs race, helped predict negative mental health outcomes, such as depression, anxiety, and hostility. This in turn predicted reduced self-care behaviors and increased the use of drugs and alcohol for coping. Embracing meta-stereotypes have also been linked to negative effects in black women. Black women who endorsed the meta-stereotypes were more susceptible to engage in risky sexual behaviors binge drinking, and marijuana use. == Meta-stereotypes across different populations == === Minorities === When majority members of a population felt that the minority members wanted to seek contact with them, their meta-stereotypes about themselves were more positive and that led to them having more positive attitudes about the minority group. The collectivistic meta-stereotype of Asians may lead them to think that they need to be more of an individual. This self-perceived notion of individuation may lead to tension with their culture and a continuation of their stereotype to relieve this tension. White Americans may hold the meta-stereotype that Black Americans perceive them negatively. The majority of Black Americans surveyed believed that White Americans think Black Americans are more likely to commit violent crimes, are better athletes, are less intelligent, would rather live off welfare than work, have low moral standards, are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol, are always whining about racism, are lazy, have no self- discipline, and are religious. These meta-stereotypes are perceived at a higher rate by Black Americans than the rate at which White Americans actually report believing these stereotypes. Another example of meta-stereotypes can be found between Aboriginal and White Canadians. Aboriginal Canadians perceive White Canadians as egocentric, lacking feeling, prejudice, ambitious, and high status. Conversely, White Canadian‚Äôs meta-stereotype of Aboriginals was perceived as lazy, rebellious, lacking ambition, low status, unscientific in nature, and unsociable. === Age === Younger people hold meta-stereotypes that older people think they are lazy and unmotivated, irresponsible, unreliable, inexperienced and add no value. Older people hold meta-stereotypes that younger people think they are boring, stubborn, and grumpy. These results are not representative of what young people actually think of older people. === Gender === Men and women typically hold meta-stereotypes about the opposite genders. For example, meta-stereotypes held by men about women include women being affectionate, artificial, attentive, attractive, bad-drivers, bitchy, controlling, fearful, feminine, fussy, gentle, giving, gossipy, insecure, intuitive, moody, multitaskers, nagging, organized, sensitive, shy, soft- hearted, sweet, timid, understanding. === Religion === Between non-believers and believers, the meta-stereotype about non-believers is being immoral (low in altruism and honesty) and high in extraversion. Non-believers also tend to exaggerate their differences on the topic of meta-stereotypes. Believers that hold strong ingroup bias feel that non-believers see them as dogmatic and dishonest. ==References== Category:Stereotypes ","title":"Metastereotype"},{"id":"56735093","text":"Tehran soroosh cinema Soroush Cinema (; formerly known as: Moulin Rouge Cinema () is one of the old cinema of Tehran which opened on October 15, 1956.http://jamejamonline.ir/online/671449249970035103http://www.tabnak.ir/fa/news/337051/%D9%81%DB%8C%D9%84%D9%85-%D8%B3%D8%B1%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B4%D8%AA-%D9%85%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%88%D8%AA-%D8%AF%D9%88-%D8%B3%DB%8C%D9%86%D9%85%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D8%A7-%DB%8C%DA%A9-%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%88-%D8%A2%D9%85%D8%B1%DB%8C%DA%A9%D8%A7the first movie showed in this cinema was Trapeze.

In 1945 he was a candidate for Mayor of Boston. He finished in last place with 1% of the vote behind James Michael Curley, John E. Kerrigan, William Arthur Reilly, John J. Sawtelle, and Joseph Lee. In 1952, Feeney became a member of the House Ways and Means Committee. He served as its chairman from 1959 to 1962, when he was removed by speaker John F. Thompson following a dispute between the two over a railroad tax subsidy. Feeney challenged Thompson for speaker in 1963. Governor-elect Endicott Peabody took the unprecedented step of endorsing Feeney over Thompson. After Feeney failed to defeat Thompson on the first ballot, most of his supporters backed Cornelius F. Kiernan as a compromise candidate. Thompson won on the sixth ballot. In 1965, Feeney was a candidate in the special election to succeed the deceased Julius Ansel in the Sixth Suffolk District. He lost the Democratic primary to Samuel Harmon. In 1973, Feeney became \\"Dean of the House\\".

The weekly subscription- based newsletter headquartered at 55 W. 42 Street, New York. Counterattack was available by subscription and on news stands and in stores for one dollar ($1) in New York City. An annual subscription cost $24. Its target subscribers included \\"Security Officers, Personnel Directors, Employment managers and all sorts of people whose business requires them to know the facts about the background of organizations and/or individuals.\\" By 1949, Counterattack had earned some $200,000 in revenue. In 1952, TIME magazine reported: > [Counterattack] never paid salaries of more than $6,000 a year, and it paid > only a few dividends of $1 each on its 1,000 shares of stock. Its special > research jobs for corporations, ad agencies, unions, etc. now account for > about 5% of its income; the rest comes from Counterattack. ===Mission=== Its self-proclaimed \\"principal functions\\" were to: > * Publish the newsletter Counterattack, expose \\"the most important aspects > of Communist activity in America each week * Compile factual information on > Communists, Communist fronts, and other subversive organizations * Assist, > consult with, and provide factual information on Communist activities The Columbia Journalism Review has assessed the mission of Counterattack as follows: > Counterattack had two missions: one, ostensibly journalistic, the other > vigorously interventionist. First, it set out to expose everyone it could > find who had any connection, however dubious or tenuous, to anything or > anyone associated with Communism, Socialism, the Soviet Union, or > progressive ideology. Then, more significantly, Counterattack sought to > rally its subscribers to action against the individuals it targeted. In its > assault on performers and production personnel in radio and television, > Counterattack exhorted its readers to write protest letters to the corporate > sponsors of programs featuring actors with purported links to the left. ===Counterattack staff=== Staff members included: * John G. Keenan: Ex-FBI agent, publisher of Counterattack, and ABC president. * Kenneth M. Bierly: Ex- FBI agent, ABC vice president * Theodore C. Kirkpatrick (AKA \\"Ted Kirkpatrick\\"): Ex-FBI agent, managing editor and chief spokesperson of Counterattack (known as \\"Mr. Counterattack\\") and BAC secretary-treasurer * Francis J. McNamara: In 1948, Francis John McNamara (1915‚Äì2007), WWII Army intelligence officer and UNRRA staffer in China, began serving as researcher. In January 1950, he became editor of Counterattack through May 1954. (In 1954, he moved to Washington, DC, where he led the National Security Program of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW). He joined the House Committee on Un-American Activities [HUAC] as research analyst [1958], director of research [1961], and staff director [1962]. In 1970, joined the Subversive Activities Control Board (SACB) as executive secretary. In 1981, he became executive director of the Nathan Hale Foundation. In 1987, he became as vice-chairman of the Security and Intelligence Foundation through to 1990. His last role was senior fellow at the Center for Intelligence Studies. * Herbert Romerstein: In 1951, Romerstein testified before the Senate Sub-Committee on Internal Security on communist youth organizations and before the Subversive Activities Control Board. He became a research analyst and investigator for American Business Consultants, publishers of the anti-Communist newsletter Counterattack as well as for Bookmailer, which published his first book, Communism and Your Child, in 1962. From 1965 to 1983, Romerstein served as a staff member for the U.S. House of Representatives. During this interval Romerstein worked as investigator for the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), as minority chief investigator for the House Committee on Internal Security, and on the staff of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. ===ABC (publisher)=== Alfred Kohlberg, an American textile importer and an ardent member of the anti-Communist China Lobby, funded the group, registered as American Business Consultants, Inc. (ABC) in 1947, \\"an extremist group of corporate and ex-government personnel.\\" Affiliates of ABC included Lawrence Johnson (owners of a supermarket chain in upstate New York) and Jack Wren (former Naval Intelligence officer at BBDO advertising agency). (Kohlberg was also an original national council member of the John Birch Society. ) Keenan served as ABC president, Bierly as vice president, and Kirkpatrick as secretary-treasurer. ABC offered a service costing $5 to investigate people. Newsletter subscribers (clients) included: Bendix Aviation, Du Pont, General Motors, Metropolitan Life, R.J. Reynolds, and F.W. Woolworth. ==History== J. Edgar Hoover (1959) In 1946, Kirkpatrick and Bierly were implicated in \\"pirating\\" of security informants for Plain Talk magazine and soon thereafter for Counterattack newsletter. Kirkpatrick and Bierly also used FBI information to capitalize upon their FBI association. Together with Keenan, they formed first \\"John Quincy Adams Associates\\" in Washington, DC, and then \\"American Business Consultants, Inc.,\\" in New York City, publisher of Counterattack newsletter. On March 26, 1947, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover appeared before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) to air his views on communism. Hoover said: > The mad march of red fascism is a cause for concern in America. But the > deceit, the trickery, and the lies of the American communists are catching > up with them. Whenever the spotlight of truth is focused upon them the cry, > \\"red baiting.\\" Now that their aims and objectives are being exposed they are > creating a Committee for the Constitutional Rights of Communists, and are > feverishly working to build up what they term a quarter-million-dollar > defense fund to place in ads in papers, to publish pamphlets, to buy radio > time. They know that today it is a fight to the finish and that their backs > will soon be to the wall. > The Communist Party of the United States is a fifth column if there ever was > one. It is far better organized than were the Nazis in occupied countries > prior to their capitulation. They are seeking to weaken America just as they > did in the era of obstruction when they were aligned with Nazis. Their goal > is the overthrow of our government. HUAC's investigations gathered momentum after Hoover's speech ‚Äì and, shortly after that speech, Counterattack launched publishing. ===Political counterattacks=== Progressive Citizens of America members (1947) supported Wallace and Progressive Party. From left are seated, Henry A. Wallace and FDR's son Elliott Roosevelt; standing are Dr. Harlow Shapley andJo Davidson. As early as December 1947, Counterattack had denounced the presidential aspirations of former U.S. Vice President Henry A. Wallace and his Progressive Party. It tracked other political parties that supported the Progressive Party, including the American Labor Party and the National Farmers Union. It also attacked American labor unions, particularly the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (ACW) and their support (CIO) or not (ACW). In late March 1948, Counterattack had started to seek to rally its readers to take action against communists and communist organizations. In May 1948, Counterattack denounced the communist opposition to the Mundt-Nixon Bill. On July 2, 1948, Keenan and Kirkpatrick testified before the Special Subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Labor. Kennan described himself as publisher of Counterattack, ABC president, and Brooklyn resident: he also notice service as FBI agent from 1942 to 1948. Keenan further testified that he was a lawyer and partner in the firm of Alexander and Keenan. Kirkpatrick described himself as managing editor of Counterattack, ABC secretary-treasurer, and Queens resident: he noted service as FBI agent from 1941 to 1945. Kirkpatrick further testified that, after the FBI, he had worked for Macy's and then joined ABC in June 1946. They claimed to have some twelve employees, who included other ex- FBI agents. Among them were Jeremiah Buckley (head of research) and Harry Morgan (former vice president of the American Communications Association-CIO union). They stated circulation at that time ran between 1,400 and 1,500 subscribers. In 1949, Counterattack denounced the Scientific and Cultural Conference for World Peace (July 1949) as a communist-front plot. By 1949-1950, Ed Sullivan was consulting Counterattack's Kirkpatrick for guidance on whom to avoid as a \\"pinko.\\" ===HUAC and Red Channels=== In October 1947, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) began investigating the influence and infiltration of communism in Hollywood, which some regard as a prelude to McCarthyism and others regard as the beginning of the Second Red Scare. A period of blacklisting in the Entertainment industry began with a contempt of Congress charge against the \\"Hollywood Ten.\\" American Business Consultants were part of a larger network, which included HUAC, which researched allegedly Communist-related activities of individuals and organizations. Composed of several former FBI agents, ABC obtained information from the FBI and had access to the files of HUAC. On June 22, 1950, Counterattack published a special issue, Red Channels: The Report of Communist Influence in Radio and Television, with intent to \\"expos[e] the most important aspects of Communist activity in America each week.\\" Red Channels shook the Entertainment industry. Starting in August 1950, Young & Rubicam advertising agency and its radio and television program-sponsoring client General Foods ran into \\"pinko\\" issues over The Aldrich Family and The Goldbergs. In September 1950, Billboard magazine published an expos√© \\"The Inside on 'Counterattack',\\" which promised the \\"full story of paper and operators,\\" an \\"ex-FBI foursome.\\" ===Peak=== In 1951, Bierly left the newsletter. He claimed that Counterattack had \\"changed into an opinion and editorial sheet‚Äîshort on facts and long on opinion.\\" He also admitted that Red Channels had led to \\"lots of people getting kicked around.\\" He set up his own research outfit with Columbia Pictures as an initial client. In 1952, Counterattack seems to have peaked at 7,500 subscribers. By late June 1952, TIME magazine reported, Kirkpatrick, AKA \\"Mr. Counterattack,\\" had left the newsletter for \\"primarily personal reasons.\\" ===Decline=== Left to right: Fredric March with wife Florence Eldridge, Helga Maria zu L√∂wenstein-Wertheim-Freudenberg (born Schuylenburg) with husband Hubertus Prinz zu L√∂wenstein-Wertheim-Freudenberg at the Premiere of Anthony Adverse in Los Angeles (July 29, 1936) In mid-March 1948, actor Fredric March and his wife Florence Eldridge sued Counterattack for defamation and damages of $250,000. Counterattack settled with them out of court‚Äì\\"an expensive lesson\\" in libel. The first publication whose accusation against Counterattack for \\"extortion-style\\" tactics stuck was a weekly newsletter called In Fact in an article dated July 17, 1950. Lawsuits against Counterattack seemed to have stopped its publication by 1954, 1955, or 1958 though the organization (and ABC) seem to have survived until 1968 or even 1973. ==Archives== The right-wing Church League of America obtained research files from American Business Consultants.

As young adults, their paths diverged when Bob moved west to make his fortune and Jimmy stayed in New York. Before they parted, though, Bob and Jimmy made an agreement to meet in twenty years' time at the restaurant where they last saw each other. After twenty years have passed, Bob is waiting for Jimmy at the appointed spot. A policeman on patrol stops to question the loiterer, and Bob tells the patrolman his story. Bob boasts of how well he has fared and tells the policeman that he has no doubt that Jimmy will show up. Later, \\"Jimmy Wells\\" arrives, and as they walk into a lighted area, Bob discovers that this is not the same Jimmy he knew, because twenty years cannot change a man's nose. The man reveals himself to be a plainclothes policeman who arrests Bob, a wanted criminal. Before going to the police station, he gives Bob a letter from Jimmy. Bob reads it and realizes that the policeman he met earlier was in fact Jimmy Wells. In the letter, Jimmy explains that when he arrived at the designated spot and realized that his old friend, Bob, was the criminal that police were on the lookout for, he did not have the heart to arrest him. Instead, he sent a plainclothes officer to do so. ==Media adaptations== * The story was included in a 1987 audiotape collection O.

Escaping Nazi persecution he emigrated in 1936 to Johannesburg, South Africa, where he lived until his death. Between 1911 and 1913 he changed his original surname, Lewy, to Lenck. ==Life== He was born in Berlin on September 2, 1873, son of banker Oscar Lewy and his wife Rosalie, n√©e Samuelson, first cousin of her husband.Young, Rabbi Roderick, Young-Bebro-Siegenberg-Metzenberg Family Tree, Ancestry.com From a young age he was fond of drawing animals at the zoo and illustrating scenes from Greek mythology, with a special interest in the saga of the Argonauts. Dissatisfied with the work in his father's bank he did sketches of clients. Despite his fondness for drawing he began his artistic career with musical studies and became a virtuoso cellist. Having always been interested in sculpture, he then devoted himself to this branch of art at the Royal Academy in Berlin as a disciple of the sculptor Paul Friedrich Meyerheim, simultaneously continuing architecture studies, and then in Paris, where he was influenced by the school of Antoine-Louis Barye and in Brussels with Constantin Meunier. After completing his studies, he made a living painting portraits until he earned a reputation as a sculptor. In 1910, the German government sent his monumental sculpture Jason to the International Railway and Land Transportation Exhibition, one of several held that year in Buenos Aires on the occasion of the centenary of Argentine independence.Voerkel, Stefan (2003). ¬´Wie Jason nach Leipzig kam. Die gr√∂√üte Leipziger Bronzeplastik steht im Zoo¬ª, Sonderheft Zoo der Zukunft.Leipzig: Kulturstiftung Leipzig. p. 37 Still as Walter Lewy the artist traveled from Hamburg, embarking on the steamer K√∂nig Friedrich August on May 21.Hamburg Passenger Lists 1850-1934, Ancestry.com At the International Art Exhibition, held at San Mart√≠n Square, he presented three bronze sculptures. The reason is not known, but by the end of 1913 and perhaps when he moved to Vienna he had already changed his surname, since he appeared as Walter Lenck, cellist, in a December announcement that year of a concert to be held there in January 1914. He would spend fourteen years in Vienna where, without neglecting his sculpture, he developed a wide-ranging musical activity as a cello and viola da gamba instrumentalist, and participated in design contests for public monuments. In 1916 he organized an exhibition of his architectural and sculptural works in a room at the Musikverein, which he personally rented. The contractText of the contract between Wiener Musikverein and Walter Lenck, April 3, 1916, Wiener Musikverein Archiv, Vienna stipulated that the association would receive in payment the amount collected from the sale of tickets, once the installation and administrative expenses incurred by the artist had been covered. The show would open on May 2 and would extend, in principle, for a month; it received favorable reviews. That same year, Lenck was one of the founders of the Collegium Musicum in Vienna, an organization dedicated to rescue and disseminate works of ancient music by German composers, performing frequent concerts in which he played the cello and viola da gamba. In September 1922, Gertrude Richardson Brigham, a correspondent for The Washington Times, met Lenck during a visit to Vienna as part of a tour of European capitals. She was interested in contacting painters and sculptors for an exhibition of modern art planned by the newspaper, to be held the following season in Washington. She describes him in an article published on October 22 that included photos of two works by the artist, written under her pseudonym, Viktor Flambeau: He lived in Berlin until his emigration to South Africa in 1936, where he continued his sculptural work; the catalog of a solo show in Johannesburg in 1945 lists more than a dozen bronzes of animals, his great specialty, and portrait busts, oil paintings and drawings.Catalogue - Exhibition of Sculptures, Paintings and Drawings by Walter Lenck, 9‚Äì10 June 1945, Johannesburg He did not neglect his activity as a musical composer and dramatist, although he had to stop playing the cello for medical reasons. He died in Johannesburg on August 13, 1952, aged 78, and was buried there. ==Work== ===Sculpture=== The monumental Jason and the Bulls of Ae√´tes presents the hero when he has just subdued the two ferocious fire-breathing animals, the first of the tasks called for by Ae√´tes, king of Colchis, when Jason claimed the golden fleece. Exhibited in Buenos Aires in 1910 It was fourteen feet tall without the base and was completed in 1909, at the artist's expense. The German government sent the bronze to Buenos Aires in 1910 and it was installed at the center of the Parque de las Naciones, in the International Railway and Land Transportation Exhibition, one of several held to celebrate the centenary of Argentine independence. According to different sources it received the Grand Prize, something that has not been possible to verify. The local government tried to buy it for 250,000 marks, but the German government did not authorize the sale. Returning home in 1911 and unable to find a buyer for the piece, the artist lent it to Berlin Zoo, where it was installed in front of the Elephant House. During the inflationary crisis of the mid-1920s Lenck, in need of money, offered to sell it to the city of Berlin but although he did not request a high sum negotiations did not prosper. In 1927 the Leipzig merchant Otto Schultz offered 25,000 marks for the work, of which he paid 20,000. Before the operation was finalized he went bankrupt; a group of anonymous donors led by Johannes Ebbing, director of the Leipzig zoo, finally collected the remaining sum and bought the sculpture. The artist supervised the dismantling of the work in Berlin in February 1928. It was erected in Leipzig Zoo the following May, coinciding with the fiftieth anniversary of the park.At Leipzig Zoo, after the restoration Not everyone welcomed the work in its new destination. The painter Max Schwimmer criticized it harshly in a newspaper article entitled \\"Jason the Terrible\\", calling it \\"monumental kitsch\\". In 2015 it was fully restored by the Free State of Saxony at a cost of 33,000 euros and the hero's helmet recovered its original gilding. Small- scale versions appear occasionally at art auctions. Throughout his career he made a large number of animal sculptures in bronze. The three pieces he presented at the Centennial International Art Exhibition in Buenos Aires - Archer, Lion, and Buffalo and Lion, appear in the catalog but with no indication of dimensions. An almost life-size version of the third is installed at Memorial Boulevard, Johannesburg Zoo, South Africa, donated by the artist in 1936.Email from Mr. Jan Du Toit, Registrar, Johannesburg Zoo, December 8, 2017 Two sources mention another monumental bronze, Fighting Mammoths (or Mastodons). One of them says that it was bought by the Berlin City Council in 1929 and installed in that city's zoo. The park was destroyed in the last days of World War II and the current administration has no records or photographs of this work in its archives.Email from Dr. Clemens Maier- Wolthausen, Zoologischer Garten Berlin AG, December 28, 2017 He made portrait busts of personalities of his time such as King Edward VIII, Paul von Hindenburg, the German president Friedrich Ebert, Chief Rabbi Juda L. Landau of South Africa, R. Wolff and H. Tietz, Gustav Marchet, among others, and a statuette of Empress Zita of Bourbon-Parma with her son Otto, the crown prince. A limited edition of an image of the popular Austrian actor and operetta tenor Alexander Girardi, who had died in April 1918, was advertised in a July newspaper; the piece, 65 cm tall and made of polychrome imitation majolica, was priced at 225 crowns. Some years later, the Berlin City Council commissioned a work illustrating the Siegfried cycle, but when Hitler assumed power relations with the sculptor broke down and the work was never carried out. ===Architecture=== Reinhold V√∂lkel: Perspective of the Monument to Peace (Walter Lenck) Lenck designed several monuments, none of which were built, but he presented the plans and models at his 1916 exhibition in Vienna. The Monument to Peace and Alliance stood out; it was conceived to be built on the side of a hill at the border between Bohemia and Saxony, in homage to the unity between Germany and Austria-Hungary. The model appears in photographs published in newspapers, in the poster designed by the architect Otto Polak for the exhibitionA copy is in the collection of the Albertina in Vienna and in a charcoal perspective by Reinhold V√∂lkel. The great central tower of the mausoleum is surrounded by terraces and galleries, decorated with sculptural groups on pilasters, of two of which Lenck exhibited plaster models. In 1915 he designed a memorial to the sinking of the Austro-Hungarian submarine U-12 and its commander, Lieutenant Egon Lerch, to be erected in Vienna. The sinking, witnessed by ships of the Italian navy during the war, took place on August 7, 1915, at the Venice lagoon entrance, apparently when the submarine hit a mine. The design combined the figure of the submarine and the letter U into a plastic unit. Another design was for a Bulgarian Monument, depicting the meeting in Serbia of three riders - one Austrian, one German and one Bulgarian. === Music and Theater=== Numerous reviews of concerts in newspapers of the time highlight his successful professional career in Vienna as a performer of the cello and the then little-known viola da gamba. His works as a composer, in practically all forms but preferring the symphony, were well received in Germany. In 1936 he was working on a dramatic trilogy, Emmanuel, a play with musical interludes. ==References== ===Footnotes=== === Notes === Category:20th-century German sculptors Category:20th-century male artists Category:German classical cellists Category:20th-century German architects Category:German painters Category:Exiles from Nazi Germany Category:1873 births Category:1952 deaths ","title":"Walter Lenck"},{"id":"56735704","text":"Following is a list of presidential candidates by number of votes received.

Jump off Joe rises above the Tri-Cities and is visible throughout much of the region, including in parts of Umatilla and Morrow Counties in Oregon to the south. A gravel road approaches the summit from the south up a steep incline. On a clear day, visitors to the summit can see Mount Hood, Mount Adams and Mount Rainier. Jump off Joe's high elevation compared to the surrounding area makes it an ideal location to place towers for radio and television communications. Among these is an amateur radio repeater that provides coverage to much of the Columbia Basin. Two major local television stations, NBC affiliate KNDU and ABC affiliate KVEW have their towers atop the butte. FM radio stations with transmitters on top of the butte include KUJ-FM and KORD-FM. ==Geology== Jump off Joe and the greater Horse Heaven Hills are anticlines within the Yakima Fold Belt. The belt is a series of fault lines extending throughout south-central Washington which are part of the larger Olympic-Wallowa Lineament. The lineament runs from Port Angeles to the Wallowa Mountains in northeastern Oregon.Field Trip Guide to the Columbia River Basalt Group Retrieved 31 May 2015. Rocks in the area are predominantly basalt, part of the Columbia River Basalt Group. Lava flows believed to have originated from the Yellowstone hotspot approximately 10 to 15 million years ago when the hotspot was located in western Idaho. These lava flows covered large portions of Washington and Oregon all the way to the Pacific Ocean in basalt up to thick.Bishop, Ellen Morris (2003), In Search of Ancient Oregon: A Geological and Natural History, Portland, Oregon: Timber Press, During the last glacial maximum, ice sheets extended into what is today the Idaho panhandle, blocking the flow of the Clark Fork River creating Glacial Lake Missoula. Over a period of 2,000 years the weight of the water behind this ice dam caused it to break sending a surge of water toward the Pacific Ocean. This water would backup at the Horse Heaven Hills, flowing through and deepening Wallula Gap located a few miles southeast.Allen, John Eliot; Burns, Marjorie and Sargent, Sam C. (c. 1986).

The show began airing on July 12, 2015 on Apple Music's radio service, Beats 1. The show covers a variety of topics, such as politics, corporate food history, 1970s rock music, city living, as well as frequently analyzing the latest in contemporary pop music by contrasting it with music released in another era. In addition to Koenig, a variety of guest hosts have appeared over the show's history, including Jonah Hill, Rashida Jones and Jamie Foxx. Since 2017, Koenig is accompanied by co-host, Jake Longstreth, who regularly proclaims his love for the \\"tasteful palette\\" of classic rock, particularly music from The Grateful Dead, Ween and Guided by Voices. The show typically airs every two weeks. In March of 2020, motivated by the increased number of listeners working from home due to the novel coronavirus, Time Crisis began airing on a weekly basis. As of October 6th, 2020, 132 episodes have aired. The show is in its sixth season, as of 2020. ==Format and Segments== The show follows a general format each episode during its two-hour runtime, usually with listener emails and other discussions in the first half of the show and the Top Five on iTunes at the episode's conclusion. ===News Discussions=== The most common segment on the call, in which Koenig and his co-hosts discuss the most relevant and obscure news topics of the week, generally relating to politics or current happenings in the world of entertainment. ===The Time Crisis Mail Bag=== This has been a regular segment since the show's third season. Initially, the segment began after a fan located Jake Longstreth's personal email. The segment now utilizes the email 8minutecapecod@gmail.com a reference to an episode aired in July 2017 where they joked about the prospect of an 8 minute Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa to be played on the next Vampire Weekend tour. Fans generally send in questions regarding 1970s music and suggest artists to the hosts that they believe are \\"tasteful\\" and fit Longstreth's ideal palette. Another popular topic submitted by fans relates to the corporate food history segment of the show. ===Corporate Food History Discussions=== Frequently, Koenig and guests analyse the current landscape of the corporate food industry, as well as looking back on the history of snack foods across the world. In 2016, Jennifer Saenz, chief marketing executive of the Frito-Lay corporation appeared. Additionally, the show has discussed Subway on multiple episodes and their obscure promotions, such as the Five Dollar Footlong deal. In 2018, the show highly criticised the Lady Dorito proposition by hosting a Lady Dorito's Town Hall, featuring Rashida Jones and Longstreth's wife and filmmaker, Hannah Fidell. ===Time Crisis Hotline=== Koenig regularly takes phone calls and has intimate discussions with notable journalists, political commentators, corporate food professionals and celebrities. Notable calls have included Seinfeld theme composer, Jonathan Wolff, Reading Rainbow composer, Steve Horelick and more. ===Jake's Takes=== A recurring segment in which Longstreth recommends or discusses music, with notable recommendations such as The Grateful Dead, Guided by Voices, Ween, Phish, Neil Young, Small Faces and more. Occasionally, Longstreth compiles playlists for Apple Music, notably The Tasteful Palette of Seventies Rock and more recently, Jake's Old Wisdom Playlist.https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/jakes-old-wisdom- playlist/pl.806d80a924c34d8bac0eb41bb18562c2 ===Sweet Chili Heat World Premiere=== A segment in which the crew premiere fan generated music. The music is often inspired by events that take place on previous episodes of the show. ===Top Five on iTunes=== Koenig and Longstreth regularly compare and contrast the iTunes chart from the current week with another music chart from the same week in another year. Notably, the show has regularly jokingly criticized the music of Ed Sheeran, such as his 2017 hit, Shape of You. Koenig and Longstreth commonly refer to the song as Bed Sheets, in reference to one of the song's lines. Fan response to this criticism has been overwhelmingly positive, with one particular fan even compiling the discussions into a complete 32-minute compilation. ===Other Segments=== Other segments have included New York News. ==Cast== ===Core Crisis Crew=== * Ezra Koenig Host * Jake Longstreth Co-host * Jason Richards (a.k.a.

Macosko (1944) is an American chemical engineer and professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science at the University of Minnesota. He is internationally known for his work in polymer science and engineering, especially in the areas of rheology and polymer processing. Macosko is an author of more than 500 academic papers, dozens of patents, and two books including the text: \\"Rheology: Principles, Measurements and Applications\\" (Wiley/VCH, 1994). He served as Director of the Industrial Partnership for Research in Interfacial and Materials Engineering (IPRIME), a university-industry consortium at the University of Minnesota, from 1999 to the present. Macosko and his wife Kathleen have been married since 1967 and are long-time residents of Minneapolis. They have four children and numerous grandchildren. ==Early life and education == Macosko received a B.S. degree in Chemical Engineering in 1966 from Carnegie-Mellon University. He then spent one year at Imperial College, London and obtained an M.S. degree in Chemical Engineering in 1967. Macosko earned his Ph.D. degree in Chemical Engineering in 1970 from Princeton University, where he worked under the supervision of Bryce Maxwell. His thesis work included the design of a new less-compliant rheometer. Macosko and a fellow graduate student, Joe Starita, co-founded the company Rheometrics, whose instruments have significantly advanced the field of rheology. The company is now part of TA Instruments, a world-leading manufacturer of rheological devices. == Research at Minnesota == In 1970, Macosko joined the University of Minnesota and become one of the first assistant professors in the then newly combined Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science. His research on polymers served as a bridge between the two disciplines, and his leadership helped attract other faculty in this area and contributed to the international reputation in polymers at the University of Minnesota. Macosko's research was centered around polymer processing, with special emphasis on the structure-function relation between polymer morphology and the associated rheological, mechanical, electronic, and other physical properties. He made significant contributions toward understanding the rheology of polymer materials, such as the characterization of network formation during gelation, the elasticity of foams, interfacial area generation in reactive blends, and the viscoelastic character of polymer composites. Macosko's research has addressed a broad range of polymer processing operations including reaction injection molding, extrusion, melt blowing, and coating. His current research interests include network polymerization, nanoparticle reinforced polymer composites, interfacial reaction during polymer blending, and polymerization with phase separation. Macosko has taught short courses for many years on rheological measurements that have attracted industrial interest. == Awards, honors, and professional service == , Macosko has graduated over 100 Ph.D. students, and has supervised more than 50 postdoctoral researchers. Many of his students and postdocs have become faculty members at major research universities across the world (e.g., Julio Ottino at Northwestern University). Macosko was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2001 and was awarded the Bingham Medal by the Society of Rheology in 2004. He has also received Charles M. A. Stine Award (now called the Braskem Award) in Materials Engineering and Sciences from American Institute of Chemical Engineers in 1988 at Northwestern University. In addition, Macosko has received numerous awards including the Pall Award for Applied Polymer Research in 1997, the Banbury Award from American Chemical Society in 2006, the International Award from the Society of Polymer Science Japan (SPSJ) in 2008, and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Conference on Advanced Molding Technology and Materials Processing in 2012. == Works == Chris Macosko has authored numerous journal articles describing significant advances in polymer rheology, melt processing, and nanocomposites which includes but is not limited to: *C.W.

At the time of the massacre, it was populated by approximately 130 African-Americans, as well as one Caucasian representative of the Pennsylvania society, Edward Hankinson. According to R. McDowell, a physician visiting Edina at the time of attack, local slave traders decided they did not want to do business so close to a repatriation settlement and had informed the local Bassa chief, King Joe, that they intended to move their business elsewhere. An \\"exasperated\\" King Joe‚Äîwho was equipped with arms provided by American and European slavers‚Äîpledged to drive the settlers out. ==Massacre== On June 10, 1835, Port Cresson was attacked by the forces of King Joe. As the settlers were pacifist Quakers, they lacked arms or any other means with which to defend themselves. Roughly twenty of the Port Cresson settlers were killed outright by King Joe's men, with the remainder managing to flee the bloodshed and escape to the armed settlement of Monrovia, where Hankinson appealed for aid. Meanwhile, King Joe continued on to attack nearby Edina; however, a second indigenous leader, King Bob, intervened to defend the Edina settlement, and Joe was forced to withdraw. ==Aftermath== On learning of the massacre at Port Cresson, Elijah Johnson, a veteran of the War of 1812, assembled a company of 120 armed volunteers and set out on a punitive expedition to engage King Joe. The Monrovia government routed the opposing forces. A peace accord was signed on November 6, 1835.

Although ethnically a Mongol, Sando's aggressive implementation of Beijing ordered reforms, including increased immigration of Han Chinese to the area and a rapid buildup of a sinicized military to fend off growing Russian influence, aggravated Mongols and precipitated moves by Khalkha nobles to declare independence from China in 1911. == Early life == Sando was born in 1876 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, as a member of the White Banner of Mongolia. He studied under the prominent Chinese scholar Yu Yue, and later became a scholar himself. He is also believed to have studied in Japan for a period. At a young age he entered the Manchu civil service and held several high level civil and military offices in Zhejiang, Beijing, and Hohhot. He served as prefect of the Hangzhou government, then was named Director of the Hangzhou Military Academy. In 1902, he moved to Beijing where he became proctor of the Imperial University. In 1907, he became a Counselor on the Board of Civil Administration. In 1908, he was appointed Fu du-tong (ÂâØÈÉΩÁµ±), or Deputy Lieutenant-General in Guihua (present day Hohhot). He would eventually write at least seven volumes of poetry and took a deep interest in the archeology and history of Mongolia. == Amban of Urga == Sando as an Amban in Urga, 1910 Sando was named Amban of Urga (modern day Ulaanbaatar) responsible for Tsetsen Khan and T√ºsheet Khan aimags, on November 26, 1909. Upon his arrival in March 1910, he implemented in rapid succession a spate of \\"New Administration\\" Qing reform policies and projects. He promoted increased immigration of Han Chinese farmers, which he felt was a more effective way to counter expanding Russian influence in the area than simply garrisoning troops, and built up the Qing military capacity by establishing a Military Training Office under the domineering leadership of Army Chief of Staff Colonel Tang Zaili (ÂîêÂú®Á§º) who forcibly recruited Mongolians, including lamas, into the cavalry and local Chinese into the machine gun battalion. To enforce law and order, Sando recruited 100 patrolmen and 44 policemen and levied taxes on gold, timber, carriage and camels to subsidize establishment of effective law courts. He introduced improvements to postal operations between Urga and Beijing, the education system, and to heath and sanitation (for example, he introduced street lights to the capital and created the first public toilets). He dispatched agents to investigate Outer Mongolia's natural resource potential, created the Bureau of Cultivation to exploit agricultural possibilities, especially in the central Tusheet Khan area of the country, and planned construction of a railway between the Urga and Beijing. Local Khalkha Mongols, unsettled by Sando's brutishness and the rapid pace of reforms, viewed these moves as little more than a purposeful colonization of the country. Sando's support suffered further following the Deyiyong Incident in April 1910. When a price dispute between Mongol monks and Chinese carpenters in Urga quickly devolved into a riot, Sando responded harshly, personally leading the armed response at Gandan Monastery, the principal monastery in the city. The protesting lamas pelted him and his troops with stones, forcing them to withdraw. Outraged, Sando demanded that the Mongolian spiritual leader, the Jebstundamba Khutuktu, surrender a particular lama believed to be the ringleader of the incident. The Khutuktu refused and Sando fined him. In response, representatives of the Jebstundamba Khutuktu petitioned the Qing government to remove Sando, but without success. Other incidents followed, all underscoring Sando's diminishing authority. A minor noble, Togtokh Taij, with a small band, had with the connivance of local Mongolian officials plundered several Chinese merchant shops in eastern Mongolia. Two detachments of soldiers sent by Sandoo to capture Togtokh were killed after being lured into a trap. Mongolian princes resisted providing soldiers for Sando's army. And the prince of the khoshuun which Togtokh had raided refused Sando's demand to pay compensation to the plundered Chinese merchants. Sando and his entire administration were eventually despised for their oppressive tactics. Opposition to Sando's administration continued to spread, in particular to Tang Zaili's heavy-handed attempts to tighten military control over Outer Mongolia. Tang's tactics eventually led to his recall after Mongolian leaders and the Russian Ambassador put pressure on Beijing. However, with Qing rule collapsing, Sando found support from Beijing dwindling. Believing that his position was untenable, Sando wired the Beijing government asking for permission to resign, but his request was denied. === Delegation to St. Petersburg === Sando's forcefulness was one factor in the decision of Mongolian nobles, among them Prince T√∂gs-Ochiryn Namnans√ºren, Da Lam Tserenchimed, and Mijiddorjiin Khanddorj, with the blessing of the Jebstundamba Khutuktu, to send a delegation to St. Petersburg in 1911 to seek Russian backing for Mongolian independence from China. In a letter to the Russian government, the Mongolian delegation accused the Qing of aggressive colonization of Outer Mongolia, creating Chinese administrative units, weakening the power of local Mongolian government institutions, and replacing Mongolian garrisons with Chinese troops along the Mongolian-Russian border. They proclaimed their intention declare independence to save their country from the fate of overt colonization by ethnic Chinese as suffered by their Inner Mongolian kinsmen. On learning of the Mongolian mission to Russia, the Qing government instructed Sando to investigate. Sando immediately summoned the head of the Khutukhtu's ecclesiastical administration (Ikh shav‚Äô), the Erdene Shanzav Gonchigjalzangiin Badamdorj, and demanded an explanation. Badamdorj, pleading that he had not been involved, revealed the entire plot to Sando, who then demanded that the Khutuktu withdraw his request for Russian troops. The Khutuktu agreed, provided that Sando dismantle the New Administration. Sando cabled to Beijing for instructions, and was told that parts of the New Administration could be delayed. The moment was ripe for conciliation. Sando chose to bully instead. He ordered the princes in Urga to sign a statement that only a few individuals had been responsible for the appeal to Russia. The princes did give such a declaration, but only orally. Sando then ordered the Mongolians to have no further contact with the Russian consulate, threatening in case of disobedience to bring an additional 500 troops to Urga and to arm the Chinese population in the city. He posted sentries around the Khutuktu's palace with orders to bar Russian visitors. And he sent a contingent of troops to the Russian-Mongolian border to intercept the Mongolian delegation to Russia on its return. === Mongolian independence === In the meantime, the Mongolian delegation to Russia secretly returned, and reported the results of its trip to a group of princes and lamas. They composed a joint memorial to the Khutukhtu asking what Mongolia should do in lieu of the provincial uprisings. He advised that Mongolians form a state of their own. On December 1, 1911, a delegation of nobles and lamas visited Sando's office, and informed him of their decision to declare independence and to install the Khutuktu as emperor. Sando pleaded with the delegation. He admitted that what had come to pass was the result of his own folly, and he promised to recommend full autonomy for Mongolia, but not independence. The delegation curtly replied that it had come simply to deliver a message, not to debate it. Sando was ordered to leave the country within 24 hours. There was little Sando could do. He had only 150 troops, who in any event were in an unruly mood because of arrears in back pay. On the following day, his soldiers were disarmed by Mongolian militiamen, as well as Russian Cossacks of the consular convoy under command of Grigory Semyonov, future Ataman. Sando and his staff moved into the Russian consulate compound for their own safety and then were escorted to the Russian border by Cossacks on December 5. == After Mongolia == From there, Sando travelled to Mukden in Manchuria, where he received a telegram expressing the emperor's astonishment over Sando's inability to control the Mongols. The Amban was removed from office, and he was ordered to await an inquiry into his conduct. The fall of the Qing dynasty in February 1912 saved him from further embarrassment, or worse. Sando continued his public career in the newly established Republic of China. In October 1912 he was appointed Deputy Lieutenant-General in Mukden , and the following month he was concurrently named Deputy Lieutenant-General of Jinzhou. In September 1920, with the support of Zhang Zuolin he became the director of the Beijing Bureau of Emigration and Labor. In December 1921 he became Chief of the Bureau of Civil Appointments in the cabinet office. In June 1922 he was named Associate Director of the Famine Relief Bureau, and in October of the same year he was named head of the College of Marshals. Information about the last years of life Sando's life are vague, however it is believed he died in 1941. == References == Category:1876 births Category:1941 deaths Category:Politicians from Hangzhou Category:Republic of China politicians from Zhejiang Category:Qing dynasty politicians from Zhejiang Category:People of Manchukuo Category:Republic of China people born during Qing ","title":"Sando (official)"},{"id":"56736754","text":"Gender preference may refer to: *Sex selection, the attempt to influence the sex of the offspring *Gender identity, personal identification of gender ","title":"Gender preference"},{"id":"56736773","text":"Faygoluvers is a website originally dedicated to horrorcore music, and eventually included underground music as a whole. It was founded in 1999 initially to cover news relating to Insane Clown Posse and other similar artists. Over time, the website evolved to include the underground music community as a whole. They provide news articles, album reviews, music videos, free songs, filmed concerts, new interviews, upcoming events, and more. There is also featured content, such as the annual FLH Music Awards, the Unreleased Underground music archive, an Underground Spotlight section, a weekly podcast, and various other editorials. ==History== Faygoluvers was originally created by Ricky Winowiecki, a fan known as Faygoluver. It was initially created to follow the latest from the horrorcore rap duo Insane Clown Posse, and other associated acts from their record label Psychopathic Records, such as Twiztid, Blaze Ya Dead Homie, Myzery, Psychopathic Rydas, and the then-upcoming supergroup Dark Lotus. Although originally containing only news articles, the site evolved to include more content, such as album reviews and free music. Over time, ownership of the website was switched over to another prominent figure known as ScottieD. Also, due to the increasing popularity of horrorcore music as a whole, more artists than just Insane Clown Posse started to be covered. This ranged from Tech N9ne of Strange Music, Kottonmouth Kings of Suburban Noize, and more. Although rap/hip-hop was still the main focus, other genres started to be covered as well, mainly rock/heavy metal. Due to many other websites offering news postings, Faygoluvers eventually started to include original content; thus, an entire archive of interviews, videos, reviews, songs, and more started to compile together. The website also has its hand in other ventures as well. The Faygoluvers Mixtapes was a continuous project released exclusively on the website using its namesake as a record label. The annual DCG Con includes a tsuro tournament hosted by Faygoluvers itself. Faygoluvers also provides hourly coverage at the Gathering of the Juggalos, and have made prominent appearances at other public events.

A stylistic trend was formed incorporating different varieties of European architecture, and eclectic environments had begun to be flavored with modernity. The first period of architectural development in Baku was about to end; in the new socio-economic conditions, the national-romantic direction opened itself to revival. Agabala Guliyev was one of the monarchs of Baku who often traveled to Western Europe. He decided to build a house in the traditions of local architecture. He owned several properties in the Icheri Sheher. He was against the European style used in urban buildings, so he hired Skibinsky and ordered him to employ the Shirvanshah's Palace, Middle East and Arabic architecture. As the Shirvanshahs Palace was nearby, Skibinsky acquired photographs of Middle Eastern architecture. This architecture had attracted the attention of European and especially German scholars; albums, trials and other iconographic material were accessible to Skibinski.Union of Architects of Azerbaijan.Nobel Brothers and Azerbaijani competition.

Folci began his ecclesial studies after he turned ten and was called to serve as a chaplain to Italian soldiers on the frontlines during the course of World War I until his capture and release. His main priorities as a priest included tending to the ill and poor and also focused on the education of children while seeking to establish a religious congregation that would continue that work. Folci's beatification process launched in 2003 and he became titled as a Servant of God as the investigation was opened in his native Como. The investigation culminated on 30 September 2015 after Pope Francis confirmed his life of heroic virtue and named him as Venerable. ==Life== ===Education and priesthood=== Giovanni Folci was born in Como on 24 February 1890 as one of four children to the devout Carlo Folci and Teresa Sonzini. His father was a store manager and also owned a tavern adjoining the store. He was baptized on 27 February in the San Michele parish church. His two brothers were Giuseppe and Giacomo and his sister was Carolina. Folci began to serve as an altar server in 1897 and in the summer months lived with his maternal grandmother in Malnate where he also got to know his uncle (now a Servant of God) Carlo Sonzini who was a seminarian in Milan. The relationship he forged with his uncle fostered within Folci the call to enter the priesthood. His uncle soon suggested to his parents that he be sent to Vendrogno to complete his studies where his academic results were so good that he was permitted to skip the fifth grade. In summer 1901 he attended the ordination of his uncle and sometime after that towards summer's end arrived in Como to commence his own studies for the priesthood. But in 1904 he suffered from lung disease and was sent to Valduce to be treated. He returned to his studies once he recovered and passed his examinations in 1909. He was made a deacon on 6 January 1913. Folci was ordained to the priesthood in Como on 13 July 1913 and he celebrated his first Mass on 14 July in the Santuario del Crocifisso in Como with his uncle at his side. On 20 July he celebrated Mass in his parish of origin in his hometown. In August 1913 the Bishop of Como appointed him as the parish priest for Valle di Colorina and sent him there instead of to upper Valmalenco as was predicted for him. He arrived with his mother for the first time in Valle di Colorina on 23 August with the stationmaster welcoming him at the station. ===Chaplain and imprisonment=== But the outbreak of World War I in Europe saw him summoned to the frontlines that August as a chaplain in which he was later decorated for his actions. He was appointed as a chaplain for the soldiers at the end of September and served in that role until May 1916 when he was permitted a period of rest; he resumed his activities in October. Folci and several others were later taken as prisoners in November 1917 following the defeat of Caporetto and then interned in concentration camps across German regions until 1919 once the Red Cross arrived to oversee prisoner release following the war's end. It was during his time in prison that he tended to his fellow prisoners. He was first held in detention in Rastatt in Baden- W√ºrttemberg and received permission to celebrate Mass for himself and his fellow prisoners. In September 1918 he was sent to a hospital near Limburg to tend to German soldiers and decided upon the armistice in 1918 not to leave the hospital. He left just over a month later in January 1919 and passed through Rome where he met with Pope Benedict XV who encouraged his idea to erect a monument to the fallen and victimized of the war. ===Projects=== Upon his return to his parish in July 1919 he had the desire to commemorate the imprisoned and the fallen which his parishioners supported. To that end he decided to erect the Santuario del Prigioniero dedicated to the Blessed Sacrament in his parish to honor those fallen; this project was completed and was consecrated on 27 September 1925. In December 1925 he rested following a period of exhaustion. He later founded - next to that place - his religious congregation known as the Sisters Handmaids of Jesus Crucified on 29 November 1926 alongside several religious and priests. This order took several forms during his lifetime. In 1919 he founded a center for the education of children and at a later stage founded the Et in Terra Pax home for retreats for priests and others. He later bought at Santa Caterina di Valfurva an old hotel which he converted into a Casa Alpina for pre-seminarians and another at Villa di Santa Croce in Como which also acted as a retirement home for older priests. In 1950 he opened a home for the Spiritual Exercises and the Casa Ges√π for the care of ill priests in Loano. It was also in 1950 that he travelled to Rome to celebrate the proclamation of the dogma of the Assumption of the Mother of God. Folci was successful in 1956 with the establishment of the San Pio X Pre- Seminario within the Vatican state which received approval from Pope Pius XII and was a venture that Monsignor Domenico Tardini also supported. Federico Tedeschini - the archpriest for the Vatican - also agreed with Folci's proposal. He and the students of the San Pio X Pre-Seminario met with Pius XII in Castel Gandolfo on 2 October 1952. He was present on 5 February 1957 at the bedside of his uncle (who was made a Monsignor in 1942) who died not long after Folci arrived. On 23 February 1960 he was appointed as the rector for the Santuario della Madonna del Soccorso in Ossuccio and was hospitalized in Milan in 1960 after suffering heart problems while in Albenga. ===Death=== On 30 March 1963 he returned from Loano to his parish after having passed through Como. He was found dead on the floor in his room on 31 March after the religious of his order waited for his presence to celebrate Mass. Folci's remains are interred (since October 1963) in the Santuario di Valle di Colorina in the main chapel beneath the main altar. His resting place is marked with a bronze monument that depicts a priest rendering assistance to a soldier. ==Beatification process== The beatification process launched on 7 July 2003 under Pope John Paul II and he was titled as a Servant of God after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints published the \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections) decree that would allow for the cause's launch. The Bishop of Como inaugurated the diocesan investigation for the cause on 15 September 2004 and closed it in Como on 19 November 2005; the C.C.S. validated this process in Rome on 24 February 2007. The postulation then drafted and compiled the Positio dossier that collated witness testimonies and gathered documentation accumulated from the diocesan process; this dossier was submitted to the C.C.S. on 16 February 2013. The dossier received approval from theologians on 3 June 2014 and from the C.C.S. members on 22 September 2015.

He was a member of the Lw√≥w School of Mathematics and a victim of the Holocaust. J√≥zef Schreier was born on 18 February 1909 in Drohobycz. His father was a rabbi and doctor of philosophy. His cousin was the musician Alfred Schreyer. From 1927-31 he studied at the Jan Kazimierz University in Lw√≥w. In his first published paper, he defined what later came to be known as Schreier sets in order to show that not all Banach spaces possess the weak Banach-Saks property, disproving a conjecture of Stefan Banach and Stanis≈Çaw Saks. Schreier sets were later discovered independently by researchers in Ramsey theory. Schreier completed his master's degree On tournament elimination systems in 1932 under the direction of Hugo Steinhaus. Schreier correctly conjectured that to determine the second largest number in an unordered list requires at least n + \\\\lceil \\\\log_2 n \\\\rceil -2 comparisons.On tournament elimination systems, J. Schreier - Mathesis Polska, 1932 In 1934, he completed his doctorate, On finite base in topological groups under Banach.O sko≈Ñczonej bazie w grupach topologicznych In 1932 he married Zofia Rosenblatt. Schreier often played blindfold chess. He was a friend of Stanis≈Çaw Ulam and co- authored eight papers with him. They were the only two undergraduates who attended the meetings at the Scottish Caf√© in Lw√≥w. (Schreier contributed ten questions to the Scottish Book.) Together they proved the Baire‚ÄìSchreier‚ÄìUlam theorem and Schreier‚ÄìUlam theorem. According to Ulam, With the outbreak of World War II, Eastern Poland including Drohobycz was occupied by the USSR in accordance with the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. After Operation Barbarossa, this territory was invaded by Nazi Germany. The Jews of Drohobycz were confined to the Drohobycz Ghetto. In April 1943, the Germans discovered - or were informed of - an underground bunker in which Schreier was hiding with other Jews. It took three days for them to force their way in. Schreier committed suicide by cyanide rather than be captured. Of a prewar Jewish population of 10,000 in Drohobycz, approximately 400 survived the war. Schreier's wife was one of them and later moved to Israel, where she remarried. ==Publications== * ==References== * Category:1909 births Category:1943 deaths Category:People from Drohobych Category:Jews from Galicia (Eastern Europe) Category:20th- century mathematicians Category:Polish mathematicians Category:Polish Jews who died in the Holocaust ","title":"J√≥zef Schreier"},{"id":"56737180","text":"Laura Bueno Fer≈Ñandez (born 25 May 1993) is a Spanish sprinter specialising in the 400 metres.

She was a self taught artist, with no academic training in art. Inspired by her brothers, Abanindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, and Samarendranath Tagore, she started painting only at the age of 30. She was married at the age of 12 to the grandson of Raja Ram Mohan Roy. == Early life == Sunayani Devi was born on 18 June 1875 in the historically influential Tagore family in Calcutta to Gunendranath Thakur and Soudamini Devi. She was married at the age of 12 to Rajanimohan Chattopadhyaya. She never had formal training in art other than the art and music lessons as feminine accomplishments, as Partha Mitter cites in his book, \\"The Triumph of Modernism: India's Artists and the Avant-garde, 1922‚Äì1947\\" == Painting style and themes == Known to be a true primitive of the Bengal Art School, she drew inspiration from the folk Pata painting style which was familiar to the women of the Tagore household. Often depicting scenes from Indian epics and mythologies in her works. Some of her notable works are Sadhika, Ardhanarisvar, Satir Dehatyag, Milk Maids, Yashoda and Krishna among others. According to Stella Kramrisch, she was the first modern painter in India. Her works were exhibited in 1922 as part of the Bauhaus artists exhibition in Calcutta. Since the beginning her artworks have been original and bold. They resemble the ancient Jain manuscript paintings. She applied wash technique to its fullest and later her woks echoed the native imagery like village clay dolls that would be used as ornamentation. Her works are an amalgamation of modernist dialogue of primitive simplicity and a larger national discourse of being rooted in its cultural identity. Thus carving her image as a nationalist artist. Critical analyses of her portraits, have led her to be addressed as a na√Øve painter, who used folk themes with allure and sensitivity. == Exhibitions == Some of the exhibitions of Sunayani Devi's paintings are: # 1908, 10, 12 Exhb., Indian Society of Oriental Art, Calcutta. # 1911 United Provinces Exhb. organised by Indian Society of Oriental Art, Allahabad. # 1911 Festival of Empire, organised by Indian Society of Oriental Art for George Vs Coronation Crystal Palace, London. # 1924 Travelling exhb. organised by Indian Society of Oriental Art and American Federation of Art, USA. # 2004 Manifestations II, organised by Delhi Art Gallery, Jehangir Art Gallery, Mumbai and Delhi Art Gallery, New Delhi. # 2011 Summer Oasis, organised by Chitrakoot Art Gallery, Kolkata == Museums == Sunayani Devi's paintings are part of the collection of many prestigious Museums.

As the first female editorial cartoonist in France, she is noted for pioneering women's involvement in comic books. == Biography == Chantal Montellier studied at the √âcole Sup√©rieure d'Art et Design Saint-√âtienne from 1962 to 1969. From 1969 to 1973, she was a professor of visual arts in colleges and high schools. From 1989 to 1993, she taught courses at Paris 8 University. Starting in 1972, she worked as an editorial cartoonist for Combat syndicaliste, Politis, Maintenant, L'Humanit√©, L'Autre Journal, Marianne, France nouvelle, and R√©volution, among others, at a time when she was the only woman exercising her talents in the male-dominated field of work. As a comics creator, she contributed notably at Charlie Mensuel, M√©tal Hurlant, ', (√Ä suivre), and Psikopat. Her realistic drawing, often in black and white early on, recalls that of Jacques Tardi, Jos√© Mu√±oz, or even Guido Crepax. She integrated many \\"modernist\\" graphic experiments (like ) before settling on her own profoundly original aesthetic. Montellier began publishing comic strips such as Andy Gang in Charlie Mensuel in 1974 and in the French feminist comics magazine Ah! Nana in 1976. Her dystopian strip 1996, originally appearing in M√©tal Hurlant, was reprinted in Heavy Metal in the United States in the late 1970s, bringing her work to the notice of Anglophone readers. Chantal Montellier is one of the rare comic strip creators to have affirmed (and continues to affirm) her political and feminist engagement. For example, in Les Damn√©s de Nanterre, an investigative comic strip about Florence Rey, she takes apart the official version of the shootout at the Place de la Nation, which set the police against an anarchist group. She came to suffer consequences for it: when she was first invited to Lausanne, for the 2007 , her appearance was canceled on the pretext that her presence might bother the other authors there. Among her projects is her personal web site where, since 2007, her autobiographical account De l'art et des cochons (Of Art and Pigs) prominently features her comics universe (its actresses and actors, publishers, etc.) and an album of comics that she describes, inside quotation marks, as \\"erotic.\\" In 2007 she co-founded, with Jeanne Puchol, the , named for Artemisia Gentileschi, a prize annually awarded to comics created by one or more women. In 2017, she brought out a new, completely revised edition of Shelter Market published by Les Impressions Nouvelles and a novel inspired by her own life, Les vies et les morts de Cl√©o Stirner, in the literature collection of √âditions Goater. ==Political engagement== In 2012, Montellier supported Jean-Luc M√©lenchon, the Left Party candidate in the presidential election. ==Publications== ===Comic strips and graphic novels=== * 1996, Les Humano√Ødes Associ√©s, 1978 * Les R√™ves du fou, Futuropolis, 1978 * Blues, Kesselring, 1979 * Andy Gang : # Andy Gang, Les Humano√Ødes Associ√©s, 1979 # Andy Gang et le tueur de la Marne, Les Humano√Ødes Associ√©s, 1980 # Joyeux No√´l pour Andy Gang, Les Humano√Ødes Associ√©s, 1980 * Shelter, Les Humano√Ødes Associ√©s, 1980 * Lectures, Les Humano√Ødes Associ√©s, 1981 * Le Sang de la commune, Futuropolis, 1982 * Wonder city, Les Humano√Ødes Associ√©s, 1982 * La Toilette, storyline by Pierre Charras, Futuropolis, 1983 * Odile et les crocodiles, Les Humano√Ødes Associ√©s, 1983; reprint retouched by Acte Sud/L'An II in 2008 * L'esclavage c'est la libert√©, Les Humano√Ødes Associ√©s, 1984 * Rupture, Les Humano√Ødes Associ√©s, 1985 * Un deuil blanc, Futuropolis, 1987 * Julie Bristol : # La Fosse aux serpents, Casterman, 1990 # Faux sanglant, Dargaud, 1992 # L'√éle aux d√©mons, Dargaud, 1994 * Voyages au bout de la crise, Dargaud, 1995 * Sa majest√© la mouche, in Noire est la terre, collective, Autrement, 1996 * La Femme aux loups, Z'√©ditions, 1998 * Paris sur sang, Myst√®re au P√®re Lachaise, Dargaud, 1998 * Social Fiction, Vertige Graphic, 2003, compilation of the albums 1996, Wonder City, and Shelter; foreword by Jean-Pierre Dionnet * Les Damn√©s de Nanterre, Deno√´l Graphic, 2005 * Sorci√®res mes s≈ìurs, La Bo√Æte √† bulles, 2006 * Tchernobyl mon amour, Actes Sud, 2006 * The Trial, after Kafka, storyline by David Zane Mairowitz, Actes Sud, 2009 * L'Inscription, Actes Sud, 2011 * Shelter Market, new enlarged version of the album Shelter originally published in 1980, Les Impressions Nouvelles, 2017 ===Editorial cartooning=== * Impressions sur \\"Betty\\" dans la \\"Force des sentiments\\", L'Autre Journal, March 26 to April 2, 1986 * Sous pression, Pop'com/Graphein, 2001 ===Novels=== * Voyages au bout de la crise, Dargaud, 1995, illustrated novel * La Dingue aux marrons, Baleine, 1997 (Le Poulpe) * TGV, conversations ferroviaires, stories, Les Impressions Nouvelles, 2005 * Les Vies et les morts de Cl√©o Stirner, novel, √âditions Goater, 2017 ==See also== * Franco-Belgian comics * Women comics creators ==References== ==Bibliography== * Patrick Gaumer, \\"Montellier, Chantal\\", in Dictionnaire mondial de la BD (Paris: Larousse, 2010) , p. 606‚Äì607. * Yves Lacroix (ed.), I am a camera: Chantal Montellier, auteur de bandes dessin√©es, CASB, 1993. ==External links== * Official site Category:French comics artists Category:French female comics artists Category:Female comics writers Category:French comics writers Category:French feminist writers Category:French women novelists Category:Feminist artists Category:French editorial cartoonists Category:French women cartoonists Category:Art educators Category:People from Loire (department) Category:1947 births Category:Living people ","title":"Chantal Montellier"},{"id":"56737211","text":"Pauer is a surname. people with the name include: *Ernst Pauer (1826‚Äì1905), Austrian pianist, composer and educator *Fritz Pauer (1943‚Äì2012), Austrian jazz pianist, composer and bandleader *G√©za Pauer (born 1976), Hungarian sprinter *Ji≈ô√≠ Pauer (1919‚Äì2007), Czech composer *Maria Pauer (1734/36‚Äì1750), Austrian witch ==See also== *Paur ","title":"Pauer"},{"id":"56737217","text":"Talajiƒá is a Serbo-Croatian surname.

Born in West Bengal in 1971. == Early life & education== Sen was born in 1971 in West Bengal and obtained Bachelor's and Master's degrees in painting from Kala Bhavan at Visva-Bharati University in Santiniketan, West Bengal. Later, she completed a post-graduate program (visiting) at the Glasgow School of Art in the United Kingdom on the Charles Wallace India Trust Award for 2000‚Äì2001. Sen's Bengali poetry has been published in collected volumes, as well as in magazines and journals since she was a young adult. == Work== Sen‚Äôs conceptual practice with a varied set of surfaces, materials, and processes that emerge in the wake of her regular negotiations with her milieu. Her work often deals with the complexities of the body in its physical, basal, erotic and sexless forms. A lot of her works deal with the self as a matrix of identities and myths ‚Äì questioning societal norms, fixed beliefs, and categorisations. Sen's material art work, which she calls ‚Äúbyproducts‚Äù of her larger process, contrast scale, imagery and genre to problematize existing notions of hospitality, sexuality, communication, and contract. Known for her often erotically and emotionally charged imagery, Sen‚Äôs work blurs the line between distance and intimacy, often explored through what she calls ‚Äúradical hospitality‚Äù. Using the virtual and the real forms of social relation and individual experience, both spontaneous and premeditated, Sen creates work fundamentally as a performer. Many of her performance-based works challenge the notion of language as a proprietary means of communication, attempting to outsmart linguistic hegemonies and codes of propriety by creating an abstract body of gibberish text she calls ‚Äúnon- language‚Äù. Non-language, whose use creates moments of what Sen calls ‚Äúlingual anarchy‚Äù employs glitch, noise, sonic affect in its spontaneous creation. Before turning to the aporias of non-communicative language, Sen was a practicing poet in Bengali.

Hamichlol aspires to be \\"the largest Jewish encyclopedia in history, which includes articles on all issues pertaining to the Torah, Jewish values and the history of the Jewish people, but also knowledge pertaining to mankind and from all the secular\\" ( [transliteration: hulin]) \\"fields-written in clean language according to the Jewish worldview.\\" ==History and description== Originally, the site of the site imported the entire Hebrew Wikipedia and re-edited or deleted the content which they considered not proper for the Torah-observant public, and specifically the ultra-Orthodox readers. The content is imported from the Hebrew Wikipedia in accordance with Wikipedia's free license, which enables editors to perform such a \\"split\\". It is easy to find information which was omitted by comparing specific articles on the site with the parallel articles at the Hebrew Wikipedia. Examples include: * In the Biology article, initially copied entirely from the Hebrew Wikipedia and then re-edited, the \\"Evolution\\" () section was re-named to \\"The Order of the Creation of Creatures\\" () and the content of this section was changed so that instead of saying that all organisms on the Earth have descended from a common ancestor, it was changed to say that all forms of life were created in the Six Days of Genesis. * In the Beit Zeit article, initially copied entirely from the Hebrew Wikipedia and then re-edited, the mentioning of the \\"Dinosaur Footprints\\" site in Israel was omitted, because it is a site which contains a layer of ancient rock that contains some 200 traces of dinosaur tracks from tens of millions of years ago. Other articles and references on the site which present dates or periods that contradict the age of the world according to the Torah also are removed from all the imported articles. * In the article about The Holocaust, copied from the Hebrew Wikipedia and then re-edited, the mentioning in the introduction that homosexuals were also murdered by Nazi Germany in World War II was completely removed. Other articles and references on the site to homosexuality or homosexuals are removed from all imported articles. * Because many Haredi avoid pictures of women, in articles about prominent historical female figures the portraits of the women are replaced with pictures of their graves. Furthermore, pictures that include women, including historical pictures or group photos showing of men and women (for example, a photo of the thirty-fourth government of Israel's cabinet) are photoshopped to remove women. The owners of the website state that in the instances in which imported articles from Wikipedia contain content deemed problematic, the editorial team of the website will gradually review the articles to determine whether the content is appropriate: problematic articles which also contain proper content will be rewritten, while the articles with totally inappropriate content will eventually be permanently deleted. As of August 25, 2018, some of the articles that are most sought-after at the Hebrew Wikipedia but are temporarily blocked awaiting review include: YouTube, Gal Gadot, Ten Commandments, Eyal Golan, Harry Potter, Ofra Haza, Sigmund Freud, Christianity, Independence Day (Israel), Judaism, New Testament, Sports, Racism, Academy Awards, Human evolution, Woman, Status quo (Israel), Age of Enlightenment, Breast cancer, Tower of Babel, Muslims, The Simpsons, Apocalypse, Hell, Table tennis, Homo, Platonic love, Sport in Israel, Bourekas films, Handball, Race (human categorization), Jewish and democratic state, Maccabiah Games, Catholic Church, Satire, Paganism, Samaritanism. == Copyrights == All content on the site which was originally imported from Wikipedia is provided under the free license CC-BY-SA.

Wielhorski was neither a professional virtuoso, nor a professional composer. He highly esteemed Mozart's music. According to Polish musician Jan Kleczy≈Ñski, his own compositions, though being mostly bagatelles, valses and mazurkas, bear little reminiscences to those of Chopin. Another of his favorite genres was march. His compositions did not gain success even during his life, and he was not interested in this. Kleczy≈Ñski explained such a failure through their relative difficulty: Wielhorski asks for much larger hands than was typical in salon music.

She is currently the Coordinator of Vasl Artists‚Äô Collective in Karachi, and is also an Associate Professor (Bachelor of Fine Art Faculty) at the Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture]http://www.indusvalley.edu.pk/web/undergraduate/bachelor-of-fine- art/ - She lives and works in Karachi, Pakistan, and is known for the social and political commentary underlying her sculptures, which are created out of mundane, everyday objects. == Early life & education == Adeela was born in Karachi, Pakistan in 1970. She first did an MA in International Relations from the University of Karachi in 1995, following which she switched her focus to art, completing her BFA in Sculpture from the Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture in Karachi, Pakistan in 1999. == Career == Adeela Suleman's work takes found domestic objects and materials from everyday life and transforming them into sculptures. \\"The everyday object, through its multiplication and assembly, becomes the delegate of a new, stimulating inner vision,\\" she said. Her art has consistently reflected an engagement with contemporary socio- political concerns, primarily gender in Pakistani society, an engagement that has continued from her earlier university days. Her early work displayed the transformation of found objects into art. A theme running through her earlier work is the restrictions that women face in the private sphere. She created helmets, body armour and corsets made out of kitchen utensils and other functional tools, to show the entrapment that the private sphere imposes upon women in Pakistani society. Her more recent work has moved towards flatter silhouettes, creating tableaux on steel sheets, where pastoral scenes are rendered in the filigree tradition of Islamic art on the hard steel surface. These pastoral images are juxtaposed with symbols of destruction like weapons, the contradiction in these images signifying the indifference of society to the violence present within it. Suleman's work displays recurring motifs of organic elements like flowers and birds. === Exhibitions === Adeela Suleman's work has been exhibited both in group and solo exhibitions internationally.

Srimati (1926 - 2007) 20th century artist, born in Mysore, India, was an artist and musician. From a very young age, she was trained in Indian classical music, dance and painting . Y.G. Srimati became a highly accomplished vocalist and performer of Carnatic music and became a participant of the Indian Independence Movement from Chennai. She was deeply influenced by Mahatma Gandhi and at rallies addressed by him she would perform devotional songs in various Indian languages. She dedicated her art work to nationalist themes, often painting figures from Hindu mythology, her style being influenced by Nandalal Bose and the frescoes of the Ajanta Caves. Her talent was recognized and in 1952 during her first solo exhibition == Personal life == Born in 1926 in Mysore in Karnataka, Srimati grew up in coastal Chennai in a Tamil Brahmin family. Her older brother, Y.G. Doraisami, mentored her in classical dance, singing, instrumental music and painting. Her grandfather was the chief astrologer in the court of the Maharaja of Mysore. The family initials of 'Y.G.' was an honorific title granted by the Maharaja. Her grandfather died when her father was a year old and her family's land was seized. Her father was married off at the age of six and was disinherited. Following which he dedicated himself to the education of his children. Srimati danced as a child and her first solo performance happened when she was seven. She started to paint when she was in her early teens. Her brother was an art collector and he sponsored various artists. In 1963, she got a scholarship to the Art Students League of New York, where she met fellow artist, Michael Pellettieri. They later became partners and he even went to contribute some of the paintings made by her to Metropolitan Museum of Art after she died. Vina (‡§µ‡•Ä‡§£‡§æ) MET midp2009.531 det7 == Career == Y.G Srimati‚Äôs career started when she received training in four traditional South Indian arts, voice, music, dance and painting. She became devoted towards these arts. She kept her lifelong friendship with Carnatic vocalist M.S. Subbulakshmi. She got the opportunity to go on a tour in India, United States and in the United Kingdom with the classical dancer Ram Gopal. == Influences & Style == The theme of Y.G. Srimati's paintings is based on devotion. She did not date or sign her work. Most of Srimati's work was inspired from mythology and religion. She pursued her musical career even after shifting to New York. And the exhibition also includes one of her Tamburas which was the vestige of her musical career. Srimati was intrigued by Indian religious epic literature and visions of rural culture. She had this nationalist sentiment which was the subject matter of the conscious expression. The Met Collection featured 25 watercoloured paintings which expressed musical instruments, archival photographs and performance recordings. The art critic Holland Cotter said : \\"Ms. Srimati‚Äôs choreographic take on naturalism makes everyday subjects‚Äîa woman dressing, a family riding to market‚Äîlook heroic, and images of deities and saints look approachable human. In the end, she‚Äôs a devotional artist, in the religious or spiritual sense: Her 1947-48 painting of the Hindu goddess Saraswati was originally displayed on her family‚Äôs home altar.\\" Being a trained classical dancer, a lot of her artwork was dedicated to the treatment of the physical form. Some of her more popular paintings comprise 'The Bullock Cart' and 'Parashurama'. She died in 2007 in her hometown Chennai, at the age of 81. The first retrospective exhibition of her work An Artist of Her Time : Y.G. Srimati and the Indian Style opened at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 2016. Her work was influenced by ragas, dance positions and mythological tales. When she was 26, she had her first exhibition, inaugurating the Centenary Hall Madras Museum in the year 1952. === Other exhibitions and work include === *In 1950, profiled in the first major survey publications of painters in the post-Independence India, Present Day Painters of India *In 1952 The Government of Museum, Madras, Organized her first solo Exhibition. *In 1955 All India Fine Arts and Crafts Society, New Delhi, Solo Exhibition. *1959 Beryl de Zoete invited her to England.

The article outlined three areas of cybernetics: * Information theory, principally statistical approaches to processing and transmission of messages. * The theory of automatic high-speed electronic calculating machines ‚Äì computers as the theory of self-organizing logical processes. * The theory of automatic control systems, principally feedback theory. A political point was added at the end of the article: :\\"Foreign reactionary philosophers and writers strive to use cybernetics, like any new scientific field, in their class interests. By intensively advertising and often exaggerating the statements of individual cybernetic scientists concerning the achievements and prospects of the development of automation, reactionary journalists and writers carry out a direct order from the capitalists to inspire ordinary people to consider their own inferiority, about the possibility of replacing ordinary workers with mechanical robots and thus they seek to reduce the activity of the working masses in the fight against capitalist exploitation. :We must resolutely expose this manifestation of a hostile ideology. Automation in a socialist society serves to facilitate and increase human productivity.\\" ==Impact== The mathematician Victor Glushkov was living in Sverdlovsk when he read the article along with Kitov's book Electronic digital machines. He saw the importance of cybernetics as being in relationship to computer science, and started leading a team working on the \\"Kiev Computer\\". Rather than seeing the computers as just a big adding machine, Glushkov approach meant working on areas which came to be called artificial intelligence. ==Text== * –û—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω—ã–µ —á–µ—Ä—Ç—ã –∫–∏–±–µ—Ä–Ω–µ—Ç–∏–∫–∏ On-line Russian language copy of the text made available by Virtual Computer Museum. ==References== Category:Cybernetics ","title":"The Main Features of Cybernetics"},{"id":"56737573","text":"Majakka (; ) is a high-rise building in Kalasatama, Helsinki.

It is located by an ancient river crossing, originally used by the Romans to get to a nearby Roman fort. Harewood Estate is surrounded by old mine workings, so the house faces towards Morwellham Quay. ==History== In Saxon times Calstock was in the Kingdom of Cornwall, which resisted the spread of Wessex from the east. In 838 CE Wessex had spread as far as the River Tamar, and a battle for independence was fought near Calstock. Following the Norman Conquest, Calstock manor was recorded in the Domesday Book. The Saxon manor (held by Asgar) was taken over, and in the 14th century became part of the Duchy of Cornwall: one of the 17 Antiqua maneria. Arms of the Williams family of Scorrier, Vair, three crescents or At the time of Domesday Book (1086) the manor was held by Reginald from Robert, Count of Mortain. There were two and a half hides of land and land for 12 ploughs. Reginald held one virgate of land with 2 ploughs and 12 serfs. 30 villains and 30 smallholders had the rest of the land with 6 ploughs. There were 100 acres of woodland, 3 square leagues of pasture and 3 pigs. The value of the manor was ¬£3 sterling though it had formerly been worth ¬£6.Thorn, C. et al., ed. (1979) Cornwall. Chichester: Phillimore; entry 5,2,12 Arms of the Trelawny family, Argent, sable chevron The manor was sold by the Duchy to John Williams of Scorrier House circa 1807. 1807 saw Sir William Lewis Salusbury-Trelawny, 8th Baronet, of the Salusbury-Trelawny baronets, purchase the estate. ==St Andrew's Parish== ===Granite cross=== A granite cross at the eastern end of the churchyard marks the grave of Sir William Lewis Salusbury-Trelawny, 8th Baronet, of Harewood House, Calstock, part of Salusbury-Trelawny baronets, who was for sometime the Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall and M.P. for East Cornwall. He died at Harewood in 1856, aged seventy five years. Folklore says that Sir William didn't want his body ever to leave his estate and so he was carried in through the back gate to his current resting spot, closest to his estate. Inside the church, just north of the pulpit, are two plaques: # At the top of one is inscribed \\"Laus Deo\\" (\\"Praise God\\"). Below that is inscribed the names of the four children of Sir William, the oldest living to just 28. # At the top of the other is an image of the cross, inscribed \\"Beneath The Cross\\"; below, Sir William and his wife are depicted. Below them is their fifth child, whom also died in middle age. ==Modern day== Harewood House has since been changed. The house is now only two storeys tall as the roof height has been lowered. The building is divided east and west by a rather out-of-place looking large stone doorway. Whilst West Harewood House is a single residential property the East comprises two. ==References== ==External links== * Calstock Online Parish Clerk * Calstock History * Cornwall Record Office Online Catalogue for Calstock * Calstock Parish Church History, Rev Gordon Ruming Category:Buildings and structures in Cornwall Category:Manors in Cornwall ","title":"Harewood House, Calstock"},{"id":"56737693","text":"Holly Webb (born 1976 in London) is a British children's writer.

Louis-Fran√ßois-Sebastien Fauvel (born September 14, 1753 in Clermont-en-Beauvaisis and died March 12, 1838 in Smyrna) was a French painter, diplomat and archaeologist who was long stationed in Athens. Fauvel has been called the \\"Father of Archeology in Greece.\\" ==Biography== Louis- Fran√ßois-S√©bastien Fauvel made his first stay in Greece in 1780-1782 in the service of the Comte de Choiseul-Gouffier. His archaeological work was meant to complete the Comte's Voyage pittoresque de la Gr√®ce. When the Count was appointed the ambassador of France to the Sublime Porte in 1784, he again engaged Fauvel. The latter did not support the life of the embassy in the Ottoman capital and did many archaeological trips to collect the material for the future publications and the collection of antiques of his patron, through Greece or in the summer of 1789, Egypt. It was then that he expressed his tiredness of working for someone who did not recognize his qualities. Fauvel settled permanently in Athens in the summer of 1793, after the emigration of Choiseul-Gouffier to Russia. In February 1796, he ended up being recognized for his archaeological work and named \\"non-resident partner\\" of the Institut de France. This assured him of funding for the pursuit of his research. He succeeded, for example, in sending to the Louvre a metope and a section of the Parthenon frieze. The Egyptian campaign entailed his imprisonment and his expulsion from the Ottoman Empire. He arrived in complete destitution in Paris in December 1801, sixteen years after leaving France. He participated in the work of the Institute. Seeking to return to Greece, he obtained the post of Vice-Consul of France in Athens. He was back there in January 1803. There he competed with Lord Elgin's agents, including Giovanni Battista Lusieri, for the Parthenon marbles. Taking advantage of the reversal of the alliances, the French vice-consul managed to make the self-same agents search on his behalf. However, he could not carry out the archaeological work he was considering: he could not get away from Athens where his consular activities, however rare, held him back. Above all, he did not have the financial means to open large projects. He then contented himself with limited research that he never published. In the same way, he sold the objects that he discovered, thus leaving the travellers who became the owners to publish their works on his discoveries. However, he played a key role in the development of archaeological knowledge of Athens and Attica by making the \\"cicerone\\" (guide) to the \\"tourists\\" who visited him. During the Greek War of Independence Fauvel held anti-Hellenic sentiments. He fled the fighting and fled to Smyrna where he died. ==References== Category:French painters Category:French diplomats Category:French archaeologists Category:People from Oise Category:1753 births Category:1838 deaths ","title":"Louis-Fran√ßois-S√©bastien Fauvel"},{"id":"56737738","text":"Thomas John Dennis (1869-1917) was an Anglican priest who was the main translator of the Bible into the Igbo language.DACB ==Childhood and education== Dennis was born into a farming family in Langney in Sussex on 17 September 1869 and grew up in Cuckfield, Guestling and St Leonards. He was the eldest of eight children, four of whom were to follow him into overseas Christian mission. He applied to joined the Church Missionary Society (CMS) in 1889, and because he had not been able to complete his education, was sent to the CMS Institution in Clapham before attending the CMS training college in Islington. Dennis was ordained in St Paul's Cathedral in 1893, and served for some months as an assistant curate in the parish of St. Marys, Islington. ==Work in West Africa== He was assigned to West Africa in 1893. He was acting Vice-Principal of Fourah Bay College, Freetown, Sierra Leone (1893-1894) before joining the Niger Mission in November 1894. Initially, his duties were mainly administrative, as acting mission secretary in 1895. He married Matilda (Mattie) Silman in 1897, and in the same year, following the death of H.H. Dobinson, was appointed mission secretary. He was appointed Archdeacon of Onitsha in 1905, although he had been fulfilling this responsibility de facto since 1897. He was Commissary and Examining Chaplain to the Rt Rev. Herbert Tugwell, Bishop in Western Equatorial Africa.\\"Igbo Culture and the Christian Missions, 1857-1957: Conversion in Theory and Practice\\" Okwu, A.S.O. p165: Lanham, Maryland; Rowman & Littlefield; 2010 He studied at Durham University, completing a BA in 1902.‚ÄùThe Clergy List‚Äù London, Kelly‚Äôs, 1913 ==Bible translation== Dennis was one of the new generation of Evangelicals who were disappointed that the Niger mission was not a \\"Scriptural Mission\\". Most translation efforts were directed towards hymnals and liturgy,Journal of Niger Delta Studies 1:2, p.66 1977 the only previous Bible translation work being an extremely literal translation of the four gospels, the Acts of the Apostles, and some of the Pauline epistles. Dennis therefore undertook a new translation of the Bible into the Igbo language under the auspices of the British and Foreign Bible Society. It was considered that he alone had anything near what could be regarded as the experience and training for translation work.Journal of Niger Delta Studies 1:2, p.66 1977 He was a key player in the development of Union Igbo, a written standard intended to serve all dialects. The Union Igbo New Testament was published in 1908 and the whole Bible in 1913. By the time of his death, five years later, 25,215 Bible had been sold. This version was very influential but criticised by artists, among them Chinua Achebe, as stultifying the Igbo language.Emerging Perspectives On Chinua Achebe p 435 Ernest EmenyoÃ≤nu, Iniobong I. Uko - 2004 - 459 \\"To Achebe, Union Igbo was a mechanical standardization, and its use in the translation of the Bible into Igbo in 1913 was a legacy detrimental to the growth and development of Igbo language and culture.\\" He also published a grammar of Igbo (1901), a literacy primer (1903, revised 1911), and an Igbo translation of Pilgrim's Progress. ==Death== In 1917, Dennis and his wife set sail for England on the Elder Dempster steamship Karina. On 1 August they were torpedoed off the south coast of Ireland just outside Queenstown and the ship sank. Mattie was rescued but Dennis drowned. One of their suitcases, containing a draft of the Igbo-English dictionary and part of an Igbo grammar, later washed up on the coast of Wales. A fisherman found it, broken open on the beach. He collected the papers and dried them out. The suitcase had Dennis' name printed on the outside, and also contained the address of a donor. The fisherman wrote to her, and she in turn contacted Mattie. By this means the dictionary manuscript was eventually returned to CMS, who published it in 1923. ==Legacy== The Dennis Memorial Grammar School in Onitsha is named after him.DOBADennis and the Ibo Bible: The Missionary Work of Tom Dennis in Nigeria and the Creation of the Union Ibo Language 0954637100 John Goodchild (Rev.

In 1877 or 1878, number four Euston Square was the site of a murder that became popularly known as the \\"Euston Square Murder\\" after the body of Matilda Hacker was found in the coal cellar of the house in 1879. She had last been seen in 1877. Hannah Dobbs, a former servant at the house and mistress of the leaseholder Severin Bastendorff, was arrested after it was found that she had pawned some of Hacker's possessions. In 1879 she was tried for murder at the Old Bailey, but acquitted due to lack of evidence.Unsolved murders of women in Victorian London. Jan Bondeson, The History Press. Retrieved 21 March 2018. ==Renaming== As of 25 September 1879, the Metropolitan Board of Works of London recorded the receipt of a letter from the Vestry of Saint Pancras, asking that the south side of Euston Square be renamed Endsleigh Gardens, and the houses renumbered. The vestry had received the request from George Cubitt, M. P., a freeholder of the south side of Euston Square, along with a petition signed by \\"nearly the whole of the leaseholders and occupiers of the houses there\\". The vestry meeting had voted in favour, 69 to 3. As of 28 November 1879, a committee reported to the Metropolitan Board of Works in favour of the request, and as of 5 December 1879, the change was moved, seconded and resolved. The reasons for the request are not recorded in the Board of Works' minutes.

In 2005 she was selected for the Advanced Course in Visual Art at the Fondazione Antonio Ratti, Como (IT), visiting professor Alfredo Jaar. She attended the Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten in Amsterdam in 2007-2008. ==Career== Francesca Grilli's early works focus on videos documenting her performances inspired by her interaction with members of her family, such as 194.9 MHz (2006) for example, where she describes the relationships with her father, or Gordon (2007) where she invited her grandfather to play Bocce with her. Since 2006 her focus shifts to performance and sound installations such as Arriver√† e ci coglier√† di sorpresa (2006) where she invited two elderly dancers to dance Tango for 3 hours in front of a video projection of an empty dancehall. The next year she presented Enduring Midnight (2007) where she asked an aged woman, who used to be a Soprano singer, to perform at midnight. Both the performances stress on the ageing body in relation to time and their ability to challenge their physical limits putting memory to test. With Moth (2009) she started a research about the idea of the 'resistant body', meaning a body with some sort of physical limitation, which sees such limitation as a special condition to explore, within a performative act. The work analyzes the relationship between a singer affected by Albinism and light, through a scientific experiment which uses the Rubens' tube. The performer interacts with the light source generated by the experiment in order to control it: the flame reacts on the voice of the performer according to her tone and volume. In 2010 she realizes The Conversation where she invited a deaf teenager to listen to live music through the vibration produced by the sound waves, and to sing using the Italian Sign Language. The performance was the recipient of the Nuove Arti award, promoted by the Museo d'Arte Moderna di Bologna, Italy. Gold (2011), Iron (2011) and Variazioni per Voce (2012) focus on the state censorship on music operated by the Istituto Centrale per i Beni Sonori ed Audiovisivi di Roma (IT) emphasizing on the paradox between the preservation of cultural heritage and its destruction. In Fe2O3, OSSIDO FERRICO presented at the Italian Pavillion at the Venice Biennale in 2013, she incorporates some elements of her previous artworks, in particular, the use of sound as the main element. The artist invited a group of female performers, who were asked to interact daily with a massive iron wall through vocalizations for six months. A microphone was connected to a mechanism that released drops of water on the iron surface causing its corrosion. The idea was to eventually open a gap on the wall using the performances' voices and water. In 2015 for the performance Family presented at the Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven (NL) she invited a family from the city composed by 4 individuals (a child, a father, a mother and a grandmother) to sing a repertoire related to the museum's collection, every change of season until 2017. Throughout two years the members of the family grew older and their voices changed, especially as regards the youngest and the oldest family member. Every performance was documented with a photograph and audio recorded in order to prove the effect of time on the bodies and the voices. The museum acquired the documentation which is now part of the collection. The Forgetting of Air (2016) uses air as the material shared between the audience and the performer. Considering breathing as the first individual autonomous action that brings life to a being and inspired by the recent facts regarding migratory fluxes throughout the Mediterranean Sea, Grilli invited professional and non-professional performers with a refugee background to just breath into a cone-shaped device in a room filled with steam. Due to the fact that the performers had experienced first hand the risk of suffocation or drowning the work enphasisez on the precariousness of human life. ==Work== ===Major exhibitions=== * 2017 A House Halfway, Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo , Torino, I * 2017 Murmur, Netwerk Center for Contemporary Art, Aalst, B * 2017 Sensibile Comune.

He served as Governor of Tamaulipas from 1975 to 1981 and Municipal President of Ciudad Victoria from 1968 until 1971. Nationally, C√°rdenas served in the Senate of the Republic for two terms, as well as Undersecretary of Finance during the administration of President Luis Echeverr√≠a during the 1970s. ==Life== C√°rdenas was born in Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, on February 4, 1927. In the 1950s, he began his business career selling cars in Tampico and later moved to Matamoros, where he sold and repaired farm implements. His brother Jorge started a radio station, XEGW, in Ciudad Victoria in 1957. Ultimately, after working as one of its sales agents, Enrique acquired XEGW from his brother. In 1969, C√°rdenas started Organizaci√≥n Radiof√≥nica Tamaulipeca, which continues to operate radio stations in Ciudad Victoria and Ciudad Mante. Separately from ORT, he also was the original owner of XEIR radio in Ciudad Valles, San Luis Potos√≠. In 1963, C√°rdenas entered politics. His cousin, Morelos Jaime Canseco Gonz√°lez, was critical in promoting him to the head of the state electoral commission. When Gustavo D√≠az Ordaz left the Federal Electoral Commission to run for president, Luis Echeverr√≠a took his place, starting a friendship that would catalyze C√°rdenas's political career. In 1968, with Echeverr√≠a as Secretary of the Interior, he intervened to have C√°rdenas be named the mayor of Ciudad Victoria. However, he would only serve in that post for a year before being named to the first of two Senate stints. C√°rdenas promoted Tamaulipas's agricultural sector during his tenure as governor from 1975 to 1981 through his program called Revoluci√≥n Verde, or Green Revolution. The initiative led to the modernization of Tamaulipas's agriculture industry, including an increase in land clearing and tillage for farming. Tamaulipas became known as one of the \\"granaries of Mexico\\" as a result of the state programs. Enrique C√°rdenas died at his home in Ciudad Victoria at 3:00 a.m. on March 1, 2018, at the age of 91.

United States was a case heard before the U.S. Supreme Court in April 1872 addressing the civil rights of African Americans, as well as states' rights issues. The case involved the testimony of African American victims of an attack by two White people using an axe that left four people dead. Kentucky state law prohibited the testimony of a \\"Negro\\" against a white man and barred African Americans from serving on juries. The case was eventually moved to Federal court, where the attackers were convicted. The State of Kentucky then appealed the case to the Supreme Court citing states rights in defense of its laws prohibiting African Americans from testifying against Whites. The case was a test of the Civil Rights Act of 1866. The Supreme Court ruled that victims were not entitled to protection from the state law because word \\"affected\\" in the law did not apply to victims of crimes who are not defendants in a case. Noah Swayne (the first Republican appointed to the Supreme Court) and Joseph Bradley dissented. The civil rights legislation was subsequently modified and comments in the dissent are noted for putting forth a group right to the adequate protection of the law. Justice William Strong wrote that any case involving an African American witness could be brought to a Federal Court if the court had ruled for the victims and upheld the right of African Americans to testify in court. ==References== ==Further reading== *The Family of Jack and Sallie Foster, Blyew v.

It is used by the Berlin S-Bahn. The first, 5.9 kilometre-long section was opened in 1962 and served mainly as a connection to Berlin Sch√∂nefeld Airport and the associated long-distance station. In 2011, a 7.7 kilometre-long extension went into operation to connect with Berlin Brandenburg Airport (BER). Due to delays in the start-up of the new airport, this section is not yet used for public transport. == History== The only railway between the radial Berlin‚ÄìDresden and Berlin‚ÄìG√∂rlitz railways until the 1930s was the Neuk√∂lln-Mittenwalde Railway, which was also a radial line. The latter also served the village of Sch√∂nefeld. Plans for a tangential connection with Berlin's developing railway bypass had been developed for several decades, but they were only actually realised west of the Berlin‚ÄìHalle railway (Anhalter Bahn). During the Nazi period, the Outer Freight Ring (G√ºterau√üenring, GAR) was built to a temporary low standard; this ran in the area of the southern Berlin city boundary from the Berlin‚ÄìHalle railway to the east. After the Second World War, passenger traffic ran briefly between Berlin-Gr√ºnau and Lichtenrade via Sch√∂nefeld and later, between 1955 and 1958, passenger traffic ran again from Gr√ºnau to Gro√üziethen. As a result of the divisions of Germany and Berlin, through rail traffic between most of the surrounding areas and West Berlin (with the exception of the S-Bahn) was cut off in the early 1950s. The traffic ran from the southern radial lines over the beginning of the Berlin outer ring (Berliner Au√üenring, BAR), which was built in the eastern part of Berlin in the 1950s. Since it was still possible to move largely unhindered between the eastern and western parts of the city, control stations were also set up at the borders between East Berlin and the surrounding area where passengers were checked before they travelled to Berlin. Such a control station was also built in Sch√∂nefeld. The station did not serve public transport, but travellers passing through Berlin-Sch√∂nefeld Airport, which was opened for civil use in 1955, could use the trains stopping there. In order to improve access to the airport, an S-Bahn line was planned to the airport as early as 1958. There were also considerations of extending the line to the west to Rangsdorf or along the BAR to Ludwigsfelde. The construction of the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961 made a railway connection even more urgent. Travellers from the areas to the south of Berlin would be able to change to the S-Bahn in Sch√∂nefeld. So soon afterwards work started on the construction of the line. === S-Bahn line to Sch√∂nefeld Airport=== Gr√ºnbergallee S-Bahn station, looking to the east in 2000 Work on the line began at the end of September 1961. A second track was built between Altglienicke and Schoenefeld (except under the Waltersdorfer Chaussee underpass) and the infrastructure in the Altglienicke area had to be rebuilt so that an approach road to an expressway could be built next to the railway. The Germanenstra√üe road bridge was demolished and replaced by a pedestrian bridge with platform access. Gr√ºnbergallee station (originally planned with the name of Falkenh√∂he) was rebuilt and the former halt of Sch√∂nefeld Siedlung on the Outer Freight Ring was closed. The facilities of Schoenefeld station, now serviced by ordinary public transport services, were extended slightly. A new S-Bahn platform and a pedestrian bridge were built and a station building was built in 1962. Nevertheless, the station remained provisional for a long time. The line went into operation on 26 February 1962, but Gr√ºnbergallee station did not open until 27 May 1962. A possible extension of the S-Bahn along the outer ring towards Wuhlheide was prepared at the Gr√ºnau Cross (Gr√ºnauer Kreuz), where the BAR crosses the Berlin‚ÄìG√∂rlitz railway. The power supply of the line was built with a provisional substation at Gr√ºnau Cross, which was later replaced by a new building. From 1985 to 1987, the section between Gr√ºnau Cross and Altglienicke was upgraded to two tracks. This increased the efficiency of the line. The ultimate goal was to allow a third group of services (i.e., three trains per direction at 20-minute intervals) to better serve the new development areas in the Altglienicke area. However, this increase in services did not occur. The last single-track section under the Waltersdorfer Chaussee bridge was eliminated in 1991. === Extension to Berlin- Brandenburg Airport === Wa√ümannsdorf S-Bahn station In the 1990s, the Sch√∂nefeld area was chosen when the location of a new major airport for Berlin was examined. An area in the southern part of the existing airport was chosen as the location for the new terminal building. Various concepts for its connection to Berlin were investigated. Two options for an S-Bahn connection were favoured: on the one hand, an underground connection from the existing Sch√∂nefeld station under the runway and, on the other hand, an east-west connection from Blankenfelde station on the Dresden Railway through the airport station and continuing to the G√∂rlitz Railway. Neither of these options were chosen. Instead, a connection was built that runs around the airport from the old Sch√∂nefeld station in a large loop to the north and then reaches the new airport station in a tunnel from the west together with the mainline railway. It uses two tracks of the four tracks of the Berlin outer ring that were built in the 1980s but were no longer needed due to falling freight traffic and changed traffic flows to Berlin since reunification. Originally, no intermediate station was planned, but the community of Sch√∂nefeld financed the construction of Wa√ümannsdorf station. The new line and a long-distance railway have been in operation since 31 October 2011. Originally the Berlin-Brandenburg Airport was supposed to begin operations on the same day. However, there have been extensive delays to its construction. It is now not expected to be open before the Autumn of 2020. After January 2012, route training for train drivers was carried out on the new line, but these were stopped when the opening of the airport was delayed. However, trips are still being made to keep the line operational and to ventilate the underground airport station. === Passenger services=== S-Bahn train in Altglienicke station Shortly after the opening of the line, it was operated with two S-Bahn train groups, that is two trains per direction at 20-minute intervals. In 1962, the Bernau ‚Äì central Sch√∂nefeld airport train group (running during the whole operating day) and the Friedrichstrasse ‚Äì Sch√∂nefeld train group (not running during the evening) served the line. A few years later, the latter train group operated during the entire operating time to/from the Berlin Stadtbahn. Since then, it has been the main train group on the line. In 1990, it was extended in the western part of the city to Charlottenburg and sometimes to Westkreuz. Since 1991, it has carried the line number of S9. Because of the construction work at Ostkreuz, it has not run on the Stadtbahn since 2009, but instead runs to Pankow or Blankenburg, but after the completion of the connection curve, services will return to the Stadtbahn. The second train group to Sch√∂nefeld has changed several times. For a long time there were continuous connections between Sch√∂nefeld and Oranienburg. Since the end of 2002, the S 45 line has been operating from Sch√∂nefeld via Baumschulenweg to the southern Ringbahn. The terminus of the line (as of 2016) is generally S√ºdkreuz, with some trains continuing Bundesplatz.Various timetables These two services are to run on the line after completion of the new airport and then terminate at Berlin Brandenburg Airport station. == Route== View of the S-Bahn platform in Berlin Brandenburg Airport station The line starts in Gr√ºnau Cross, where the Berlin outer ring crosses the Berlin‚ÄìG√∂rlitz railway. The many connecting curves allow trains to operate in all directions. For the S-Bahn, the only branch in this area is the separation of the line to the airport from the S-Bahn line along the G√∂rlitz Railway towards Gr√ºnau and K√∂nigs Wusterhausen. The line to the airport turns to the southwest and initially uses the former route of the Outer Freight Ring. Altglienicke station is located, together with a feeder road to an autobahn, in a cutting between the districts of Altglienicke and Bohnsdorf. The line runs to the west and reaches Gr√ºnbergallee station. On the same street there is one of the few level crossings on the Berlin S-Bahn network. The line crosses the Berlin city limits and again meets the Berlin outer ring. Berlin Sch√∂nefeld Airport station has an island platform for the S-Bahn with two S-Bahn tracks; it formerly had three island platforms for mainline services. Originally, no extension of the S-Bahn line was planned. Therefore, the extension of the S-Bahn line continues on the axis of the former long-distance tracks from the southern island platform, which was therefore taken out of service. The outer ring had been four-tracked in this area in the 1980s. The new S-Bahn line uses the two southern tracks of the outer ring. It follows the ring for several kilometres and turns to the south in Wa√ümannsdorf and runs into Wa√ümannsdorf station, which is built on an embankment. At Selchow the line meets the long-distance tracks of the Glasower Damm Ost‚ÄìBohnsdorf S√ºd railway and they run together initially in a trough, then through a several kilometre-long tunnel to the east and then northeast to Berlin Brandenburg Airport. This is where the S-Bahn line ends, while the long-distance train tracks continue to the G√∂rlitz Railway. The airport station is only about 2.5 kilometres in a direct line from Sch√∂nefeld station, while the S-Bahn line between the two stations is 7.7 kilometres long. With the construction of the extension of the line, a new turnback facility was built in Sch√∂nefeld station. There is no turnback facility in the new airport station, so trains reverse at the platform. The airport station is controlled by a computer-based interlocking in Selchow. ==Notes== ===Footnotes=== ===Sources=== Category:Railway lines in Berlin Category:Railway lines in Brandenburg Category:Airport rail links in Germany Category:Railway lines opened in 1962 Category:1962 establishments in East Germany Category:Berlin S-Bahn Category:Buildings and structures in Dahme-Spreewald ","title":"Gr√ºnau Cross‚ÄìBerlin Brandenburg Airport railway"},{"id":"56738553","text":"Richard Utaegbulam (1904-1968) was an Anglican priestDACB Utaegbulam was born in Umuezeala and educated at St Paul's College, Awka.

Fortunatianus may have eventually inclined to anti- Nicene doctrine but at l.984-6 the text clearly states the Trinity as being of one substance (is this his earlier position, his considered view or an interpolation?). He also admitted a large figurative element in the Gospel narratives. (An example: l.499 seq. Fortunatianus' treatment of the Magi \\"returning by another way.\\") An interesting detail is his identification of two of the four Evangelists based on Ezekiel and the Apocalypse at the opening of his text: Mark is the eagle and John the lion. Fortunatianus was a signatory at the western Council of Serdica (343) which condemned Arius' teaching; he subsequently entertained Athanasius on his return journey from Treves to Alexandria, and was chosen by Pope Liberius to defend Athanasius at the Council of Milan (355) where however he yielded, doubtless with good grace, to pressure from Emperor Constantius II; in the aftermath of the council he urged Pope Liberius to conform. ==References== *Fortunatianus Aquileiensis: Commentaria in Evangelia, ed.

Culver served in combat in Vietnam and was awarded the Silver Star for his heroic actions during a firefight in 1967. ==Early years== Richard Otis Culver Jr. was born on Alcatraz Island on April 9, 1936. His father, Richard O. Culver, was a guard at the Federal Penitentiary there and the family lived on the island. Richard Jr. was the first child born on the island while it was a Federal Penitentiary. His father was a retired Marine Corps lieutenant colonel who had served in the Banana Wars and in China. Culver's family moved to Hopewell, Virginia, where he attended elementary school and completed his high school education. Culver enlisted in the Marine Corps at age 17. He graduated from high school in 1954 and then attended Virginia Military Institute (VMI), where he was a member of the Marine Corps Reserves. While at VMI, he competed as captain of the VMI Pistol team, and on the Marine Corps Reserve Rifle and Pistol team at the National Matches. He earned his bachelor's degree in physics in 1958. He later earned a master's degree in physics. ==Marine Corps service== Culver enlisted into active service in the US Marine Corps on November 11, 1958. He subsequently attended Officer Candidate School (OCS) and was commissioned as a Marine Corps second lieutenant. ===Vietnam War=== Culver served two combat tours in Vietnam. In his first tour, from 1967 to 1968, he was wounded on his first day in combat and awarded the Purple Heart. After recovering, he led reconnaissance patrols. He then saw combat experience with the infantry, where he served as a company commander. While serving as the commanding officer of H Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines, in Vietnam, Culver was awarded the Silver Star for his actions on July 21, 1967, during a firefight with a North Vietnamese Army company. As described in his obituary, he \\"exposed himself to fire several times, rallied his Marines, coordinated fire and medevacs, called in artillery and air support, and forced the enemy to break contact after suffering numerous casualties\\". Culver had a second tour to Vietnam from 1971 to 1972. As the conflict was ending, he supervised the evacuation from the U.S. Embassy in Saigon. ===Sniper school=== After the Vietnam War, the Marine Corps moved forward with forming a permanent Scout Sniper program. Together with Major Edward James Land (who was Culver's commanding officer in Vietnam), Culver helped form, and was the first commander of, the first Marine Corps Scout Sniper School at Quantico, Virginia. Culver's senior NCO was GySgt Carlos Hathcock. Culver was a member and later commanding officer of the Marine Corps Rifle and Pistol team, earning several medals in competition. ==Silver Star citation== For heroism in combat on July 21, 1967, when a Captain in the United States Marine Corps, in Company H, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines, 9th Marine Amphibious Brigade: > The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting > the Silver Star to Captain Richard O.

He then returned to the U.S., to Kellogg, Idaho, where he spent five years as the high school's JROTC senior instructor. In retirement, Culver wrote about the Marine Corps and his experiences. On February 24, 2014, Culver died at age 77 at Hospice House in Hayden, Idaho. He was survived by his wife and son.

He is the youngest and first ever Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan who hails from the province of Balochistan. ==Early life and education== Sanjrani was born on 14 April 1978 in Nok Kundi, Balochistan, Pakistan. He received his early education from Nok Kundi and then moved to Islamabad from where he earned his master's degree. According to another report, he earned his degree of Master of Arts from the University of Balochistan. ==Political career== Sanjrani began his political career in 1998 as coordinator of the team of then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif where he served until 1999 Pakistani coup d'√©tat. In 2008, he was appointed in-charge of the Prime Minister's Yousaf Raza Gillani Grievance Cell at the Prime Minister's Secretariat where he remained for five years. Sanjrani was elected to the Senate of Pakistan as an independent candidate on general seat from Balochistan in 2018 Pakistani Senate election. He took oath as Senator on 12 March 2018. On the same day, he was elected as 8th Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan.

In September 2018, Sanjrani addressed the National Assembly of Azerbaijan on the eve of its 100th anniversary. On the 1st of August 2019, a no-confidence motion was presented by the opposition parties in the senate to remove him from the post of the Chairman of the Senate. The resolution was tabled in the Senate with 64 senators in support of it. The no-confidence motion failed to pass because the opposition parties only gathered 50 votes, 3 votes short of the resolution passing. Sanjrani still stands as the Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan after having survived the no-confidence vote. This was seem as a clear victory to the PTI government coalition and a confirmation of senators having confidence in the chairman. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1978 births Category:People from Chagai District Category:Members of the Senate of Pakistan Category:Chairmen of the Senate of Pakistan Category:Baloch people Category:University of Balochistan alumni ","title":"Sadiq Sanjrani"},{"id":"56738698","text":"Olivia Eliasson in 2018 Olivia Margareta Eliasson (born 7 June 1996) is a Swedish singer.

The NED article specifically names the Russian state-funded RT News Network and the Chinese state-sponsored Confucius Institute educational partnerships as examples of sharp power. According NED, autocratic states \\"are not necessarily seeking to 'win hearts and minds,' the common frame of reference for soft power efforts, but they are surely seeking to manipulate their target audiences by distorting the information that reaches them.‚Äù Since 2018, the term \\"sharp power\\" has been used in news articles, scholarly discussions, and Congressional hearings. Even representatives of the Chinese Communist Party have used the term, dismissing Western claims that their country has engaged in sharp power practices. ==Overview== Sharp power can include attempts by one country to manipulate and manage information about itself in the news media and educational systems of another country, for the purpose of misleading or dividing public opinion in a target country, or for masking or diverting attention away from negative information about itself. The link between sharp power and authoritarian regime is, as stated Christophe Walker \\"This approach takes advantage of the asymmetry between free and unfree systems, allowing authoritarian regimes both to limit free expression and to distort political environments in democracies while simultaneously shielding their own domestic public spaces from democratic appeals coming from abroad.‚Äù making sharp power easier to use for an authoritarian regime than a democratic one. Soft power policies can include student exchanges and the sponsoring of cultural and sporting events. Sharp power is distinguished from soft power, which are attractive policies that project a positive impression of one country and promote greater understanding with another country, ultimately to influence the decisions of another country through persuasion. Sharp power is also distinct from hard power, which are coercive policies by one country to compel another country into taking action or changing its decisions. Hard power can include military force, economic sanctions, and diplomatic threats. Sharp power often has a digital element to it. In particular Chinese exercises in sharp power are carried out almost entirely online. ==See also== * Soft power * Hard power * Smart power * Power projection * Power (international relations) * Power (social and political) * Abusive power and control *Political warfare *Psychological warfare and propaganda *Active measures *Hostage diplomacy ==References== ==External links== * \\"From 'Soft Power' to 'Sharp Power': Revisiting the Conceptual Vocabulary.\\" National Endowment for Democracy.

To the same period goes back the idea to reserve a large area, north to the castle, to the private leisure and hunting of the Visconti family. Thirty years later Gian Galeazzo Visconti added a further portion of land (Parco Nuovo, the New Park) to the first part (Parco Vecchio, the Old Park). With this extension the park reached to the north the Charterhouse of Pavia founded few years before by the Visconti as well with the purpose to host the family mausoleum. The park was encircled by walls and accessible by gates. The total length of the wall along the perimeter of the park is estimated to be about 25 km. Inside the park manors, farmsteads, ponds with hydraulic arrangements and pathways were built. At its center the Mirabello Castle, seat of the Captain of the Park, was erected. In some part the vegetation was designed with recreational purposes or to accommodate animal species either autoctone or exotic. In other parts the agricultural activities were maintained in continuity with the external areas. The original Visconti Park is considered an archetype of the modern parks as an area set aside by local authorities and modified with techniques of landscape architecture. In its hunting purposes it can be compared to the English deer parks. The complex of the Visconti Park, the Pavia castle and the Certosa di Pavia constitutes the first example in Europe of a royal palace connected to an enclosed park with a private chapel or other buildings. The nearest example visible today is the royal villa and park of Monza realized about four centuries later. ==Disuse and decay== The breaching of the walls of the Visconti Park is a recurrent theme in the iconography of the Battle of Pavia (unknown Flemish artist, 16th century) After the rule of Ludovico Maria Sforza (1489-1494) the park was progressively abandoned and its features deteriorated. In 1525 it was the theater of the Battle of Pavia fought between French and Imperial‚ÄìSpanish forces. The walls of the park were damaged by the armies while manoeuvring during the battle. In the following centuries the masonry of the wall, offering bricks for the reuse in the nearby peasant houses, went through a general demise up to its complete demolition. ==The park nowadays== The Visconti Park today has few signs of the original features, being mainly dedicated to agriculture like the area external to it. Of the Mirabello Castle, having originally a quadrilater layout, only one side has survived. Remains of two gates are visible at Torre del Mangano and in San Genesio (Porta Pescarina). The other gates survive only in place names. To facilitate the visit of the park, bike routes and thematical tours are proposed by local authorities. ==References== ==External links== *Visconti Park - Portale del Turismo di Certosa di Pavia *al centro - Parco Visconteo Category:Parks in Lombardy Category:1360 establishments in Europe Category:1360s establishments in the Holy Roman Empire Category:14th-century establishments in Italy ","title":"Visconti Park"},{"id":"56739113","text":"Tahir Bizenjo is a Pakistani politician who has been a Member of the Senate of Pakistan, since March 2018. ==Political career== Bizenjo was elected to the Senate of Pakistan as a candidate of National Party on technocrat seat from Balochistan in 2018 Pakistani Senate election.

Intended as a kind of revolutionary council and socialist and communist in inspiration, it was created after the soldiers mutinied against their officers and seized control of Brussels which had been occupied since August 1914. They tried unsuccessfully to create an alliance with Belgian civilians and socialists and there was sporadic fighting in the city between right-wing and revolutionary soldiers. At the same time, the Soldiers' Council struggled to maintain law and order. Its chief concern was to secure the repatriation of its men to Germany. After a few days, the council disbanded and the final German troops left Brussels on 16 November. The Belgian Army under King Albert I finally entered the city on 22 November 1918. The Brussels soldiers' council was contemporary with another similar body established at Beverloo at the same time.

They were locomotives for fast passenger trains and most came from the Societ√† per le strade ferrate dell'Alta Italia (SFAI). They were all of foreign construction. The oldest were delivered from Koechlin of Mulhouse between 1873 and 1874 and accounted for more than half of the total quantity. The subsequent orders, made by RM, were to Maffei of Munich who delivered them between 1884 and 1889. Eight locomotives were built by the Soci√©t√© Franco- Belge between 1888 and 1889. They were finally acquired by FS in 1905 on nationalization. In the FS locomotive list, at 31 December 1914, 60 units were registered. They were divided into two groups with different technical characteristics and some functional and aesthetic variations. ==Technical details== The locomotive was built with a 2-4-0 wheel arrangement, with very large 2.030 mm diameter wheels and a front axle with 8 mm side-play allowed. It was typical of the passenger locomotives of the time. It used saturated steam and had two outside cylinders with simple expansion. The boiler pressure was 10 bar. A three-axle tender of total mass 29 tonnes (26 tonnes in the second group) was coupled to the locomotives. The water capacity was 10 m¬≥ and the coal capacity was 3.5 tonnes (3 tonnes in the second group). All locomotives were equipped with automatic compressed air brake equipment.

The harbor community is non-contiguous from the rest of Egg Harbor Township, separated from municipal facilities by about . Seaview Harbor shares a zip code with neighboring Longport, whose postmaster handles mail for the community. Longport also provides first response for fire and medical emergencies, as well as most police matters, at no cost to the township. ==History== Seaview Harbor subdivision was first envisioned in 1957 as a \\"planned community for the boating family\\", and housing units were gradually added. In the 1960s and 1970s, storms damaged bulkheads in the community, forcing residents to finance their own breakwater. By the mid-1970s, Egg Harbor Township began providing trash pickup. The township installed a public sewer system by 1994. In 2009, a traffic light was installed at the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and NJ 152. Within Seaview Harbor, there are currently 92 single-family homes, two vacant residential lots, a utility lot, and Seaview Harbor Marina. The namesake marina has 300 slips, a restaurant, a store, a fuel dock, and a private beach. The properties of Seaview Harbor, representing an area of , is assessed at over $100 million. In 2012, a tax reevaluation rose taxes in Seaview Harbor by 60%. In 2014, 69 residents of Seaview Harbor submitted a petition to leave Egg Harbor Township and join nearby Longport. This represented about 80% of registered voters in the community. Among the concerns was confusion and lost mail, due to uncertainty whether the area was a part of Longport or Egg Harbor Township, as well as the high taxes. Over two years, the township held 25 meetings exploring the community's deannexation, at the cost of $87,800 in legal and engineering fees. Longtime Egg Harbor Township mayor James J. McCullough lives in Seaview Harbor, and recused himself from the secession hearings. The mayor of Longport, Nicholas Russo, was neutral on the matter. A 500-page report released in January 2016 concluded that Seaview Harbor did not meet the criteria to secede from the township. The report cited the lack of continuity with Longport, as the only connection is NJ 152. The secession would also negatively impact the rest of Egg Harbor Township, including a $505,000 loss in taxes. On November 30, 2016, the Egg Harbor Township Committee voted 4-0 to deny the deannexation. ==References== Category:Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey Category:Unincorporated communities in Atlantic County, New Jersey Category:Unincorporated communities in New Jersey ","title":"Seaview Harbor, New Jersey"},{"id":"56739317","text":"Julie Berry (born 1974)http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?126269\\"Julie Berry,\\" OCLC World Cat Fiction Finder is an author of children's and young adults books and winner of several national book awards. ==Biography== Julie Gardner Berry grew up on a farm in rural Medina, New York as the youngest of seven children in a Mormon family.Faith and good works: Mormon writers find their niche in wholesome young adult genre Michael Paulson, The Boston Globe (2009)Julie Berry Mormon Artist (2014) She received a B.S. in communications at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, New York in 1995 and later earned an M.F.A. from Vermont College of Fine Arts in 2008.Julie Berry BooksJulie Berry, A Young Mother of Boys Finds Happiness Writing For Teen Girls Meridian Magazine (2009) Berry met her husband at RPI.

There are more than 70 species. Some of these mites are parasites or commensals of bees, but the presence in some bees of specialized structures for carrying mites (acarinarium) indicates the mutualistic nature of the relationship of some species (Sennertia sayutara, Sennertia devincta). Most species of the genus Sennertia settle on adult bees as heteromorphic deutonymphs, but the species Sennertia vaga has no deutonymph and settle on adult bees in the eating adult stages. Reproduction and feeding occurs during resettlement. Most species occur on small carpenter bees (Ceratina) and large carpenter bees (Xylocopa) of the family Apidae. A few species (Sennertia vaga-group) are associated with Centris (Paracentris) in the Neotropics. == Distribution == Sennertia are found worldwide, except for in the Antarctic.

In 1871 alone, more than 130,000 people moved to Berlin. They slept on the streets, in attics, the cattle sheds of the central slaughterhouse, the cheapest boarding houses and shacks. Alcoholism, thievery and prostitution were often their fate. Epidemics ran rife. In winter, tens of thousands more streamed into Berlin after the countryside harvest came to an end. Young girls arriving at the station in the hope of obtaining work as domestic servants were often lured away and forced into prostitution.Winfried Ripp, \\"Wiesenburg \\" in Stattreisen Berlin e.V. vol. 3, Stattbuch Verlag GmbH 1990, pp. 28/9 ==Beginnings== The Berlin Homeless Shelter Association was founded in 1868 in Berlin by members of the Friedrichs-Werdeschen-Bezirksverein. The awareness that an individual is not necessarily responsible for his or her homeless condition and that police custody is also not a useful way to deal with the problem led to the founding of the homeless association by engaged and motivated Berlin citizens. Led by banker, Gustav Th√∂lde, its members included industrialist August Borsig, head of the city council Friedrich Kochhann, chaplain Friedrich Gustav Lisco, physician Rudolf Virchow, factory owner, and socialist Paul Singer, and Chief of Police Lothar von Wurmb, amongst others. Th√∂lde remained the association's chairman until his death in 1910. The association, virtually a ‚ÄòWho‚Äôs who‚Äô of the Berlin bourgeoisie, was notable for its large number of high-ranking members of Berlin society. Its articles included the daily presence of the members in the association's work. How far those mentioned kept to this requirement is unclear although this example is a characteristic feature of the bourgeoisie of that time. That the association was rooted in the more affluent levels of society meant that the association could exist functionally and financially for a comparatively long time. At the end of the century, it had 4‚Äì5,000 members and was financed from donations, legacies, foundations and bequests, as well as charity benefits which raised considerable sums of money for the association. However, many less affluent citizens and social democratic workers counted among its members. The association was supported above all by liberal Berlin Jews. When a call for donations was made in the Vossischen Zeitung in 1893, many anti-semitic postcards were received in response: \\"I do not donate to the Berliner Asyl- Verein f√ºr Obdachlose because of its exclusively Jewish supporters.\\"Ibid, p. 31 ==First shelters== The priority was the construction of a women's shelter. On 7 December 1868, the association had already signed a rental contract for a former artillery workshop on the corner of Dorotheensta√üe and Wilhelmstra√üe. A call for donations went out to the Berlin population on 12 December. People were urged to join the association or support it with contributions. At this point, there was accommodation for 60 people who could sleep on metal beds with sprung mattresses in contrast to the unhygienic wooden beds of other establishments. A men's shelter administered by Paul Singer followed in 1873, in B√ºschungstra√üe 4 in former K√∂nigstadt, near the women's prison. Today a memorial plaque can be found there. In 1876, the association registered 105,000 stays and by the end of 1892, around 2.5 million.Ibid, p. 29 ==The Wiesenburg== In 1896, a new building in Wiesenstra√üe in Gesundbrunnen between the Panke canal and the Berlin Ringbahn (circle line) was ready to accommodate 700 men in the 12,000 m¬≤ complex. A large donation from Dr Moritz Gerson, amongst others, funded the construction; 400 workers completed the shelter in one year. The site had been carefully chosen: previous experiences with the neighbours of the Friedrichshain house, who felt harassed by the sight of miserable people and claimed that their children were endangered by the homeless, led the association to look for a site as shielded from the neighbourhood as possible. The shelter had a 50 m ‚Äòprivate street‚Äô, to clear 700 men from the Wiesenstra√üe as quickly as possible, a small, attractive garden lay at the front, the circle line protected it to the north and the Panke canal to the west. The shelter, called Die Wiesenburg in popular parlance, was designed by the architects, and . The house, still standing and in use today, provided conference rooms for the association and living accommodation for the shelter's employees. Paul Singer was the shelter's administrator, Georg Toebelmann and Rudolf Virchow took charge of hygiene. The shelter was fitted out to the most advanced standards of the day, produced its own electricity, had its own water supply, central heating and air conditioning. It provided dormitories and dining hall, showers and baths with warm water, a library and the possibility to have one's clothes disinfected and washed. Almost every room had electric lighting and running water, and the terrazzo floor was easy to clean. Clothes lockers sign. Smoking STRICTLY forbidden. Compared to other shelters run by the church or the government, the homeless here were not forced to work nor required to attend religious services. They could remain anonymous. The police were not allowed to enter the premises. Until 1914, overnight guests were provided with soup and bread in the evenings and coffee and a bread roll in the mornings. This humane treatment of the homeless stood in stark contrast to, e.g., ‚Äò‚Äô, a government- run shelter in Fr√∂belstra√üe, Prenzlauerberg, where homeless persons attempting to stay longer than five nights were sent to a workhouse in Rummelsberg to build irrigation fields outside the city. Or the ‚Äò‚Äô in Reinickendorferstra√üe, Wedding, run on lines dictated by Pastor von Bodelschwingh, who insisted on religious services and required the men to chop wood or break stones for their overnight stay.Ibid, p.31 In 1906, the shelter was extended to provide 882 places for men and 400 for women. The whole shelter was used not only by the homeless but also migrant workers, seasonal harvest workers and domestic workers. At this time, the shelter was providing far more than 300,000 overnight stays per year. At the beginning of the 1st World War, a firm producing canned goods for the army moved into the women's shelter. By its end, the donation-dependent association was in financial difficulties, and its activities came to a halt for the time being. After the war, the men's shelter was used by commercial firmsIbid. and some rooms were used as accommodation for Jewish immigrants from the East. In 1924, the SUM-Vergaser-Gesellschaft produced carburettors for motorbikes and aeroplanes on the site(later ), eventually taking over the whole of the women's shelter. The association was able to reorganise itself in 1926, and the men's shelter reopened, but only with financial help from the state, who insisted on applying the rules of state-run shelters, thus ending the anonymity of its visitors and the independence of the association. State funding ceased in 1931 due to the world financial crisis and the shelter closed forever. In 1933, the ‚ÄòNational Socialist People's Welfare‚Äô (NSV) requisitioned the association's assets. Further industrial tenants moved in, among them a dye firm who produced the party flags for the 1936 Olympic Games (the concrete dyeing vats still stand in the ruin of the former bath and shower room). With the Third Reich's armament policy, SUM became a much larger firm and moved to bigger premises in Michaelkirchstra√üe, Kreuzberg, where forced labour was used to build weapons. Bullet holes from the end of WW II still dot the walls In the early 1940s, a tinned goods firm and the foundry company, Pemietsreider, who made weapons for the German war effort, moved in. Pemetsrieder (previously located in Moabit) was based in the Wiesenburg until 1980. In 1944/45, large parts of the men's dormitories and the washrooms were destroyed by Allied bombing. The administration house and parts of the women's shelter escaped undamaged. Traces of the conflict are still visible; bullet and grenade splinter holes from the last days of the war dot the walls. The building lay on the last main battle line of the surrounded Third Reich capital: the circle line along its northern perimeter, defended by broken-down soldiers from the front, the home guard, policemen and Hitler Youth. In the 1950s, various small companies moved in and bombed-out families lived in the still-standing parts of the shelter.Daniel Gollasch: Wiesenburg: Die Verdr√§ngung aus dem Paradies. Weddingweiser, 28. M√§rz 2015 In the 1980s, an attempt to build high-rise flats on the area was blocked by the Cultural Heritage Office, who added The Wiesenburg to their list of protected buildings. Parts of the remaining buildings fell into disrepair, artists and craftspeople people moved in and repaired the rooms for their own purposes. Spiegel online described the Wiesenburg in 2015 as \\"a dreamy place‚Ä¶ a secret tip. Crumbing walls, wild vines fall over empty windows, a birch tree spreads its roots into a stairway, mysterious doors. (‚Ä¶) A Swedish artist from Stockholm has his studio here, and dancers practise for their performances, an artist builds his wooden sculptures. There is a music studio, a concert room and a huge, wild garden. The city has few such places that are so enchanting.\\" ==Cultural activities== Entrance to the men's shelter with converted round window for the Night of Broken Glass (Kristallnacht) scene in Schl√∂ndorff's 'The Tin Drum' Many figures from the literary and political worlds visited the Wiesenburg during the Weimar Republic to familiarise themselves with the association and become acquainted with the milieu. These visitors included Hans Fallada, whose character, Rieke Busch, a Wedding street urchin, described it as \\"Where the tramps and vagabonds sleep when they don‚Äôt have anywhere else to stay\\", in his book, Ein Mann will nach oben. The Wiesenburg was used as the setting for numerous films. Amongst others, Fritz Lang shot scenes from M and Fritz Weiss from Der Vagabund (1929). In November 1978, the men's reception hall served as the setting for the fire at the Danzig synagogue (also designed by Georg Toebelmann) during the Night of Broken Glass (Kristallnacht) in Volker Schl√∂ndorff‚Äôs The Tin Drum. In the same year, scenes from Hans Fallada's ' and in 1981, Rainer Werner Fassbinder's Lili Marleen were filmed here. ==Planned renovation and reconstruction== After a lengthy dispute about the association‚Äôs legal succession to the Wiesenburg, the courts eventually decided that it belonged to the Berlin state, who transferred it on 1 April 2014 to their municipal housing association, Degewo. At the end of March 2015, they informed the tenants that they would soon close off large parts of the complex as they were no longer secure and were in danger of collapse.Annette K√∂gel: Verfallene Wiesenburg wird jetzt doch saniert. In: Der Tagesspiegel, 4. April 2015 The residents protested against this closure of areas that had developed over the years into spaces for art, culture and out-of-school educational locations for pupils in the district. Nationwide press coverage followed. At the beginning of April 2015, Degewo announced that current tenants would not be required to move out and that each step of the reconstruction would be carried out in dialogue with them.Ulf Teichert: Die eigent√ºmliche Rettung der Wiesenburg. In: Berliner Abendblatt, 16. April 2015 In October 2015, the \\"Soziale Stadt\\" (Social City) committee of the district council held its meeting in the Wiesenburg and unanimously agreed that the association, Die Wiesenburg e.V., and the QM (neighbourhood management) Pankstra√üe should be involved in the planning and development stages.berlin.de (PDF) The association produced a development concept which was highly recommended in the committee meeting and selected for the ‚ÄòPlayers of Change‚Äô conference for innovative urban development ideas in Holzmarkt, Berlin.Players Of Change, Holzmarkt, Berlin, 2015 At the end of November/beginning of December 2015, Degewo closed all studios and workshops ‚Äì again because of an alleged possibility of collapse. Discussions between Degewo and the tenants' statistician and lawyer reversed this decision and they were able to move back in three weeks later. Since January 2016, Degewo has continued to carry out further safety measures so that the current activities on the site can continue without danger to life and limb. In 2018, Degewo plan to start construction of around a hundred flats in the ‚Äògarden‚Äô (the previous site of the men's and women's dormitories). The former reception halls of the men's and the women's shelters will become spaces for cultural activities, and part of the garden will become a ‚Äògreen classroom‚Äô. The studios and workshops will remain and be renovated to a basic standard to avoid sudden high rent rises for the current tenants. ==References== ==External links== * Commons: Asyl f√ºr Obdachlose (Berlin-Gesundbrunnen) ‚Äì collection of image, video and audio data * Asyl f√ºr Obdachlose & Wiesenburg entry in the list of Berlin cultural heritage sites * diewiesenburg.berlin official Homepage of 'Die Wiesenburg e.

He went to Cologne to seek investiture of the regalities from Otto, who granted them in September 1201.In Otto's ensuing conflicts with the Hohenstaufens, he was a loyal supporter. In 1208 he was a potential candidate to become Archbishop of Cologne, one of the three most important sees in Germany, but objections were raised because he spoke no German (which suggests that he spoke only French, Latin and maybe Flemish). In 1209, as a prince of the Empire, he accompanied Otto to Rome for his coronation in St Peter's Basilica as Holy Roman Emperor. At Cambrai, his position was complex. As bishop, he presided over an extensive diocese which covered a large part of present-day Belgium, including important cities like Brussels and stretching as far north as Antwerp. He was also secular lord of the town of Cambrai and prince of the independent principality of Cambr√©sis, which surrounded the city and formed part of the Holy Roman Empire. Relations between the bishops and the inhabitants of the town of Cambrai had often been tense, and in 1212 the townspeople obtained a charter from Otto's rival, Frederick, King of Sicily, granting them rights and privileges which curtailed the power of the bishop and the church. The defeat of Otto and his allies at the Battle of Bouvines in 1214 meant that from then on the major power in the region was France, under the victorious King Philip II, while much of Germany recognised Frederick. Immediately after the battle, in which Philip had captured Ferdinand, Count of Flanders, Jean was one of three bishops asked by his wife Joan, Countess of Flanders, to negotiate the prisoner's ransom and release, but without success. Jean was obliged to waive his loyalty to Otto and to accept the authority of Frederick, swearing him fidelity and obtaining a re-grant of the regalities from his hands. In 1215, Frederick granted Jean a new charter in which he recognised him as a prince of the Empire and as a kinsman. In 1212, on the death of his brother Baldwin without a surviving son, he had inherited the lordship of Chocques near B√©thune. Early in 1219, he joined the Albigensian Crusade, in which King Philip's son Louis led an army south and captured the town of Marmande in June, massacring its inhabitants. The force moved on to besiege Toulouse, which held out, and it was during this engagement that Jean fell ill and died on 27 July. His body was taken back to his diocese and buried in front of the altar in the Cistercian abbey of Vaucelles.Chapter house of Vaucelles ==References== Category:1160s births Category:People from B√©thune Category:12th-century French people Category:13th-century French people Category:13th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Princes of the Holy Roman Empire Category:Bishops of Cambrai Category:Cambrai Category:People of the Albigensian Crusade Category:1219 deaths Category:12th-century people of the Holy Roman Empire Category:13th-century people of the Holy Roman Empire ","title":"Jean de B√©thune"},{"id":"56739527","text":"Georgia Skovgaard, painted by her husband P.C. Skovgaard Georgia Maria Luise Skovgaard n√©e Schouw (1828-1868) was a pioneering Danish embroiderer who is remembered above all for works depicting Danish flora, many of which were based on the artwork of her husband, the Golden Age painter P.C. Skovgaard. After her early death, her designs lived on after her student Kristiane Konstantin-Hansen used them to develop her own embroidery business. ==Biography== Born on 27 September 1828 in Copenhagen, Georgia Maria Luise Schouw was the daughter of the botanist and politician Joakim Frederik Schouw (1789‚Äì1852) and his wife Susanne Marie Augustine Peschier Dalgas (1798‚Äì1844). Brought up in a lively Grundtvegian home among visitors from the Danish world of culture, she was not given a formal education but acquired skills in drawing, painting and needlework from the artists who were friends of her parents. She perfected her skills after marrying the painter P.C. Skovgaard (1817‚Äì75) on 3 September 1851. It was N. F. S. Grundtvig himself who conducted the marriage ceremony at which the bride wore a veil with honeysuckle and wild flowers which she had embroidered herself from a design by Skovgaard. P.C. Skovgaard: Design for Georgia's bridal veil The couple's artistic collaboration continued through their married life, frequently also inspired by artwork from their artist friends. Georgia Skovgaard sketched both classical monuments and naturalistic subjects while travelling in Italy with her husband in 1854‚Äì55. At the 1862 Scandinavian students meeting in Copenhagen, Skovgaard and her team sewed four banners as gifts for the various student associations. She instructed a number of other women in embroidery, first and foremost Kristiane Konstantin-Hansen who, after working for Skovgaard for a period, went on to open her own embroidery business together with Johanne Bindesb√∏ll. It was Skovgaard who introduced the embroidery of Danish flora which was further developed at the beginning of the twentieth century by Gerda Bengtsson. Her husband also encouraged her to embroider depictions of animals including swans, dolphins, and deer which were often used in upholstery. When only 39 years old, Georgia Skovgaard died in Copenhagen on 15 July 1868 while giving birth to a stillborn daughter. She is buried together with her husband in Copenhagen's Assistens Cemetery. Her patterns and designs continued to be used well into the 20th century by the embroiderers Konstantin-Hansen and Bindesb√∏ll. ==Exhibitions== While Skovgaard's works were not exhibited during her lifetime, they featured at the 1895 Copenhagen Women's Exhibition and at the P.C. Skovgaard exhibition at the Kunstforeningen in 1917. More recently, they formed part of the P.C. Skovgaard exhibition at the Skovgaard Museum in Viborg (1967). Georgia Skovgaard was also represented in the embroidery exhibitions at the Danish Museum of Art & Design in 1983 and 1990. ==Family== P.C. Skovgaard: Georgia Skovgaard with sons Joakim and Niels Skovgaard was the mother of three artists: Joakim Skovgaard (1856‚Äì1933), Niels Skovgaard (1858‚Äì1938) and Suzette Holten (1863‚Äì1937). Today there is a museum dedicated to the Skovgaard family. ==References== Category:1828 births Category:1868 deaths Category:Artists from Copenhagen Category:Danish textile artists Category:19th-century Danish artists Category:Danish women artists Category:Danish embroiderers Category:19th-century women textile artists Category:19th-century textile artists ","title":"Georgia Skovgaard"},{"id":"56739568","text":"tabletop RPG Dungeons & Dragons. The gargoyle is a fantasy and horror monster inspired by the gargoyle architectural element. While they were believed in mythology to frighten away evil spirits, the idea of such statues physically coming to life is a more recent notion. Like golems, they are usually made of magically animated or transformed stone, but have animal or chimera traits and are often guardians of a place such as a cathedral or castle. They can also be depicted as vessels for demonic possession or as a living species resembling statues. ==Description== ===As evil constructs=== The notion of gargoyles as supernatural constructs brought to life by evil was introduced in Maker of Gargoyles (1932), a short pulp fiction story by Clark Ashton Smith where Reynard, a medieval stonemason, unconsciously infuses his hate and lust into two gargoyles that attack the town of Vyones and later kill him when he attempts to destroy them. In the novelette Conjure Wife (1943) by Fritz Lieber, a dragon sculpture is animated by a witch and sent to kill an archaeology professor. Such gargoyles also entered science fiction, such as in the Doctor Who episode The Daemons (1971). ===As demonic vessels=== The notion of gargoyles as demonic vessels was introduced in The Horn of Vapula (Lewis Spence, 1932), in which a demon familiar is bound into a horned and goatlike gargoyle. Gargoyles appear as horned canine statues in the movie Ghostbusters (1984), where they are possessed by the demonic spirits of Zuul and Vinz Klortho. Gargoyles may also appear as vessels for formerly human souls, such as the Marvel Comics hero Gargoyle, who later is able to transform back into a human. ===As a race of beings resembling statues=== The 1908 children's book Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz featured a Land of the Gargoyles, wooden creatures with hinged wings. The film Gargoyles (1972) depicted a fictional race created by Satan to harry mankind. A species of gargoyles also exists in Dungeons & Dragons. Movies featuring races of gargoyle-like creatures include Gargoyle (2004) and Rise of the Gargoyles (2009), in which the creatures can lay eggs and turn into statues to blend in. === Friendly gargoyles === The notion of a friendly gargoyle was created by the Disney show Gargoyles (1994‚Äì1997) in which gargoyles battle monsters to protect humanity. It originates from the folk belief of gargoyles as protectors. Friendly gargoyles also appear in the Discworld universe, such as Constable Downspout in Feet of Clay (1996), and in Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996), as Hugo, Victor and Laverne, who embody Quasimodo's subconscious. ==In popular culture== Gargoyles have occupied a prominent place in film, television, and gaming due to their distinctive characteristics. ===Film and television=== Gargoyles is an American animated television series produced by Walt Disney Television and distributed by Buena Vista Television, and originally aired from October 24, 1994, to February 15, 1997. The series features a species of nocturnal creatures known as gargoyles that turn to stone during the day. After spending a thousand years in an enchanted petrified state, the gargoyles (who have been transported from medieval Scotland) are reawakened in modern- day New York City, and take on roles as the city's secret night-time protectors. Gargoyles was noted for its relatively dark tone, complex story arcs, and melodrama; character arcs were heavily employed throughout the series, as were Shakespearean themes. The series also received favorable comparisons to Batman: The Animated Series. A video game adaptation and a spin-off comic series were released in 1995. The show's storyline continued from 2006 to 2009 in a comic book series of the same title, produced by Slave Labor Graphics. IGN ranked Gargoyles 45th place on its 2009 list of top 100 animated series, stating: \\"A decent success at the time, Gargoyles has maintained a strong cult following since it ended more than a decade ago\\". Hollywood.com featured it on their 2010 list of six cartoons that should be movies. UGO.com included it on their 2011 top list of legendary medieval and fantasy TV shows. The third season of the TV series Riverdale features a monstrous antagonist known as the \\"Gargoyle King.\\" ===Comics=== Gargoyle is a name shared by two fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The first Gargoyle, Yuri Topolov, appears in The Incredible Hulk #1 (May 1962), and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. The first Gargoyle received an entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition #17, where his real name was revealed. The second Gargoyle, Isaac Christians, is a human/demon composite and a member of the Defenders. He was created by writer J. M. DeMatteis and artist Don Perlin. Perlin's design was inspired by a sequence in Prince Valiant in which the titular hero disguises himself as a gargoyle. During his long run on The Defenders, Gargoyle also was the co-star of Marvel Team-Up #119, written by his co-creator DeMatteis, who later described the issue as \\"one of my favorite favorite stories\\". In 1985 Marvel published a four-issue Gargoyle limited series, written by DeMatteis and drawn by Mark Badger. DeMatteis said of the series, \\"It was a psychological fantasy. You take the interior life and make it concrete... give it substance... and play with it.\\" ===Gaming=== ====Dungeons & Dragons==== In the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game, a gargoyle is a grotesque winged monstrous humanoid creature, with a horned head and a stony hide. The gargoyle was one of the first monsters introduced in the earliest edition of the game, in the Dungeons & Dragons \\"white box\\" set (1974), where they were described as a reptilian bipedal beast, Chaotic in alignment.Gygax, Gary, and Dave Arneson. Dungeons & Dragons (3-Volume Set) (TSR, 1974) The kopoacinth, an aquatic version of the gargoyle, first appeared in the 1975 Dungeons & Dragons supplement, Blackmoor by Dave Arneson.Arneson, Dave. Blackmoor (TSR, 1975) The gargoyle appears in the first edition Monster Manual (1977),Gygax, Gary. Monster Manual (TSR, 1977) where it is described as a ferocious predator of a magical nature, found among ruins; it attacks anything it can detect. The marlgoyle, a more horrid form of gargoyle, first appears in the module Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth (1982),Gygax, Gary. The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth (TSR, 1982) and later appears in Monster Manual II (1983) as the margoyle.Gygax, Gary. Monster Manual II (TSR, 1983) This edition of the D&D; game included its own version of the gargoyle, in the Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set (1977, 1981, 1983).Gygax, Gary, and Dave Arneson [1974], edited by J. Eric Holmes. Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set (TSR, 1977)Gygax, Gary, and Dave Arneson [1974], edited by Tom Moldvay. Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set (TSR, 1981)Gygax, Gary, and Dave Arneson [1974], edited by Frank Mentzer. Dungeons & Dragons Set 1: Basic Rules (TSR, 1983) The gargoyle was also later featured in the Dungeons & Dragons Game set (1991), the Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia (1991),Allston, Aaron, Steven E. Schend, Jon Pickens, and Dori Watry. Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia (TSR, 1991) and the Classic Dungeons & Dragons Game set (1994). The gargoyle and margoyle also appear first in the Monstrous Compendium Volume Two (1989),Cook, David, et al. Monstrous Compendium Volume Two (TSR, 1989) and are reprinted in the Monstrous Manual (1993),Stewart, Doug, ed. Monstrous Manual (TSR, 1993) along with the kapoacinth. The Greyhawk campaign setting module Gargoyle (1989) featured the gargoyle (of the Tors). In Gargoyle, set in the City of Greyhawk, the player characters are hired by a pair of gargoyles to find their stolen wings. The grist (true gargoyle) appeared in Vale of the Mage (1990). The guardgoyle for the Forgotten Realms setting appeared in the Ruins of Zhentil Keep boxed set (1995). Four variant gargoyles appeared in the \\"Dragon's Bestiary\\" column of Dragon #223 (November 1995), including the archer, the grandfather plaque, the spouter, and the stone lion.Baichtal, John. \\"The Dragon's Bestiary: Four Guardian Gargoyles.\\" Dragon #223 (TSR, 1995) These creatures were reprinted in Monstrous Compendium Annual Three (1996). The gargoyle and kapoacinth appear in the Monster Manual for the 3.0 edition (2000‚Äì2002),Cook, Monte, Jonathan Tweet, and Skip Williams. Monster Manual (Wizards of the Coast, 2000) and in the revised Monster Manual for 3.5 edition (2003‚Äì2007). The guardgoyle returned in City of Splendors: Waterdeep (2005). The gargoyle appears in the Monster Manual for the 4th edition (2008‚Äì2014), including the nabassu gargoyle.Mearls, Mike, Stephen Schubert, and James Wyatt. Monster Manual (Wizards of the Coast, 2008) Ordinarily, gargoyles are stone statues carved into a demonic shape and imbued with life by magical means, akin to a golem. However, their descriptions in the official source materials are sometimes unprecise and even conflicting; in the 2nd edition Monstrous Compendium, for instance, their stats summary lists their diet as carnivorous, while the description of their ecology explains that a gargoyle requires neither food or water to survive. In some D&D-related; works, gargoyles and their kin (see Variants, below) are even erroneously depicted as biological creatures capable of natural reproduction.Culotta, Paul: \\"Huzza's Goblin O'War\\". Dungeon Magazine #63 (January/February 1997), pp. 30‚Äì33. A gargoyle is usually chaotic evil. Gargoyles are sentient, cunning, and malevolent to the extreme. Their favorite sport is to capture intelligent beings and slowly torture them to death. Due to its stone body, a gargoyle has the ability to hold itself so still that it appears to be a statue. Standard gargoyles possess wings which give them flight capability. The gargoyle is fully detailed in Paizo Publishing's book Classic Horrors Revisited (2009), on pages 16‚Äì21.Jacobs, James, Rob McCreary, and F. Wesley Schneider. Classic Horrors Revisited (Paizo, 2009)\\\\ ====Video games==== Gargoyle's Quest: Ghosts 'n Goblins is an action-adventure game for the original Game Boy. Developed by Capcom, it was released on May 2, 1990, in Japan, then North America in July, and lastly Europe in 1991. The playable character Red Arremer (Firebrand in the U.S.) made his debut in the video game series Ghosts 'n Goblins as an antagonist character, of which this is a spin-off. Gargoyle's Quest was followed by the NES prequel Gargoyle's Quest II in 1992 and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System sequel Demon's Crest in 1994. According to the fictional game lore, Firebrand is a gargoyle predestined to carry on the namesake and identity of the Red Blaze ‚Äì the powerful force that fought back the Destroyers long before this game takes place. As his destiny foretold, Firebrand saves the Ghoul Realm from brutal conquest by traversing the Ghoul Realm, building his powers, and preparing to fight against the Destroyers' king, Breager, so as to ensure the protection of the Ghoul Realm once more. Gargoyle's Quest was warmly received by contemporary and later critics alike, and sold well enough to warrant a prequel on the NES only two years later. The Yuri Topolov version of Gargoyle appears in the Lego Marvel's Avengers video game. A video game adaptation of the Disney TV series, Gargoyles, was released in 1995. ===Others=== Animatronic gargoyle statues are a popular Halloween or haunted attraction commodity. == References == Category:Fictional monsters Monster ","title":"Gargoyle (monster)"},{"id":"56739596","text":"Michal ≈†ilhav√Ω (born 29 May 1976) is a Czech retired football player and coach. ==Vietnam== Moving to Th·ªÉ C√¥ng of the V.League 1 through his Hungarian mentor at Budapest Honv√©d, Silhavy was surprised at the penurious state of locals there≈†ilhav√Ω: Ve Vietnamu jezd√≠m jen tax√≠kem Idnes.cz and did not settle in well in his first few months, despite earning a salary higher than what he had in the Czech lower leagues.≈†ilhav√Ω: fotbal hraje ve Vietnamu Isport.cz One of five foreign imports, the Czech goalkeeper mixed with two Brazilians, a Hungarian and a Cameroonian, helping The Cong get 14 points from their first seven rounds.

Her work has been associated with an avant-garde language that drew apart from the Pictorialist tradition that was in vogue at the beginning of the 20th century, due to the capture of geometric forms, the presence of foreground elements, and the process of overprinting. == Artistic trajectory == Aurora Eugenia Latap√≠ was born in Mexico, in 1911. In 1926, when she was fifteen years old, she returned from a trip in Europe with a camera that had been given to her by her mother, Aurora Est√©vez de Latap√≠.Rodr√≠guez, Jos√© Antonio. \\"Aurora Eugenia Latap√≠, una fot√≥grafa vanguardista\\" In Alquimia.

In an interview published in Alquimia magazine in the year 2000, she explains she began taking photographs as a hobby: ‚ÄúI enjoyed taking pictures, and since my mother liked it, I took them.‚ÄùRodr√≠guez, Jos√© Antonio. \\"Aurora Eugenia Latap√≠.

For this reason, she started studying photography at the American Photo Supply Co and at the industrial school Malina X√≥chit. A few years later, she was admitted at the Academy of San Carlos, where she studied with the renowned Mexican photographer Agust√≠n Jim√©nez. In December 1929 she participated in the group show Guillermo Toussaint y 11 fot√≥grafos mexicanos en la Galer√≠a de Arte Mexicano at the National Theater (now Palacio de Bellas Artes) in Mexico City. The exhibit was organized by Carlos M√©rida and Carlos Orozco Romero, and it featured works by sculptor Guillermo Toussaint, photographers Manuel √Ålvarez Bravo, Hugo Brehme, Rafael Garc√≠a, Librado Garc√≠a Smart, Agust√≠n Jim√©nez, Ricardo Mantel, Luis M√°rquez, Juan Oc√≥n and Roberto Turnbull, as well as Aurora Eugenia and her mother Aurora Latap√≠. Criticism of the show was positive and, according to Jos√© Antonio Rodr√≠guez, this exhibition allowed Latap√≠ to formally enter the Mexican photography scene, which was still ruled by the already weak Pictorialist style. In November 1931, during her first year at San Carlos, she showed 50 pictures in the Exposici√≥n Fotogr√°fica Jim√©nez-Latap√≠ at Galer√≠a Exc√©lsior, along with Agust√≠n Jim√©nez. Latap√≠ exhibited still lifes portraying organic materials or industrial objects, which allowed her to experiment with different mechanical processes such as overprinting negatives, and which she would push toward abstraction. In this second exhibition, her work spoke an avant-garde language that reflected, according to Jos√© Antonio Rodr√≠guez, a more ‚Äúmature‚Äù approach toward photography. On this occasion, the critics‚Äô opinion was divided. On the one hand, Latap√≠'s and Jim√©nez's works were praised by some for ‚Äúaccurately expressing the aesthetic inquiries of our time‚Äù.Del R√≠o, Carlos. ‚ÄúDos artistas: Agust√≠n Jim√©nez y Aurora Eugenia Latap√≠‚Äù In Revista de revistas.

On the other hand, an anonymous review was printed in Helios magazine (published by the Asociaci√≥n de Fot√≥grafos de M√©xico, where the most influential Pictorialist photographers of Mexico came together), in which both photographers were accused of imitating the work of Edward Weston and Tina Modotti.\\"La exposici√≥n Jim√©nez-Latap√≠.\\" Helios: Revista mensual fotogr√°fica (M√©xico) 2, no.17 (December, 1931): 6 It was common then, for Mexico-based photographers, like Weston and Modotti, but also like Latap√≠, Agust√≠n Jim√©nez, and Lola and Manuel √Ålvarez Bravo to capture aspects of Mexican culture and landscape, as well as valuing high contrasts and compositional rhythms in photography, so it was frequent to find these similarities in photos taken by many artists in Mexico during those years. In December 1931, La Tolteca, a Mexican cement company, and the newspaper Exc√©lsior, organized a painting, drawing and photography contest, around the topic of the recently built and inaugurated cement factory in Mexico City's area of Mixcoac. The winning works were to be exhibited at the National Theater in an exhibition called La Tolteca. Aurora Eugenia Latap√≠ was awarded fourth place with the picture Chalchiuhtlanetzin (the first place was won by Manuel √Ålvarez Bravo; Agust√≠n Jim√©nez won second; and third was awarded to Lola √Ålvarez Bravo). Once again, the jury's decision, which Diego Rivera was part of, was widely criticized in Helios magazine by members of the Asociaci√≥n de Fot√≥grafos de M√©xico.‚ÄúAlgo sobre la exposici√≥n de La Tolteca.‚Äù Helios: Revista mensual fotogr√°fica (M√©xico) 3, no.18 (January, 1932): 2-3. Latap√≠'s series ‚ÄúLa Tolteca‚Äù (1931) presents different views of the cement factory. Many of the photos show architectural structures covered with cement: a great wall with attached cylinders, grids, chimneys, towers; all of which contrast with metallic scaffolds, staircases and pipes. This large industrial landscape, however, is deprived of human form so, when one of the untitled photos shows someone climbing a scaffold tower in front of an architectural structure with three concrete cylinders and doors in the lower part, it becomes exceptional. As in other photographs by Latap√≠, the framing in the pictures of this series is mostly diagonal, and the closely captured large structures tend to exceed the limits of the frame. In this sense, and also due to the contrast between shadows and highlights, these compositions tend toward geometric abstraction. After this show, Latap√≠'s work was featured in many magazines, like Jueves de Exc√©lsior, Revista de revistas and Nuestro M√©xico, but according to Jos√© Antonio Rodr√≠guez, it disappeared from the public sphere my the mid-1930s.Rodr√≠guez, Jos√© Antonio. \\"Aurora Eugenia Latap√≠, una fot√≥grafa vanguardista\\" In Alquimia. Sistema Nacional de Fototecas. Jan-Apr 2015, year 18, number 53. Number entitled Precursoras en la imagen fotogr√°fica, p. 65. Emma Cecilia Garc√≠a Krinsky, nonetheless, points out that the photographs Latap√≠ took between the 1930s and 40s were very important for avant-garde photography in Mexico. In 1950, she was the first woman to become a member of the Club Fotogr√°fico de M√©xico: ‚ÄúI was sent out to develop, to do anything because they didn‚Äôt think I could do photography. So I took my photos to the right person, they liked it, and came up with something that they should not have done, put my photos in different classes [categories], to top it off I won a price in all of them. That‚Äôs why the men, as I was the first woman to enter, made me see my luck‚Äù.Rodr√≠guez, Jos√© Antonio. \\"Aurora Eugenia Latap√≠, una intuici√≥n vanguardista\\" In Alquimia. Sistema Nacional de Fototecas. Ene-abr 2000, year 3, number 8. Number entitled Fot√≥grafas en M√©xico 1880-1955, pp. 37, 38. By the end of that year, Latap√≠ founded the Sal√≥n Femenil (the Women Salon) of the Club Fotogr√°fico de M√©xico, of which she would later become president. During the 1950s and 60s, Latap√≠ opened the commercial photographic studio ‚ÄúFoto Cui‚Äù in the Polanco neighbourhood, in Mexico City. In 1961 she received an honorable mention in the National Photography Contest ‚ÄúAs√≠ es M√©xico‚Äù, and in 1963 she had her last solo show in the same contest. After that and due to her husband's business activity she moved to the United States, but later returned to Mexico City where she died September 4, 2000. == Work == In most of her photographs, Latap√≠ used diagonal frames that make the captured objects and buildings exit the compositional space. The general composition of most of her photos is guided by strong, multiple and/or parallel diagonal axis that, along with shadows and highlights, provide the pictures with movement and depth. Diagonal frames, close-ups, rhythm and contrasts between shadows and highlights, also create geometric patterns that render some of the images abstract. Her preferred technique was gelatin silver.

Typically, types of permissions cover functions that may have privacy implications, such as the ability to access a device's hardware features (including the camera and microphone), and personal data (such as device storage, the contacts list, and the user's present geographical location). Permissions are typically declared in an application's manifest, and certain permissions must be specifically granted at runtime by the user‚Äîwho may revoke the permission at any time. Permission systems are common on mobile operating systems, where permissions needed by specific apps must be disclosed via the platform's app store. == Mobile devices == On mobile operating systems for smartphones and tablets, typical types of permissions regulate: * Access to storage and personal information, such as contacts, calendar appointments, etc. * Location tracking. * Access to the device's internal camera and/or microphone. * Access to biometric sensors, including fingerprint readers and other health sensors.. * internet access. * Access to communications interfaces (including their hardware identifiers and signal strength where applicable, and requests to enable them), such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Near-field communication (NFC), and others. * Making and receiving phone calls. * Sending and reading text messages * The ability to perform in-app purchases. * The ability to \\"overlay\\" themselves within other apps. * Installing, deleting and otherwise managing applications. * Authentication tokens (i.e. OAuth ones) of web services stored in system storage for sharing between apps. Prior to Android 6.0 \\"Marshmallow\\", permissions were automatically granted to apps at runtime, and they were presented upon installation in Google Play Store. Since Marshmallow, certain permissions now require the app to request permission at runtime by the user. These permissions may also be revoked at any time via Android's settings menu. Usage of permissions on Android are sometimes abused by app developers to gather personal information and deliver advertising; in particular, apps for using a phone's camera flash as a flashlight (which have grown largely redundant due to the integration of such functionality at the system level on later versions of Android) have been known to require a large array of unnecessary permissions beyond what is actually needed for the stated functionality. iOS imposes a similar requirement for permissions to be granted at runtime, with particular controls offered for enabling of Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and location tracking. == WebPermissions == WebPermissions is a permission system for web browsers. When a web application needs some data behind a permission, it must request it first. When it does it, a user sees a window asking him to make a choice. The choice is remembered, but can be cleared lately. Currently the following resources are controlled: * geolocation * desktop notifications * service workers * sensors ** audio capturing devices, like soundcards, and their model names and characteristics ** video capturing devices, like cameras, and their identifiers and characteristics == Analysis == The permission-based access control model assigns access privileges for certain data objects to apps. This is a derivate of the discretionary access control model. The access permissions are usually granted in the context of a specific user on a specific device. Permissions are granted permanently with few automatic restrictions. In some cases permissions are implemented in 'all- or-nothing' approach: a user either has to grant all the requested permissions to an app, or be unable to use the app. It remains intransparent to the user when the permission is used by a program or app to access the data protected by the permission access control mechanism. Even if a user can revoke a permission, the app can blackmail a user by refusing to operate, for example by just crashing. The permission mechanism has been widely criticized by researchers for several reasons, including; * Intransparency of personal data extraction and surveillance, including the creation of a false sense of security;Moen, Gro Mette, Ailo Krogh Ravna, and Finn Myrstad: Deceived by Design - How tech companies use dark patterns to discourage us from exercising our rights to privacy., 2018, Consumer council of Norway / Forbrukerr√•det. Report. https://www.forbrukerradet.no/undersokelse/no- undersokelsekategori/deceived-by-design * End-user fatigue of micro-managing access permissions leading to a fatalistic acceptance of surveillance and intransparency; * Massive data extraction and personal surveillance carried out once the permissions are granted. There are some solutions, such as XPrivacy, which instead of providing access to the requested data instead of throwing an exception and crashing an app returning disinformation to make an app operate as if the permission was granted. Mockdroid is another instance of this approach. It is also possible to use static analysis to analyze the requested permissions. Further transparency methods include longitudinal behavioural profiling and multiple-source privacy analysis of app data access. == References == Category:Computer security models Category:Application software ","title":"Application permissions"},{"id":"56739685","text":"Jaroslav J√≠lek is a male former international table tennis player from Czechoslovakia.

However, a deserter informed the hetman Rozhinsky of the strength of the Russian army, the location of the regiments, and also their unwillingness to fight for Tsar Vasily IV. Rozhinsky moved his reserves into the flank of the Russian army and resorted to cunning, ordering the inclusion of carts in this detachment, putting the battle banners on them, so that Russian soldiers would think that the army of False Dmitri was much larger.

He was one of the best two-year-olds in England in 1928 when he won five of his seven races including the New Stakes, July Stakes, Lavant Stakes and Prendergast Stakes. In the following spring he took the Severals Stakes before recording his biggest success in the 2000 Guineas. He failed when favourite for the Epsom Derby but returned to form to win the St James's Palace Stakes. His performances subsequently deteriorated and he was retired from racing at the end of the year. He made little impact as a breeding stallion. ==Background== Mr Jinks was a \\"massive\\" grey horse with \\"big, spreading feet\\" bred in Northern Ireland by Dermot McCalmont who owned the horse during his racing career. He was trained by McCalmont's cousin Henry Seymour \\"Atty\\" Persse at Chattis Hill near Stockbridge in Hampshire. As a three-year-old Mr Jinks stood 16 hands high with a girth of 73 inches. Mr Jinks inherited his grey colour from his sire Tetratema, the leading British two-year-old of 1919 who went on to win the 2000 Guineas and many important sprint races. As a breeding stallion, Tetratema sired many good sprinters and milers including Tiffin and Myrobella and was the British champion sire in 1929. Mr Jinks' dam False Piety was a granddaughter of Alicia, whose other female-line descendants included the Nunthorpe Stakes winner Golden Cloud. Although a character named Mr Jinks appears in The Pickwick Papers, the horse was reportedly named after John Jinks, a former mayor of Sligo. ==Racing career== ===1928: two-year-old season=== Mr Jinks had acquired a considerable reputation before he ever appeared on a racecourse and when he made his debut in the New Stakes at Royal Ascot in June many \\"eager\\" spectators crowded the paddock to see the \\"powerful, strong-quartered, big-limbed colt.\\" Ridden by Harry Beasley he duly took the race at odds of 9/4, recovering from a poor start to win \\"in the stle of an exceedingly useful colt\\" from Lord Astor's Cragadour. He was then sent to Sandown to contest the five furlong National Breeders' Produce Stakes, which at the time was the most valuable race of the season for two-year-olds, with prize money of over ¬£7,000. He started joint-favourite but was beaten into second place by the filly Tiffin. In July at Newmarket Racecourse Mr Jinks returned to winning form whe he won the July Stakes at odds of 4/11, beating the Coventry Stakes winner Reflector by half a length, and went on to win the Lavant Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse in August by a short head from the filly Turbine, to whom he was conceding 10 pounds. Mr Jinks came back in autumn to take the Prendergast Stakes at Newmarket at odds of 13/8 and finished second to Reflector in the Buckenham Post Produce Stakes. Mr Jinks ended his season by winning the Hurst Park Two-year-old Stakes in November. He ended the season with earnings of ¬£8,800 and was rated the joint-best juvenile colt of the season, equal with the Middle Park Stakes winner Costaki Pasha and a pound behind Tiffin. ===1929: three-year-old season=== Mr Jinks' sire Tetratema Mr Jinks began his second season by winning the Severals Stakes over five furlongs at Newmarket on 17 April. On 1 May, Mr Jinks, ridden by Beasley, started the 5/2 favourite for the 121st running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket. The best fancied of the other 21 runners included Costaki Pasha, Gay Day, Cragadour and the Irish colt Trigo. The final stages saw the race evolve into a struggle between Mr Jinks and Cragadour, who were racing far apart on either side of the wide, straight course. Mr Jinks prevailed by a head from Cragadour, with Gay Day a length and a half away in third. After the race Beasley said \\"My horse was a bit lively at the post, but once away lie ran as smootha race as possible. I was about three lengths behind the leaders at the Bushes, and moved up to take the lead in the bottom of the Dip. After that I was not headed again\\". Mr Jinks was then moved up in distance for the Newmarket Stakes (a trial race for the Epsom Derby) on 15 May. In a very close and \\"exciting\\" finish he was beaten a short head by Lord Derby's Hunter's Moon, with Midlothian in third place. Despite his defeat in the Newmarket Stakes and doubts about his stamina, Mr Jinks started favourite for the Derby over one and a half miles at Epsom on 5 June but began to struggle at half way and finished eleventh behind Trigo. Later that month at Royal Ascot the colt was dropped back in distance for the one-mile St James's Palace Stakes and won \\"very comfortaby\\" from seven opponents at odds of 6/4. After his win at Ascot, Mr Jinks began to be described as a \\"speed specialist\\". The colt was generally expected to follow up in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood and started at odds of 4/7 but finished fourth behind Le Phare. In September Mr Jinks finished tailed-off in last behind Trigo in the St Leger Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse. Mr Jinks won one other minor race towards the end of the year and ended the season with earnings of ¬£16,253, making him the second most financially successful racehorse of 1929. ==Assessment and honours== In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Mr Jinks an \\"inferior\\" winner of the 2000 Guineas. ==Stud record== After his retirement from racing Mr Jinks stood as a breeding stallion. He made a fairly promising start to his stud career, but his later record was disappointing. He died in 1952 at the age of 26. ==Pedigree== *Mr Jinks was inbred 4 √ó 4 to Bona Vista, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree. ==References== Category:1926 racehorse births Category:1952 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 22-d Category:2000 Guineas winners ","title":"Mr Jinks"},{"id":"56739846","text":"Frances Miller Mumaugh, \\"A woman of the century\\" Frances Miller Mumaugh (July 11, 1860 ‚Äì 1933) was an American still-life painter. She exhibited an oil, A Dreamer, at the World's Congress of Representative Women of the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, 1893; and was also an exhibitor at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, 1904. ==Early years and education== Frances Miller was born in Newark, New York, July 11, 1860. She was a descendant of an old Lutheran family from Saxony. Her childhood was passed in the Genesee Valley. When a mere child, her artistic faculty attracted the attention of her teachers. She was educated in the public schools, but without instruction in her special line, in which she continued to show development. ==Career== In 1879, she married John E. Mumaugh, of Omaha, Nebraska, where they afterward resided. She was soon identified with western art and artists. Broad in her ideas, she was not a follower of any particular school, and sought for herself nature's inspirations. Thrown on her own resources in 1885, with a two-year- old daughter to care for, worked diligently to be a recognized western artists. With the exception of a course of study in water-color under Jules Gu√©rin, of Chicago, a summer course in oil with Dwight Frederick Boyden, of Paris, as well as a course with William Merritt Chase, her progress was due almost entirely to her own efforts. She delighted in landscapes, in which line she was always successful. She also designed holiday cards and gift tags for large firms, finding a big demand for them. Mumaugh kept a studio in Omaha's Paxton block. As a teacher, her classes were always full.

Angnaqquaq's work explores textile creations while experimenting with non-traditional methods. Her style has been described as painterly for the way in which she fills the space between her figures and animals with embroidery. == Early life == Angrnaqquaq was born in 1916 in the Northwest Territories, Canada in a traditional nomadic camp. She and her younger siblings were raised by their father after their mother died young. She lived a traditional Inuit lifestyle until the early she and her family moved to Baker Lake, Northwest Territories (now in Nunavut) in the 1950s to avoid poverty and starvation. Her son Harold worked at the sewing center in the late 1960s. In Baker Lake, Angrnaqquaq explored textile and mixed-media art practices where she used stitching as a method for creating figures in fabrics. Angrnaqquaq obtained fabrics through Jack and Sheila Butler, visiting art advisors to the Baker Lake region. == Career == After establishing an art practice in which Angrnaqquaq explored figures of landscapes, animals, and textures through herringbone stitching, she began showing her works at Art Institutions around Canada. After establishing her art practice in textiles throughout Canada, Angenaqquaq was commissioned to create a public art commission for the Post Office at Wakefield, Ontario through the Public Works Department in 1976. Her work has been exhibited throughout North America, specifically in Toronto, San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, and Winnipeg in both private and public commissions.Animals and People (2000) Angrnaqquaq worked well into her 80s, producing her last work in 2000. The work, entitled Animals and People, explores bright colours and the situation of animal forms within an abstracted landscape. Animals and People was rendered in the same herringbone stitch which Angrnaqquaq was known for. Angrnaqquaq died in 2003. ==Permanent collections== * National Gallery of Canada * Winnipeg Art Gallery * Canada Council Art Bank == List of temporary exhibitions == * \\"Eskimo Wallhangings\\", McIntosh Gallery, University of Western Ontario * \\"Baker Lake Wallhangings 1976\\", The Guild Shop * \\"Baker Lake Wallhangings 1978\\", The Inuit Gallery of Eskimo Art * \\"Artisans '78\\", Canadian Crafts Council Northwest Territories * \\"Baker Lake Prints, Sculpture, Wallhangings\\", The Raven * \\"Baker Lake Wallhangings 1979\\", The Arctic Circle * \\"Baker Lake Wallhangings 1979\\", Kaiser House Gallery * \\"Baker Lake Wallhangings 1979\\", Vancouver Art Gallery * \\"Baker Lake Wallhangings 1980\\", Margot Galleries * \\"Baker Lake Wallhangings 1981\\", Inuit Gallery of Vancouver * \\"Baker Lake Wallhangings 1981\\", Tundra Gallery * \\"Keewatin District Wallhangings 1979\\", Kaiser House Gallery * \\"Mary Wolf Ceramics and Canadian Eskimo Wallhangings\\", Franz Bader Gallery * \\"The Spirit of the Land\\", The Koffler Gallery * \\"Wallhangings Embroidered and Appliqued by Elizabeth Angrnatquaq of Baker Lake\\", The Inuit Gallery of Eskimo Art * \\"Embroidered and Appliqued Wallhangings by Elizabeth Angrnatquaq\\", The Inuit Gallery of Eskimo Art * \\"Spirits and Dreams - Arts of the Inuit of Baker Lake\\", Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development * \\"Baker Lake Wallhangings\\", The Inuit Gallery of Eskimo Art * \\"Elizabeth Angrnaqquaq Wall Hangings\\", The Upstairs Gallery * \\"Embroidered and Appliqued Wallhangings from Baker Lake\\", The Inuit Gallery of Eskimo Art * \\"Women of the North: An Exhibition of art by Inuit Women of the Canadian Arctic\\", Marion Scott Gallery * \\"Northern Lights: Inuit Textile Art from the Canadian Arctic\\", Baltimore Museum of Art * \\"Arctic Mystery, Harmony and Transformation, Baker Lake Textile Art\\", Art Gallery of the Canadian Embassy ==References== Category:Inuit textile artists Category:1916 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Canadian Inuit women Category:Artists from Nunavut Category:20th-century Canadian women artists Category:21st-century Canadian women artists Category:Inuit from the Northwest Territories Category:Inuit from Nunavut Category:Women textile artists Category:People from Baker Lake ","title":"Elizabeth Angrnaqquaq"},{"id":"56739900","text":"Parable of the Polygons is a 2014 explorable explanation created by Vi Hart and Nicky Case. The article focuses on a society of blue squares and yellow triangles which have slight personal biases against diversity, which leads to social segregation. It is based on game theorist Thomas Schelling's papers about residential segregation. The article was well-received, especially its visual and playable aspects, and was called a useful educational tool for topics like racial segregation. == Content == upright=1.3 The article is an interactive blog post, \\"part story and part game\\". It has a model consisting of a society of blue squares and yellow triangles, presented in a grid. At the top of the article, a crowd of triangles and squares are wiggling. Just under, it says, \\"This is a story of how harmless choices can make a harmful world.\\" The article first demonstrates step-by-step how institutional bias can occur even when there is little personal bias against diversity, and individuals are well-intentioned. The article describes the squares and triangles as \\"slightly shapist\\". In the first example, a square or triangle is happy only if at least a third of its neighbors are of the same shape as it is. The shapes merely adopt a meh face in a homogeneous neighborhood. At this point, the article lets the reader interact with the model. The reader's goal is to make all residents happy with where they live, by moving only unhappy shapes. At first, the bias is easily managed; however, as the population grows, the shapes' bias quickly leads to visually segregated areas. The article reads: \\"Sometimes a neighborhood just becomes square, and it's not their fault if no triangles wanna stick around. And a triangular neighborhood would welcome a square, but they can't help it if squares ain't interested.\\" The reader can later execute automated simulations, and increase and decrease the shapes' bias. When the bias is increased, the segregation is more prominent. A subsequent iteration of the game shows that decreasing bias does not make a difference if the population started out segregated. Shapes then have to reject the default scenario of segregation in favor of seeking out the other shapes. Finally, the reader can generate new models using a sandbox. The article departs from Schelling's work by discussing a demand for \\"even the smallest bit of diversity\\" which reverses residential segregation; Case said that the article teaches that such segregation is \\"easily offset\\" with a \\"small amount of anti- bias\\", even if bias is still present. The article also departs from Schelling by concluding with encouraging words on how to enact change. The article concludes with: \\"If you're all triangles, you're missing out on some amazing squares in your life ‚Äì that's unfair to everyone. Reach out, beyond your immediate neighbors.\\" == Development and release == Vi Hart and Nicky Case, creator of Coming Out Simulator 2014, teamed up following a talk on the lack of tech event diversity and women in STEM delivered by Hart, which convinced Case \\"of the necessity of active measures\\". The article applies ideas from game theorist and economist Thomas Schelling's 1978 paper Micromotives and Macrobehaviour which describes how small personal bias against diversity leads to greater segregation in the general population. It is also based on Schelling's 1971 paper Dynamic Models of Segregation. Case described Schelling's model as \\"perfect ‚Äì simple and fun to play\\"; Schelling played his own model on a chess board or graph paper with nickels and dimes, moving them one by one. Case said that he was \\"fascinated with taking models/systems from the arts [and] humanities, and translating them into game models/systems\\". The second part of the article was based on a \\"new surprising aspect of Schelling's model\\", which introduced a nonconformity bias. Case said that by playing around with variables, they found that \\"just as a small bias can turn a society segregated, a small anti-bias can reverse that\\". Hart said they knew that nonconformity would mix up the population, but that they were \\"pleasantly surprised to see it work even [at a] very minimum level\\". Case said that the article ends on an \\"optimistic note\\" that \\"small local changes really can change institutions from the bottom-up\\". Development of the article began in September 2014. The goal of Parable of the Polygons was for readers to \\"learn to demand diversity\\". People are represented by abstract shapes because marking their races and genders would be \\"really weird\\" and \\"have the unfortunate implication that [the races and genders] are binary and immutable\\". A triangle was chosen because it appears in Hart's videos. The article contains few words, and the ability to move shapes is introduced \\"slowly and deliberately\\". Hart said that they felt that \\"it was important to start with moving the shapes by hand, so that later when shapes move automatically [the reader would know] there's nothing going on behind [their] back\\". The article provides readers with interactive sections governed by simple rules to help them prove the counter-intuitive results to themselves. Case said that there was \\"an effort made to keep players from being scared off by the big stuff\\"; thus, the article includes jokes, slang, and \\"cute and friendly shapes\\". Hart said that they wanted to make sure to explain systemic bias without changing the readers' \\"minds\\". Case said that a main message was \\"[not to] take it personally\\" because \\"large collective bias can exist even with small individual bias\\". The article was released in December 2014; Hart noted that \\"matters of systematic bias [were] even more topical [at the moment]\\", and Case said, \\"There's a huge gap between the racial proportions of the police force and the neighborhoods they're policing, that both reinforces and results from racial tensions.\\" Case said that Schelling's models could be identified in that \\"a black officer [had led] the police force one night\\" amidst the Ferguson unrest. A remixed version which includes a green pentagon was made the same year and is featured at the bottom of the article. Hart described the reaction to the article as \\"more positive than anything [Hart's] ever done\\" and \\"almost disturbingly eerie\\". Case said: \\"It's been surprisingly positive and polite, especially for something that touches on a touchy subject!\\" Hart said that they planned to \\"tweak some stuff after release\\", but did not because the reception was \\"so overwhelmingly positive\\". Case said that the article was doing \\"shockingly well\\", so any fixes \\"might weaken or confuse the message\\" when applied. == Reception == The critical reception for the article was overwhelmingly positive. Joanna Rothkopf of Salon called the article \\"an adorable and eloquent primer on issues of segregation\\". Columbia Journalism Review Chava Gourarie described the article as \\"a cute, engaging, playable explanation\\". Aatish Bhatia of Wired described the design and characters as \\"charming\\" and \\"delightfully animated\\". The playable aspect of the article received praise. Kill Screen Jess Joho wrote, \\"Parable of the Polygons asks you to tackle Schelling's concepts in a way only a game could.\\" Bhatia called the article \\"a truly interactive way of communicating an idea\\". Jesse Singal of The Cut called the article \\"a really well-done use of the web\\". Singal noted the article's parallels to human behavior. Bhatia said that the article delivers an \\"effective, lucid and very relevant\\" lesson on real- world segregation, race and equality. Laura Moss of Mother Nature Network said that it \\"accurately illustrates racially segregated neighborhoods\\", and noted that the article illustrates \\"Schelling's three major findings\\": the effect of slight individual bias, the starting game state and the reluctancy to become more diverse, and the necessity of intervention \\"in creating and maintaining diversity\\". Joho said that \\"demonstrating a difficult reality while still maintaining a sense of actionable hope\\" was the article's \\"greatest achievement by far\\". Gamasutra Phill Cameron praised the article for using triangles and squares and effectively dissociating itself from \\"the prejudices of real life\\". Bhatia said that the article does not get \\"embroiled in a heated political debate\\". Joho wrote that the article is \\"careful not to throw blame around\\", and that it constantly emphasizes that personal biases might be \\"unexamined, unintentional, or even unconscious\\". The Washington Post Ana Swanson said that the call to action is a \\"powerful\\" message. Polygon Megan Farokhmanesh wrote, \\"Half game, half informational post, Parable of the Polygons wants to encourage people to talk about topics like racism and sexism in healthy, constructive ways.\\" Amanda Monta√±ez wrote in a Scientific American blog that the shapes assume that \\"their individual preference for diversity is sufficient to propel their society toward integration\\", but that \\"the social system in which they operate prohibits it\\". Monta√±ez said that \\"true progress requires a more active, dramatic shift than expected\\" and that, in the article, \\"the complacent squares and triangles must abandon their preconceptions about the nature of 'shapism' and adopt a new, activist stance on integration\\". Monta√±ez compared the idea of using two-dimensional geometric shapes to represent people to the 1884 illustrated novella Flatland by Edwin Abbott Abbott. == References == == External links == * * Category:Segregation Category:Electronic literature Category:Thought experiments Category:Public- domain software with source code ","title":"Parable of the Polygons"},{"id":"56739901","text":"The Transcendence Gospel Choir, based in the San Francisco Bay Area, is the first documented transgender gospel choir.

Its first store opened in 1967, it grew to have six stores and finally closed in 1998. It is known for championing avant-garde fashion designers in the 1980's. Its rise to prominence in fashion coincided with the gentrification of its neighborhood, Manhattan's Upper West Side. ==Background== During the 1970s and 1980s the store grew from one to five locations (four were on the Upper West Side, there was a store on West 57 and a sixth location on the Upper East Side was added in 1992). The Upper West Side locations were designed by Alan J. Buchsbaum. The store championed Japanese and European designers and is with significantly contributing to the revolution in fashion that took place in the 1980s. Some of the designers featured at Charivari included Azzedine Ala√Øa, Giorgio Armani, Ann Demeulemeester, Dolce & Gabbana, Perry Ellis, Jean Paul Gaultier, Katharine Hamnett, Marc Jacobs (who, as a teenager, worked at Charivari), Helmut Lang, Issey Miyake, Thierry Mugler, Dries van Noten, Miuccia Prada, Gianni Versace, and Yohji Yamamoto. Writing about the closing of the chain in The New Yorker, Rebecca Mead noted: \\"If, during the nineteen-eighties, you wanted your clothes to indicate that you were a) in the know, fashionwise; b) a bit of an intellectual; and c) not afraid of wearing unfinished seams or jackets turned inside out, or other things that might, if not worn with sufficient √©lan, look like fashion disasters, then you shopped at Charivari.\\" Jon Weiser who, with his mother Selma and sister Barbara Weiser founded and ran the stores, attributed the company's decline and eventual failure to poor financial planning, the recession in the 1990s and its own success: the availability of the avant-garde designers championed by Charivari in both the designers' own stores and at larger department stores made a store like Charivari unnecessary. ==Timeline== In 1967, Upon the debut of Charivari, the Upper West Side received its first glimpse in high fashion. Charivari was a family business company founded by Selma Weiser and her daughter Barbara as well as her son Jon. In 1976, With the relocation of the men's store across the street, Charivari's rising status as a cutting-edge pilgrimage was secured. Alan Buchsbaum, a minimalist architect became the designer of several Charivari's expansion.

It is monotypic, with Dermechinus horridus, sometimes called the cactus urchin, being the only species. ==Taxonomy== The species was first described in 1879 as Echinus horridus by the American zoologist Alexander Agassiz, after being dredged from the deep seabed during the Challenger expedition of 1872‚Äì1876. In 1942, it was allocated to the newly erected genus Dermechinus by the Danish zoologist Ole Theodor Jensen Mortensen, a specialist in sea urchins. ==Description== An unusual-looking bright-orange sea urchin, Dermechinus horridus is globular when young but sometimes grows to a height more than twice its width. The fine long spines grow in vertical rows and are interspersed with a dense mat of shorter ones. Pedicellariae and tube feet are also present, and the general appearance of the sea urchin is similar to a cylindrical cactus. ==Distribution== D. horridus has a global but discontinuous distribution on the continental slope in oceans in the southern hemisphere; this includes Chile, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. The depth range of this sea urchin is . ==Ecology== This sea urchin tends to perch on rocks, in rows at right angles to the current, and has a relatively small mouth, leading to the speculation that it might be a filter feeder, an unusual feeding method among sea urchins. Commenting on this suggestion, sea urchin expert F. Julian Fell pointed out that Dermechinus horridus lived in zooplankton-rich waters and that its upright posture resembled that of a filter-feeding sea cucumber; the long spines formed combs and the short spines would be suitable for transporting small particles to the mouth at the base of the animal, with the tiny jaws adequate for ingesting them. So this feeding method is a possibility, but direct observation is needed. ==References== Category:Echinometridae Category:Taxa named by Ole Theodor Jensen Mortensen Category:Monotypic genera ","title":"Dermechinus"},{"id":"56740320","text":"Rock Jolly is a historic house near Cross Plains, Tennessee, U.S..

Slauerhoff. First published in 1930, the poems in the collection are mostly personal and lyric poems. Critics have noted that some of the poems are inspired by 19th-century French poetry and are sexual in nature, and they have responded in various ways, with assessments ranging from \\"childish\\" to \\"pure lyric\\". The themes of desperation and the desire to escape bourgeois life, common in Slauerhoff's other poetry, are found in Serenade as well, and two of the poems were used in an obituary for the poet, who died eight years after the publication of this volume. ==Content== The collection comprises 27 poems of between 6 and 48 lines. Four of the poems form a tetralogy called \\"For the children\\", containing a creation myth, a poem in which the dead lovingly address children, a narrative poem about a child that fell from the stars, and a poem in which a child compares the stars to a herd of animals and questions why they do not wander. Many of the poems discuss sexual love. P. N. van Eijck noted that compared to earlier poems by Slauerhoff the speaker seems to adopt a less antagonistic attitude toward the women addressed in the poems, and figures as a lover (albeit a powerless and unsatisfied one) rather than a desperate man who opposes everything on principle. Van Eijck notes the dependence of many of the poems (and that of his Saturnus) on the French poetry of the 1850-1900 period, and considers their genesis to be mostly sexual. Other readers focused on the sense of desperation, of never being at home, that is found in some of the poems; A. G. W. Severijnen cited from two poems in Serenade in an obituary on the occasion of Slauerhoff's death. In \\"De voorpost\\" (\\"The outpost\\") and \\"In mijn leven...\\" (\\"In my life\\"), Severijnen sees Slauerhoff's disgust with ordinary bourgeois life, the desire to escape the mundane and to wander the earth. ==Publishing history== First published in 1930 by The Halcyon Press of Maastricht and Brussels (with E. du Perron having corrected the manuscript), it was reprinted four times by A. A. M. Stols (Maastricht/The Hague, in 1938, 1942, 1946, and 1954), and twice by Emanuel Querido (Amsterdam, 1978 and 1982). It was published (unchanged from the first edition) in 1982 by Nijgh & Van Ditmar as part of Slauerhoff's collected poetic works. ==Critical responses== Hendrik Marsman thought that on the whole Serenade was bad, full of trivial material, and written in a very pedestrian style‚Äîthe best that could be said about a lot of the poems was that they were not awful. Particularly the fourth poem of the \\"For the children\\" cycle invoked his wrath; he thought it childish. Marsman also commented that he just could not get used to Slauerhoff's rhythm with its frequent syncopation, masculine rhymes, and monosyllabic phrases. The collection's bright side is a half a dozen poems which, according to Marsman, are Slauerhoff at his most powerful and personal. E. du Perron responded directly to Marsman's commentary in a lengthy review of Slauerhoff's poetry. Du Perron sees no weak spots in the collection, liking even the poems that Marsman did away with as childish. He separates them in two categories‚Äîlighter and of higher tone, and heavier and more serious, and claims to not want to miss a single stanza of Serenade. He noted \\"De Voorpost\\" and \\"In mijn leven...\\" as among the serious ones, the same poems Severijnen focused on in his obituary. (originally published in De Vrije Bladen, 1930). Anton van Duinkerken also cites \\"Voorpost\\" as emblematic of Slauerhoff's life and desire. Long after Slauerhoff's death, Victor E. van Vriesland revisited Serenade and Marsman's critique; van Vriesland argues that Serenade is the best Slauerhoff published before 1930, that he managed to overcome most of the \\"errors of his virtues\\". Those errors include capriciousness and a nonchalance intended to show his antipathy against the pose of literariness. In Serenade, van Vriesland argues, Slauerhoff left behind the \\"anecdotal character\\" of his earlier work. He praises the collection for its \\"pure lyric\\" and its \\"refined technique\\" which still retained the unexpected and concise expression he had already demonstrated. ==References== I Miss You Poems poems about community ==External links== *Eldorado, second edition (PDF) Category:Dutch poetry collections Category:1930 poetry books ","title":"Serenade (poetry collection)"},{"id":"56740402","text":"Rina Yerushalmi (born March 1, 1939) is an Israeli theater director and choreographer.

Following this production, in 1989, Yerushalmi founded the Itim Theater Ensemble, for which she continues to serve as artistic director. The theater is dedicated to the performance of classical texts as contemporary theater. Two of Yerushalmi's major productions with the Itim Theater Ensemble have been the Bible Project Parts I and II (1995-2000) and Mythos (2001/2002). The Bible Project consisted of Va-Yomer, Va-Yelech (And He Said, And He Walked) and Va- Yishtahu, Va-Yera (And They Bowed, And He Saw). Yerushalmi currently teaches acting and directing at Tel Aviv University. == Selected works == === As director === * 1970: Woyzeck (MFA final project); Toy Show (Leon Katz's adaptation of The Dybbuk); Ta, Ta, Tatata (Yerushalmi's adaptation of The Trial and Malone Dies) * 1971: Shekhina: The Bride (Leon Katz's adaptation of The Dybbuk) * 1978: Malone Dies; Some Such Things * 1980: Glasshouse (written by Fatima Dike) * 1982: Yossele Golem (written by Dan Horowitz) * 1986: Macbeth; Six Characters in Search of an Author * 1988: Hamlet * 1990: The Chairs; Hansel and Gretel (opera) * 1991: Woyzeck 91 * 1992: Romeo and Juliet * 1993: La Juive * 1994: Hedda Gabler * 1996: Va-Yomer,Va-Yelech (Bible Project, Part I) * 1998: Va-Yishtahu, Va-Yera (Bible Project, Part II) * 1999: Elektra * 2002: Mythos (adaptation) === As choreographer === * 1979: An Ecumenical Theatrical Liturgy on the Rights of the ChildLa MaMa Archives Digital Collections, \\"Program: 'An Ecumenical Theatrical Liturgy on the Rights of the Child' (1979b)\\".

The following two poems were exchanged between Im Che and his lover, gisaeng Hanu (ÌïúÏö∞; ÂØíÈõ®). Im was known for his liaisons with Hanu and Hwang Jin Yi. The term in line 3, ch‚Äôan bi (Ï∞¨ÎπÑ), literally translates as ‚Äúfreezing rain.‚Äù It uses the same Chinese characters as the poetess‚Äô name (ÂØíÈõ®), but with a different pronunciation, and was intended by both poets as a pun. Hanu's particular gift is to echo the style of the original that Im wrote to her, while improving on it with a teasing, very human tone. The translation employs a formal tone to match Im's original; and then follows with the simpler and more lyric style used by Hanu. In both cases, the line ‚Äúrain has frozen‚Äù seemed to best communicate the double entendre of the originals.

Jane is also the family historian. (7 May 1875 in Preston, Lancashire ‚Äì 1953 in Hampshire) was born into a legal and sporting family in Southport, where he practised as a solicitor in the family firm of Bucks, Cockshott and Cockshott. His brother Francis was an Athletics Blue in each of his three years at Cambridge as well as working for a time in the family firm. George served as a justice of the peace and was also an active and gifted amateur yacht designer. His claim to fame comes through his design of the 'International' 12 Foot Dinghy. Although the international status of the class was revoked by the IYRU (now World Sailing) in 1964, it is still raced actively across the world. George retired to Hampshire in later years, dying there in 1953. ==Early Life== George was educated at Uppingham School and King‚Äôs College Cambridge. As a boy he took a keen delight in building and sailing model yachts, and while at school built for himself a rowing and sailing boat. He joined the Cambridge University Cruising Club shortly after its formation in 1893. On coming down from Cambridge and commencing practice as a solicitor in the family firm, he spent several seasons as ‚Äòforward hand‚Äô racing in the Southport ¬æ-rating class and the Menai Straits 1-rating class. In 1906 he married Mary Eileen Beatrice Kent of Wicklow, Ireland (b 28 Nov 1985) and they had two sons. ==Sailing and Yacht Design Activities== George owned the Unona, a half decked centre board boat, and designed and sailed for two seasons a boat in a ‚Äòrestricted class‚Äô of 12-foot dinghies with a fair measure of success. In 1901 he became owner of the 12 ton cutter Eurynome, a boat long famous as a cruiser-racer in Irish, Clyde and Welsh waters. Although Cockshott preferred cruising to racing and considerably reduced her spars and canvas, she was successfully raced under his flag for several seasons in a strong handicap class. In 1903 he won a trophy, engraved with the name of his boat - Eurynome. This trophy he later (1950) presented to the Cambridge University Cruising Club. In 1904, he again entered the ¬æ-rating class as part owner of Imp. He also owned the yacht Sthoreen, an able and comfortable cruising yawl of 16 tons, built from his own designs, and launched in the spring of 1906. In addition to his own yacht Sthoreen, Cockshott designed one 20 tonner, several smaller yachts and motor launches, and a tender to the Southport lifeboat, all of which were built to his designs. He also designed a new racing class for the West Lancashire Yacht Club in 1906 from which nine boats were built and are now known as the West Kirby Star Class. The five remaining Stars transferred to West Kirby SC in 1922, and the class there has been added to over the years. =='International' 12 Foot Dinghy== In 1912 Cockshott won a design competition for a small sailing and rowing dinghy. The requirements for this dinghy were: *an overall length of 12 feet, *a beam of 4 feet 6 inches and *a single sail of 100 square feet. The hull was to be clinker, planked in spruce on bent timbers. Cockshott's design became known worldwide as the 'International' 12 Foot Dinghy. The design was granted informal international status in 1914 and full international atatus was confirmed by the IYRU (now World Sailing) in 1919. In 1920 the 12 foot dinghy was used in the Summer Olympics as the first one design class. The dinghy was also used as an Olympic class in 1928, Amsterdam. The International status of the class was revoked in 1964 by the IYRU - but the dinghy is still raced widely across the world. ==References== Category:1875 births Category:1953 deaths Category:British yacht designers Category:People from Southport Category:Engineers from Merseyside ","title":"George Cockshott"},{"id":"56740482","text":"Chlo√´ Bass (born 1984) is an American conceptual artist who works in performance and social practice. Bass's work focuses on intimacy. She was a founding co-lead organizer of Arts in Bushwick from 2007-2011, the group that organizes Bushwick Open Studios. She is an Assistant Professor of Art and Social Practice at Queens College, CUNY, and holds a BA from Yale University and an MFA from Brooklyn College. Bass is also a regular contributor to publications like Hyperallergic. == Early life and education == Bass was born in New York City in 1984 and lived on the Upper West Side. In 2002 she moved to New Haven to pursue a BA in Theatre Studies at Yale University. Two labor strikes in 2003, including a dining hall workers' strike, strongly affected Bass's undergraduate experience, and influenced her later involvement with organizing. She completed her MFA in Performance and Interactive Media at Brooklyn College in 2011. == Career == Bass moved to Bushwick in 2006, after her undergraduate degree programme. In Bushwick she became a co-lead organizer of Arts in Bush-wick (2007-2011), and helped to organize Bushwick Open Studios, a project of which she is now critical, saying that \\"ultimately the damaging effect [of BOS] has been greater than the fun.\\" While living in Bushwick, Bass worked to register the area's voters and, as a result of a displacement mapping project, gained a seat on Community Board Four, which she held until 2012. In 2011, she moved to an apartment in Bed-Stuy, where she currently lives. In 2014 she was the Create Change resident for The Laundromat Project in Bed-Stuy, creating a work called \\"The Department of Local Affairs\\". For this work she collected information in the form of writing, drawing, and conversation by and for locals, examining what this looked like in contrast to information collected by companies for advertising or tourism. Her ongoing eight-chapter project exploring individual social interactions, The Book of Everyday Instruction, has been presented at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and other venues. Chapters from this work have included creating poetic installations in bathrooms and inviting gallery goers to smell jars of spice. Her work has been exhibited at the Elizabeth Foundation for the Arts, Cooper Union, The Bronx Museum of the Arts, the Neuberger Museum of Art, the Knockdown Center, and Momenta Art, amongst other venues. She is the recipient of residencies at The Laundromat Project, Bemis Center, Triangle Arts Association, and Lower Manhattan Cultural Counsel (LMCC) Workspace residency, and was nominated for the Rema Hort Mann Foundation Grant.

It transferred to the Territorial Force (TF) in 1908 and Its successor units fought with the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division in Palestine during World War I, and in North West Europe and Burma during World War II. It continued in the Territorial Army (TA) until amalgamation in 1967. ==Artillery Volunteers== The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle and Artillery Volunteer Corps composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett.Grierson, pp. 1‚Äì12.Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 1‚Äì4.Spiers, pp. 163‚Äì8. The 1st Administrative Brigade of Ayrshire Artillery Volunteers was formed with its headquarters (HQ) at Irvine, North Ayrshire, in November 1860. It comprised the following Ayrshire Artillery Volunteer Corps (AVCs):Beckett, Appendix VIII.Grierson, pp. 146‚Äì8.Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 27‚Äì8.Army List, various dates. *1st Corps formed at Irvine on 22 December 1859, as one and a half batteries ; reduced to one battery in 1862. *2nd Corps formed at Ayr on 31 January 1860, as one and a half batteries; increased to two batteries in 1874. *3rd Corps formed at Largs on 1 March 1860, as one battery. *4th Corps formed at Ardrossan on 3 March 1860, as one battery. *5th Corps formed at Kilmarnock on 12 July 1860, as one battery; increased in 1864 to one and a half batteries. In 1863, the following corps were added to the brigade: *1st Kirkcudbright Artillery Volunteers formed at Kirkcudbright on 2 February 1860, as one battery.Litchfield & Westlake, p. 104. *1st Wigtown Artillery Volunteers formed at Stranraer on 20 February 1860, as one battery. *2nd Wigtown Artillery Volunteers formed at Port Patrick on 22 February 1860, as one battery.Litchfield & Westlake, p. 171. *3rd Wigtown Artillery Volunteers formed at Sandhead on 4 May 1867 as one battery and became part of the Brigade. The first commanding officer (CO) of the administrative brigade was Major Sir Edward Hunt-Blair, 4th Baronet of Dunskey, Wigtown, appointed on 8 May 1861, who was replaced on 17 July 1863 by Lieutenant-Colonel the Hon Greville Vernon, whose his second-in-command (with the rank of major) was Captain (later Admiral) John Eglinton Montgomerie, Royal Navy. Hunter-Blair was reappointed (with the rank of lieutenant-colonel) on 4 September 1866. In 1863, brigade HQ moved from Irvine to Ayr, and in May 1880 the brigade was consolidated as the 1st Ayrshire & Galloway Artillery Volunteers, with headquarters at Ayr and 11 batteries as follows: Old practice battery of 64 Pounder guns of the Ayr companies, pictured near the pier in 1907 * No 1, Irvine (late 1st Ayrshire Corps) * Nos 2 and 3, Ayr (late 2nd Ayrshire Corps) * No 4 at Largs (late 3rd Ayrshire Corps) * No 5 at Ardrossan (late 4th Ayrshire Corps) * Now 6 and 7 at Kilmarnock (late 5th Ayrshire Corps) * No 8 at Kirkcudbright (late 1st Kirkcudbright Corps) * No 9 at Stranraer (late 1st Wigtown Corps) * No 10 at Port Patrick (late 2nd Wigtown Corps) * No 11 at Sandhead (late 3rd Wigtown Corps) ===Position artillery=== The AVCs were intended to serve as garrison artillery manning fixed defences, but a number of the early units manned semi-mobile 'position batteries' of smooth-bore field guns pulled by agricultural horses. At that time they were not officially supported by the War Office (WO). The concept was revived in 1888 when some Volunteer batteries were reorganised as position artillery to work alongside the Volunteer infantry brigades.Beckett, pp. 178‚Äì9.Litchfield and Westlake, pp. 3‚Äì6. In 1889, a position battery of 16-pounder Rifled Muzzle Loading (RML) guns was issued to the 1st Ayrshire & Galloway and manned by the two Kilmarnock batteries. In that year the HQ moved to Kilmarnock. 16-Pounder RML gun manned by Artillery Volunteers in 1897. In 1892, the existing position battery took the number 1, absorbing the 6th and 7th Companies. In 1901, two more batteries of 9 Pounder Rifled Muzzle Loading (RML) guns were issued to the corps, which took the numbers 2 and 3 and absorbed the Irvine and Ayr Companies, and an extra personnel formed as a 6th Company at Kilmarnock. The 8th to 11th Companies took the numbers 7 to 10. ===Royal Garrison Artillery=== In 1882 all the AVCs were affiliated to one of the territorial garrison divisions of the Royal Artillery (RA) and the 1st Ayrshire & Galloway AVC became part of the Scottish Division. In 1889 the structure was altered, and the corps joined the Southern Division. In 1899 the RA was divided into separate field and garrison branches, and the artillery volunteers were all assigned to the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA). In 1902 their titles were changed, the unit becoming the 1st Ayrshire and Galloway Royal Garrison Artillery (Volunteers), with its HQ at Kilmarnock. The following year the position batteries were redesignated as heavy batteries. In 1903, 4.7-inch Quick Firing (QF) guns replaced the RML armament of all three heavy batteries. The final organisation of the unit until 1908 was as follows: * No 1 Heavy Battery at Kilmarnock * Nos 2 and 3 Heavy Batteries at Ayr * No 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 Garrison Companies (No 6 vacant, accounted for by extra personnel in the heavy batteries) The corps carried out its gun practice at Irvine. It used the Ayrshire Rifle Association range at Irvine for musketry, except the 7th to 10th Companies, which had ranges near their own headquarters. In 1900, over 600 men of the unit volunteered to serve in the Second Boer War, but as artillery men were not required they were not accepted. Twenty-eight men served in South Africa during the war with other units. ==Territorial Force== When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force in 1908 under the Haldane Reforms, the 1st Ayrshire and Galloway RGA (V) formed the II (or 2nd) Lowland Brigade in the Royal Field Artillery (RFA). It also provided a nucleus for the Lowland Mounted Brigade Transport & Supply Column, Army Service Corps. The new unit had the following organisation:Beckett, pp. 247‚Äì53.Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10.London Gazette 20 March 1908.Litchfield, pp. 287‚Äì9. 15-pounder gun issued to TF field artillery.

The batteries were each issued with four 15-pounder guns.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 109‚Äì15.52 (L) Division at Long, Long Trail.52 (L) Division at Regimental Warpath. ==World War I== ===Mobilisation=== The Lowland Division had been attending annual camp on the Ayrshire coast when the order to mobilise was received at 17.25 on Tuesday August 1914. Mobilisation began the following day at unit drill halls. On 12 August the division was ordered to concentrate at Bedford and entrainment began on 15 August. Concentration was completed by 17 August and the division formed part of First Army (Home Forces) in Central Force. On the outbreak of war, units of the TF were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service. On 15 August the WO issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. Then on 31 August the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate batteries, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6. ===1/II Lowland Brigade=== 18-pounder field gun preserved at the Imperial War Museum. 1/II Lowland Brigade embarked with the rest of the division for the Mediterranean in May 1915, and landed at Alexandria the following month. However, it was not employed in the Gallipoli Campaign and remained in Egypt. It rejoined the rest of the division at El Qantara in March 1916 and the following month it was re- armed with 18-pounder guns. It was redesignated CCLX (or 260) Brigade, RFA, on 25 May 1916, and renumbered CCLXI (261) Brigade on 15 September. It transferred to 7th (Meerut) Division when the 52nd left for the Western Front in April 1918 and served with this Indian Army formation in Palestine until the end of the war. It was placed in suspended animation in 1919.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, Annex 1. ===2/II Lowland Brigade=== 2/II Lowland Brigade served with the 2nd Lowland Division (65th (2nd Lowland) Division from August 1915) in Scotland and England. It was redesignated CCCXXVI (or 326) Brigade, RFA, in May 1916. Early in 1917 the division was sent to Ireland. It was broken up in early 1918, but 326 Bde remained at Kildare until 27 October 1919 when it completed its disbandment.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 61‚Äì5.65 (2nd L) Division at Long, Long Trail. ==Interwar years== The 2nd Lowland Brigade reformed in 1920, and was redesignated as the 79th (Lowland) Brigade, RFA, the following year when the TF was reconstituted as the Territorial Army (TA). It became a 'Field Brigade, RA', when the RFA was subsumed into the Royal Artillery in 1924. It continued to be part of 52nd (Lowland) Division and had the following organisation:Titles and Designations, 1927. * HQ at Drill Hall, 111 South Harbour Street, Ayr * 313 (Ayr) Bty at Ayr * 314 (Irvine) Bty at High Street, Irvine * 315 (Kirkcudbright) Bty at Drill Hall, Kirkcudbright * 316 (Kilmarnock) (Howitzer) Bty at John Finnie Street, Kilmarnock Field Brigades were termed Field Regiments from 1938 onwards. ==World War II== ===Mobilisation=== The TA was doubled in size following the Munich Crisis of 1938, with existing units splitting to form duplicates before the outbreak of World War II. 79th Field Regiment reorganised as follows:Scottish Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files. 79th (Lowland) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery79 Fd Rgt at RA 1939‚Äì45. * HQ at Ayr * 313 (Ayr) Field Bty * 314 (Irvine) Field Bty 130th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery131 Fd Rgt at RA 1939‚Äì45. * HQ at Kilmarnock * 315 (Kirkcudbright) Field Bty * 316 (Kilmarnock) Field Bty The establishment of a field battery was increased to 12 guns organised into three Troops.Ellis France and Flanders, Appendix I. ===79th (Lowland) Field Regiment=== 79th Field Regiment mobilised in 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division.Joslen, pp. 85‚Äì6. Apart from a period in June 1940 when the rest of the division was briefly deployed to France, the regiment served with the 52nd (L) Division throughout the war, including the campaign in North West Europe from October 1944 to VE Day. It was placed in suspended animation in 1946 25-pounder gun by the Shweli River in Burma, February 1945. ===130th (Lowland) Field Regiment=== 130th Field Regiment mobilised in 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division (the duplicate of 52nd (Lowland)) and served with it through the early years of war. The regiment received its 'Lowland' subtitle in 1942.Joslen, pp. 58‚Äì9.

She retired and moved to Cape Cod (2013). She has been using the surrounding landscapes to create her ‚ÄúCut Paper Mosaics‚Äù which is the main medium for her relatively new life as a professional artist. Current Residency and Works: Professional Affiliations: Elected Member, Audubon Artists, Inc., Past President of the Society of Cape Cod Craftsmen Where Work is Displayed: The Rice Gallery at Woodruff Art Center, Mashpee Commons, Mashpee, MA October 8, 2017: Creative Hands Gallery, Sandwich, MA == Education == Flax attended Heidelberg College and earned a BA in English, in addition to receiving an MA in Speech & Theater from the University of Michigan. == Artistry == === Technique === Flax is considered a visual artist for her work in representational collage. This is a style that she created in her twenties, but did not receive any recognition for at the time. The artist describes her own process, calling it ‚ÄúCut Paper Mosaics,\\" where she essentially recycles paper from materials such as magazines. She then cuts the paper and glues pieces to her surface of choice, often a collage board, using a brush-stroke pattern to create the illusion of a painting. === Influence === While aspirations of an early art career did not work out for Flax, she kept the idea of Cut Paper Mosaics in the back of her mind. Eventually when she retired to Cape Cod in 2013, she revived and refined this idea and began her career as a professional artist. Now she plays with the idea of \\"upcycling\\" to turn used paper into art. Additionally, Flax enjoys creating her works to resemble paintings in an attempt to fool viewers when they first encounter her work. She enjoys the aspect of searching for the colors and textures she needs for each landscape. Flax is an Elected Member of Audubon Artists, Inc. (at the Salmagundi Club, NYC); and artist member of: Fuller Craft Museum, the Cotuit Center for the Arts, the Sandwich Arts Alliance and the Arts Foundation of Cape Cod. == Awards == Most notably, Flax received the Audubon Artists Silver Medal of Honor in 2016 for her collage Mayflower Beach iii.

Her first entertainment industry job was as sitcom storywriter and editor for Witt-Thomas-Harris. Her first film screenplay was for the 1983 comedy-drama film The Big Chill. For her work on the film she received, along with co- writer Lawrence Kasdan, the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay in 1984. She was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay, BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay, and was runner-up for the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award. She went on to write screenplays for Immediate Family (1989) and Men Don't Leave (1990). In his two-star review of Men Don't Leave, Roger Ebert speculated that Benedek's screenplay started out \\"a good deal more realistic and honest,\\" but that it was subject to detrimental revisions in the filmmaking process. Benedek was an uncredited writer for the 1990 film Pretty Woman. According to director Garry Marshall, \\"We had five different writers on Pretty Woman ... In all the rewrites, the part of Vivian, the prostitute, came quite easily. It was the character of the businessman, Edward Lewis, that presented the most problems. Only Barbara Benedek, the sole woman writer in the group, got the voice of Edward down by creating a Donald Trump-style executive with a vulnerable side.\\" In 1995 Benedek wrote the screenplay for Sabrina, a remake of a 1954 film of the same name. It began as a fully original screenplay. Due to similarities to the 1954 film, producer Scott Rudin suggested adapting that story instead. ==Filmography== *The Big Chill (1983) *Immediate Family (1989) *Men Don't Leave (1990) *Sabrina (1995) ==References== ==External links== * Category:American women screenwriters Category:Living people Category:1948 births Category:Writers Guild of America Award winners Category:20th-century American screenwriters Category:20th- century American women writers ","title":"Barbara Benedek"},{"id":"56740593","text":"The Pokotciminikew River is a tributary of the North Shore of the Kakospictikweak River, flowing into the territory of the Town of La Tuque, in the administrative region of Mauricie, in Quebec, in Canada.

Sheldon (Jim Parsons) who disdains Christmas as a pagan ritual is disconcerted when Penny (Kaley Cuoco) brings him a Christmas gift. He now feels obligated to buy her a gift that matches the value of her gift to him, and enlists Wolowitz (Simon Helberg) and Koothrappali (Kunal Nayyar) to help him with this task which they reluctantly agree to. After deciding on a basket of bath items he discovers a large selection, so not knowing what Penny will get him, he buys the entire range to cover all contingencies.

fifth solo studio album by the English singer-songwriter Paul Carrack, then a member of the supergroup Mike + The Mechanics. It was Carrack's first solo album in seven years; in the interim period between solo albums, he had recorded one album as a member of Squeeze, one album as a member of Spin 1ne 2wo, and two albums as a member of Mike + The Mechanics. Blue Views was originally released in 1995 on I.R.S. Records in the UK and most other territories. In the US, it appeared on the Ark 21 label. The album was produced by Carrack's erstwhile Mike + The Mechanics bandmate Peter Van Hooke, who had left the group the previous year. Blue Views spun off two UK top 40 hits: \\"Eyes of Blue\\" and a re-recording of \\"How Long\\", which Carrack had originally written and sung 22 years earlier as a member of the band Ace. In the US, \\"Eyes of Blue\\" was a minor hit on the Adult Contemporary (AC) charts, while the track \\"For Once in Our Lives\\" was a major AC hit, peaking at #3. The song \\"Love Will Keep Us Alive\\", a Carrack co-wrote, had been previously recorded by The Eagles for their 1994 album Hell Freezes Over. ==Reception== AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine calls Blue Views \\"solid adult contemporary pop\\", and while criticizing some of the \\"spotty\\" material, writes that \\"Carrack's vocals are terrific and the sound is appealingly polished.\\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits are adapted from the album's liner notes. * Paul Carrack ‚Äì lead vocals, keyboards * Rod Argent ‚Äì keyboards * Tim Renwick ‚Äì guitar * Robbie McIntosh ‚Äì guitar * Mitch Dalton ‚Äì classical guitar (track 1) * Neil Hubbard ‚Äì guitar (7) * Pino Palladino ‚Äì bass * Keith Wilkinson ‚Äì bass (8) * Andy Newmark ‚Äì drums * Martin Ditcham ‚Äì percussion * Luis Jardim ‚Äì percussion * Frank Ricotti ‚Äì percussion *Gavyn Wright ‚Äì violin (10) * Perry Montague-Mason ‚Äì violin (10) * Roger Chase ‚Äì viola (10) * Bill Hawkins ‚Äì viola (10) * Katie Kissoon ‚Äì backing vocals * Tessa Niles ‚Äì backing vocals * Lance Ellington ‚Äì backing vocals (5, 9, 10) ===Production=== * Producer ‚Äì Peter Van Hooke * Engineers ‚Äì Paul Mortimer and Simon Smart * Assistant Engineers ‚Äì Danny Dawson, Paul Hicks, Robbie Kazandjian and Guy Massey. * Mixing ‚Äì John Brough and Simon Smart * Mastered by Chris Blair * Recorded, Mixed and Mastered at Abbey Road Studios (London, UK). * Photography ‚Äì Paul Cox ==Certifications== ==References== ==External links== * Category:1995 albums Category:I.R.S.

This collection was written, or at least composed, by an anonymous author shortly before 1300. While scholars have included it as a type of French fabliau, being contested due to the varying ownership of Alsace-Lorraine, it has stood out as a \\"unique\\" or \\"experimental\\" text for its time. It is studied as a text in German and French Medieval literature. ==Plot== The characters in the story are from an elite or upper class status. Their society is made up of knights, thus it revolves around battle. They hold the values of chivalry and honor in high regard. When their land is attacked the men are forced to leave for war, and the women are left behind in a community of their own. In this new society the women settle disputes by holding discussions among themselves, and leadership is won by developing the best rhetorical skills. During a debate on whether or not women gain honor or share the same honor as men a challenge is presented to the group, \\"the women are to put on the men's armor, mount the men's warhorses, and joust against each other in the pursuit of honor.\\" In the battle the woman who wins is the poorest among them, and was forced to ride bearing the name of a famous knight, rather than a familial name. Once their story has traveled through the land, and this famous knight has heard of her victory, he comes to meet this poor maiden. He feels pity for her, so he gives her dowry and marries her off to a rich man. ==Scholarly importance== This text gives insight to the marriage system present in medieval central European society, and its closes tie with the importance of status. It also reveals to what degree women may have been involved in medieval french militancy. == References == Category:Medieval German literature Category:Medieval French literature Category:13th-century poems ","title":"Li Tournoiement as dames"},{"id":"56740725","text":"Anna Whitelock, , is a British historian and academic, specialising in the Tudors and public history.

The bomb targeted a bus carrying British Army soldiers just outside Chelsea Barracks. The blast killed two civilians and injured 40 people, among them 23 soldiers. ==Background== In early October 1981, the Irish hunger strike, in which ten Irish Republican prisoners died, had just come to an end. The strike, started by Bobby Sands, was an attempt by the prisoners to have their political status reinstated. During the strike, Sands and another IRA volunteer, Kieran Doherty, were elected to the British and Irish parliaments respectively.Peter Taylor -Behind The Mask: The IRA & Sinn Fein p.278 -783 The IRA resolved that action should be taken against the British Army or British Government to match the sacrifice made by the strikers. ==Bombing== An IRA's Active Service Unit (ASU) in London decided to traget members of the British Army Irish Guards regiment and planned to bomb two bus loads of guards on 10 October, as they were entering Chelsea Barracks. The IRA unit assumed that would be a place where passing civilians were unlikely to get caught in the blast. The device, believed to be a remote- controlled bomb, was hidden in a laundry van near the barracks, close to the junction of Ebury Bridge Road and St. Barnabas Street. The bomb was detonated as a single bus passed, carrying 23 Irish Guards. Two other bus loads of Irish Guards were travelling a few minutes behind the one that was hit, so it seems that the bombers missed their main target. Two civilians, Nora Field, 59 and John Breslin, 18, were killed in the blast, and 40 people were injured, 23 of them soldiers, eight of whom received severe injuries. It was the worst attack carried out by the IRA in England since the London Hilton bombing, which killed two civilians and injured over 60 others. ==Aftermath== The IRA said in a statement the day after the bombing from Dublin that \\"the attack was aimed at a party of British soldiers\\". The statement added: > The attack is attributable to the state of war which exists between the > British government who occupy Northern Ireland and the oppressed Irish > people who strike out through the Irish Republican Army. We await the > hypocrisy which will undoubtedly follow from British political leaders whose > attitude to Irish victims of their violence in our country only strengthens > our conviction in our cause and methods. The IRA continued bombing targets in England. A week after the Chelsea bombing, the IRA seriously injured Lieutenant-General Sir Steuart Pringle when a booby-trap bomb exploded under his car. Pringle survived his injuries but lost his right leg. On 26 October 1981, Kenneth Howorth, a police explosives officer, was killed trying to defuse an IRA bomb placed in a Wimpy Bar in Oxford Street, London. A month later on 23 November 1981 a bomb exploded at the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich injuring two people. A year later, on 20 July 1982, two bombs killed 11 British soldiers, and injured 50 soldiers and civilians, during the Hyde Park and Regent's Park bombings. This was the deadliest IRA attack against the British Army in England during The Troubles. In December 1983, six people were killed and 90 injured in London when an IRA car bomb exploded outside Harrods dpartment store. The IRA's most notable attack in Britain during that period occurred in Brighton in October 1984, when five people were killed and dozens injured in the Brighton hotel bombing, which was an attempt to kill British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. ===Convictions=== In 1986, Paul Kavanagh and Thomas Quigley, then aged 29, were given life sentences for the bombing in Chelsea, as well as the booby- trap bomb in Oxford Street. They were released in 1999 after the Good Friday Agreement. ==INLA bombing attempt== Four years after the Chelsea Barracks bombing, on 11 November 1985, the Irish Republican Socialist-Revolutionary paramilitary organization the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) again attempted to bomb Chelsea Barracks. An INLA unit placed three bombs right outside the barracks, each weighing about . They were packed with nuts and bolts designed to cause maximum damage, but all three bombs were found and defused before they went off. Patrick McLaughlin, from Derry, was arrested in 1986 over the bombing attempt and was sentenced to life imprisonment. McLaughlin claimed he was innocent that he was a victim of a miscarriage of justice. In the book INLA: Deadly Divisions Henry McDonald and Jack Holland wrote: \\"McLaughlin is almost certainly an innocent man ... His links to the bomb team seem to be no more than accidental\\".Henry McDonald & Jack Holland INLA: Deadly Divisions p.260, 261 https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/misc.activism.progressive/j712FKwOe9Y A campaign claiming his innocence gathered some momentum in the 1990s.

Gender roles in the community have slowly been evolving as societal norms around them progress. == Formal rights for women == Formal institutions, such as laws and courts, have led women within this community to find themselves both at the center of a tradition and compromised by it. === Role of trusts === Within the Parsi community, religious spaces are managed and funded by charitable trusts. It is through this mechanism that Parsi women's rights in such religious spaces are determined within the Parsi community in India. === Parsi personal law === Personal laws are those that apply only to a certain community, class, or group of people within India, often with reference to one's religion, faith, and caste. Such Personal Laws vary according to religion and as such there are Personal Laws for the Hindu, Muslim, Christian, and Parsi communities. The Parsi Personal Laws are dictated by the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act of 1936. The act was written and adopted on April 23, 1936, and later amended in 2001. Parsi Personal Laws only address marriage between two Parsis of the opposite sex. The main purpose of the Personal Laws are to outlaw child marriage, incest, and polygamy. The most notable articles within the act include Article 6 that requires for every marriage under the act to be registered. Article 32B dictates that divorce must be filed by both husband and wife on the ground of both parties living separately for a year or more, an inability to live together, and the mutual agreement of separation. Article 34 furthers this with the protocol that any married person can sue for a judicial separation on the same conditions that a divorce might be filed. The Parsi Personal Laws function in accordance with the Special Marriage Act of 1954. This act states that it is compulsory for all marriages to be registered, regardless of the religious identity of the individuals involved. The two acts, while functioning together, are often at odds with one another with relation to intermarriage, and the validity of such marriages. === Inheritance law === Parsi Laws of Inheritance dictate that any non-Parsi woman who is the wife, or widow, of a Parsi man cannot receive inheritance from their husbands. However, the children of such a couple, born to a non-Parsi mother and a Parsi father, are entitled to the inheritance of their fathers. === Intermarriage rights === Intermarriage is the term used to refer to married couples that are of different religious faiths. More and more Parsis are marrying outside the community. Parsi woman marrying a non-parsi is allowed to enter the fire temple and participate in religious activities. Before December 2017, a Parsi women who marries a non-Parsi man was automatically considered to have converted to the religion of her husband. She was forced to renunciate her identity as a Parsi. She no longer had access to the legal protections and religious spaces that are governed by the Parsi trusts. This included places of worship, known as Agyaris or fire temples, and sacred burial sites. On December 14, 2017 Supreme court overruled the verdict of High Court of Gujarat which stated the denial of parsi woman to enter fire temple. A parsi woman marrying a non-parsi is now allowed to enter the fire temple and tower of silence and participate in other religious activities. The children of an intermarriage can only be recognized as Parsi if their father is a Parsi and their mother is a non-Parsi. In the case that their father is a non-Parsi and their mother is a Parsi, they are not allowed to identify as Parsi nor be raised as such. Such children are, like their Parsi mothers post-marriage to a non-Parsi man, unable to enter the Agyaris nor be accepted into the faith group through the ritual, the Navjote. === Notable court cases === There have been a series of judicial cases concerning women's rights within the Parsi community that have been escalated to the High Courts of India. Such cases have brought legal, media, and popular attention to progression towards greater rights for Parsi women. One such case is that of a Parsi women, Goolrukh Gupta, who married a Hindu man and was subsequently barred from entering all Parsi sacred spaces as an intermarried women. Gupta sued the local Parsi trust in her town of Valsad, Gujarat that imposed the restriction on her. Her case was soon escalated to the Gujarat High Court. Gupta made the case that she was married under the Special Marriage Act of 1956 and thus her civil marriage should be recognized in all communities. However, the High Court ruled in favor of the trust and Gupta remained a Hindu, and not a Parsi, in the eyes of the trust and legal system. A second famous case is the Parsi Punchayet Case of 1909. In this case, Sir Dinshaw Petit sued the Bombay Parsi Panchayet (BPP). His case was that the funds from the BPP trust were being restricted from Parsi converts, as people who could also benefit from the offerings of the trust. In this case, Ratanji D. Tata and his wife, a born French woman, were both plaintiffs. Mrs. Tata had converted to the Parsi religion, and yet as a convert, the BPP barred her from entering any agiarys and disabled her from being buried in the sacred site, the Tower of Silence or the doongerwadi. Again, the High Court ruled in favor of the trust. In a third case, in December 2017, the Supreme Court of India ruled in favor of women's rights. Despite both being married to non-Parsi men, two Parsi sisters were granted the right to attend their father's burial at the Tower of Silence. In this case, the Court ruled against the Mumbai Parsi trust that was banning both the women. The Court however, could not secure the right of the women to pray. == Informal rights for women == Ritualized Spaces and traditions also influence the rights and role of women in the Zoroastrian community, in a more informal, yet pervasive, manner. === Ritual spaces === In addition to legal restrictions, women in the Parsi community face restrictions in ritualized, religious spaces as well. One of the most notable examples of this is that women are often not allowed into the doongerwadi and other sacred burial grounds for Parsis throughout India. === Community spaces === Parsi women also face discrimination in community spaces, such as social clubs. Many such clubs in Mumbai have adopted the British idea of a \\"gentleman's club\\" by only granting membership to males. One prominent example of this is the Ripon Club. Following backlash from the community, the Ripon Club began granting membership to females. Approximately 10% of their members are female, all of whom are considered to be \\"lady associate members\\". Such members must attain their membership either through a Parsi father or a Parsi husband who is a member. They do not have voting rights within the club. == In religious scripture == The rights of women within the Parsi faith can be analyzed through scriptures and ancient Zoroastrian texts, such as the Avesta. However, the scriptures can be analyzed and perceived in many different ways. The result is two main camps of text interpreters - a liberal camp and an orthodox camp. Those who read the text with a liberal perspective state that the Parsi prophet, Zarathustra, has always addressed both men and women through his words and actions. The orthodox view states that no one who is half Parsi, whether male or female, born to a Parsi mother or father, should be considered to be a Parsi at all. These people believe that laws and access, even those that allow children born to Parsi fathers and non-Parsi mothers, should only be made more strict and restrictive. ==References== Category:Zoroastrianism Category:Women and religion ","title":"Women in Zoroastrianism"},{"id":"56740903","text":"The Vanuatu Labor Corps was a labour unit of the United States Armed Forces consisting of New Hebrides natives. The unit was established in 1942 and dissolved in 1945, during its service it provided crucial logistical support to the Allied war effort during the Guadalcanal Campaign. It was jointly led by Major George Riser and Thomas Beatty, while its size fluctuated between 1,000 and 10,000 men. ==Background== Following the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States of America officially entered the Pacific War on the side of the Allies. In an attempt to halt the rapid Japanese expansion southward, which threatened Australia's marine communication lines, American troops occupied the Anglo-French New Hebrides Condominium in early 1942. The first American troops landed on Efate in March, establishing joint rule with the colonial authorities. In May, the construction of a large airfield was initiated amidst the arrival of reinforcements. American military facilities were erected in Port Vila, Port Havannah and Espiritu Santo. Those included eight coastwatching stations, ammunition depots, airfields, ports, encampments and water supply systems. They played an important role as a transit point for the transportation of military equipment and the evacuation of wounded personnel during the course of the Guadalcanal Campaign. At the peak of the campaign Espiritu Santo became the second-largest American base in the Pacific, housing 40,000 people. By 1943, the New Hebrides had lost much of their strategic importance and the bases shifted their focus to rear line support. ==Service== The arising situation necessitated the recruitment of indigenous Ni-Vanuatu population into a labor unit. At first, the Americans used the colonial authorities as middlemen during the hiring process as they had previously done with Solomon Islands Labour Corps and the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit. However frequent disagreements between the French and the British in combination with complaints from the laborers regarding the quality of the food they were served, prompted the Americans to assume control. By the end of 1942, the Vanuatu Labor Corps numbered 1,000 people who worked three-month-long tours each. Once the labor resources of Efate had been exhausted recruits started coming from Tanna, Ambae and smaller islands eventually swelling the unit's numbers to 10,000 men. Workers were separated into 20-man groups, led by a single person who could speak the local language, Bislama. Those were divided between the US Army and US Navy, and supervised by Major George Riser and Thomas Beatty respectively. While the recruits had to build their own huts for accommodation, other necessities such as food, clothing, dogtags, medical care and cigarettes were provided for them by the American military. Workers were paid 7.50 USD per month, with the wages purposefully lowered as colonial authorities feared post-war inflation. They also imposed restrictions on the attire, eating habits, length of contracts, the number of workers and their interactions with foreigners. Those were dropped once the Americans took over the unit's management. The men normally worked 10 hour days, with a single day off every 14 days. Tasks performed included stevedoring, mosquito eradication, hospital work and supply delivery. Although no member of the corps died in combat, deaths from disease, work- related accidents and overwork were not uncommon. The formation was dissolved following the departure of the Americans from the island in 1945. The mass participation of Ni-Vanuatu men in the Labor Corps had a significant effect on the John Frum movement, giving it the characteristics of a cargo cult. ==Footnotes== ==References== * * Category:Military units and formations of the United States in World War II Category:Military units and formations established in 1942 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1945 Category:Non-combatant military personnel Category:1940s in the New Hebrides ","title":"Vanuatu Labor Corps"},{"id":"56740916","text":"The Vogelinsel is an island in Lake Constance with an area of around 600 square metres.

It is a complex piece with multiple guitar parts and reflects a variety of styles. Lyrically, Hendrix continues to explore an idealized feminine figure, as in his 1967 song \\"Little Wing\\". Hendrix recorded the piece in the summer of 1970 at his new Electric Lady Studios with drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Billy Cox. He proposed the song for his fourth album and it is one of the few that are seen as largely complete. \\"Night Bird Flying\\" was initially released on the first Hendrix posthumous album, The Cry of Love (1971). The track is included on several subsequent Hendrix compilations. ==History== Hendrix used elements of the song's rhythm pattern in jams at TTG Studios in Los Angeles in October 1968. In early 1969, he started to develop it as \\"Ships Passing in the Night\\" and several demos were recorded before Hendrix attempted a proper recording in his newly built Electric Lady Studios on June 16, 1970. After 32 takes, he completed the master. Overdubs were recorded on July 19 and August 22, before a final mix was accomplished on August 24, 1970. Hendrix and all involved in the recording were very pleased with the song and it was presented on the opening party of Electric Lady on August 26. The song was chosen as a B-side for \\"Dolly Dagger\\" and a master for a single was prepared by Reprise Records. However, the single was cancelled when Hendrix died on September 18, 1970. In 1971, the song was included on the posthumous Hendrix album, The Cry of Love. In the UK, it was released as the single B-side to \\"Angel\\" on Track Records. ==Personnel== *Jimi Hendrixvocals, guitar, production, audio mixing *Billy Coxbass guitar *Mitch Mitchelldrums, production *Eddie Kramerproduction, audio engineering, mixing ==References== ==External links== *[https://www.vevo.com/watch/jimi-hendrix/night-bird-flying-(behind-the- scenes)/USSM21201813 \\"Night Bird Flying\\" (Behind the Scenes) on Vevo]: Eddie Kramer (with Mitch Mitchell and Billy Cox) demonstrates some of the mulitrack guitar parts recorded at Electric Lady Studios, New York City.

It stars Billie Dove, Huntley Gordon, and Miriam Battista, and was released on December 11, 1921. The film gives a glimpse into the behind-the-scenes reality of life in the New York theater, as seen by a small town girl trying to make it in the big city. The picture received mixed reviews. This was Dove's first time on film, having moved over from the Ziegfeld Follies. ==Plot== Mary Matthews is the elder sister of Helen, who is the favorite of their widowed mother. Growing up, she continually has to accede to Helen's wants and preferences. However, when the selfish Helen steals Mary's fianc√©, Mary leaves home to try and make a life in New York City. She gets a part as a chorus girl in a Broadway production, but refuses to give in to the wanton lifestyle so prevalent among the other dancers. One night she is being pursued by the stage manager to join the gang in going out to one of their parties, but she keeps refusing. The stage manager becomes more and more aggressive, until he is on the verge of forcing her to accompany him. Mary is saved by the intervention of Philip Pierce, the heir of a socially prominent family, who punches out the stage manager. The two become friends, and there is a growing attraction. However, at the insistence of his friends, who feel that \\"all chorus girls are alike\\", Philip makes a dishonorable proposition to her. Afterwards he realizes his mistake and apologizes, and the two reignite their mutual attraction. He eventually proposes to her, and tells her that the following evening he will meet her and present her with an engagement ring. However, he fails to show up at the rendezvous, and in the papers the next morning there is an announcement of his engagement to a wealthy socialite. Mary is crushed. That night, despondent over being let down once again, she is on the verge of giving in and accompanying \\"the gang\\" on one of their licentious evenings out. Philip arrives just in time to prevent her from making a mistake. He explains that he missed the rendezvous because he indeed went to see his fianc√©e, who had arrived home unexpectedly from Europe. But he went to see her to break off their engagement, so that he could marry Mary. Unfortunately, Philip's mother jumped the gun on the wedding announcement. The two are reconciled and are married. ==Cast list== Billie Dove (seated) along with the rest of the chorus girls * Frances Hess as Helen Mathews * Elizabeth North as Helen Mathews, later * Miriam Battista as Mary Mathews * Billie Dove as Mary Mathews, later * Margaret Foster as Mrs. Mathews * William Collier Jr. as Arthur Bates * Carlton Griffin as George Andrews (credited as C.

Most of the film was shot on several sets at Robertson-Cole's West 61st Street studio in New York City, while several scenes were shot on location inside the Park Theatre, as well as outside of its stage door. The working title of the film was Women of Conquest. During filming in November, dozens of members of the press were invited on set to watch the shooting of one of the scenes. One scene shot on location in the Park Theatre included the use of over 600 extras as audience members. The film was released on December 11, 1921. ==Reception== Exhibitors Herald gave the picture a positive review, calling it \\"A rapidly moving and interesting story of a small town girl who has to give up everything for her more favored sister, and her adventures and misadventures after becoming a chorus girl.\\" They called it one of Cabanne's best films, and praised the overall casting of the movie. They highlighted Billie Dove's acting as \\"brilliant\\", and also were impressed with Miriam Battista. They were less impressed by the cinematography, which they described as simply adequate. Variety, on the other hand, was less impressed with the picture, while finding the photography \\"exceptionally good.\\" They felt the picture was over-melodramatic, and the ending somewhat farcical, lowering the overall quality of the entire film. They felt the supporting cast was adequate, but they were impressed with the comedic talents of Doris Eaton. Motion Picture News took the opposite view, holding that Cabanne's vision of New York theater life had \\"... all the piquancy of theatrical life to fascinate the picture public, and it has also wholesome and at times gripping drama, and plenty of human interest drama.\\" They felt that Cabanne did not give the stereotypical picture of backstage life, but a more realistic interpretation. They felt that the cast was \\"well- nigh perfect\\" in their performances, particularly highlighting the work of Billie Dove, stating \\"... an actress with exactly the wistful, appealing expression needed for such a part.\\" Their overall impression was that the film was a \\"delightful, absorbing story of theatrical life.\\" ==References* * Category:Films directed by Christy Cabanne Category:Film Booking Offices of America films Category:American silent feature films Category:American films Category:1921 romantic drama films Category:American romantic drama films Category:1921 drama films Category:1921 films ","title":"At the Stage Door"},{"id":"56741338","text":"is an upcoming Japanese animated film directed by Hayao Miyazaki and animated by Studio Ghibli.

However, Estonia's independence came to a de facto end during World War II when the country was illegally occupied and annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940, then Nazi Germany in 1941 and returned to Soviet rule in 1944 when it became the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic. As a result, a government in exile was established. As the political upheavals taking place throughout the Soviet Union in the 1980s, during the events of Baltic Way, Estonia declared sovereignty on its territory in 1988, which restored its de facto independence on 8 May 1990 and declared Soviet rule illegal. Following the aborted coup in Moscow, the country's full de facto independence was restored after the Soviet troops failed to seize the Tallinn TV Tower on 20 August 1991. The Soviet State Council recognized the Estonian independence on 6 September 1991.

She is MƒÅori, from the Te Arawa and NgƒÅti T≈´wharetoa iwi (tribes). Morrison was the first New Zealand woman and the first MƒÅori person to play at Wimbledon and reached the quarter-finals in 1957. She also won 13 national New Zealand tennis titles. == Early life == Morrison was born in 1936 at Tikitere, a small farming community between Lake Rotoiti and Rotorua in New Zealand's North Island. She was the third of nine children born to Hingawaka (Waki) Morrison and Tanira Kingi. In 1944, the family moved from Tikitere to live in Te Koutu, Rotorua. Shortly afterwards, Hingawaka Morrison, a rugby and tennis player, built two tennis courts in the community. Morrison, aged 8 years old, wanted to play on the courts but as she was so young her father made her a wooden bat and coached her while she practised on the walls of their house instead. Morrison attended Rotokawa and Rotorua Primary Schools, Rotorua High School, and Te Puke High School, before moving to Auckland in 1953 where she enrolled at Queen Victoria School for Maori Girls. After finishing high school, Morrison attended Auckland Teachers' College, where she continued to play tennis and also began a long tennis relationship with Heather Robson. == Adult life == Morrison won the national singles title in 1956 and it became clear that for her to make progress in tennis she would need to compete overseas. Hoani Waititi, a prominent educator and tennis umpire, formed a fundraising campaign to help Morrison travel to England to compete at Wimbledon. The campaign was successful, raising more than enough for the trip, and Morrison and Robson left New Zealand in 1957 for England. At Wimbledon, Morrison reached the fourth round, beating Billy Woodgate, J.L. Debford and Sheila Armstrong but losing to American player Betty Pratt, ranked fourth in the world. Pratt invited Morrison, along with the Wimbledon champions Althea Gibson and Maria Bueno, to the Caribbean the following year for international tennis tournaments at Montego Bay, Jamaica, and San Juan, Puerto Rico. In 1958, Morrison reached the third round of Wimbledon. In 1959, she competed at the British Hard Court championships, losing to Christine Truman in the quarter-finals. She won the Guildford Championships by beating South Africa‚Äôs Joan Cross, and the mixed-doubles with Mexican Gustavo Palafox as her partner. The same year, Morrison and Pat Nettleton reached the third round of the ladies' doubles at Wimbledon and Morrison made the fourth round of the mixed-doubles with Brian Woolf from New Zealand. In the Wimbledon singles, Morrison reached the fourth round, losing to the eventual champion, Maria Bueno. In later years, Morrison won the New Zealand national singles title an additional five times and the national doubles title several times as well. In 1961, Morrison donated the excess money from the 1956 fundraising campaign to the Maori Education Board, rather than travelling to Wimbledon again. Despite not competing internationally that year, she still won the national singles and doubles titles in 1962. In 1959 and 1960, Morrison entered the W.D. & H.O. Wills tournament in Auckland, winning the women's title in both years; in 1960 she also won the doubles and mixed-doubles. In 1965, Morrison and Elizabeth Terry were selected to travel to Melbourne to compete in the Federation Cup. They beat Argentina but lost to Australia. === Recognition === Ruia Morrison visiting Queen Victoria School for MƒÅori girls circa 1960s In the 1960 New Year Honours, Morrison was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services in the field of sport, especially tennis.

In his will, the professor asks to revive him with the solution. Assistant Professor Dr. Korn connects the professor's head to the solution, and leaves the body in the car, ignites the car and throws it off the road outside the city. Arthur, son of the professor, comes to the funeral of his father. In a charred car, Arthur discovers an object belonging to Dr. Korn, and gives it to the district police officer as evidence. The professor's head informs Dr. Korn of the code from the bank account of the professor, and Korn is able to pay off his debts. The police tries to detain drug traffickers in a restaurant; as a result of the shootout, two women are killed. The pathologist writes out the death certificates of two women and passes the bodies to Dr. Korn. Korn connects the head from one body to the body from the other, the woman named Eva and revives with the help of the professor's solution. The head of Eva belonged to a singer who came for a tour, and the body to Arthur's girlfriend. Korn wants to learn how to create the life-giving solution; The professor's head is against this and twice gives Korn the wrong formula.

She began her career as an actress before venturing into recording in Los Angeles where she released a few singles. Hathaway became known in the 1950s for her activism and golfing. She co-founded the NAACP Image Awards in 1967. == Life and career == A native of Campti, Louisiana, Hathaway traveled to Los Angeles in 1931 in hopes of playing piano in one of the clubs on Central Avenue, also known as \\"Black Broadway\\". Instead, she began her career in the area working as an extra in Hollywood films, usually as an \\"Egyptian\\" or an \\"exotic.\\" After auditioning for Cabin in the Sky, Hathaway was hired as a body double for Lena Horne throughout much of the film; she later worked as Horne's stand-in in Stormy Weather. However, her Hollywood career ended when she refused to play an extra in a biopic about Woodrow Wilson which required her to wear a bandanna and sit on a bale of cotton. She then returned to singing in cabaret in Los Angeles clubs, recording several songs including ‚ÄúBayou Baby Blues,‚Äù ‚ÄúSchool Girl Blues,‚Äù ‚ÄúA Falling Star‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhen Gabriel Blows His Horn‚Äù with The Robins and ‚ÄúHere Goes a Fool‚Äù as a solo artist. During the civil rights movement, Hathaway would become a major activist in the Los Angeles-Hollywood region. After she took up golf as a pastime after winning a bet against Joe Louis in 1955, she began agitating against local golf courses which restricted black patrons from usage. By 1958, she began writing a golf column in the California Eagle about black professional players. She also wrote a golf column in the Los Angeles Sentinel. In 1960, Hathaway organized the Minority Association for Golfers (MAG) to support young black golfers by advocating for golf-related employment. In 1963, Hathaway led a picket during the PGA at the Long Beach municipal golf course to protest a lock of golf jobs for black professional golfers. She also campaigned for an increase black player participation in PGA tournaments. Her agitation spread to broader issues. Hathaway became the founding president of the newly-chartered Beverly Hills- Hollywood branch of the NAACP in 1962. In 1967, she joined with Sammy Davis, Jr. and Willis Edwards in holding the first NAACP Image Awards. In 1975, Hathaway petitioned for Lee Elder to be invited to play in the Masters Tournament. During the following decades, she continued to write for the Los Angeles Sentinel. She organized opportunities for young minorities to play and received financial help from PGA players, including Jack Nicklaus. Hathaway died on September 24, 2001. == Personal life == She was married to at least four husbands, including King Coleman (from 1979 to 1984).

Its origins seem to be in the Lena river basin of Yakutia, and also along the Yenisei river. From there it spread both to the east and to the west.Kicki N√§slund, Short summary of Siberian pre-history and cultures - Academia.edu Individual sites were also found in Taymyr. It is named after Ymyyakhtakh, a settlement in the Sakha Republic, Russia. ==Description== A. Golovnev discusses Ymyyakhtakh culture in the context of a ‚Äúcircumpolar syndrome‚Äù, :\\"... some features of the East Siberian Ymyyakhtakh culture spread amazingly quickly as far as Scandinavia. Ceramics with wafer prints are found at the Late Bronze Age monuments of the Taimyr Peninsula, Yamal Peninsula, Bolshezemelskaya and Malozemelskaya tundra, the Kola Peninsula, and Finland (not to mention East Siberia and North-East Asia).\\" A distinctive feature of the culture is the round-bottomed ceramics with waffle and ridge prints on the outer surface. Stone and bone arrowheads, spears and harpoons are richly represented. Armour plates were also used in warfare. Finds of bronze ware are frequent in the burial grounds. The culture was formed by the tribes migrating from the shores of Lake Baikal to the south, merging with the local substrate of the Bel'kachi culture. The carriers of culture are identified either with the Yukagirs ethnic group, or perhaps with the Chukchi and Koryaks. The Ymyyakhtakh culture continued at least until the first centuries of our era. It was later replaced by the Ust-Mil culture. ==Migrations== After 1,700 BC, the Ymyyakhtakh culture is believed to have spread to the east as far as the Chukotka peninsula, where it was in cultural contact with the Eskimo-Aleut language speakers, and the Paleo-Eskimos. A ceramic complex comparable to the Ymyyakhtakh culture (typified by pottery with an admixture of wool) is also found in northern Fennoscandia towards the end of the second millennium BC. ==See also== *Prehistory of Siberia *Syalakh culture ==References== ==Further reading== * Fedoseeva S.

Originally published in October 1920 in the Lamp of Learning supplement to the New Journal of Current Affairs (ÊôÇ‰∫ãÊñ∞Â†±„ÄÇÂ≠∏Ááà), it was later included in his first collection of short stories, A Call to Arms (Âê∂Âñä). It is based on Lu Xun's own experience of cutting off his queue and reflects his negative opinion of the Chinese national character. ==Background== A Chinese criminal with the queue hairstyle, also wearing a cangue around his neck as punishment In 1644, after the conquest of China by the Manchurian Qing dynasty, Han Chinese males were forced as a symbol of subservience to adopt the queue, a Manchurian hairstyle consisting of shaving the forehead and wearing the rest of one's hair in a long plait. In 1903, while a student in Japan, Lu Xun cut off his queue, adopted the Japanese Western-style student uniform and grew a moustache. When he returned to Shaoxing in August, his family were scandalised. Lu Xun bought a false queue and wore traditional clothing in the streets, but people noticed the queue was not real and he was jeered at. Lu Xun then did not use the queue and wore Western clothing, attracting even more attention and being called a \\"fake foreign devil\\". For the rest of his stay, Lu Xun remained at home. Later, Lu Xun became a school teacher, and attracted derision from the students when he did not urge them to abandon the queue. In his later story A Storm in a Teacup, a boatman arrives in a Republican village and finds his queue chopped off by revolutionaries, which causes him anxiety when he hears of the abortive Manchu Restoration.(Chinese) ÁóÖÂæåÈõúË´á‰πãÈ§ò by Lu Xun at Wikisource ==Synopsis== The narrator, who lives in Beijing, notices that October 10 - Double Ten Day (the National Day of the Republic of China, commemorating the fall of the Qing dynasty)- is not marked on his calendar. (The story was commissioned for a special October 10 issue of the Lamp of Learning.) Mr N (ÂÖàÁîüÔºÆ), an older acquaintance based on Lu Xun's superior Xia Huiqing at the Ministry of Education, angrily dismisses the importance of the day, which he says is only remembered because the police remind people to put up the flag. Changing tone, he reminisces sadly about his friends who died during the anti-Qing struggle. N then describes his own experience of cutting of his queue, which mirrors that of Lu Xun. N reflects on the subservient position of China, mentioning that he once read an interview with a Japanese traveller who said that he had no need to speak Chinese or Malay when in those countries because he could make himself understood by beating the natives with his cane. He concludes the story by posing a question to idealists like the narrator, quoting the Russian writer Mikhail Artzybashev (who was popular in China at the time): \\"You promise a golden age to these people's sons and grandsons, but what do you have to offer them here and now?\\" ==Notes== ==External links== * Full text of È†≠È´ÆÁöÑÊïÖ‰∫ã in Chinese at Wikisource Category:1920 short stories Category:Chinese Republican era short stories Category:Works by Lu Xun ","title":"The Story of Hair"},{"id":"56741518","text":"WSIQ is an AM radio station licensed to Salem, Illinois and broadcasting on the frequency of 1350 kHz.

She attended Jersey Academy for four years in the early 1960s. A progressive private High School, many of the faculty members had been blackballed during the earlier 1950s red-baiting era for suspected Communist leanings or membership in the party, and had been given employment by the progenitor of the school, Robert Lustgarten, a wealthy stockbroker with left-liberal leanings. Numerous faculty members, from historians and literary scholars to actively practicing and published poets, held an internationalist and cosmopolitan worldview they shared with the students, that included French Symbolist, 20th-century German and Russian poetry, Whitman and Hart Crane, European Classical music, and in particular foreign films - which included the masterpieces of the Italian neo- realists, Satyajit Ray, Fellini, Antonioni, Bergman, Andrzej Wajda and Kurasawa among others.

Mthunzi began to work for the National Laser Centre in the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, where she set up a functional cell-culture facility. Whilst at a conference in San Diego, Mthunzi-Kufa saw a presentation on optical tweezers which made her consider a career in biophotonics. It was not possible to study this in South Africa, so she moved to University of St Andrews, where she was the first South African PhD student in the discipline. She earned her PhD in 2010, \\"Optical sorting and photo-transfection of mammalian cells\\". She was a member of the SPIE students chapter in St Andrews. == Career == As lead for biophotonics research at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Mthunzi users high power lasers to characterise and treat disease. She uses lasers to optically manipulate cells at the microscopic scale, including: * Embryonic stem cells for tissue engineering * Neuroblastoma cells for neurodegenerative studies * HIV-1 cells for targeted drug delivery in latent viral sites * Cancer cells to study single cell processes She visited Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology to discuss Biomedical Applications of Lasers in Biophotonics in 2013. In 2015, Mthunzi was appointed a TED Fellow. Her TED talk, Could we cure HIV with lasers?, has been viewed over one million times. She used the opportunity to discuss wish to translate her research from petri dishes to human testing. Her talk was well received by the audience in Vancouver and scientists all over the world.

Smith typically creates narrative oil paintings. In Patricia Hickson‚Äôs text about Emily Mae Smith‚Äôs exhibition at the Wadsworth Atheneum, she writes, ‚ÄúWith a nod to distinct painting movements in the history of art, such as Symbolism, Surrealism, and Pop art, Emily Mae Smith creates lively compositions that offer sly social and political commentary.‚Äù == Education == Smith attended the University of Texas from 1997-2002, receiving a B.F.A. in Studio Art. Upon graduating in 2002, she was presented with the Roy Crane Award by the University of Texas. In 2005, Smith received the Edward Mazzella Jr. Scholarship from Columbia University. And in 2006, she received her M.F.A. in Visual Art from Columbia University. == Selected Works == === Symbolism of the broom === An anthropomorphized broom is a reoccurring symbol in Smith‚Äôs works. Patricia Hickson writes, ‚ÄúLeading with humor, she presents a vocabulary of signs and symbols that start with her avatar, inspired by the bewitched broomstick figure from The Sorcerer‚Äôs Apprentice sequence in Disney‚Äôs animated film Fantasia (1940). This unlikely (‚Ä¶) choice is an astute one as the broom simultaneously alludes to a painter‚Äôs brush, a domestic tool associated with women‚Äôs work, and the phallus. Smith‚Äôs flexible character has continued to evolve across her body of work.

She and her sister, Virginia \\"Ginnie\\" Moon are best known for their role as Confederate spies during the American Civil War. When the girls were young, their father sold their slaves and moved the family north to Oxford, Ohio where they lived in the house that is known as the \\"Lottie Moon House.\\" As spies for the Confederacy, Lottie and Ginnie smuggled information and medicine from North to South. == Early life == Moon performed in amateur plays, often using her skills as a ventriloquist. As a young woman, she was engaged to a young officer (and later Union general), Ambrose E. Burnside, whom she left at the altar. When the minister asked if she took Burnside as her husband, it is claimed that she answered \\"No siree, Bob!\\" Later, she was engaged to sixteen Confederate soldiers at once in an effort to allow them to at least die happily. == Espionage career == Before the American Civil War, Moon married Judge James Clark. Her younger sister lived with them briefly after being expelled from her school for her pro-confederacy views. The Clarks' home was a stopping point for Confederate couriers and Moon began her espionage career when a letter needed to be delivered but no courier was available. Throughout the war, both sisters used various disguises. Various anecdotal incidents include spying on President Abraham Lincoln, passing herself off as a traveling British subject with forged papers, pretending to be in horrible pain due to a dislocated jaw, and hiding medicine and pain relievers in her quilted hoop skirts. Once, the sisters and their mother were caught by Moon's jilted ex-fianc√©, General Burnside. He kept them under house arrest, but eventually released them. == Post-War == After the war, Moon moved to New York with her husband, Jim Clark. She began a second career as a journalist, eventually covering the Franco-Prussian War from various capitals in Europe. She died in Philadelphia on November 20, 1895 and was survived by her sister Ginnie and her son, Franklin Pinckney Clark. == References == == Further reading == * Bucy, Carole Stanford (25 December 2009). \\"Virginia Bethel Moon\\".

An expert on waterborn illness, she holds a co- appointment in the College of Public Health. She works to introduce and maintain high quality water systems in rural regions. == Career == Brion first followed her interests to Duncan, Lagnese, and Associates Incorporated, an industrial waste company, where she acted as the Sewer Studies Field Team Supervisor. From 1979 to 1980, Brion worked as the Sewage Treatment Plant Operator for the Brush Run Municipal in Mckeesport, PA where she analyzed water and waste water. The following year, she moved to another Municipal Sewage Treatment Plant in Rock Springs, Wyoming where she took over as the Chief Lab Analyst. From 1981 to 1982 Brion worked as a Product Specialist for the Hach Company, assisting in chemical analysis and customer troubleshooting. Starting in March of 1982, she began as the Plant Chemist for the Fort St. Vrain Generating Station, analyzing the cooling, waste, and natural water systems. 1984 marked the start of her 6 year employment for the United States Environmental Protection Agency, working under 3 different divisions over that time span. While in the Water Quality Division Brion worked as a Co-op Student Engineer. In the Air and Toxics Division she held the title of NESHAPS Asbestos Coordinator and finally in the Office of Air Quality Rulings and Standards as an Environmental Engineer. Brion worked for the Environmental Protection Agency before she began teaching engineering at the University of Kentucky in 1995. She now connects research and work between the University of Kentucky's Environmental Engineering program and the College of Public Health to accomplish mutual goals that benefit public health through engineering. She is concerned that the lack of ongoing support for water infrastructure in marginalized areas is resulting in ongoing deterioration that will continue until \\"something large and catastrophic happens\\". == Education == In 1978, Brion received her bachelor of science degree in Environmental Engineering from the University of California. Continuing her educational journey, Brion then completed both her masters of science and PhD in Civil Engineering at the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1985 and 1995 respectively. == Advocacy == Brion's interest in waterborn illness began in childhood, inspired by personal experiences with water contamination. Some of her friends became ill after wading in a city park creek. After investigating, she found an unregulated straight pipe dumping untreated hospital wastes into the water. She also saw a migrant family, whose children were too sick to work at a berry field, drinking untreated irrigation water because no other water sources were available. She commented, \\"a desire to make a difference was kindled.\\" ==References== == External links == * * Gail Brion, ResearchGate * Category:Living people Category:Kentucky women engineers Category:Kentucky women scientists Category:University of Kentucky faculty Category:Engineers from Kentucky Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Gail Brion"},{"id":"56741696","text":"HCIL may refer to: * Honda Cars India Ltd (HCIL) * University of Maryland Human‚ÄìComputer Interaction Lab (HCIL) ==See also== * HCI (disambiguation) ","title":"HCIL"},{"id":"56741706","text":"Jessica Muscat (born 27 February 1989 in Mosta, Malta), more commonly known as Jessika is a Maltese singer and actress.

It is not to be confused with the Great River Road Wine Trail that follows along the banks of the Mississippi River. It is notably referenced in numerous books and magazines. ==History== The River Road (Monterey County, California G-17) follows along the banks of the Salinas River and predates the wineries by many decades. It runs along the length of the Santa Lucia Highlands AVA. The earliest grape plantings, however, were in the 1790s, with the arrival of the Spanish missions in California. The arrival of commercial wineries (and wine-tasting), began in the early 1970s, with initial plantings by Smith at Paraiso, by McFarland at Sleepy Hollow, by Johnson at La Estancia, and by Hahn at Smith & Hook. The hot days of the Salinas Valley make for good Syrahs, and the cool foggy nights are ideal for Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and other cool-climate varieties. Currently there are at least 24 wineries in the Salinas Valley with at least 13 tasting rooms lining River Road, going from Salinas, California south to Greenfield, California. They are perched on the Santa Lucia Highlands, and present great views of the rich farmlands below. The Salinas River Wine Trail was named by Wine Enthusiast Magazine in the top ten wine travel destinations in the world, with only two other locations (New York and Oregon) from North America. ==Distance to wine-tasting facilities== The Wine-Tasting Facilities are usually encountered driving south from Highway 68 where it crosses the Salinas River. Using that as a starting point, the Wine-Tasting distances are tabulated below: 1\\\\. Odonata Wines South ‚Ä¢ 645 River Road, Salinas ‚Äì 7 mi. 2\\\\.

After relocating to the United States in 1940, Riese studied with Clyfford Still at Virginia Commonwealth University (from 1943-1945) and with Will Barnet in New York (from 1955-1965). She moved to New York in 1949. She joined American Abstract Artists, where she served as president (from 1990) for more than a decade. She was a member of A.I.R. Gallery, the first all female artists cooperative gallery in the United States. ==Works== Riese had many solo exhibitions and her artwork is in the collections of more than forty museums, including the Brooklyn Museum, Krannert Art Museum, Pratt Institute, Museum of Modern Art, National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, Snite Museum of Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, and others. For her artworks that employ a grid structure, Riece may have taken inspiration from the work of Indian Space painters in the 1940s and early 1950s, including Will Barnet. Stephen Westfall argues that although those works are not structured using a grid, they share the same \\"interlocking spatial reversals and movements and fluid hard-edged style.\\" ==Art collecting== Riece collected African and Native American artwork. She acquired her first piece of African art in 1950 from Julius Carlebach, one of the earliest dealers of African art in New York. Her African art collection now belongs to the Brooklyn Museum. The museum organized an exhibition of thirty of her West and Central African masks and figural sculptures in 2000. She also gave artwork from her collection to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts and the Snite Museum of Art at Notre Dame University. == References == Category:American women artists Category:American art collectors Category:1917 births Category:2004 deaths Category:Virginia Commonwealth University alumni Category:Artists from The Hague Category:German emigrants to the United States ","title":"Beatrice Riese"},{"id":"56741852","text":"George Dickinson Hadley FRCP (30 June 1908 ‚Äì 14 August 1984) was an English gastroenterologist. He served in the Royal Army Medical Corps during the Second World War and was taken prisoner during the Dunkirk evacuation. He made several failed escape attempts during his incarceration. In 1963 he introduced the gastrocamera to Britain, thus enabling the development of endoscopy in that country. ==Early life and family== George Dickinson Hadley, known as \\"Dicken\\" at home, was born on 30 June 1908, the son of Laurence Hadley, editor of the Birmingham Post.George Dickinson Hadley. Munk's Roll, Royal College of Physicians. Retrieved 6 March 2018. He was educated at King Edward VI School, Birmingham, and then at Clare College, University of Cambridge, from where he earned a first class honours degree in natural sciences. He married Jean Stewart in 1947, who was a professional viola player, and they had three daughters who all played instruments. The composer Ralph Vaughan Williams later became a patient and confidant. Hadley inherited a library of fishing books from his father which he rebound and he was a fly-fisher himself as well as having an interest in oriental rugs. In later life he became so proficient at book-binding that dealers sent their books to him to work on.\\"Dr George Hadley\\", The Times, 1 September 1984, p. 10. ==Medical career== Hadley was house physician to Charles Lakin and house surgeon to Gordon Gordon-Taylor. Between 1936 and 1938 he became an Elmore research student at Cambridge and established his lifelong interest in peptic ulcers. Subsequently, he became registrar to Donald Hunter at the London Hospital. At the start of the Second World War in 1939, he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps. He was captured during the Dunkirk evacuation and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner despite several escape attempts. Being of a professional standard in cello and with instruments provided by the Red Cross, he helped establish an orchestra in his prisoner of war camp. Having plenty of time on his hands, he was also closely involved in the prisoners' observations of nesting birds, the studies of which found their way into the Collins New Naturalist book series after the war. His war-time experience greatly affected him, however, and he turned from a pre-war \\"typical medical student ‚Äì outgoing with a love of fast cars\\" to an \\"intensely shy and often monosyllabic\\" man who developed a \\"reputation for epigrammatic description\\" from which he partly recovered with the help of his wife. After the war, Hadley became resident medical officer at the Middlesex Hospital. A year later, he was appointed assistant physician, and was later chosen to be physician at the Canadian Red Cross Hospital, Taplow. He used the Hermon Taylor and Schindler instruments from 1949 and imported the first gastrocamera to Britain from Japan in 1963. He went on to be a pioneer of fibreoptic endoscopy. His 1967 paper with L.M. Blendis and A.J. Cameron in Gut, titled \\"Analysis of 400 examinations using the gastrocamera\\", was described by the editors as confirming \\"the claim that the use of the gastrocamera is a safe, simple, and easily learnt technique which has been found to be of considerable value in the diagnosis of gastric diseases.\\"L.M.

Padelford boats cruise on the Mississippi River and celebrate the history of the region. The Padelford Riverboat Company is based at Harriet Island in downtown St. Paul. The company was founded in 1969 by William Bowell - a World War II decorated veteran - at a time when the Mississippi River was neglected and underused. The activities of Bowell and Padelford helped build relationships between the people and the river, and spurred positive changes on the riverfront. ==History== Founder William Bowell grew up close to the river, helping his father's small business on Harriet Island. He served in World War II, then enrolled at Macalester College after the war. His lifelong dream was to pilot a boat on the Mississippi River. He was a curator for the Minnesota Historical Society and later a businessman, but returned to the river in 1969 to start the Padelford Riverboat business. His lifelong collection of books about the river, along with historic photographs, books, blueprints, original documents, and other reference materials are stored in the Captain William D. Bowell, Jr. River Library, housed in the National Mississippi River Museum & Aquarium in Dubuque, Iowa. After initially purchasing the paddle steamer Jonathan Padelford, Bowell continued to expand the boat inventory. He also expanded the original boat itself - cutting it in half and adding a 20-foot section at midship. The eventual fleet included three coast-guard rated boats and 5 vessels total. In 2006, the three co-owners sold one of their boats, the Harriet Bishop, to buy a new overnight cruiser to replace the Viking Explorer, which had been sold in 1998. But before they could get their hands on one, the economy slipped into recession and that extra cash ended up providing the necessary resources for the company to remain in operation. ==Operations== The company was founded by Captain William Bowell, who retired in 2002, passing leadership of the company to his family members Bill Bowell Jr, Beth Myers, Shelley Kosmo, Steve Bowell, and Jim Kosmo; and General Manager Gus Gaspardo. The Padelford operated out of Harriet Island originally, and continues to this day. For a period from 1988 until 2004, they also operated from Boom Island in Minneapolis. Their Minneapolis operations were within a contract with the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board, and ended when the two parties were unable to come to terms for a new contract. Starting in 1996, Padelford partnered with the National Park Service, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, the Science Museum of Minnesota, the St. Paul chapter of the National Audubon Society, Hamline University's Center for Global Environmental Education, and other government agencies and nonprofit organizations to create a temporary floating classroom/field trip series. This field trip series on a Padelford riverboat includes curriculums involving environmental studies, ecology, aquatic life and watershed stewardship as well as cultural studies and regional history. The Padelford company partnered with the University of Minnesota to bring back their flagship vessel, the Minnesota Centennial Showboat, containing a 210-seat theater. The Showboat Players - theater students of the University - performed melodramas and olios in that venue. Originally operated by the University itself, the refurbished vessel arrived back at Harriet Island on April 17, 2002. The University decided to end the partnership due to declining interest in melodramas. Its final show - also featured during its first season - was Under the Gaslight in 2016. In 2004, the Padelford participated in the 2004 Grand Excursion, celebrating the 150-yr anniversary of the original grand excursion in 1854. As part of that event, the company provided public and private cruises from Diamond Bluff, Wisconsin for one week. The Padelford participated in other steamboat revival events throughout the region. The company was a founding member of the Passenger Vehicle Association and has been an active member in the association. ==Mississippi riverfront resurgence== In the early part of the century, industrialization and farming activities caused the Mississippi to become very polluted. Not only was the MNRRA region named and identified, but regular recreational activity of all kinds increased starting in that period. When Bowell launched the Padelford, there were no cruise lines operating in that stretch of the River - the closest was in Iowa. The locks and dams had recently been built and the river was used mainly for industrial shipping. Bowell went against that grain and provided access to the river on a recreational basis, including also a dose of regional history in each excursion. Through to the current day, the company remains involved in a wide variety of activities focused on the River. ==Vessels== The Jonathan Padelford is a nearly-authentic Mark Twain-era sternwheeler riverboat that was built in 1969 at Dubuque Boat and Boiler Co., Dubuque, IA. The boat replicates the paddle wheel mechanism, but operates on diesel fuel instead of the original steam technology. Two years after completion the Padelford was taken to a shipyard in Lemont, IL where it was cut in two and a 20-foot section was added at midship. The lengthening increased capacity and made the overall length 125 feet with a 24-foot beam. Capacity: 313. The name Jonathan Padelford is that of the founder's 10th great-maternal grandfather and territorial pioneer who came to Minnesota in 1856. In 1988 the 300-passenger sidewheeler Anson Northrup was added. Built in 1988 in Jennings, LA the Northrup started in service with public excursions on Father‚Äôs Day, June 19, 1988. Length - 92 feet. In 1990 a car/truck ferry vessel named the Brandon Paul from Tiptonville, Kentucky was acquired, renamed the Betsey Northrup and converted to a two deck, 300-passenger party barge. The main deck was enclosed while the second deck was left open but was covered for maximum sightseeing. Length - 108 feet. Viking Explorer - formerly the Arkansas Explorer - Length - 110 feet; built in 1980; Capacity - 34 passengers. Mini cruise ship with 24 staterooms, provided cruises that ranged as far as Florida. Viking Explorer was sold in 1992. Harriet Bishop - Length - 98 Feet; Built 1987, Utica, Indiana; Capacity - Harbor Cruises: 350, Riverboat Race, Themed Harbor and Parade of Tall Stacks Cruises: 300, Lunch and Dinner Cruises: 264. Captain Frank M. Whiting - Showboat built in 2002 by John Nichols of Mississippi Marine for the University of Minnesota and Padelford. Owned by the University of Minnesota and operated by Padelford as the replacement of the original Minnesota Centennial Showboat until 2016.

Large images of waves and found objects both intermix losses and gains of migration *Acariciando el chivo/Caressing the Goat: The painting Garc√≠a's painting hearkens to the 19th century after the island's separation and re-colonization by Spain. Depicted as an androgynous, Black child holding a goat, Ulises Heureaux - known as Lili and born illegitimately to a Haitian father and a mother from St.Thomas - is shown in Garcia's beautifully abstracted painting as a ghostly image existing between two swirling universes. As the man who led the country of Santo Domingo during the years 1882 until Lili's assassination in 1899 he was considered heroic, and very much a contradiction of the 20th century myth of racial whiteness that the dictator Trujillo later projected. The painting was featured in the exhibition Bordering the Imaginary: Art from the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and their Diasporas, curated by Abigail Lapin Dardashti in 2018 at BRIC Gallery, which explored the dynamic of the Haitian/Dominican diaspora. * Memories of a Utopian Island: A site-specific installation and video animation Conversation Thread in collaboration with Vladimir Cybil Charlier. Two projected silhouettes of the artists tackle contemporary issues related to their island of origin that includes both Haiti and Dominican Republic. Speaking in a mixture of French, English and Spanish and Haitian Creole the silhouettes talk back and forth about an environment of equality and collaboration rather than one of friction.

Passed on February 28, 2018, it was signed into law by President Donald Trump on March 16, 2018. As a follow-up to the Taiwan Relations Act, the bill allows high- level officials of the United States to visit Taiwan and vice versa. The law is considered a substantial upgrade to Taiwan‚ÄìUnited States relations, making them official though still sub-diplomatic. As such, the law was harshly criticized by the government of the People's Republic of China in Beijing (which had formally protested the bill through ambassador Cui Tiankai, demanding it not pass) for violating the One-China principle, which holds that Taiwan is an inalienable sovereign part of China. In July 2019, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen used this act to travel freely to New York City, New York and Denver, Colorado while in transit to countries in the Caribbean that still have official diplomatic relations with Taiwan. Before the act was passed, Taiwanese presidents usually could only meet local Texas government officials in Houston, Texas, which is where he or she could get on transit flights to the Caribbean and South America. Tsai was the first Taiwanese president to visit UN ambassadors of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in New York since the passage of the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979. In New York, she also met with a U.S. congressional delegation headed by U.S. House Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel (D-NY) and Ranking Member Michael McCaul (R-TX). In Denver, she met with the governor of Colorado, some U.S. congressmembers and mayors from the local area and visited the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. ==Background== When the U.S. established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1979, it also ceased to officially recognize Taiwan but continued to maintain unofficial relations with the island. In the same year, the U.S. enacted the Taiwan Relations Act. In 2016, the Taiwan Travel Act was introduced to the U.S. Congress by Representative Steve Chabot and Senator Marco Rubio; part of the House Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, respectively. The bill was considered a follow-up to the Taiwan Relations Act and stated that the U.S. and Taiwan had suffered from insufficient high-level communication since 1979, when the U.S. started to restrict its officials' visits to Taiwan. === Chinese pressure on Congress === In August 2017, Cui Tiankai, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, sent a letter expressing \\"grave concern\\" to leaders of the House and Senate, demanding they block provisions related to Taiwan in the National Defense Authorization Act of that year, which included the Taiwan Travel Act as well as the Taiwan Security Act of 2017. In the letter, Ambassador Cui stated the legislation together with another bill () represent ‚Äúprovocations against China‚Äôs sovereignty, national unity and security interests,‚Äù and ‚Äúhave crossed the ‚Äòred line‚Äô on the stability of the China-U.S. relationship‚Äù. US lawmakers perceived this wording, together with the Chinese threat of ‚Äúsevere consequences‚Äù as inappropriate interference and \\"out of line\\". ==== American responses ==== One Democratic aide said: ‚ÄúMaking these sorts of threats and laying down ‚Äòred lines‚Äô on domestic legislative action is neither helpful or constructive to build the sort of relationship needed between the United States and China.‚Äù The Washington Post journalist Josh Rogin noted: > Other congressional aides said that no other embassy uses threats as a > tactic to influence Congress, especially not via an official communication. > Most embassies try to build relationships and persuade U.S. policymakers to > support what they believe is in their national interest. But not China. Ranking House Foreign Affairs Committee Democrat Eliot Engel (D-NY) said in response: > ‚ÄúChina carries out this kind of heavy-handed behavior with other countries > around the world. It‚Äôs interesting to me that they now feel that they can > get away with these kind of threats and vague pressure tactics with the U.S. > Congress.‚Äù It has been suggested that China's heavy-handed tactics and direct threats to United States Congress through official communications backfired, by forcing Congress to make a show of force against perceived Chinese bullying. This effected the unanimous passage of the law. === Congressional delegation to Taiwan in September 2018 === In September 2018, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce led a bipartisan delegation of US lawmakers to Taiwan, where he was awarded the Republic of China (Taiwan)'s Order of Brilliant Star with Special Grand Cordon from President Tsai Ing-wen for his \\"outstanding contributions to Taiwan's development\\". Royce had previously been awarded the Order of Brilliant Star with Grand Cordon in 2015. Upon receiving his accolade from President Tsai on September 1st, Royce said: > ‚ÄúI am honored to receive the Order of Brilliant Star with Special Grand > Cordon and view it as a symbol of the special bonds between the U.S. and > Taiwan. I want to thank President Tsai for receiving me today, and for her > commitment to making the partnership between our two peoples even stronger ‚Äì > a commitment I share. Taiwan is one of our most important friends in the > Asia Pacific region, and our partnership is anchored in a shared commitment > to democratic values. > ‚ÄúAs a free and democratic society, Taiwan is an example to its neighbors in > the Asia Pacific. Its economy is diverse and growing, which means there is > great potential for increased economic ties. The United States will remain > steadfast in its commitments to Taiwan‚Äôs security. The Taiwan Relations Act > and the Six Assurances make it clear that a stable, free, and prosperous > Taiwan is in America‚Äôs national security interests.‚Äù ==Legislative history== On , the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs passed the bill with no opposition. Committee Chairman Ed Royce explained: > Currently, the State Department enforces self-imposed restrictions on > official travel between the U.S. and Taiwan. This bill denounces that > practice by encouraging more frequent official visits ‚Äì including at the > highest levels ‚Äì and will serve to further strengthen the critical > U.S.-Taiwan partnership. This bill builds off legislation we passed out of > the committee last month, which addressed Taiwan‚Äôs exclusion from the World > Health Assembly. The following day on , a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs commented: > The Chinese side urges the US side to comply with the one-China policy and > the principles of the three China-US joint communiques and cautiously handle > the Taiwan question, not to engage in any official exchange and contact with > Taiwan or send any wrong message to the \\"Taiwan independence\\" separatists > lest the larger picture of the China-US relations should be disrupted and > undermined. In January 2018, the bill was passed unanimously by the House of Representatives. Shortly afterwards, it was also passed unanimously by the Senate on February 28. President Donald Trump signed the Act into law on March 16, 2018. ==Provisions== Provisions of the Taiwan Travel Act state that the U.S. should: *Allow officials at all levels of the U.S. government to travel to Taiwan to meet their Taiwanese counterparts; *Allow high-level Taiwanese officials to enter the United States under respectful conditions and to meet with U.S. officials; *Encourage the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office and any other instrumentality established by Taiwan to conduct business in the United States. ==Reaction== ===Taiwan=== In January 2018, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen expressed her gratitude to the U.S. Congress for \\"supporting Taiwan‚Äôs democracy\\" through her Twitter account, stating she believed the Taiwan Travel Act would \\"strengthen and enhance the long-standing partnership between the two sides.\\" Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also showed its support for the bill, saying Taiwan was \\"committed to fostering an upgraded strategic partnership with the U.S.\\" ===People's Republic of China=== The Chinese state-controlled Xinhua News Agency indicated that China was \\"strongly dissatisfied\\" with the bill and said it violated the one-China policy that asserts Taiwan is a province of China. ==See also== *Taiwan Relations Act *TAIPEI Act *Six Assurances *Political status of Taiwan * *Taiwan‚ÄìUnited States relations *China‚ÄìUnited States relations *Cross-Strait relations *Two Chinas ==References== Category:Acts of the 115th United States Congress Category:United States foreign relations legislation Category:Taiwan‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:China‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:2018 in international relations ","title":"Taiwan Travel Act"},{"id":"56742002","text":"The D.H. and Leah Curran House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.

WCPT reports that there a total of 153,830 members organization for their Asia Western Pacific region of the organization. Support personnel are part of the workforce. == Regulation == The scope of practice is defined by the Ministry of Health that has a regulated code of conduct. There is currently no legislation to prevent private practice clinics. Patients have direct access meaning they can self-refer to private practice clinics without referral from another health care professional. A physical therapist's scope in Nepal permits: * Assess patients/clients * Make a diagnosis * Treat (interventions, advice and evaluation of outcome) * Refer to other specialists/services * Offer preventative advice/services Registration is required to practice as a licensed physiotherapist in Nepal. As of the current code of ethics, continuing professional development is not required for re-registration and membership, however, the amendment of the code of ethics have incorporated a mandatory evidence of continuing professional development, which will soon come in action. == Role of physiotherapy after the earthquake == On April 25 and May 12, 2015, two major earthquakes measuring 7.8 and 7.3 on the Richter scale struck Nepal. Out of the 75 districts of Nepal, 14 were severely affected by the earthquakes with an estimated 8600 deaths, 22,000 injuries and 505,000 homes completely destroyed. Post-disaster, health care facilities faced shortages in space and resources. Furthermore, patients facing discharge after acute care faced challenges of accessibility living in remote locations with limited health care services especially those requiring ongoing rehabilitation. With natural elements such as monsoon season, floods and landslides made access more difficult post-earthquake. Injuries included traumatic cases due to falling debris and houses collapsing due to poor building construction and high population density in larger cities. 70% of injuries were fractures with a large number of patients suffering from spinal cord injuries (200-300), amputations (40-60) as well as traumatic brain injuries, crush injuries and neuropraxia. During the time of the earthquake, 393 physiotherapists were registered with the majority of therapists located in Kathmandu. The role of physical therapist in disaster response was poorly defined with the profession being relatively new. Many physical therapists at the time worked in facilities treating patients with musculoskeletal conditions followed by neurology and rehabilitation with a small number in intensive care-unit, obstetrics and pediatrics. In response to the earthquake, physical therapists worked alongside doctors, nurses and other heath providers with triage, screening and acute care management of patients. This would includes services such as brace fitting, applying plaster cases, temporary backslabs, skin traction for femoral fractures and hip dislocations, dressing wounds, fitting assistive devices. Physiotherapists also mobilized patients, prescribed exercises, re-positioned patients to prevent secondary complications such as bed sores and chest complications post-surgery or prolonged bed rest. ==References== Category:Physical therapy Category:Health in Nepal ","title":"Physiotherapy in Nepal"},{"id":"56742043","text":"The Xiaohaituo Alpine Skiing Field is an Alpine Ski Centre that will be located in Yanqing District, a suburban district in Beijing.

It was released on March 1, 1924. ==Plot== Sally Whipple is the daughter of the local judge, who dotes on her and gives in to almost her every whim. While at the library, she catches the interest of a newspaper man, Jimmy Munroe, who is writing an article on \\"the average woman\\". Sally fits his idea of what represents that woman, and he begins to follow her around, hoping to collect information for his story. His stalking is noticed, and he is arrested. Judge Whipple, finding him harmless, yet wanting to teach him a lesson, sentences him to regularly visit Sally. During these visits a romance develops between the two. Rudolph Van Alten is the owner of a local notorious speakeasy, although he keeps his involvement in the club secret. He also begins courting Sally, although he has an ulterior motive. He has come into the possession of some letters written by the Judge's wife, which he thinks will embarrass the judge if they become public. He and his lover Mrs. La Rose, who is also the hostess at his nightclub, intend to use the letters to blackmail the judge. When Sally finds out of his plans, she offers to marry him if he will agree to turn over the letters. When La Rose overhears Van Alten seducing the young girl, she becomes jealous and calls the police, who raid the club. The Judge and Jimmy also arrive at the club, saving Sally from the raid, and in the chaos which ensues La Rose shoots and kills Van Alten, and then makes her escape.

Tooker as Colonel Crosby * Russell Griffin as \\"Tike\\" La Rose * Coit Albertson as Bill Brennon ==Production== C. C. Burr announced in late February 1923 that it had secured the rights to Dorothy De Jagers' short story, \\"The Average Woman\\". The story had appeared in the edition of April 8, 1922 of The Saturday Evening Post. In November 1923 it was announced that film would be one of the films produced during the winter of 1923-24. On December 9, 1923 Burr revealed that the following actors had been cast in the picture: Harrison Ford, David Powell, Pauline Garon, De Sacia Mooers, Burr McIntosh, William Tucker, and Russell Griffin. It was Powell's first appearance in an independent film in several years. The movie began filming in early December 1923, with Christy Cabanne at the helm. In early January 1924, it was announced that Pauline Garon had been selected to play the lead in the film. It was also learned that Coit Albertson was in the cast. The picture was filmed at Burr's Glendale studio, which was located in Glendale, Queens. By February 23 the editing on the film had been completed. While the American Film Institute's film catalogue gives a release date of March 1, 1924, The Film Daily has a release date of February 3. Burr had originally intended to distribute the film as part of a several picture deal through Associated Exhibitors, but in October 1923 he terminated that deal, agreeing to distribute the films through the state rights market. The distribution rights for South America were sold to Sociedad General Cinematografica, while the Liberty Film Company were awarded the distribution rights for Cuba. In May, the distribution rights for France, Switzerland, and Belgium were sold to Societie Cinematographique for France, Belgium and Switzerland. ==Reception== The Film Daily gave the film a positive review, although they felt the story line was trite. They enjoyed Garon's performance, and also gave good marks to Cabanne's direction and the cinematography of Brown and Sullivan. While they felt the story trite, they called the screenplay by Harris \\"very good\\". Motion Picture News gave the film a slightly positive review. They enjoyed Cabanne's direction, and called the production a \\"simple story, treated with considerable discretion, smoothly and logical told.\\" They highlighted the acting work of Powell and McIntosh, and especially praised Mooers work as the vengeful hostess (Mrs. LaRose). They felt Ford's work was flat, and thought that Garon's performance worked at times, particularly during the romantic sequences, but left something to be desired in other places. ==Notes== After the film's release, the author of the short story, Dorothy De Jagers, sued C. C. Burr over a disagreement regarding her rights to have a say in the final cut of the film. A court awarded her $900, which would have been her pay for work on six reels of film. During the film's production, rumors began to spread that Garon had become engaged to Gene Sarazen, the professional golfer. In March 1924 she issued a complete denial of the rumors. ==References== == External links == * * * Category:Films directed by Christy Cabanne Category:American silent feature films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Melodramas Category:1924 drama films Category:1924 films Category:American drama films ","title":"The Average Woman"},{"id":"56742100","text":"The cutter Alert (1753), bow view, painted 1755 Joseph Marshall (active 1755-1779) was an 18th-century British marine painter.

This election was a part of national Italian general election of 1968 even if, according to the Italian Constitution, every senatorial challenge in each Region is a single and independent race. The election was won by the centrist Christian Democracy, as it happened at national level. Seven Lombard provinces gave a majority or at least a plurality to the winning party, while the agricultural Province of Pavia and Province of Mantua preferred the Italian Communist Party. ==Background== Following the alliance between Christian Democracy and the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), which entered into Aldo Moro's centre-left governments, the PSI created a federation with another member of the coalition, the Italian Democratic Socialist Party, but it paid its toll to the Italian Communist Party, which joined its forces with the newly established Italian Socialist Party of Proletarian Unity, the former Socialist leftist wing. ==Electoral system== The electoral system for the Senate was a strange hybrid which established a form of proportional representation into FPTP-like constituencies. A candidate needed a landslide victory of more than 65% of votes to obtain a direct mandate. All constituencies where this result was not reached entered into an at-large calculation based upon the D'Hondt method to distribute the seats between the parties, and candidates with the best percentages of suffrages inside their party list were elected. ==Results== -

She is the founder and creator of FullyRaw, the Rawfully Organic cooperative, FullyRaw Juice, and author of the book The FullyRaw Diet: 21 Days to Better Health. Her YouTube channel, where she discusses a variety of topics but mostly shares her raw vegan recipes, has more than 90 million views. All of her social media platforms (YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat) have almost 3 million viewers. She has been on the Greatist.com list of \\"100 Most Influential People in Health and Fitness\\" every year since 2015. She is based in Houston, Texas. ==Early life== Carrillo- Bucaram was raised in a multicultural household with a Lebanese mother and an Ecuadorian father. She says she was raised on traditional food and that has affected her health and later her activism. At the age of 16 she was diagnosed with Hyperglycemia, meaning she had a high blood sugar condition, and the early stage of Type 2 diabetes. She claims that her Hyperglycemia caused her to become emaciated weighing in at only 87 pounds while standing 5 feet and 7 inches tall. Carrillo-Bucaram did her undergraduate studies at Vanderbilt University and later graduated from Rice University in 2009 with the summa cum laude distinction and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa for completing at least 90 semester hours in courses that reflect \\"learning for its own sake.\\" She graduated with majors in kinesiology, health science, and vocal performance and briefly studied abroad in Costa Rica focusing on agriculture. ==Health struggle and diet== Carrillo-Bucaram met John Rose, a raw foods coach, at age 18 in a Whole Foods supermarket. He described raw veganism to her and this interaction inspired her to go raw vegan on July 15, 2005. She ate peaches for two weeks straight when she first went raw vegan. She has made health-related claims such as that going raw will change your eye color, and has promoted the discredited practice of Iridology. When interviewed by Yahoo News, she said her eyes changed color because she claims eating a raw vegan diet \\"clears out all the gunk in your colon.\\" ==Raw Vegan Movement and Businesses== While attending university she started her own farmer's market on her campus. It was intended to be an alternative to expensive grocery stores and appeal to college students who may not be able to afford produce and other groceries otherwise. Running the campus farmer's market helped her cultivate a relationship with local farmers and produce distributors and lead her to open her own grocery cooperative called Rawfully Organic in September 2007. ===Rawfully Organic=== At its height, Rawfully Organic served 50,000 people at three different locations in the Houston area and was the largest organic produce cooperative in the United States. At the food co-op, people ordered their produce in advance then picked up their order after all of it has been assembled into boxes. Order pick-ups occurred at the Houston Arboretum and Nature Center on Tuesdays, at the Nottingham Forest Club on Thursdays, and at the Bissonett location on Saturdays. In 2014, a doctor in Houston, Dr. Garth Davis, started prescribing his patients \\"raw fruits and vegetables.\\" Dr. Davis received a grant from the Memorial Hermann Health System and partnered with Carillo-Bucaram. His patients would pick up their prescription not from a pharmacy but from the Rawfully Organic co-op each week and paid very little for the produce by showing their prescription to the co-op. In 2016, CBS named Rawfully Organic as one of the top spots to get produce. After almost 11 years of operation, the Rawfully Organic co-op closed its doors in 2017. After 4 years of being closed, Rawfully Organic reopened temporarily in April 2020 to help get produce to people who didn't feel safe going to grocery stores during the COVID-19 pandemic. Reopening was also an attempt to revitalize the Houston Farmer's Market that had been failing for some time. However, Carrillo-Bucaram doesn't see Rawfully Organic staying open after the pandemic because there's too much competition from major grocers like Whole Foods. ===FullyRaw Juice=== This is a sister company to Rawfully Organic that sells fully raw juices. She founded it in 2013 using a \\"Kickstarter\\" campaign to help cover the cost of the start up. She raised $35,000. She sells cold-pressed fruits and vegetables. ===FullyRaw website=== FullyRaw is a website she founded to coach people on how to start and maintain a raw vegan diet. She provides webinars, programs, and in person health coaching. She has done several \\"challenges\\" for a period of time where she offers meal plans, workouts, and advice through her website if you pay to join the \\"challenge.\\" ===Book=== On January 5, 2016 Carrillo-Bucaram wrote and published a book entitled The Fully Raw Diet: 21 Days to Better Health, with Meal and Exercise Plans, Tips, and 75 Recipes. As the title suggests, the book contains meal plans, workouts, and recipes but it also contains the story of her health journey. The book became a number one seller on Amazon. ===YouTube=== Carrillo-Bucaram has gained much of her recognition from her growing YouTube channels and other social media. She has one million followers on instagram and has gained more than 90 million views across her YouTube channels. ===Speaking engagements=== Carrillo-Bucaram has hosted and gave speeches at the \\"Woodstock Fruit Festival\\" for many years on and off since 2010. She also has given talks at the annual \\"Texas Veggie Fair\\" for several years since 2013. == References == Category:Living people Category:American people of Lebanese descent Category:American women writers Category:American women bloggers Category:American bloggers Category:Writers from Houston Category:American activists Category:Veganism activists Category:Animal rights activists Category:American people of Ecuadorian descent Category:1987 births Category:Pseudoscientific diet advocates Category:Raw foodists Category:Rice University alumni ","title":"Kristina Carrillo-Bucaram"},{"id":"56742575","text":"Mother Joseph is a bronze sculpture depicting Mother Joseph Pariseau by Felix de Weldon, installed in the United States Capitol Visitor Center's Emancipation Hall, in Washington, D.C., as part of the National Statuary Hall Collection.

Confederates were citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they resided, due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the Confederate government. Virginia was admitted into the Confederacy as a commonwealth rather than a state. The Confederacy recognized 13 states, but Kentucky and Missouri were border states represented by governments-in-exile; their pre-war state legislatures never voted to secede, but the Confederacy recognized pro-South provisional governments there as legitimate. States were the primary subdivisions of the Confederate States and possessed a number of powers and rights under the Constitution of the Confederate States, such as regulating intrastate commerce, running elections, creating local governments, and ratifying constitutional amendments. Each state had its own constitution grounded in republican principles, and government consisting of executive, legislative, and judicial branches. All states and their residents were represented in the Confederate States Congress, a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state was represented by two Senators, while Representatives were distributed among the states in proportion to the most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census. Additionally, each state was entitled to select a number of electors to vote in the Electoral College, the body that elected the President of the Confederate States, equal to the total of Representatives and Senators in Congress from that state. Every new state was admitted pursuant to Article I, Section 6 of the Confederacy's Provisional Constitution which required a simple majority vote in the Provisional Congress. Since the establishment of the Confederate States in 1861, the number of states expanded from the original seven to 13. Each new state had been admitted on an equal footing with the existing states. Under Article IV, Section 3, Clause 1 of the permanent Constitution Congress had the authority to admit additional states into the Confederacy, but unlike the United States and Provisional Confederate Constitutions which required a simple majority vote admission of new states to the Confederacy required a two-thirds vote in each House with the Senators from each state voting jointly. The following table is a list of all 13 states and their respective dates of statehood. The first seven became states in February and March 1861 upon agreeing to the Provisional Constitution of the Confederate States, and each joined the permanent Confederation of states between March 12 and April 22, 1861, upon ratifying the Constitution of the Confederate States, its permanent constitution (a separate table is included below showing Provisional Constitution of the Confederate States adoption dates). These seven states are presented in the order in which each ratified the permanent Constitution, thus joining the permanent government. The date of admission listed for Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee, Missouri, and Kentucky was the official date set by an act of the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States. ==List of C.S. states== {class=\\"sortable \\" style=\\"align:left\\" ! colspan=2 State !

Born in El Paso, Texas, she studied in Los Angeles before moving to New York City. She has exhibited in exhibitions internationally since 1959. ==Education and early career== Jaramillo was raised in Los Angeles, California, where she attended the Manual Arts High School before attending the Otis Art Institute (now called Otis College of Art and Design) in 1958. She moved her family to New York City after the 1965 Watts riots.

The authors wanted to design a model which explained each component of the teaching and learning process while at the same time examining the relationship between the media and instruction. The model consists of ten elements and was constructed for teachers who both design and deliver instruction. The model is clearly defined and easily understood. == The Designers of the model == The Gerlach and Ely instructional design model was developed by Vernon S. Gerlach and Donald P. Ely (1930 ‚Äì 2014). Gerlach is an American Educator and writer who authored and co-authored books in the field of Education. Dr. Ely was an American professor and director of ERIC Clearinghouse on information and technology at Syracuse University. Dr. Ely also published and co-authored several journal articles and books and founded the ERIC Clearinghouse on information and technology. As an Educator, he was an advocate for instructional technology. Gerlach and Ely co-authored Teaching and the media, A systematic Approach (1971) where they introduced the Gerlach and Ely Instructional design model. == Overview of the model == The model can be described as a mix of linear and concurrent activities that contains several steps which are seen as simultaneous. In education, the model is suitable for primary, secondary and tertiary levels and can be implemented with limited resources available to teachers. The model is most suitable for instructional planning and designing where objectives and content are predetermined. Both objectives and content are also synchronize and are the starting point of instruction. The model includes strategies for selecting and including multimedia during instruction. It is one of the few models that recognizes content orientation of many teachers. In the field of education, the model ‚Äúhas stood the test of time and has continued to serve the classroom teacher well‚Äù. === Steps in the model === Step One * Specification of Content * Specification of Objectives Step Two * Assessment of Entering Behavior Step Three * Determination of Strategy * Organization of Groups * Allocation of Time * Allocation of Space * Selection of Resources Step Four * Evaluation of Performance Step Five * Analysis of Feedback ==== Step One ==== The first task of the Gerlach and Ely instructional design model is the specification of content and objectives. This is done simultaneously since both content and objectives interact with each other. It is essential that the teacher indicates the reason for teaching the specific content and the medium in which the content will be used to achieve the objectives. The teacher is responsible for selecting the area of content to be taught and determining when it should be taught The content is selected from the curriculum. The teacher also takes into consideration the state/local guidelines, personal experiences, goal or preferences of supervisor. The objectives must be measurable and written as specific skills that learners should display under specific conditions and time. ==== Step Two ==== The second step is the assessment of entering behavior. At this stage, the teacher needs to determine the present skills and prerequisite knowledge of learners. Gerlach and Ely (1980) explained that the teacher must ask the question, ‚ÄúTo what extent has the student learned the terms, concepts and skills which are part of the course?‚Äù The teacher can determine the starting knowledge of each learner by using a variety of methods such as giving a pretes). Gerlach and Ely were advocates of pretesting; they believed that teachers should breakdown content into units and give learners a pretest at the beginning of each unit.  Step Three  In this model there are five tasks which occurs simultaneously: * Determination of strategy: The teacher determines a teaching strategy through the process of deciding how much information should be used and the roles of the teacher and the students in the learning process. The choice of strategy range from the traditional, expository to the inquiry approach. * Organization of groups: The learners may work independently, in pairs or in groups. The group size is dependent on the task to be completed. The organization of groups is also dependent on objectives and materials used for delivering the content. * Allocation of time: Time allocation is dependent on the class period and the organization of group activity. * Allocation of space: This is dependent on the task to be performed and whether or not the space is available during the time of instruction. The teacher can utilize not only the classroom but also the school's lab, gym or even outdoor facilities. * Selection of Resources: The selection of resources is based on the objectives of the lesson. Materials are not considered resources until there is a meaningful context for their use. The teacher must consider whether available resources can be adopted to fulfil learning objectives. The model also suggests that teachers should seek out resources from existing ones rather than developing new resources  Step four  The fourth step in this model is the evaluation of performance. Evaluation of performance is focused on the measurement of students‚Äô performance and the attitude of students towards the content. In other words, the teacher must determine the effectiveness and efficiency of the instruction.  Step Five  The final step in the model is the analysis of feed back. A formative revision is done to complete the process. At this point the teacher will inform the students about their performance. == See also == Instructional Design ADDIE Model Instructional Technology Communication Theory Learning Theory == Notes == References Agamba, J. and Keengwe, J.

Peter is introduced as a media publisher in 2017, and is soon revealed to be the previously unknown son of super villain Cesar Faison (Anders Hove) and his arch nemesis super spy Anna Devane (Finola Hughes). Peter becomes a target as it is revealed that he was Faison's accomplice in the abduction of mobster Jason Morgan (Steve Burton). Instead of killing Jason on Faison's orders, Peter uses Jason to kill Faison. However, Peter's scheming leads to the death of his half-brother Nathan West (Ryan Paevey). As Peter falls for Nathan's widows, Maxie Jones (Kirsten Storms), he plots to kill his mother as revenge for leaving him with Faison. Fortunately, Peter is arrested before he can go through with his plan. Through his relationship with Maxie, Peter finds redemption, and also forgives Anna upon discovering that his longtime friend Valentin Cassadine (James Patrick Stuart) actually turned him over to Faison. Peter‚Äôs introduction garnered very mixed reactions from both critics and viewers alike. While most felt the story undermined Anna's long history and backstory, a few, including ABC Soaps In Depth actually liked the umbrella affect the story had on the canvas. Despite the critiques about Peter being Anna's son, many praised Ramsey for his \\"compelling\\" and \\"nuanced\\" portrayal of the character. TV Insider hailed the revelation of Peter's lineage as one of the \\"Best Moments\\" of the year, while Michael Fairman TV said Peter was the \\"Most Polarizing Character\\" of the season and Soap Opera Digest felt it was too big of a \\"rewrite\\" for fans to believe. What ==Storylines== In 2017, Peter is hired by Jason (Billy Miller) and Sam Morgan (Kelly Monaco) as the COO of their newly acquired media company, Aurora Media and becomes the boss of Nina Cassadine (Michelle Stafford) and Maxie Jones. Aspiring journalist Lulu Falconeri (Emme Rylan) appeals to Peter for a job and Peter advises her to bring him a \\"hard- hitting\\" story before he considers hiring her. With the revelation the mysterious Patient 6 is the real Jason and Peter's boss is actually Jason's previously unknown twin-brother Andrew Cain, Peter wants to capitalize on the drama but Sam shoots down the idea. Peter is quite impressed when Lulu uncovers Mayor Janice Lomax (Shari Belafonte) stole the 2014 election which leads to her resignation, but tells Lulu she needs an impressive follow story before he would put her on staff. Peter convinces Lulu to do a story on Cesar Faison, the man responsible for switching Jason and Drew. Although he is happy with Lulu‚Äôs article about Maxie's husband Nathan ‚Äî Faison's son ‚Äî Peter isn't interested in a follow-up. Peter rejects Anna Devane's suggestion to plant a fake story about Faison's eldest son Henrik as a trap. Peter is nearly shot defending a pregnant Maxie from Faison. He survives and helps Maxie care for Nathan who is caught in the crossfire. Peter confronts a hospitalized Faison and reveals himself to be Henrik. Peter admits he intentionally kept Jason alive to use him against Faison and he is further delighted when Faison dies from cardiac arrest upon hearing Nathan has died. Peter steals the flash drive with Drew's memories to conceal his identity. Peter changes his mind about leaving town having bonded with the widowed Maxie. He is terrified to learn Faison suffered from Huntington's disease and confides in Valentin Cassadine who convinces him to get tested. Peter is relieved both he and Maxie's unborn child have not inherited the disease but Nina accuses him of taking advantage of Maxie's grief. When his doctor Griffin Munro (Matt Cohen) confronts Peter about his identity, Peter convinces him to keep quiet for Maxie's sake. Against Valentin's wishes, Peter orders Lulu to write an article about Henrik, and even contacts her as Henrik. Peter warns Valentin to neutralize Anna and Robert Scorpio (Tristan Rogers) when he learns they have been investigating him. Peter is contacted by a woman claiming to be his mother and agrees to meet her at the Nurses' Ball. After Peter helps Maxie deliver her baby on the side of the road, he goes to meet the mystery woman and finds Anna. Jason stops Peter from killing Anna, and Peter is shocked when Anna stops Jason from killing Peter by announcing she is his mother. Peter rejects Anna as he is arrested. Peter is furious to learn Valentin stole him from his adopted family and delivered him to Faison and guilt trips him into breaking him out of jail. Peter tries to skip town when he is abducted by Nathan's distraught mother and Valentin's soon-to-be aunt-in-law, Liesl Obrecht (Kathleen Gati), who tries to torture him into confessing. After a failed escape attempt in which Obrecht breaks his hand, Peter appeals to Nina to let him go before she ends up in prison along with Obrecht. Obrecht then moves Peter to the stables at Wyndemere Castle when she is nearly caught. She tries to kill Peter in a fire, but he is rescued by Anna's boyfriend, Hamilton Finn (Michael Easton). Finn stalls Peter‚Äôs arrest refusing to release him from the hospital. To avoid prosecution, Peter trades information for his freedom. After his release, Peter coerces Valentin into giving him the money to buy local tabloid, The Invader and hires Lulu as a reporter. Peter continues bonding with Maxie after she helps him through a panic attack and they spend her birthday together. In December 2018, Peter changes his statement allowing Obrecht to be released from prison and spends Christmas with Anna. In 2019, Peter hires Obrecht to write a medical column due to Maxie's insistence after Obrecht visited Peter's female counterpart Nelle Benson (Chloe Lanier) in prison. Peter continues thawing toward Anna and supports her when she suddenly goes blind. Meanwhile, Peter and Maxie discover Obrecht is blackmailing Valentin about Sasha (Sofia Mattsson), whom he claims is Nina's daughter. However, their secret DNA test proves their theory wrong. In April 2019, Peter takes Anna's advice and finally confesses his feelings for Maxie and they soon start dating. In July, Peter is shot by a deranged Dante suffering from PTSD. Fortunately, the bullet only causes minor injuries. Soon, convicted cult leader Shiloh (Coby Ryan McLaughlin) blackmails Peter into breaking him out of prison threatening to reveal that Peter helped Helena Cassadine (Constance Towers) with Drew's 2012 abduction in Afghanistan. When Drew leaves town in search of Doctor Andre Maddox (Anthony Montgomery) determined to get his memory back, knowing Drew could identify him should he recover his memories, Peter makes sure Drew's plane crashes. Peter even tries to kill Andre when he returns looking for Drew. While Peter successfully breaks Shiloh out of prison, his attempt to eliminate him goes awry when Shiloh escapes from his hired henchman, Bryce (Brian Gross). Shiloh tries to blackmail Peter for cash only to end up dead after a confrontation with Sam. When Bryce is arrested for helping Shiloh escape, Peter orders him to frame Sam. ==Development== ===Casting and creation=== In October 2017, TVLine announced that Wes Ramsey, previously recognized for his portrayal of Sam Spencer on Guiding Light, had been cast in the \\"mystery role\\" of Peter August. Besides his first air-date, no further details were made available at press time. Ramsey who had recently become known to General Hospital fans as the boyfriend of Laura Wright ‚Äì who plays Carly Corinthos ‚Äì took to social media about his casting: \\"Port Charles is a dream come true!\\" Ramsey accompanied Wright to set one day and had a friendly encounter with executive producer Frank Valentini. A few months later, Ramsey came in to audition for the role of Peter. In 2009, Ramsey auditioned at One Life to Live where Valentini also served as executive producer. Ramsey felt he and Valentini had \\"unfinished business\\" after their first meeting in 2009. With his most recent stint in daytime being a short lived role at Days of Our Lives, Ramsey turned to daytime once again because he missed the genre. \\"To tell you the truth, I felt better about this time and this role and this show than any other time in my career.\\" Wright helped him prepare for the screen test. Ramsey competed against 8 other actors, and auditioned 3 times for the role. The actors, including Ramsey, auditioned with opposite Finola Hughes who plays Peter's mother, Anna. Hughes concluded that Henrik/Peter's creation was a surefire way to, in the words of ABC Soaps In Depth, \\"blow up\\" the canvas for so many characters. In an interview with Soap Opera Digest, Ramsey explained that Peter was presented to him as a \\"much smaller role and throughout the course of a few weeks, grew into something else.\\" Despite their hesitation, both Hughes and her co-star Tristan Rogers ‚Äî who plays Anna's ex- husband Robert ‚Äî agreed that the story of Peter's conception and birth would fit into the timeline without completely upending the history between their own characters. ===Characterization=== ====Personality==== Ramsey characterized Peter August to be a \\"genuinely good guy\\" as originally presented to the audience. But, Ramsey insisted, \\"He's no pushover!\\" Peter is \\"complicated, confusing and disturbing\\" the actor stated. Ramsey said that Peter \\"obviously believes he's capable of outwitting anyone.\\" Ramsey's favorite thing about Peter is \\"his complexity.\\" Peter \\"thinks he's invincible\\" Ramsey later said. As far as Peter is concerned, \\"there isn't a situation he could find himself in that he can't handle.\\" Underestimating those around him is \\"hubris.\\" Peter has consistently been described as a \\"puppeteer\\" or \\"puppetmaster.\\" Ramsey further described Peter as a \\"master communicator and manipulator.\\" Despite his apparent arrogance, Peter can also show \\"vulnerability,\\" \\"sadness and weakness\\" when he has to. ABC Soaps In Depth has described the character as \\"debonair\\" \\"mysterious\\" and \\"rather cocky.\\" The magazine described Peter as an \\"educated, well-mannered, worldly guy.\\" However, he is a \\"recovering villain.\\" Hope Campbell of Soap Hub described Peter as the \\"mild-mannered infamous traitor.\\" She continued, \\"he seems a little humdrum‚Ä¶ kinda like Nathan.\\" Janet Di Lauro of said Peter looks like a \\"stiff, buttoned-up executive\\" at first glance. While he can be \\"devious\\" like Faison, he's \\"not as deadly.\\" Caralynn Lippo of TV Fanatic described Peter as \\"menacing-yet-conflicted.\\" Donald Thompson said Henrik/Peter is \\"like a chameleon.\\" Anders Hove described Peter as a \\"brilliant, good-looking young man who's been let down ‚Äî and has certain genes from his father that are not worth bragging about.\\" Shabnaj Chowdhury saw Peter \\"as a man haunted by his upbringing and desperate for redemption.\\" ==== Backstory ==== Peter, whose birth name is Henrik Faison, is the oldest son of Cesar Faison. According to Liesl Obrecht, Henrik idolizes his father but Faison doesn't show him any affection because of who his mother is, or isn't. Faison ships Henrik off to boarding school when he is old enough. In Peter's own words, Faison \\"rejected and hated\\" him. All Henrik knows of his mother growing up is that she abandoned him as an infant, and Henrik is delivered to Faison through a third party so not even Faison can determine which of his many lovers had given birth to his son. Henrik fantasizes about his mother coming to rescue him one day but Faison warns that it will never happen. Henrik finds relief that Faison usually ignores him to focus on business. Henrik attends several boarding schools in Europe, including one very prestigious school in Bern, Switzerland under the alias, Henri Francois. As a child, Henrik finds a friend and mentor in Valentin Cassadine, one of Faison's business associates. Valentin even attends one of Henrik's school plays after Faison refuses. After boarding school, Henrik comes to America to attend Harvard University. Henrik seemingly changes his name to Peter August just before his 21st birthday. As Peter, he attends graduate school at the Yale University's School of Management. After graduation, Peter finds work at several companies in Europe, including Modesto Media in Milan, Italy. However, he does not have much time for romantic relationships because he moves around too much. Peter successfully runs a publishing company for a couple of years in Europe before his arrival in Port Charles. In 2018, it is revealed that Anna Devane gives birth to Henrik on June 13, 1976 with the help of midwife Mireille Lambert in a house located at 27 Rue De Louvain in Brussels, Belgium. While training to be a spy at a special school in London, Anna poses as a prostitute, and seduces a drunken Faison to steal information from him. It was easy as Faison had been paying prostitutes to impersonate Anna. Soon after, Anna suddenly leaves school for \\"special training\\" but in actuality, she was pregnant. Anna refuses to even look at her child and begs the midwife place the baby with a loving family. However, Valentin having followed Anna, tracks down Hernik's adoptive family, and threatens them into relinquishing the child whom he then turns over to Faison. Peter craves \\"love and acceptance\\" but that desperation only makes life more difficult. With Faison as a father, \\"all he got was pain, abuse, manipulation and abandonment. He developed scars\\" Ramsey said. In 2019, Ramsey said the \\"trauma of being Faison's son\\" holds Peter back from having \\"a real life ‚Äî real connections and real friendships and a real relationship\\" for most of his life. He grows up trying to \\"outrun\\" Faison's shadow. Before Anna, Peter does not have that \\"female energy to confide in or a mom to go and seek counsel from.\\" === Introduction and identity (2017‚Äì2018) === Peter debut occurs during Sweeps in November 2017. On Peter's arrival, Ramsey described it as \\"very cloak-and-dagger and very manipulative.\\" He also said Peter is \\"tugging on string and using words and intentions to make people dance the way he wants them to.\\" For the first two months, Ramsey was \\"simply in the dark\\" about Peter's backstory. \\"Sometimes ignorance is bliss\\" Ramsey said. In December 2017, Ramsey met with Frank Valentini and script writer Elizabeth Korte to fill in the blanks about Peter. \\"It was a slow reveal but the moment I really needed what I needed, they gave it to me full force and I was able to run with it.\\" In January 2018, Peter is revealed to be the traitorous son of Cesar Faison, born to Faison's arch nemesis, super spy Anna Devane. Ramsey described the plot twist as \\"overwhelming in a wonderful way\\" and he was \\"flattered\\" that the producers trusted him with such a pivotal role. Ramsey, who grew up watching Anna, was very excited about working with the Hughes. \\"I have a great scene partner in Wes\\" Hughes said of Ramsey.ABC Soaps In Depth said \\"Perhaps the most tragic part of Peter‚Äôs tale is that the mother he hates for abandoning him only wants to find him, explain herself and take him into her arms.\\" Ramsey said \\"an incredible and complicated backstory has been gifted to me.\\" Shelly Altman explained that Peter and Anna are on a \\"collision course\\" because Peter resents the mother he never knew for abandoning him. Peter takes center stage as Anna, Robert Scorpio, and Nina Cassadine are all prying into his past for different reasons. At the same time, Peter's confidant Valentin is on edge as he fears Peter's exposure. Meanwhile, mobster Jason Morgan and investigative journalist Lulu are also looking for Henrik. Peter is \\"at odds with some very powerful people, and they're getting close, but he's not fearful in anyway.\\" Wes Ramsey was particularly excited about the potentially explosive reveal. \\"Things are about to get crazy\\" he declared. The revelation that Peter is Henrik \\"feels like a time bomb that's hardwired to branch out and devastate so many lives in so many different ways. When it goes off, it's going to spread like wildfire.\\" Postponing the climax of the story \\"only has created more tension. Now, we're all horses at the gate, ready to run. We want the race to start!\\" The storyline was set to climax during May Sweeps during the Nurses' Ball. By this time, more than half of the characters on canvas was invested in the plot in one way or another. It is not until Peter discovers that Anna has seemingly set a trap for him by \\"posing\\" as his mother that he views her as a real threat. Peter is insulted by the idea that Anna would use something so personal against him. \\"It is something that is he not going to let pass.\\" Peter and Anna's first interactions before the reveal were \\"foreshadowing\\" of their eventual relationship. They \\"have an intellectual standoff, using their wits, minds and language to face off. Neither would back down, and that was powerful‚Ä¶\\" In their standoff, Peter is forced to confront the \\"anger and animosity\\" that he harbors for Anna. === Redemption (2018‚Äì2019) === During his captivity, head writer Shelly Altman likened Peter to Scheherazade in the Middle Eastern literature One Thousand and One Nights. In the summer of 2018, Peter undergoes the painstaking process of redemption which starts with delivering Maxie's baby under \\"dramatic\\" circumstances. Wes Ramsey described it as a \\"right of passage, to deliver a baby on the side of the road.\\" Ramsey admitted that he did his best to support Kirsten Storms during the scenes because \\"as much was on my shoulders, there was even more on hers.\\" While playing out the drama, the actors tried to find moments to insert a \\"light touch of humor\\" while also maintaining the realism. Peter is simultaneously in both \\"the right place at the right time\\" for Maxie, or \\"the wrong place at the wrong time\\" because of what happens next. After he gets himself released from police custody Peter is abducted by Nathan's grief stricken mother, Liesl Obrecht. When Obrecht tricks Nina into helping her, Peter fears the worst. \\"He is quite sure that the endgame wasn't simply kidnapping him.\\" Though Nina does want Peter to pay for his crimes, Nina has a big heart which Peter has to appeal to in order to garner sympathy. While Obrecht claims she only wants a confession, Peter quickly realizes she wants him dead. He must distract her with stories about his life in an effort to save himself. \\"If when his story is finished she intends to kill him, then Peter has to keep this story going for as long as possible!\\" He is even willing to give up the little bit of leverage he still has by telling Nina how Drew Cain can get his memories back. That's Peter's way of proving that he's not a \\"monster\\" and it works, at least for Nina. While Nina keeps Obrecht from going too far, she is too \\"torn\\" by her grief to simply help Peter escape. Despite his best efforts, Peter is terrified that he will die. But even when Obrecht is at her most cruel, Peter isn't easily defeated. According to Ramsey, \\"Peter's pulling on that same spirit and strength that allowed him to beat his father and survive all those years to become the man he is.\\" When Peter convinces a young boy scout named Wyatt (Patrick Gibbons, Jr.) to free him, he uses that as motivation to convince Nina to let him go before someone else does. Obrecht nearly kills Peter, along with herself and Nina when she moves him to avoid being caught and they get caught in a fire. Fortunately he is rescued by Hamilton Finn. During Peter's \\"cruel\\" imprisonment and torture, Ramsey is able to \\"step away\\" from who Peter is on the surface, and explore the character. \\"It was certainly humbling to find the complete other side of the spectrum and show Peter‚Äôs vulnerability when he was facing his own mortality and his own remorse!\\" Ramsey said \\"Peter's certain paid a price for his actions\\" on the road to his redemption. However, Peter still must get out from under the WSB and earn Maxie's forgiveness but the actor insisted that \\"he'll figure something out!\\" When asked if Peter would cause more \\"havoc\\" on the canvas, Frank Valentini only said \\"there is a lot of story there\\" because of Peter's connections to those on and off canvas, including Anna and Maxie. In the aftermath of his ordeal with Obrecht, Ramsey insisted that Peter had paid sufficiently for his actions. \\"It was a bit of moral payback\\" Ramsey said. Peter goes from playing everyone around him to facing his \\"mortality and remorse.\\" The actor said it was \\"humbling\\" experience to play the opposite of what Peter had previously presented himself to be. In addition to making amends to those he's wronged, part of Peter's redemption includes slowly building a relationship with Anna. While they start to thaw toward one another in time for the Christmas, \\"They're not like besties or anything\\" Finola Hughes said in early 2019. \\"They've begun this kind of dance\\" Hughes said of their evolving dynamic. It's like, \\"I won't be so prickly with you if you won't be so prickly with me.\\" She continued, \\"It's a little push and pull.\\" Despite what has happened to him, and what Peter says, ABC Soaps In Depth believes Peter \\"might not be as redeemed as he likes to think.\\" === Relationship with Maxie === In the meantime, Peter develops a friendship with Maxie Jones, his grieving widowed sister-in-law. Co-head writer Shelly Altman described the relationship as \\"mutually important\\" to both Peter and Maxie. While Maxie finds it easy to be around Peter because he isn't a constant reminder of the life she's lost, co-head writer Chris Van Etten explained that it's Peter's \\"guilt\\" over his role in his brother's death that draws Peter to Maxie. Peter feels a \\"responsibility\\" to take care for Maxie. While they are just friends, Peter knows \\"he's playing with fire.\\" Peter's attraction to Maxie is \\"groundbreaking for him,\\" according to Wes Ramsey. It is the first time Peter has ever \\"had someone in his life that he's wanted to protect.\\" While it appeared to be \\"casual on the surface\\" the tragic circumstances that bring them together and the emotions in the aftermath of that tragedy \\"was such a strong bonding experience\\" for them. Caring about Maxie is the last thing Peter expected would happen. Peter feels like protecting Maxie and her unborn child can make amends for the pain he has caused. He will risk anything to protect whatever it is he has found with Maxie. Through his relationship with Maxie, the writers explore how \\"deprived Peter felt throughout his entire life of having a connection in terms of family, a connection in terms of being able to be vulnerable.\\" For Peter, \\"his connection to his nephew James is, in his heart, the only pure family that exists for him.\\" Ramsey viewed Peter's \\"protective streak over Maxie\\" as \\"really honest.\\" Kirsten Storms admits that Maxie gives Peter a pass for his schemes because of her own past and how often she's been forgiven. Storms could see why Maxie would be drawn to Peter, as Nathan's brother, even though they are very different. As he starts courting Maxie in 2019, Peter suddenly gets cold feet. According to Wes Ramsey, Peter \\"doesn't know what to do.\\" Having grown up witnessing how Faison's obsession with Anna consumed his father, Peter is careful to make sure his feelings for Maxie are \\"true and genuine and coming from a healthy place.\\" The best part for Peter is that he knows Maxie is willing to be as \\"impulsive\\" as he is for their first date. \\"She gets excited about his excitement.\\" Though Maxie insist she does not need a \\"grand gesture,\\" Peter wants to make it \\"perfect and special and magical.\\" While they are not young lovers by any stretch of the imagination, \\"there were moments where I felt those butterflies, and some of those feelings that we remember from when we were younger, get to come out these moments with these two characters.\\" Storms was happy with Ramsey as her new scene partner. The actress appreciated that he could meet or at times exceed her expectations of preparedness in scene partner. \\"He cares about his work comes across and not in an arrogant way,\\" Storms said of her co-star. Storms referenced one instance in which Peter reveals his true identity to Maxie. \\"For example, when he tells Maxie that he‚Äôs Henrik in the hospital and she is in a wheelchair, there were four or five other people in that scene who didn‚Äôt have dialogue, so there was chatting and laughing going on. He just completely zoned in to what he was doing.\\" ==Reception== === Casting and portrayal === Michael Fairman described the announcement about Ramsey's hiring as \\"intriguing casting news.\\" TV Fanatic's Caralynn Lippo and Stacy Miller from The Nerdy Girl Express were both fans of Ramsey from his role as Wyatt on the prime time supernatural drama Charmed. Actress Finola Hughes didn't think the storyline would come to fruition even though she'd auditioned with several actors, until Ramsey was hired. Liz Masters from Soapcentral.com thought Wes Ramsey should have been a recast of Nathan West instead. However, by April 2018, Masters began to change her tune about the character. \\"Wes Ramsey is a handsome bugger, so it's getting harder and harder not to be pulled in by Peter's charm.\\" Masters felt Peter was a \\"good guy\\" and felt keeping the character would be good for the canvas. Lippo said \\"I'm really into Wes Ramsey's addition to the cast so far.\\" Lippo further praised Wes Ramsey for \\"successfully selling the idea that Peter truly isn't just a carbon copy of Faison.\\" Miller said thanks to Ramsey's portrayal, \\"there's no black and white answer for Henrik's guilt or innocence, victim or villainy, only shades of gray. The character is constantly evolving, which makes Peter August a.k.a. Henrik Faison a fascinating study of nature vs. nurture.\\" In June 2018, Shabnaj Chowdhury also praised Ramsey for his portrayal of the character and said \\"what makes this revelation ‚Äî that Peter is actual Henrik, Anna‚Äôs long- lost son ‚Äî really compelling is Wes Ramsey‚Äôs nuanced portrayal‚Ä¶ Peter has emerged as a complex character worth noticing.\\" Soapcentral.com's Tamilu said \\"I do like Peter August, though, and I hope Wes Ramsey sticks around.\\" Alina Adams said it was \\"difficult\\" to decipher if Peter is a \\"good guy or a bad guy.\\" === Introduction and redemption === The revelation about Peter's identity garnered both positive and negative reactions from critics. Hope Campbell of Soap Hub was disappointed with the reveal that Peter was the one who betrayed Faison because she felt the traitor should have been an established veteran instead of a new character. ABC Soaps In Depth called the reveal \\"fantastically soapy.\\" Janet Di Lauro described the \\"stunning\\" plot twist of Peter being Anna's son as the \\"shock of all shockers. Stacy Miller said \\"Henrik‚Äôs story is a classic example of a Shakespeare tragedy full of what ifs.\\" In June 2018, TV Insider listed the revelation about Peter as one of the show's \\"8 Best Moments of 2018 So Far.\\" In July 2018, ABC Soaps In Depth featured hailed the plot as the \\"Most Shocking Twist\\" of the year \\"So far.\\" Donald Thompson of Canyon News was \\"absolutely floored\\" by the revelation that Anna is Henrik's mother. He also said \\"seeing Peter exude his dark will be fun to witness.\\" Liz Masters felt the plot twist was \\"convoluted\\" and said \\"The idea that Anna gave birth to her homicidal stalker's baby makes me ill.\\" Caralynn Lippo didn't like the idea of Anna being with Faison, but appreciated the \\"dramatic and major storyline\\" for Anna's portrayer, Finola Hughes. Finola Hughes did not see the plot twist as a \\"rewrite\\" specifically because she never agreed with the notion that Robert was Anna's \\"first,\\" which was a point of contention for many viewers. However, Hughes thought it was \\"insane\\" when she found out about it. Meanwhile, ABC Soaps In Depth pointed out how Anna and Robert's romance started under less than honest circumstances, which includes hiding Robin from Robert. Hope Campbell argued that Peter being Faison and Anna's son was \\"horrid enough\\" but \\"the character COULD have stayed contained.\\" She continued, \\"we do not understand why this character was necessary, but since he's there, why oh why is he EVERYWHERE?\\" Tamilu of Soapcentral.com agreed with Campbell's complaints about the story's overexposure. While she liked the character and the story, it's \\"all Henrik all the time\\" and \\"I'm ready for the truth to come out.\\" On the other hand, Caralynn Lippo liked how the story took centerstage and involved several different sets of characters. ABC Soaps In Depth agreed and appreciated the \\"umbrella\\" aspect of the story. The magazine liked that like that Peter was the \\"catalyst propelling other, more established characters into the spotlight, even as we get to know him a little bit better.\\" Peter successfully orchestrating Faison's demise was \\"quite surprising\\" for Donald Thompson. \\"It was slightly overwhelming to say the least.\\" Meanwhile, Faison's portrayer, Anders Hove was very interested to see what Peter would do next. Caralynn Lippo was very excited about the impending revelation. \\"I'm actually really looking forward to the eventual Peter-is-Henrik reveal and the ramifications that will be seen all over the canvas.\\" She said the \\"fall out\\" would make for \\"amazing soap.\\" While some felt the story did not work, Donald Thompson felt the climax was one of the reasons the show was so interesting during May Sweeps. Thompson was also pleasantly surprised the writers didn't \\"drag out\\" the revelation about Peter's true identity and said the reveal made for an \\"awfully juicy\\" May Sweeps. Of all the aspects of the story, Liz Masters said the most interesting component was Peter's history with Valentin and she also looked forward to Peter and Anna's reunion. \\"Having a son around will do Anna a world of good, especially with Robin and the kids living on the other side of the country.\\" of the reunion, Masters said it happened in \\"true dramatic fashion\\" and despite his failed attempt on Anna's life, \\"I'm really growing to like him.\\" According to Masters, the confrontation scenes exceeded expectations. \\"The pain in Peter's expression as she revealed that Valentin had threatened his adoptive parents and given him to Faison, and the tears in his eyes when Anna announced that she refused to testify against her son, gutted me.\\" Tamilu from Soapcentral.com hoped Peter could be \\"redeemable.\\" She said \\"Don't take [him] so far over the line that we can never love [him] again, because I really want to love [him]‚Ä¶\\" While Michael Fairman felt it provided great material for the actors involved, he felt Peter's abduction played onscreen for entirely too long. ABC Soaps In Depth agreed that while the plot provided great material for the actors, \\"it's also deprived the audience of a bigger payoff\\" due to the isolation from the canvas. Frank Valentini praised Ramsey's performance during the storyline. \\"I think he did a phenomenal job when Peter was kidnapped and tied-up. It‚Äôs not easy to be in scenes where you are tied-up for almost four weeks, and to act, and to stay present in the stage of being a hostage.\\" Liz Masters applauded the writers for \\"misleading\\" the viewers with the \\"cliffhanger\\" of Nina finding Peter, when Obrecht was the real culprit. She also praised Ramsey for his \\"magnificent\\" portrayal \\"because the anguish Peter felt was palpable, right down to his shaking hands and quivering chin.\\" She said the \\"scenes belong on an Emmy reel.\\" Tamilu said while the storyline could be amusing at times, \\"it's time for the story to move along.\\" She continued, \\"I am weary of Peter being chained up.\\" Meanwhile, Liz Masters said the story \\"quickly faded from compelling\\" to \\"torture watching Peter's torture.\\" In December 2018, the storyline was featured on TV Insider's list of the \\"20 Craziest Daytime Soap Moments\\" of the year. Soap Opera Digest hailed the story as the \\"Biggest Rewrite\\" of the year and said it \\"required a greater suspension of disbelief than most.\\" ABC Soaps In Depth ranked Peter's story at #6 on its list of the \\"10 Biggest Stories of 2018. The plot \\"not only brought back Anders Hove to the canvas, it added to the cast soap vet Wes Ramsey as Peter and gave Anna's portrayer some especially juicy material.\\" === Romance === In regards to Maxie falling for Peter only to learn of his treachery, Tamilu of Soapcentral.com said \\"Oh, the drama!\\" While TV Fanatic's Caralynn Lippo felt it was a soon for Maxie to enter into another romance in 2018, the writers are \\"laying great groundwork for a nice, slow-burn Maxie/Peter romance.\\" Lippo said that while she enjoyed Peter's budding friendship with Maxie, she was \\"concerned\\" that it was being rushed. \\"Unfortunately, they've rapidly progressed from acquaintances to shirtless run-ins and sitting on a bed together while they're hotel neighbors.\\" However, Lippo appreciated the \\"Soapy eye candy\\" and said Ramsey is \\"nice to look at.\\" However, \\"It's a nice dynamic\\" she said. While she liked their \\"sweet\\" friendship, Liz Masters felt it was still too soon for a romance between Peter and Maxie. Despite agreeing with the general consensus that it was too soon, ABC Soaps In Depth said \\"we can't help seeing the possibilities\\" because of Wes Ramsey's \\"undeniable\\" chemistry with Kirsten Storms. The magazine praised the \\"natural ease\\" between Ramsey and Storms and said \\"the inherent drama is too good to pass up!\\" Tamilu worried Maxie might not forgive Peter for his betrayal and said it's \\"a damned shame, since I like the connection they have.\\" She admitted that she was open to Maxie and Peter's eventual romance because \\"because I am in incurable romantic, and I love redemption stories.\\" By September 2018, Tamilu was a bit exhausted by the waiting game. She said \\"I wish we had one writer who wanted to actually write a couple together.\\" Tamilu found \\"genuine delight\\" in their budding romance. While she grew to like the pairing, Liz Masters admitted she wasn't ready for Maxie to move on. Masters felt it was \\"easier\\" to accept Maxie moving on because she was the one pursuing Peter. Soapcentral.com listed Peter and Maxie's relationship as one of the best parts of General Hospital in 2018. In January 2019, Tamilu agreed that it was the right time for Maxie to move on with Peter. \\"I really love her and Peter together.\\" Even with the return of Maxie former lover, Spinelli, Tamilu still rooted for Peter and Maxie. In May 2019, Liz Masters said she felt Maxie needed a bit of a push to solidify her relationship with Peter. \\"Maxie is the type of person who has a better appreciation for things that she has to work for, and I don't feel as if Maxie has worked all that hard for Peter.\\" Meanwhile, Tamilu was annoyed with the \\"stall tactics\\" that plagued Maxie and Peter's first date and felt the writers should stop dragging the story out. ABC Soaps In Depth said that while the pairing was obvious, but praised the writers for \\"wisely\\" not rushing Peter and Maxie into a romance. The magazine felt that Peter \\"massive amount of baggage\\" and Maxie's \\"checkered past\\" made the two \\"downright perfect for one another.\\" Majority of viewers were initially against the pairing. A May 2018 fan poll revealed that 81% of ABC Soaps In Depth readers felt it was too soon for Maxie to move on with Peter. However, by 2019 many viewers had come around to the idea of a Maxie/Peter pairing. Majority of Soap Hub readers (57% of 11,000) loved Maxie and Peter's chemistry and were excited about the dramatic potential should they come together. In November 2018, Peter and Maxie made their debut at #8 on ABC Soaps In Depth's \\"Top 10 Couples\\" poll. That same month, the magazine asked readers if they preferred Maxie be paired with Peter or Michael Corinthos (Chad Duell) and Peter won the fan vote with 54%. In January 2019, Maxie and Peter ranked at #4 in the overall couples poll and the third most popular pairing in the series amongst ABC Soaps In Depth readers. ABC Soaps In Depth said \\"Slow and steady seems to be not only the way to win the race, but to convince a reluctant audience\\" that Peter is worthy of Maxie. 75% of their readers felt Maxie and Peter were meant to be. One reader, Michelle Jenkins was all for the pairing and said Maxie \\"makes [Peter] want to be a better person.\\" Blane Puglies liked the idea of Maxie and Peter, but was worried he would take advantage for her feelings for him, similar to Valentin's dynamic with Nina. Linda Morgan Johnson preferred the two as just friends, while Maureen Bartek refused to accept the pairing. Sharon Magnan felt Peter worked better as a villain instead of a reformed good guy. \\"As a good guy, he's bland and boring. Maxie needs much more than that.\\" === Fan reaction === Like critics, the reactions from fans was mixed. Aurora Suarez described the plot a \\"travesty\\" and a \\"slap in the face\\" to those who watched Anna from the beginning. Theresa K. Wicoff said it was \\"terrible attempt to shock the audience.\\" Meanwhile, Rhonda Robertson said \\"I actually think the story works the way they told it\\" felt it would making for \\"interesting\\" story. Linda LeColst also liked the plot. ABC Soaps In Depth ran a poll in which 79% of readers felt Peter had paid enough for his actions after the abduction and torture. Nancy Dash loved the kidnapping said Peter \\"deserves worse if you ask me.\\" Tammy McKinney said \\"What would GH be without a good kidnapping?\\" Meanwhile, Patricia Wade didn't like the story at all. \\"The torturing of Peter is more like the movie Misery and if I wanted to watch violence, I can watch nighttime TV or a movie!\\" Hope Campbell went so far as to blame Peter's origin story, couple with other stories when the series fell to last place in the ratings in May 2018. She continued, \\"Despite fan backlash, despite falling ratings, there‚Äôs Peter.\\" ABC Soaps In Depth also took note of the ratings decline during the story's climax and how many fans voiced their displeasure on social media about Peter monopolizing the canvas. \\"I'm not going to be shy about it. My Twitter feed is not happy,\\" Hughes said during an interview with the publication. The magazine noted that the show did acknowledge the viewer criticism by having Robert talk Anna out blaming herself for Peter's actions in story. Soap Opera Digest said \\"By underestimating its fans' tolerance for tampering with Anna's canon, GH delivered a tale that got them talking for all the wrong reasons.\\" Michael Fairman TV called Peter the \\"Most Polarizing Character\\" of the year. \\"We have never seen such different views from the audience for one character. Many loathe the character of Peter August and want him off the canvas, others like the portrayal by Ramsey, and throughout 2018 as the character had plenty of screen-time. Fans were one way, or the other, on this one.\\" Despite a rough first year, in May 2019, Ramsey made his debut on ABC Soaps In Depths \\"Top 5 Actors\\" poll when he was voted in by readers, landing at number five. ==References* Category:Fictional adoptees Category:Fictional business executives Category:Fictional businesspeople Category:Television characters introduced in 2017 Category:Fictional newspaper publishers (people) Category:Fictional writers Category:General Hospital characters Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Peter August"},{"id":"56743461","text":"Sharon Calahan is an American cinematographer who was director of photography on the Pixar films A Bug's Life (1998), Toy Story 2 (1999), and Finding Nemo (2003), and was lighting director for Ratatouille (2007), Cars 2 (2011), and The Good Dinosaur (2015). She took part in the early rise of computer animated feature filmmaking and the acceptance of that medium as cinematography. Calahan is the first member of the American Society of Cinematographers who was invited to join on the basis of a career entirely in animated film. She was nominated, with Bill Reeves, Eben Ostby, and Rick Sayre, for a 2000 BAFTA Award for Best Achievement in Special Visual Effects for A Bug's Life. ==Early life and education== Calahan is a graduate of Othello High School, in Othello, Washington, and of the art program at Spokane Falls Community College (SFCC). Her studies did not include filmmaking, computer animation or computer science, but rather illustration, graphic design, and still photography. She \\"stumbled into computer animation by accident\\", eventually leading to her career in feature film cinematography. ==Lighting and cinematography== Calahan worked in Spokane as an art director at KXLY-TV, KREM (TV), and at documentary film company Pinnacle Productions. Calahan was part of the early years of the computer-generated imagery (CGI) industry's expansion into television and feature films, as lighting director making commercials and TV programs for Pacific Data Images (later PDI/DreamWorks), until she joined Pixar in 1994, first as a lighting supervisor on Toy Story (1995). The first time Pixar used the title Director of Photography (DP) on a film was on Calahan's next project, A Bug's Life, representing a recognition that the processes and thinking behind computer generated film production had more in common with live action film than with cel animation. At Pixar it became an established goal to make films that looked like live action, not cartoons. More than a dozen years later, computer animated films at other studios, such as How to Train Your Dragon (DreamWorks, 2010) and Frozen (Disney, 2013) still did not credit a director of photography. Calahan said that on any kind of production, whether entirely made of computer-generated imagery, or a typical modern feature that is usually a hybrid of live action shots with large amounts of added CGI, or a pre-computer era movies shot entirely on film, the director of photography \\"sets the visual tone\\" and will \\"create and realize an artistic vision for the composition, lighting and look of the movie as a whole,\\" meaning that there is little real difference between a traditional director of photography credit and the new labels that were tested during CGI's infancy, virtual cinematographer, director of imaging, or computer graphics director of photography. In a Pixar production, a team of about 30 to 65 lighting artists is overseen by the DP, whose lighting director guides master lighters, who both pre-light each scene and oversee shot lighters who light each shot individually. This takes place in constant collaboration with the layout department, and with teams doing concept art, storyboarding, and previsualization. During pre-production, while sets and characters are being designed by the art department and the technical teams are designing workflows, lighting has not yet begun, but Calahan will paint several hundred lighting concept illustrations, based on the other teams' work but also influencing them as her paintings evolve alongside their design work. During this iterative and mutually collaborative process, Calahan will begin to settle on lighting for each scene and will ask other teams for changes, like recomposing shots. Calahan's work as both visual designer and lighting director of The Good Dinosaur was based in her experience as a native of the Pacific Northwest and from her time spent painting landscapes around the area of Jackson, Wyoming, which became Calahan's model for the film's setting. Calahan had often vacationed in the mountains to do landscape painting. During location scouting in the Jackson area, as well as in Yellowstone National Park, including a white water rafting trip, digital photos were collected, and added to Calahan's own library of photos of the region. By the time director Peter Sohn and director of photography-camera Mahyar Abousaeedi had sets and rough character animation to work with, they could establish factors such as blocking, camera lens focal lengths, and depth of field. This allowed Calahan and her team of close to 40 lighters to do a first lighting pass, setting the initial tone for the rest of the production, and giving the film its unique look. For The Good Dinosaur, this meant open and natural landscapes with a rugged, pioneering feel, while for Ratataoullie the lighting was soft and romantic, and Cars 2, a \\"guy's film\\", was all about shiny metal. In 2007, Calahan was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). She became a member of the American Society of Cinematographers in 2014, as the first member to be elected to that professional group who had worked only in animation, without also having done live action film. ==Filmography== *Toy Story (1995) Lighting Supervisor *A Bug's Life (1998) Director of Photography * Toy Story 2 (1999) Director of Photography * Finding Nemo (2003) Director of Photography * Ratatouille (2007) Director of Photography, lighting * Cars 2 (2011) Director of Photography, Lighting *John Carter (2012) Color Consultant * The Good Dinosaur (2015) Director of Photography, Lighting * Coco (2017) Additional Lighting Design * Onward (2020) Director of Photography, Lighting ==Awards== *Nominee: British Academy Television Awards 2000 for Best Achievement in Special Visual Effects, with Bill Reeves, Eben Ostby, and Rick Sayre, for A Bug's Life (1998). *Nominee: 10th Visual Effects Society Awards 2011 for Outstanding Virtual Cinematography in an Animated Feature Motion Picture, with Mahyar Abousaeedi, Jeremy Lasky and Jonathan Pytko for Cars 2 (2011) *Nominee: 43rd Annie Awards 2016, Outstanding Achievement, Production Design in an Animated Feature Production, with Harley Jessup, Bryn Imagire, Noah Klocek, and Huy Nguyen for The Good Dinosaur (2015) ==Works== * * ==Patents== * with Shah Apurva.

MBE is a growing topic in neuroethics, a field developing the ethics of neuroscience as well as the neuroscience of ethics. After Thomas Douglas introduced the concept in 2008, its merits have been widely debated in academic bioethics literature.Paulo, N. & Bublitz, J.C. (2017). How (not) to argue for moral enhancement: reflections on a decade of debate. Topoi, 1-15. doi:10.1007/s11245-017-9492-6 Since then, Ingmar Persson and Julian Savulescu have been the most vocal MBE supporters.Persson, I., & Savulescu, J. (2012a). Unfit for the future: The need for moral enhancement. New York: Oxford University Press. Much of the debate over MBE has focused on their 2012 book in support of it, Unfit for the Future? The Need for Moral Enhancement. ==Different kinds of moral enhancement== Moral enhancement in general is sometimes distinguished from MBE specifically, such that ME includes any means of moral improvement while MBE only involves biomedical interventions. Some also distinguish invasive from non-invasive, intended from resultant, treatment-focused from enhancement-focused, capability-improving from behavior-improving, and passive from active ME interventions. Vojin Rakiƒá has distinguished voluntary from compulsory MBE, claiming that the former is justifiable even if the latter is not. ==Arguments in favour== Douglas originally suggested MBE as a counter-example to what he calls the \\"bioconservative thesis,\\" which claims that human enhancement is immoral even if it is feasible. He argues that enhancements to improve someone‚Äôs moral motivations would at least be morally permissible. For example, he cites enhancements to reduce \\"counter-moral\\" racist and aggressive emotional reactions as morally permissible because they remove impediments to morality. In 2009, Mark Alan Walker proposed a \\"Genetic Virtue Project\\" (GVP) to genetically enhance moral traits. Given that personality traits are heritable, and some traits are moral while others are immoral, he suggests increasing moral traits while reducing immoral ones through genetic engineering. === Companions in innocence === Walker argues for the GVP based on what he calls a ‚Äò‚Äòcompanions in innocence‚Äô‚Äô strategy, which says that ‚Äúany objection raised against the GVP has an analogue in socialization and educational efforts. Since such objections are not understood as decisive against nurturing attempts, they should not be considered decisive against the GVP.‚Äù In other words, any objection to MBE which also applies to traditional moral education has reduced itself to absurdity, because few would argue that teaching someone to be moral is inherently objectionable. Several other MBE proponents have cited moral education as an example of socially accepted non-biomedical moral enhancement. For example, Douglas calls it ‚Äúintuitively clear‚Äù that any given person has a reason to undergo moral self-enhancement by reducing counter- moral emotions through self-reflection. Douglas says that at least some of the intuitive reasons that anyone should become morally better through self- reflection, like increasing concern for others or good consequences, apply to voluntary MBE. === Unfit for the Future === Based on the fact that human technological progress has advanced faster than human moral psychology can adapt through evolution, Persson and Savulescu point out that humans' capability to cause large-scale destruction has increased exponentially. However, given that humans tend to care only about their immediate acquaintances and circumstances instead of thinking on a larger scale, they are vulnerable to tragedies of the commons like climate change and to technologies like nuclear weapons which pose an existential threat to humanity. Given that moral education and liberal democracy are insufficient, MBE is needed at least as a supplementary method to solve these problems. Persson and Savulescu's argument relies on the notion that it is much easier to cause great harm than it is to cause goodness to the an equal extent. Because of the human population size there will inevitably be a fraction of humanity which is immoral enough to desire to inflict this great harm. Persson and Savulescu conclude that the intervention of extensive human moral enhancement is a necessary component to address this threat. ==Criticism== Central issues debated in literature about MBE include whether there is an urgent need for it, if a sufficient consensus on the definition of morality is achievable, technically feasible and ethically permissible interventions to carry out MBE, the ability to ensure no violation of consent in those interventions, and the ability to ensure no harmful social side-effects that they produce. === The Freedom to Fall === John Harris criticised moral enhancement on the grounds of 'The Freedom to Fall'. His principal argument is that moral enhancement is wrong because it restricts one's freedom to do wrong, making it impossible to act immorally, thus undermining their autonomy. Harris referred to Book III of Milton's Paradise Lost, in which Milton reported God saying, 'Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall.' Harris believed that one should hang on to their freedom to fall. Without it, one is unable to discern right from wrong, taking away both freedom and virtue. Harris asserted that there is no virtue involved in performing activities that one is instructed to. There are two further criticisms of moral enhancement. First, the distinction between right and wrong is highly context-dependent. For example, in the case of self-defense, harming another person can potentially be morally justifiable, as it might be the best compromise of welfare. Harris suggested that it is unclear whether MBE would be nuanced enough to take such situations into account. Second, he pointed out that there is an element of value judgement when one makes a choice between 'right' and 'wrong', and he said that people are entitled to willingly make the wrong choices. This would not be possible with MBE, which compromises this 'freedom to fall.' Harris advocates science, innovation and knowledge ‚Äî particularly in the form of education ‚Äî as possible solutions to the possibility of mass destruction. Again, he refers to Milton, in particular the power of freedom and sense of justice installed within subjective selves. Most importantly, the roles of freedom and autonomy entails that one cannot have the sufficiency to stand without the freedom to fall. ==== Replies ==== Harris's \\"Freedom to Fall\\" has been widely criticized by MBE proponents, who have argued that MBE is benign to freedom and can sometimes increase freedom. Freely chosen moral enhancement is no threat to freedom, as described by Vojin Rakiƒá. By reducing biases that impair moral judgement, Thomas Douglas argues, MBE can remove constraints on the ability to be moral. This does not take away anyone's freedom to be immoral. Instead, it simply grants them more freedom to be moral. Similarly, Persson and Savulescu point out that increasing someone's motivation to act rightly for the right reasons makes them no less free than \\"the garden-variety virtuous person\\" who already has that motivation. Several MBE proponents have pointed out that Harris's \\"Freedom to Fall\\" assumes the controversial view that if someone's actions are fully determined by previous causes, then that person cannot act freely. If anyone can be free to act one way when they will certainly act another way, then MBE can cause moral improvement without taking away any valuable freedom. Most philosophers believe that free will is compatible with determinism in this way. If they are right, then MBE can improve moral behavior without affecting anyone's freedom. ===Sufficiency of non-biomedical methods=== Terri Murray disputes the claim by Persson and Savulescu that political will and moral education are insufficient to ensure that people will behave responsibly, claiming that Persson and Savulescu unjustly reify moral dispositions in biology. Murray argues that political and social pressure are sufficient to improve behavior, explaining that although certain Islamic countries state that women should be forced to wear the burka and stay indoors because men cannot control their sexual urges, this is shown to be false by men in Western countries, both Muslim or otherwise, exercising their ability to control their sexual urges. She explained that this is due to the deterrent effect of both laws and social pressure: ===Ethical basis of moral enhancement=== Since the nature of morality has historically caused wide disagreements, several authors have questioned whether it is possible to come up with a sufficiently widely accepted ethical basis for MBE, especially with respect to what qualities should be enhanced. Joao Fabiano argues that attempting to produce a full account of morality in order to enable moral enhancement would be \\"both impractical and arguably risky\\". Fabiano also suggests that \\"we seem to be far away from such an account\\" and notes that 'the inability for prior large- cooperation\\" plays a role in this. Although there are a wide variety of disagreeing ethical systems, David DeGrazia argues, there are ‚Äúpoints of overlapping consensus among competing, reasonable moral perspectives.‚Äù Traditional moral education generally teaches children to stay within that consensus. DeGrazia‚Äôs idea of this overlapping consensus includes disapproval of antisocial personality disorder, sadism, some kinds of moral cynicism, defective empathy, out-group prejudice, inability to face unpleasant realities, weak will, impulsivity, lack of nuance in moral understanding, and inability to compromise. Biomedically reducing these traits would, per DeGrazia‚Äôs reasoning, count as moral enhancement from these ‚Äúreasonable moral perspectives.‚Äù ===Other issues=== MBE proponents have been accused of being too speculative, overstating the capabilities of future interventions and describing unrealistic scenarios like enhancing \\"all of humanity.\\" One literature review assesses the evidence on seven interventions cited by MBE proponents, saying that none works well enough to be practically feasible. Furthermore, there is some doubt that any drugs for moral enhancement will soon be introduced to the market. Nick Bostrom highlighted that the way medical research is conducted and drugs approved impedes the development of enhancement drugs. A drug must demonstrably treat a specific disease to be approved, Bostrom said, but the traits or behaviors targeted for MBE arguably cannot be viewed as diseases. Bostrom concludes that any drug that has an enhancing effect \\"in healthy subjects is a serendipitous unintended benefit\\". He suggests that the current disease-focused medical model needs to be changed, otherwise enhancement drugs could not be researched well and introduced to the market. Along with this feasibility objection, he notes that public funding for enhancement drugs research projects is currently very limited. Other authors have suggested that unless MBE is based on an individual's choice, it cannot truly be called \\"moral\\" enhancement because personal choice is the basis of ethics. Murray argues that the idea that biological enhancement can make us morally good \\"undermines our understanding of moral goodness.\\" She argues that MBE allows for \\"paternalistic interventions\\" from medical experts to \\"redirect the individual's behaviour to conform to their or society's 'best interests.\\" Ram-Tiktin suggests that if MBE is more effective for enhancing people that are already moral, then it could further the gap between moral and immoral people, exacerbating social inequality. Also, if MBE makes some people morally better, it could unfairly raise the moral standards for everyone else. ==See also== * Key issues in neuroethics * Human enhancement * Cognitive enhancement * Transhumanism == References == Category:Bioethics Category:Ethics of science and technology Category:Neuroscience Category:Transhumanism ","title":"Moral enhancement"},{"id":"56743475","text":"Joseph D.

She has been described as epitomising \\"the Canadian New Woman\\". Ford was active as a critic, writer, and lecturer, and was known in academic circles as an authority on Renaissance art and artists. Ford belonged to a number of societies and organizations and founded the Society of Mural Decorators in 1894. Ford's work is currently owned by the National Gallery of Canada, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the Art Gallery of Hamilton. == Early life == Ford was born in Brockville, Ontario, Canada in 1859. Her father was a barrister, David B. Ogden Ford. After being orphaned at the age of ten, Ford was educated at a private Anglican school for girls, the Bishop Strachan School, from 1870 to 1878. == Education and travels == Ford studied at the Central Ontario School of Art in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the St John's Wood Art School, and the Royal Academy in London, England. In France, she studied at the Acad√©mie Colarossi in Paris and with Luc-Olivier Merson and Joseph Blanc. Ford also completed a residence in Italy as part of her training, before focusing on her work as a muralist, painter and jewellery maker. Ford spent much of her life traveling, visiting countries such as Italy, Spain and England, and living intermittently in Canada and England. During her time spent in England, Ford shared a cottage with her fellow artists Edith Hayes and Sydney Strickland Tully in Newlyn and Bovingdon Green, Great Marlow, Buckinghamshire. Although she frequented Newlyn and many other parts of England, Ford preferred passing her time in St. Ives. Ford began to express new ideas and attitudes towards art after her many travels throughout Europe, thus prompting critics to brand her as \\"dangerous.\\" Ford worked full- time as a writer, lecturer and artist. She was unmarried, professionally focused and financially independent, and has been described as epitomizing \\"the Canadian New Woman\\". Such a position had both benefits and drawbacks. After winning the 1896 poster competition for the Toronto Horse Show, Ford was attacked by an anonymous critic in Saturday Night magazine, who derided both the poster's design of a woman on a horse and the very idea of the \\"New Woman\\". With her international experience, Ford was a supporter of the idea that Canadian artists should be free to find inspiration wherever they wished. In J. Russell Harper's Painting in Canada: A History, Ford stated that she did not believe that the depiction of Canadian scenes was essential for the participation in the Canadian school of art. == Career as an artist == === Painter === Ford‚Äôs work is currently owned by the National Gallery of Canada, the Art Gallery of Ontario and the Art Gallery of Hamilton. In painting, Ford worked primarily in oil paint, watercolour, and pastel. She displayed her work at numerous locations including the Royal Canadian Academy and the Paris Salon. During the Royal Canadian Academy Exhibition of 1895, Ford displayed four of her own pieces, including Girl in White, Annunciation, a decorative oil panel and a self-portrait. In 1896, Ford won a competition for the design of a horse show poster, beating out several notable Montreal artists. The work, printed in red, yellow, blue, and black, was later shown in an art exhibition in Montreal, where it reportedly was criticised for its break from formalist traditions. However, many of these criticisms acknowledged how Ford intentionally disregarded these conventions about colour and perspective, and that it was not due to a lack of skill or formal training. The poster was also mailed out to members of the artistic community for their personal collections. While living abroad, Ford also made sketches of the various locations she saw on her travels. She sent these sketches back to Canada, and one was included in an issue of Canadian Magazine in 1896. === Muralist === Ford's work in house decoration included furniture, screens, and murals, but few examples of this work remain. Ford was interested in murals as early as 1895, when she spoke about the subject during a lecture in Toronto. Ford was one of the few female Canadian artists at the time to receive commercial commissions to create murals. She was commissioned to create murals in the private homes of wealthy patrons such as Charles Porteous, James Mavor and in public institutions such as Saint John's Convalescent Hospital in Toronto, where she was commissioned to create her mural \\"Mother and Child.\\" She was a member of the Canadian Mural Decorator's Society, and in 1898 collaborated on an unsuccessful project to decorate Toronto's Union Station with a mural of Canadian railway builders at work. === Jeweller === Between 1908 and 1912, Ford began to work as a jewellery designer and metal smith. Ford likely received instruction on jewellery making from the Arts and Crafts Movement during her time spent in England. Ford began working with silver, but eventually progressed towards incorporating gold within her pieces. Just like many jewellery makers associated with the Arts and Crafts Movement, Ford integrated semi-precious stones, such as cabochons, turquoise, mother of pearl, baroque pearls, and river pearls. Her work was featured in a 2001 exhibition at the Art Gallery of Hamilton. Some of her jewellery was included in the exhibition Artists, Architects & Artisans: Canadian Art 1890-1918 at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, Ontario in 2013. == Social and academic presence == In the late 1890s, Ford delivered several lectures based on her studies in Italy. These lectures were well-attended, necessitating on one occasion the relocation to a larger room in order to seat all those attending. Ford‚Äôs lectures were based on her studies of early Renaissance art and artists, a subject on which she was considered an authority. Ford delivered her first lecture on Giotto and his followers at the Ontario Society of Artists on March 19, 1895. During this lecture, Ford was described as a \\"competent lecturer\\" who engaged the audience with interesting discussions. Ford referred to other academics in her lectures, including art historian John Ruskin, but also discussed her own research. Ford also discussed the state of Canadian art in publications, such as J. Russell Harper‚Äôs Painting in Canada: A History. Within this publication, Ford stated that she did not believe the depiction of Canadian scenes was essential for the creation of or participation in the Canadian school of art. Together with George Agnew Reid and Carl Ahrens, Ford founded Tarot magazine in 1896 and acted as an editor for this magazine dedicated to the Arts and Crafts Movement. == Affiliations == Ford belonged to many societies and academies, including the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts, the Palette Club, the Ontario Society of Artists, the Women‚Äôs International Art Club. Ford was a founder of the Society of Mural Decorators in 1894. == Death and legacy == Ford died in Great Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England on October 10, 1938. Many of her works currently reside within the National Gallery of Canada, The Art Gallery of Ontario, and the Art Gallery of Hamilton. == Works == File:Boy Lying in Grass, by Harriet Mary Ford (1859- 31 October, 1938), 1890.jpgHarriet Mary Ford, Boy Lying in Grass (1890) File:Harriet Ford, Piazzetta (1913). jpg.jpgHarriet Mary Ford, Piazzetta (1913) File:Harriet Mary Ford, Gondolas (1913).jpgHarriet Mary Ford, Gondolas (1913) File:Harriet Mary Ford, The Market Square, Segovia, No. 1 (1913).jpgHarriet Mary Ford, Market Square, Segovia No.1 (1913) File:Harriet Ford, The Market Square, Segovia, No.2 (1913).jpgHarriet Mary Ford, Market Square, Segovia, No.2 (1913) ==References== Category:1859 births Category:1938 deaths Category:20th-century Canadian women artists Category:Acad√©mie Colarossi alumni Category:Alumni of St John's Wood Art School Category:Alumni of the Royal Academy Schools Category:Artists from Ontario Category:Canadian jewellers Category:OCAD University alumni ","title":"Harriet Mary Ford"},{"id":"56743704","text":"Scott, New South Wales is a remote rural locality and civil parish of Evelyn County in far northwest New South Wales.

Due to this increased vulnerability, there are notable differences in the mental and physical health risks tied to the social interactions of LGBT youth compared to the social interactions of heterosexual youth. Youth of the LGBT community experience greater encounters with not only health risks, but also violence, due to their sexual orientation, self-identification, and lack of support from institutions in society. == Health studies == LGBT youth face a variety of stressors that affect their mental health. Due to society‚Äôs tendency to discriminate against non-heterosexual sexual orientations and identities, members of the LGBT community are 3 times more likely to face mental health disorders. For instance, the constant fear of not being accepted after coming out to one‚Äôs community can lead to an anxiety disorder, depression, PTSD, suicidal thoughts, or substance abuse. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) LGBT teens, in particular, ‚Äúare 6 times more likely to experience symptoms of depression‚Äù than their heterosexual peers as they are just beginning to navigate how to come out to friends, family, and other associates, while still developing into an adult. Because of the crucial development stages youth experience before adolescence, it is more likely for mental disorder to be expressed if a stressor is presented. It was reported in 2012 that within the year, 10% of youth in America demonstrated a mood disorder, 25% presentes an anxiety disorder, and 8.3% presented a substance use disorder. Also, the third leading cause of death for the 10-14 age group is suicide and the second leading cause for those 15-24. Out of these statistics, youth of the LGBT community are three times more likely to experience and report suicidality. Some studies that have been conducted are not completely inclusive of the entire LGBT community because of its rapid growth and expansion. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducted a 2015 Youth Risk and Behavior Survey (YRBS) ,that surveyed approximately 1,285,000 LGB youth out of 16,067,000 students total in grades 9-12 nationwide and was able to provide evidence of greater physical and mental vulnerabilities among the youth of the LGBT community. The survey found that 10% of LGB students were threatened with a weapon on school property, 34% were bullied at school, and 18% experienced physical dating violence. Another 18% of LGB students had been forced to have sexual intercourse at some point. These results were successful in pointing out these vulnerabilities of LGB students, however, about 514,000 students included in the survey were not sure of their ‚Äúsexual identity.‚Äù Another survey conducted by the Human Rights Campaign titled, ‚ÄúGrowing Up LGBT in America,‚Äù acknowledges the vulnerabilities faced by about 10,000 LGBT youth from the age of 13 to 17. This survey found that 4 out of 10 youth felt that their neighborhoods weren‚Äôt accepting of the LGBT community. On top of this 73% of youth surveyed admitted to being more honest about their identity online and 26% identified their largest ‚Äúproblems‚Äù as being related to being out and accepted at home and/or school. The contrast this survey makes to 22% of non LGBT youth who identified their largest ‚Äúproblems‚Äù as relating to academics displays the different mindsets that are present in the two groups, thus representing the different mental effects LGBT youth experience. == Media == Online platforms have become a way to communicate common, and uncommon, standpoints globally. Hashtags and campaigns are present methods of spreading the word about public issues and topics. As the LGBT community uses online platforms to interact with society and run campaigns that advocate for the community, it embraces vulnerability in order to overcome it. National Coming Out Day takes place on October 11 and is a day for LGBT individuals to willingly disclose their sexual orientation or identity. This can take place in many ways that include, but are not limited, to social media announcements and coming out to close family members. Because of current technology platforms that allow for social networking, much of National Coming Out Day can be observed on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Youtube. The Human Rights Campaign has conducted a survey tracking the impact of National Coming Out Day nationwide. 91% of LGBT youth who participated in the survey came out to close friends and reported more overall happiness as they continued to live in their communities and interact with friends, family, and classmates. A similar initiative taken online in the LGBT community is International Transgender Day of Visibility. This day takes place on March 31 and recognizes transgender individuals in an effort to empower those who identify as transgender in the LGBT community. Rachel Crandell founded this day in 2009 and it has since fought against ‚Äúcissexism‚Äù and ‚Äútransphobia.‚Äù [3] Initiatives like National Coming Out Day and the International Transgender Day of Visibility are public reminders of the potential social media holds in educating the masses and raising awareness of the LGBT community. == Support organizations == * Audre Lorde Project * The Trevor Project * It Gets Better Project *Keith Haring Foundation == See also == * LGBTQ psychology * Suicide among LGBT youth == References == Category:LGBT youth Category:Sexual orientation and psychology ","title":"LGBT youth vulnerability"},{"id":"56743730","text":"Gennings Park (sometimes spelt Jennings, and referred to as Gennings House or Gennings Court), located on Lughorse Lane near Hunton, Kent, is a Grade II listed house which was built between 1727 and 1745.

Founded in 1961, the organisation originally focused on both flavours and fragrances, but has focused solely on flavours since 2006. Its members include 12 national (covering approximately 300 SME's) and 10 direct member companies. ==Purpose== EFFA helps to promote and coordinate Europe's flavour industry, which accounts for approximately one-third of the global market and includes more than 300 businesses employing 10,000 skilled workers. In addition, EFFA helps to coordinate regulatory positions within the industry and information about flavourings for the general public. EFFA welcomed the European Commission (EC) Regulation on Flavourings and has published a Guidance Document on the EC Regulation on Flavourings that is available at its public website: http://effa.eu/library/guidance-documents ==History== The association was founded in 1961. It was originally called the \\"Bureau de Liaison des Syndicats Europ√©ens des Produits Aromatiques\\". Thirty years later, this name was officially changed to the European Flavour and Fragrance Association (EFFA). EFFA is based in Brussels, Belgium. In 2009, changes in how the flavour and fragrance industries were regulated led to EFFA to divide into two organisations. After that date, EFFA focused solely on the flavour industry, while the International Fragrance Organisation - Europe (IFRA) assumed responsibility for the fragrance industry in Europe.

Massimine was the recipient of the National Performing Arts Association's 2019 Humanitarian of the Year Award. He co-founded the Immigrant Arts Coalition, served as a special advisor to the New York City and New York State administrations, was an executive trustee and a past development chair of the Alliance of Resident Theatres/New York, and the former chief executive officer of the National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene, the longest consecutively producing performing arts institution in the United States, and the world's oldest-operating Yiddish Theatre. He is current managing director of Pioneer Theatre Company and a senior administrator at the University of Utah. ==Biography== In 2013, at age 27, Massimine made news as the youngest theater executive to oversee the activities of a professional multi-million dollar performing arts institution, when appointed producing director and chief executive officer of the National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene. Previous to his appointment, Massimine earned a Tony Award nomination for his work as a producer on American Idiot (musical) produced concerts for major label artists, and developed high-impact promotional campaigns in recorded music, retail, and video gaming. Massimine was the executive producer of the 2015 KulturfestNYC, the first International Jewish Performing Arts Festival, which included thousands of entertainers from over 30 countries, incorporating dance, cabaret, theater, film, education and music programming. Later that year, following the sudden passing of Folksbiene friend, collaborator, and lifetime achievement award recipient Theodore Bikel, Massimine honored the memory of the beloved icon of film and stage, by conceiving and producing the official multi-media tribute concert. In 2016, Massimine produced Mandy Patinkin: In Concert at Jazz at Lincoln Center. Massimine earned his second Tony Award nomination with the Broadway production of Indecent (play). In the summer of 2017, Massimine conceived New York's first Immigration Arts Summit to create an ongoing dialogue among multi- cultural artists and arts organizations, with actor, author, and comedian John Leguizamo as keynote speaker and journalist Ann Curry as distinguished moderator. In November 2017, Massimine and artistic director Zalmen Mlotek assembled an Artistic Council, composed of renowned theater artists and producers, to collaborate and advise on the National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene programming initiatives. Members of the Artistic Council include producer Margot Astrachan; producer and general manager Emanuel Azenberg; composer, lyricist, and playwright Jason Robert Brown; playwright and lyricist Joe DiPietro; actress Tovah Feldshuh; playwright and lyricist Sheldon Harnick; playwright Jon Marans; actor Mandy Patinkin; producer and actor Jana Robbins; producer Daryl Roth; producer and general manager Lawrence S.

In December 2017, Massimine announced that he and the National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene would produce the United States Premiere of Fiddler on the Roof in Yiddish, Fidler Afn Dakh, starting summer of 2018, at the Museum of Jewish Heritage. In a March 2018 issue of Forbes Magazine it was announced that Academy Award and Tony Award winner Joel Grey would direct the production. In a subsequent radio interview with 90.7FM WFUV Massimine commented on Grey's involvement. In April 2018, as part of Immigrant Heritage Week, Massimine and Immigrant Arts Coalition President, journalist and social justice activist Marlena Fitzpatrick Garcia partnered with New York City Mayor's office, The New York Times Company, and Dramatists Guild of America to host a series of panel discussions on immigrant rights and diversity in the arts. Later that month, Massimine, Zalmen Mlotek and the National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene were nominated for a 2018 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Musical Revival for the Off Broadway production of Amerike- The Golden Land. On February 25, 2019, Massimine announced his appointment as the incoming managing director of Pioneer Theatre Company in Salt Lake City, Utah. The news was made public following a 10-month national search by Pioneer Theatre Company and the University of Utah. At the close of Massimine's tenure with the National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene he oversaw Fidler Afn Dakh's sold-out six month run at the Museum and Jewish Heritage, its uptown commercial transfer to Stage 42, and partnered with Time Life Music and record producer Robert Sher on Fidler Afn Dakh's forthcoming cast album. Following retiring managing director Chris Lino's service of 28 years, Massimine is the third managing director in Pioneer Theatre Company's history. On March 1, 2019, Pioneer Theatre Company artistic director Karen Azenberg and Massimine announced Massimine's inaugural season, which includes the first pre-Broadway production of the biographical musical Cagney, the world premiere of Ass, a new play authored by screenwriter Ellen Simon, daughter of Neil Simon, and regional premieres composed of recent Award-winning Broadway plays and musicals. On May 6, 2019, the New York Drama Critics Circle announced a special award citation for Massimine's production of Fidler Afn Dakh. On May 15, 2019, Fidler Afn Dakh won an Outer Critics Circle Award for outstanding musical revival. On May 22, 2019, the Off Broadway Alliance announced that Fidler Afn Dakh won their best musical revival award. On June 2, 2019, Fidler Afn Dakh took home the Drama Desk Award in the category of musical revival. Following the passing of Massimine's mentor Harold Prince, on July 31, 2019, Massimine publicly opened up about their longstanding friendship, and of Prince serving as the inspiration for Massimine to pursue his career in producing. At the 2019 United Nations Civil Society Conference in Salt Lake City, Utah, Massimine was the keynote representative for the performing arts on sustainability. On October 16, 2019 it was announced he was selected by the NPAA as Humanitarian of the Year. ==External links== * == References == Category:Living people Category:American theatre managers and producers Category:Drama Desk Award winners Category:American entertainment industry businesspeople Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Christopher Massimine"},{"id":"56743951","text":"Jade de Melo (born 9 February 1993) is an Australian rules footballer playing for the Fremantle Football Club in the AFL Women's (AFLW).

The wine was shipped across the country and the brewery lasted into the 1940s. == Education in Europe == John inherited his father's talent for lithography and was immensely gifted. He left for Berlin in 1860 to finish his education during the Civil War. He earned a degree from the Royal Academy there and returned to St. Louis to work at his father's company. After three years, about 1867, he went to Paris to study art. The 1870 Census shows him living with his parents in St. Louis but within a year, he was working in New York. His drawings from Paris, Missouri, and New York at this time are in the Autry Museum collection. == Life and career in New York == He married Augusta Marie Catherine Stohlmann (1841-1924) of New York about 1870. The couple resided at 297 Adelphi Street in Brooklyn. They had at least three children. Son John survived only a year, son Karl married but died in his 20s, and daughter Mary Louise Katherine Gast (1879-1940), survived into full adulthood. In New York, John Gast helped launch the New York Daily Graphic, a newspaper that had a special lithographic section. He worked at the paper for about five years, but went on to establish his own lithograph firm, Gast and Company. John received patents for several lithograph processes and equipment, such as a special lithograph screen that enabled color printing. His company became the Photo-chrome Company and later Grey and Company. He is considered the inventor of the three-color lithograph process. Failing health required him to step back from his business ventures. He died of liver cancer in 1896 at age 53. == Artistic works == His most famous painting was American Progress that was commissioned by George Crofutt, a publisher who reproduced the painting in his many travel guides to the American West. The painting glorified westward expansion and is considered the American equivalent to Eug√®ne Delacroix's Liberty Leading the People (1830). Some of Gast's other paintings include: Bluffs on the Mississippi Below the Arsenal (1865), Angel Sitting on Mountain Top (1871), untitled (mother adjusting a blanket...) (1870s), American Prostonewares (1872), and Homeward (a ship sailing under dark skies, painted March 24, 1896, a few months before his death and perhaps his last work). His works are generally signed and dated. == Bibliography == * Obituary in the Brooklyn Eagle, July 27, 1896, p. 7, c. 2. ==References== == External links == *Biography of John Gast on askart.com. *John Gast, American Progress, 1872, essay by Martha A.

CIFs may apply for an exemption from the requirement to hold an Australian Financial Services Licence (AFSL) if the ‚Äúfinancial products‚Äù they provide is limited to the issue of debentures or the running of managed investment schemes. For example, the solicitation of secured loans that are paid back with interest are considered debentures. Such deposit taking entities have since 2003 also been exempted from certain requirements of the Banking Act 1959. CIFs must be registered with the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, and, as charities, may also enjoy tax and other exemptions and benefits, such as deductible gift recipient status and exemption from income tax. http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/JlATax/2008/3.pdf In 2013, ASIC estimated that there were more than 200 CIFs, with the largest funds being those operated by the Australian Catholic Bishops' Conference. ==AFSL exemptions== Normally, an organisation that offers a \\"financial product\\" is required by Chapter 7 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) to obtain an Australian Financial Services Licence (AFSL), unless an exemption applies. By an instrument in 2002 under the Corporations Act,Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) class order 02/184 ‚Äì charitable investment schemes fundraising (2002) (repealed) Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) granted certain AFSL exemptions to CIFs including: * exemptions from the application of the debenture, managed investment scheme and fundraising provisions of the Corporations Act, and * exemption from the requirement to hold an AFSL, if the only financial products issued were debentures or managed investment schemes. To obtain the exemptions, the CIF would apply to ASIC and provide an ‚Äúidentification statement‚Äù (a much less onerous disclosure statement than for regulated investment schemes). The CIF also needed to make clear to investors that their products are not fully regulated by ASIC. After the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) was established in 2012, CIFs were required to be registered with the ACNC to be entitled to the exemptions. In 2013, a consultative paperASIC, May 2013, CP 207 Charitable investment fundraisers sought submissions on proposed amendments to the exemptions under Regulatory Guide 87.Regulatory Guide 87 ‚Äì Charitable schemes and school enrolment deposits - Updated 28 September 2016 Changes were made in 2016ASIC Corporations (Charitable Investment Fundraising) Instrument 2016/813 which: * increased the amount of information to be included in the identification statement, with pre-existing charities having until 31 March 2017 to lodge new identification statements. * since 1 January 2017, CIFs have not been permitted to issue at- call or investments with a term of less than 31 days to retail investors. * since 1 January 2018, CIFs have been required to obtain an AFSL, unless if the CIF is a ‚Äúwholesale CIF‚Äù. A wholesale CIF is one that has: ** net assets of at least $2.5 million, ** has had gross income of at least $250,000 over the previous two years, and ** does not offer its financial products to non- associated retail investors. None of the changes apply to fundraising from donations or bequests, in which there is no expectation of repayment. CIFs that have been granted exemptions by ASIC, and do not hold an AFSL, must disclose that investments in the fund are not subject to the usual protections for investors under the Corporations Act 2001 or regulation by ASIC. In 2013, ASIC estimated that more than 200 CIFs were collectively managing more than $7 billion on behalf of wholesale and retail investors. The investments were mainly in the form of debentures, investment funds and interests in managed investment schemes.Changes to the regulatory framework for charitable investment fundraisers The largest funds were those of the Australian Catholic Bishops' Conference,Submission of Australian Catholic Bishops' Conference 12 July 2013Submission of Australian Catholic Bishops' Conference 15 February 2016 with 24 funds holding deposits totaling $7.49 billion. ==Banking Act exemptions== In Australia, taking deposits from the public is classified as a banking activity and is highly regulated under the Banking Act 1959 (Cth). However, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has since 2003 exempted from certain requirements of the Banking Act entities formed for religious and charitable purposes, called religious charitable development funds (RCDFs), that take deposits (termed ‚Äúinvestments‚Äù) from the public, subject to a number of conditions.Banking (Exemption) Order No. 96 (2003) Changes were made in 2016, which came into effect on 1 January 2017, to restrict RCDFs being seen by the public as quasi-banks. If a RCDF offers an account to a retail investor without a stated term, the account will now have a minimum notice period of 31 days before a withdrawal, and any account offered to a retail investor that is a term investment is required to state a term of at least 31 days. RCDFs are now precluded from offering transactional accounts, such as cheque accounts, access to ATMs, EFTPOS, etc. The exemption order and list of complying RCDFs was updated in 2017. RCDFs that have been granted an exemption by APRA are require to disclose to investors that the fund is not a bank and is not prudentially supervised by APRA, and that investors do not receive the benefit of the financial claims scheme or the depositor protection provisions in the Banking Act 1959. They are also required to tell investors that they may be unable to get their money back. There are currently about 60 RCDFs registered with APRA that have been granted an exemption.Exemption Order No. 1 of 2017 Between them, these funds have more than $7 billion in retail deposits. ==See also== * Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission ==References== Category:Finance in Australia ","title":"Charitable investment fundraiser"},{"id":"56744117","text":"Araeognatha umbrosa is a moth of the family Noctuidae first described by George Hampson in 1893.

It consists of lead vocalist Sarah McTaggart, with Judah McCarthy, Michael Panek, and Jon Garcia as musicians and writers. The band initially formed online before moving to the West Coast to collaborate in person. It gained initial recognition after a local publicity stunt, celebrity endorsements, and after being selected for a Google Play commercial. It has released three EPs and three singles, and has played a number of high-profile tours and festivals. ==Career== McTaggart originally met Panek on a musicians' networking website. At the time, McTaggart lived in Grand Cayman and Panek lived in San Diego, although as McTaggart later recalled, she initially lied on the site and stated she too was from San Diego because that was where she wanted but could not afford to move to. Panek in turn enlisted Garcia, whom he had known since they attended Churchville-Chili Senior High School together. The group, originally named Noise Floor, collaborated at a distance at first before establishing itself in San Diego. After relocating to Los Angeles, McCarthy, another Churchville-Chili alumnus and friend of Panek's and Garcia's, joined the line-up and the name was changed to Transviolet. According to the group, its chosen name was inspired by the poem When The Violets Roar At The Sun by Charles Bukowski and chosen to mean \\"transcendence into a new, violet awareness\\". Transviolet firstly began gaining widespread recognition with endorsements from Harry Styles and Katy Perry. McTaggart and Perry had known one another as children and attended the same church. The band caused some controversy early in its career by sending out anonymous packages containing a cassette tape with \\"just press play\\" handwritten on each one. The packages were sent to members of the street team of Fueled by Ramen, a label distributed by Elektra Records. The cassettes contained a recording of the song Girls Your Age, which was released online in mid 2015. A Shazam code was also included. The eponymous EP containing Girls Your Age garnered more than 20 million streams for its top three songs. The band toured with LANY in 2016. The song New Bohemia from the Transviolet EP was chosen for use on a Google Play commercial, and the band was named the \\"band of the week\\" by The Guardian in January 2016. That April, New Bohemia entered Billboard's Alternative Songs chart where it peaked at #35. In 2017 the EP Kaleidoscopes was released. Transviolet was signed by Epic Records in early 2015. It split ways with the label in late 2017. It was then picked up by Sony BMG, followed by the release of the EP Valley in 2019. A track from Valley, Undo, featured as the closing music of an episode of the Netflix series Unbelievable. The group performed on The Late Late Show with James Corden on July 12, 2016. It also performed on the Today Show and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. It has played a number of festivals, including Reading, Governors Ball, South by Southwest, and Firefly. In July 2018 the band headlined a hometown concert at The Echo (venue), Los Angeles. In September 2019 it self-released the single Sunshine, followed by Money Money in October and Born To Rule in November. Later in November, in advance of a date at the legendary Troubadour (West Hollywood, California), the band guested on Aliens by The Griswolds. ==Members== McTaggart performing with Transviolet at the Made In LA festival in 2018 * Sarah McTaggart (vocalist) * Judah McCarthy (guitarist) * Michael Panek (multi-instrumentalist) * Jon Garcia (drummer/producer) ==Extended Plays== *Transviolet (2015) *Kaleidoscopes (2017) *Valley (2018) ==Singles== *LA Love (2016) *Future (2016) *Sunshine (2019) *Money Money (2019) *Born To Rule (2019) ==Singles (as featured artist)== *Telescope (with Tim Legend) (2017) *Know U (with Jesse Porsches) (2018) *Lost Frequency (with The Swoons) (2019) *Gone (with Great Good Fine Ok) (2019) *Aliens (with The Griswolds) (2019) *Heart Lies (with Taao Kross) (2020) *Tendencies (with Sleeping Lion) (2020) *Daydream (with Charlie Crown) (2020) ==Albums== *Born To Rule (2020) ==See also== * List of alternative rock artists * List of bands from Los Angeles * List of indie rock musicians == References == ==External links== * Category:American alternative rock groups Category:Musical groups from Los Angeles Category:2015 establishments in California ","title":"Transviolet"},{"id":"56744167","text":"Tahia Noon () is a Pakistani politician who was a Member of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab, from May 2013 to May 2018. ==Early life and education== She was born on 20 May 1973 in Karachi.

Soln√∏r is a Norwegian farm in Skodje in M√∏re og Romsdal county. The farm has been known since the Middle Ages because it was a subordinate estate, known as Giskegods. The farmhouse was built by the officer Ludvig Daae (1792‚Äì1879) in 1825 and it received protected status in 1939. The house has a double-room layout with a central corridor, and the exterior has a classical symmetrical style with a large dormer and the main entrance in the middle of the facade. The door frame has a classical style with an arch over the top and columns. The farm was purchased by Ludvig Daae in 1820, and it was taken over by his son, the politician Ludvig Daae; the two men were the uncle and cousin of Suzannah Ibsen. During his travels in Western Norway in the summer of 1862, Henrik Ibsen visited his wife's relatives at Soln√∏r. The farm may have served as an inspiration for his play Rosmersholm (it may also have been inspired by the Molde farm in Molde and the parsonage farm in Her√∏y, where Suzannah grew up). Ibsen arrived at Soln√∏r on July 16, 1862 and also became acquainted with the local historian Peder Fylling there. Ibsen copied or received a collection of local oral traditions from Fylling. Magdalene Thoresen, Ibsens mother-in-law, was also at Soln√∏r and met Peder Fylling. Thoresen used the lore that Fylling provided her with in her volume Billeder fra Vestkysten af Norge (Pictures from the West Coast of Norway, 1872). Ludvig Daae hired the young Ivar Aasen as a private teacher for his children. It was during his time at Soln√∏r that Ivar Aasen formulated his Nynorsk program in the essay \\"Om vort Skriftsprog\\" (Our Written Language). Aasen had previously taught at the home of Hans Conrad Thoresen, Ludvig Daee's brother-in-law and Ibsen's father-in-law.

Although the traditional reserve military forces (not to be confused with the newer British Army reserves made up of regular soldiers who remained liable for recall after completing their full-time engagements) of the Militia, Yeomanry, and Volunteer Force were increasingly integrated with the British Army during the latter decades of the Nineteenth Century, as with the previous Mutiny Acts, the members of these units were not subject to the Army Act unless embodied for active service or for training with the Regular Army. This remained the case with the Territorial Force (created by the amalgamation of the Yeomanry and the Volunteer Force under the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907) and the Territorial Army as the Territorial Force was renamed by the Territorial Army and Militia Act 1921. As specified in the Army Act, 1955,Army Act, 1955. UK Government in reference to the Act's application to reservists, pensioners, and members of the Territorial Army: A number of regiments of the British Army, most of which are reserve units on Territorial Army lines, based and recruited in British Overseas Territories, although technically falling under the remit and control of the British Government (as national government, whereas the territorial government is strictly a local government to which most areas of internal government have been delegated) exist under acts of local legislatures, requiring clauses of those acts to also apply the Army Act to these units. These units, as of 2020, include the Royal Bermuda Regiment (RBR), the Royal Gibraltar Regiment,PERSONS SUBJECT TO MILITARY LAW: GIBRALTAR. House of Commons Debate, 9 May, 1996.

It is currently under construction as part of the Purple Line Extension project, in Beverly Hills, California. Construction started in 2018 as part of phase 2 of the extension project. It is slated to open in early 2025.

RailPAC. 8 Dec 2012. ==History== Construction of Wilshire/Rodeo station was officially kicked off on September 23, 2019. On March 31, 2020, the Beverly Hills City Council approved a proposal from the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to fully close the two blocks of Wilshire Boulevard needed to facilitate the station's construction, taking advantage of lower traffic levels resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic in California. This would allow for expedited construction of the station and better mitigation of construction impacts as opposed to the original plan, which would require alternating weekend closures for 13 weeks over a 3.5-month period, with completion scheduled for March 2021. Fully closing Wilshire Boulevard, which went into effect the next day and would last as late as July 2020, would expedite construction of the station by as much as six months. Metro officially completed foundation and decking work for Wilshire/Rodeo station seven months ahead of schedule on June 14, 2020, with Tutor Perini, the project's general contractor, putting workers on extra shifts to further expedite construction. Wilshire Boulevard reopened in both directions later that evening, with construction and excavation activities continuing underground until that phase's scheduled completion in the first quarter of 2021. ==Station layout== Wilshire/Rodeo station was originally planned with a single entrance, located at the southern side of Wilshire Boulevard and Reeves Drive. However, as part of an agreement Metro negotiated with the City of Beverly Hills which was approved on February 28, 2019, a second entrance is being planned on the northern side of Wilshire Boulevard, with three locations being considered. The station will be the only station in the Metro Rail system (aside from Union Station) to have public toilets, which would likely be built after the station opens, and may be built above-ground and/or integrated into a new development which would be built above the station. ==Metro Rail service== ==Bus connections== *Metro Rapid: 720 ==Attractions== The station is located in the Platinum Triangle neighborhood that includes the Rodeo Drive shopping district and its many hotels, including the Luxe Rodeo Drive Hotel, the Beverly Wilshire Hotel, the Beverly Hilton, and The Peninsula Beverly Hills. It also lies a few blocks south of the Beverly Gardens Park and its Electric Fountain, and Beverly Ca√±on Gardens Park. It is also located directly next to Reeves Park. Various fine dining establishments are located in the neighborhood, including Spago. The Academy Headquarters Building along with its Samuel Goldwyn Theater, the Paley Center for Media and the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts are located near by.

The game was wholly created by Australian artist and musician Cos Russo. == Development == The game was designed by Cos Russo, going through multiple revisions of the concept and objectives. It was developed for 5 years. The game was released in limited distribution on January 17, 2003. It was officially released onto the North American market in May 2004. Prior to its release, a demo was available at the Got Game Entertainment site. On August 23, 2004, the game was released into retails stores on the Australia market. An iOS version was released in 2015, with a brand new sequel planned in the future. == Plot == The making of process of the game, featured on the official Alida homepage. In-universe, Alida is a guitar-shaped island off the coast of Australia, built by the members of a band from the money made from their successful first album. They never released a second album and were forgotten by their fans. The band split, they each locked their fortunes in separate parts of the island and left. Arin, one of the previous members, goes to the island to attend a supposed reunion but never returns home. His wife Julia asks the player to head to island to locate her husband, and this is where the game begins. == Gameplay == Being a Myst-like point-and-click adventure game, Alida sees the player navigate through a series of screens. Spanning 5 CDs, the game focuses on interaction with puzzles to progress to new locations. The puzzles lean toward musical themes and vary in difficulty. It incorporates FMV scenes and CGI animations, both blended into the scenery. An interview with the creator is a bonus feature of the game. == Reception == Inside Mac Games noted some of the puzzles' intense difficulty and praised the games audiovisuals. Applelinks felt the game had a satisfying ending. Mac Review Games urged readers to support the game due to its creator's \\"vision, creativity, and conscience\\". In 2003, Just Adventure thought Alida was a \\"phenomenal achievement\\", but that it could have been a much better game. In 2004, a separate review told readers to buy the game at retail price to support games like this being made.https://www.justadventure.com/2016/03/24/alida-review/ Gamezone felt that everything the title tried to achieved had been done better a decade earlier.

It has a claimed range of more than , Mach 10 speed, and an ability to perform evasive maneuvers at every stage of its flight. It can carry both conventional and nuclear warheads and can be launched from Tu-22M3 bombers or MiG-31K interceptors. It has been deployed at airbases in Russia's Southern Military District. The Kinzhal entered service in December 2017 and is one of the six new Russian strategic weapons unveiled by Russian President Vladimir Putin on 1 March 2018. ==Design== The missile is designed to target US and NATO warships posing a threat to strategic missile systems in Russia‚Äôs European part and to destroy NATO missile defence system and ballistic missile defense ships and land objects close to Russia borders, such as one in Romania. It is allegedly designed to overcome any known or planned US air or missile defense systems including MIM-104 Patriot, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense and Aegis Combat System.. The missile first stage is probably shared with 9K720 Iskander and the guidance section is specifically designed for this missile. It is capable of attacking fixed and movable targets such as aircraft carriers. The missile accelerates to hypersonic speed within seconds of launch and performs maneuvers at all stages of the flight trajectory to evade enemy missile defenses. Russian media claims the missile's range will be when carried by the MiG-31K and when carried by the Tu-22M3. American commentators have been skeptical about Russian claims about the weapon. ==Operational history== The first operational unit armed with the hypersonic Kinzhal missiles was formed in Southern Military District of Russia in December 2017. In May 2018, ten MiG-31Ks capable of using Kinzhal missiles were on experimental combat duty and ready to be deployed. By December 2018, aircraft armed with Kinzhal missiles have conducted 89 patrol flights over the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. By February 2019, crews of the MiG-31K attack aircraft in role of Kinzhal missile carriers have performed more than 380 training flights with the missile, of which at least 70 have been carried with mid-air refueling. The weapon made its public debut during the Aviadarts international contest in August 2019.http://www.armstrade.org/includes/periodics/news/2019/0812/094553821/detail.shtml According to TASS, the first launch of Kinzhal in the Arctic took place mid- November, 2019.

This supply route was defended by the ƒê·ªìng Nai Regiment. Between 22 and 25 November the ƒê·ªìng Nai Regiment had attacked the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 48th Regiment killing several dozen soldiers. BG Robert C. Forbes planned to deploy the 4th Battalion, 12th Infantry to interdict the supply route and allow the ARVN 48th Regiment to extend security over the densely-populated hamlets along the banks of the ƒê·ªìng Nai river. ==Operation== On 4 December, 4/12th Infantry commanded by Lt. Col. William S. Schroeder, began landing several kilometers north of T√¢n Uy√™n town. That unit together with Battery C, 2nd Battalion, 40th Artillery Regiment began constructing Firebase Nashua (). On the early morning of 6 December, a VC mortar attack hit Firebase Nashua, killing or wounding several Americans. At dawn, two platoons from Company A 4/12th Infantry and a scout dog team searched for the VC southeast of the firebase. That afternoon as the force moved through an area of thick vegetation it was ambushed by the D800 Battalion of the ƒê·ªìng Nai Regiment in concealed bunkers, with more than 12 U.S. soldiers killed or wounded in the initial fire. LCol Schroeder ordered Company C to assist, together with M113s from Troop D, 17th Cavalry Regiment and called for the Brigade reserve, the 3rd Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment, to be flown in from Long Binh Post. These reinforcements were able to extract Company A by nightfall, they had suffered 25 killed and 82 wounded and 2 M113s were damaged by mines. 67 VC bodies were recovered. Following that engagement BG Forbes reinforced his units, deploying the 3/7th Infantry, into the eastern part of T√¢n Uy√™n District, where it established Firebase Keane (). A battery of M55 self propelled howitzers from the 2nd Battalion, 35th Artillery, was deployed to Firebase Nashua. BG Forbes was also given control of the recently deployed Company F, 51st Infantry Regiment, a Long-range reconnaissance patrol unit. On 19 December, a team from Company F, 51st Infantry, observed VC troops while patrolling the southern edge of War Zone D. A company from the 4/12th Infantry was landed by helicopter to engage the VC supported by helicopter gunships from the 3/17th Cavalry. The VC withdrew into War Zone D leaving 49 dead while U.S. losses were 7 dead. On 27 December the 4/12th Infantry, engaged a company-size VC unit southeast of Firebase Nashua, killing 30 for the loss of 3 U.S. dead. ==Aftermath== The operation concluded on 17 February 1968. VC losses were 456 killed while U.S. losses were 37 killed. It was considered a success because the U.S. forces had kept the VC away from T√¢n Uy√™n town and the ƒê·ªìng Nai river hamlets and prevented rocket attacks on Long Binh. ==References== Category:1967 in Vietnam Category:1968 in Vietnam Category:Battles and operations of the Vietnam War Category:Battles and operations of the Vietnam War in 1967 Category:Battles and operations of the Vietnam War in 1968 Category:History of B√¨nh D∆∞∆°ng Province ","title":"Operation Manchester"},{"id":"56745032","text":"The list of shipwrecks in March 1837 includes ships sunk, foundered, wrecked, grounded, or otherwise lost during March 1837. ==2 March== ==3 March== ==4 March== ==5 March== ==6 March== ==8 March== ==9 March== ==10 March== ==11 March== ==12 March== ==13 March== ==14 March== ==15 March== ==16 March== ==17 March== ==18 March== ==19 March== ==20 March== ==22 March== ==23 March== ==24 March== ==25 March== ==26 March== ==27 March== ==29 March== ==30 March== ==31 March== ==Unknown date== ==References== 1837-03 ","title":"List of shipwrecks in March 1837"},{"id":"56745038","text":"Malcolm Sinclair is a name that may refer to *Malcolm Sinclair (Swedish nobleman) (1690‚Äì1739) whose assassination caused the Russo‚ÄìSwedish War of 1741‚Äì1743 *Malcolm Sinclair (politician) (b. 1948), British politician and member of the House of Lords *Malcolm Sinclair (actor) (b. 1950), English stage and television actor and president of Equity trade union ","title":"Malcolm Sinclair"},{"id":"56745050","text":"Aleksandar Mladenoviƒá (, born December 2, 1984) is a Serbian professional basketball player for Konstantin. == Professional career == On December 18, 2017, Mladenoviƒá signed for MKS DƒÖbrowa G√≥rnicza of the Polish Basketball League. == References == == External links == * Player Profile at realgm.com * Player Profile at eurobasket.com * Player Profile at PLK * Player Profile at proballers.com * Player Profile at bgbasket.com * Player Profile at EuroLeague * Player Profile at beoexcell.net Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Basketball League of Serbia players Category:Centers (basketball) Category:CSU Pite»ôti players Category:KK Ergonom players Category:KK Lions/Swisslion Vr≈°ac players Category:KK Mega Basket players Category:KK Hemofarm players Category:OKK Konstantin players Category:Serbian expatriate basketball people in Poland Category:Serbian expatriate basketball people in Romania Category:Serbian men's basketball players Category:≈ölƒÖsk Wroc≈Çaw basketball players Category:Sportspeople from Ni≈° ","title":"Aleksandar Mladenoviƒá (basketball)"},{"id":"56745064","text":"Madurai Aruvai Vanigan Ilavettanar (Tamil: ‡ÆÆ‡Æ§‡ØÅ‡Æ∞‡Øà ‡ÆÖ‡Æ±‡ØÅ‡Æµ‡Øà ‡Æµ‡Ææ‡Æ£‡Æø‡Æï‡Æ©‡Øç ‡Æá‡Æ≥‡Æµ‡Øá‡Æü‡Øç‡Æü‡Æ©‡Ææ‡Æ∞‡Øç) was a poet of the Sangam period, to whom 13 verses of the Sangam literature have been attributed, including verse 35 of the Tiruvalluva Maalai.

These improvements, which were delivered by joint ventures of British company Carillion and American company KBR at a cost of ¬£1.6 billion, aimed to improve the quality of life for 18,000 soldiers living and working at the garrisons and were completed in December 2014. Funds managed by Innisfree and by InfraRed Capital Partners also invested in the project. Sites around Salisbury Plain where improvements took place included Bulford, Larkhill, Perham Down, Tidworth and Warminster. In November 2016 Aspire Defence won an extension to the contract under which it would deliver a further 130 new buildings, as well as extensions and alterations to existing buildings, as part of the Army Basing Programme in order to allow the return of troops from Germany by 2019. Following the January 2018 collapse of Carillion, KBR acquired Carillion's interests in Aspire Defence. ==See also== *Project MoDEL ==References== Category:Military in Aldershot Category:Military history of Wiltshire Category:United Kingdom defence procurement ","title":"Project Allenby Connaught"},{"id":"56745112","text":"Whitty is a remote rural locality and civil parish of Evelyn County in far northwest New South Wales.

Allan Barker. (2004) The historical Cash Coins of Viet Nam. The cast B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i Th√¥ng B·∫£o were produced at the Thanh H√≥a Mint, while the machine- struck variants were produced in Hanoi by the colonial French government. These coins bear the name of Emperor B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i who ascended the throne in 1926 but continued the production of the earlier Kh·∫£i ƒê·ªãnh Th√¥ng B·∫£o (ÂïìÂÆöÈÄöÂØ∂) that bore his father's name until 1933 when he ordered the production of new coins with his reign name, which was normal as previous Vietnamese emperors also kept producing cash coins with the inscription of their predecessors for a period of time. The cast smaller B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i Th√¥ng B·∫£o cash coins with blank reverses were only valued at piastre. The B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i Th√¥ng B·∫£o were probably cast into 1941 or 1942 and the production was stopped because the occupying Japanese forces wanted the copper and were acquiring all of the cash coins they could find and stockpiling them in Haiphong for shipment to Japan for the production of war materials. Cash coins would continue to circulate officially in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam until 1948 with an official exchange rate set of 20 cash coins for 1 ƒë·ªìng. == Machine-struck B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i Th√¥ng B·∫£o coins == A machine-struck B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i Th√¥ng B·∫£o cash coin. The French simultaneously began minting brass machine-struck cash coins in Hanoi, with the same inscription as the cast B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i Th√¥ng B·∫£o cash coins, that weighed 1.36 grams and had an official exchange rate of piastre, but were probably only valued at piastre. These coins were being minted at the Hanoi Mint because the French had cut the funding for producing cast cash coins at the Thanh H√≤a Mint which meant that the Protectorate of Annam wasn't producing enough cast cash coins to satisfy the demands of the Vietnamese markets for these low value coins for every day exchange. The machine-struck B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i Th√¥ng B·∫£o cash coins were designed by Ren√© Mercier. There were two variants of this cash coins where one had a large version of the Chinese \\"Â§ß\\" (ƒê·∫°i) while the other had a smaller \\"Â§ß\\". After the Japanese had forced the production of B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i Th√¥ng B·∫£o coins because they were commandeering all copper in Vietnam new sap√®que-like coins made from zinc were created in Hanoi and by the Japan Mint in Osaka to replace these coins as the copper was being used for the production of Japanese weaponry and other military equipment, though the coins from Osaka didn't make it to the Vietnamese market as the shipping of war supplies was deemed more important by the Japanese government.

She specialises in children's speech sound disorders. Her clinical career as a speech-language pathologist spanned 42 years from 1970 to 2011. ==Biography== Bowen studied speech therapy in Melbourne, graduating from the Victorian School of Speech and Hearing Science with a LACST (Licentiate of the Australian College of Speech Therapists, a forerunner of the Australian Association of Speech and Hearing, later to become Speech Pathology Australia) in 1970, and received her PhD degree in 1996 from Macquarie University, Australia. She also has qualifications in Speech and Drama from Trinity College London (ATCL performer 1964; LTCL teaching 1966) and a diploma in Family Therapy (1989) from the now disbanded Family Therapy Institute of Australia. She has worked extensively across Australia, Ireland and the UK and is regarded as an international expert in both clinical fields of children's speech sound disorders and in the use of technology to improve speech pathology practice. She is a Senior Honorary Research Fellow in Linguistics at Macquarie University in Australia, and an Honorary Research Fellow in Speech- Language Pathology at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. In 2008 Bowen was elected as a fellow the American Speech‚ÄìLanguage‚ÄìHearing Association. In 2011 she was made a life member of Speech Pathology Australia and in 2014 became an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists. She is the only Australian, and only speech-language pathologist, to be awarded high honours by all three of these professional organisations. Dr Bowen's other professional interests include evidence-based practice; the role of families in speech-language pathology intervention; developmental language disorder; the impact of treatment fads, complementary and alternative medicine and pseudoscience on clinical and education practice (e.g., the Arrowsmith Program, Brain Gym, Facilitated Communication, Irlen, Learning Styles, the Rapid Prompting Method, Whole Language, etc.); and the application of information and communication technology, including social media, for professional purposes. Dr Bowen has also been a pioneer in the use of the Internet in Speech Pathology. Her own website and her Phonological Therapy listserv have facilitated worldwide communication of the highest standard within the profession. She consulted on the 2010 film The King's Speech, the 2010 book of the same title by Lionel Logue's grandson Mark Logue with co-author Peter Conradi, and the 2010 book Lionel Logue ‚Äì The King's Mentor by Norman C.

Its purpose is to prevent hydrogen explosions. Recombiners come into action spontaneously as soon as the hydrogen concentration increases. They are passive devices because their operation does not require external energy. Hydrogen may be generated in a nuclear accident if the reactor fuel overheats and zirconium cladding of the fuel rods reacts chemically with steam. If the hydrogen is released from the reactor to the containment, it may get mixed with air and form a flammable or even explosive mixture. A hydrogen explosion could break the containment and cause radioactive materials to be released to the environment. Recombiners aim at removing hydrogen and thereby preventing explosions. Inside a recombiner there are plates or pellets that are coated with platinum or palladium catalyst. On the surface of the catalyst, hydrogen and oxygen molecules react chemically already at low temperature and low hydrogen concentration. The reaction generates steam. The reaction starts spontaneously when the hydrogen concentration reaches 1‚Äì2 percent. Burning of hydrogen in air requires at least 4 percent hydrogen concentration, and even higher for an explosion. So, a recombiner is able to remove hydrogen from the containment before a flammable concentration is reached. A recombiner is a box that is open from the bottom and from the top. The catalyst is located at the lower part of the box. The reaction of hydrogen and oxygen on the catalyst surface generates heat, and temperature in the recombiner reaches hundreds of degrees Celsius. Hot steam is lighter than the air in the containment, so buoyancy is caused inside the recombiner, much like in a chimney. This causes a strong airflow through the recombiner, feeding hydrogen and oxygen from the containment to the device. Hundreds of kilograms of hydrogen may be generated in a few hours during a severe reactor accident . For example the most efficient recombiner made by Framatome (formerly Areva) removes slightly over five kilograms of hydrogen per hour, when the hydrogen concentration is four percent . Therefore several recombiners are needed. For example the containment of Olkiluoto 3 EPR in Finland has 50 recombiners . Manufacturers of passive autocatalytic recombiners include Framatome , SNC-Lavalin (formerly Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd, AECL) , and German Siempelkamp-NIS . == References == Category:Catalysis Category:Nuclear power plant components Category:Nuclear safety and security Category:Hydrogen ","title":"Passive autocatalytic recombiner"},{"id":"56745615","text":"The list of shipwrecks in May 1837 includes ships sunk, foundered, wrecked, grounded, or otherwise lost during May 1837. ==1 May== ==2 May== ==3 May== ==4 May== ==5 May== ==6 May== ==8 May== ==9 May== ==10 May== ===11 May=== ==12 May== ==13 May== ==14 May== ==16 May== ==17 May== ==19 May== ==22 May== ==23 May== ==25 May== ==27 May== ==28 May== ==29 May== ==31 May== ==Unknown date== ==References== 1837-05 ","title":"List of shipwrecks in May 1837"},{"id":"56745634","text":"Dealtry is a surname.

Dapchi is located in Bulabulin, Yunusari Local Government area of Yobe State, in the northeast part of Nigeria. The Federal Government of Nigeria deployed the Nigerian Air Force and other security agencies to search for the missing schoolgirls and to hopefully enable their return. The governor of Yobe State, Ibrahim Gaidam, blamed Nigerian Army soldiers for having removed a military checkpoint from the town. Dapchi lies approximately 275 km (170 miles) northwest of Chibok, where over 276 schoolgirls were kidnapped by Boko Haram in 2014. Five schoolgirls died on the same day of their kidnapping, all others were released in March 2018 except the lone Christian girl Leah Sharibu as she refused to abandon her faith and convert to Islam. ==Controversies== ===Military withdrawal shortly before kidnapping=== Ibrahim Geidam, the governor of Yobe State, has complained about the withdrawal of army troops from Dapchi allegedly just hours before the abduction, without informing either the local police or the state government in advance. Initially the army remained silent regarding this complaint.Military Knew Of Boko Haram's Plan To Carry Out Mass Abductions In Yobe, But Withdrew Troops Sahara-Reporters. Feb. 27, 2018. Downloaded Mar. 5, 2018. Days later the army made seemingly contradictory claims attempting to explain its withdrawal. The army claimed that it had withdrawn its forces from the town due to the absence of evidence of any Boko Haram activity in the general vicinity, and that at the time, it had formally handed over Dapchi's security to the police prior to its withdrawal.Dapchi: Let the Blame Game Stop This Day Live. Mar 4, 2018. Downloaded Mar. 5, 2018. In an army intelligence document obtained by the Sahara-Reporters group dated Feb. 6, 2018 an army general expressed concern regarding a possible imminent Boko Haram attack in adjacent Damaturu, 60 miles away, thus calling into question the army's earlier assertion that it had good reason to believe that Boko Haram had left the general vicinity. The Yobe state police commissioner strongly denied the army's claim that his department had been formally informed by the army of the army's withdrawal, and no proof of any such police notification was provided by the army. ===Uncertainty regarding number of abductees=== Initially the Yobe governor stated that 94 schoolgirls were kidnapped from the school and that 48 had returned to their parents and that only 46 are still missing. While, Bashir Manzo, the chairman of the Forum of Missing Dapchi Schoolgirls Parents said that 105 girls were missing. The police commissioner of Yobe, Abdulmaliki Sunmonu said that 111 schoolgirls were missing. ===Comparison to Chibok kidnapping=== As in the recent Chibok schoolgirl kidnapping, so too in the Dapchi kidnapping the Nigerian government took days to respond at all, and then responded with several assurances that the kidnappers would be promptly apprehended, and that all of the girls would soon be returned safely to their homes. In the Chibok event, four years later still approximately a third of the abductees remained in the hands of Boko Haram, with those girls who have been released, for the most part having been released via ransom payments, and with only one low-level kidnapper having been apprehended and standing trial to date (Mar. 5, 2018).First person convicted for Nigeria's Boko Haram schoolgirl kidnap World News.

Parents and villagers of Dapchi narrated how the kidnapping occurred and urged the Nigerian government to help them bring back their girls unharmed. == Release == On 21 March 2018 the Federal government of Nigeria announced that Boko Haram terrorists had returned 106 of the kidnapped children, including 104 girls who went to school, one girl who did not and a boy. Leah Sharibu wasn't released and her parents told Agence France-Presse that the group would only release her if she converted to Islam. The group dropped them off in the town in nine vehicles. Information minister Lai Mohammed stated that the release was unconditional. But days later, the United Nation stated in its report that the government had paid a huge ransom for the release. The fighters after releasing the girls warned their parents not to put them in school again. Some of the kidnapped girls stated that five of the schoolgirls had died on the same day they were kidnapped by the terrorist group. == Leah Sharibu == Leah Sharibu, a Christian schoolgirl aged fourteen at the time of her capture, is the only remaining Dapichi schoolgirl still held hostage. After the others were released, some told The Guardian newspaper that Leah had previously escaped from her abductors but was intercepted and returned to her abductors by a nomadic Fulani family. Leah was reportedly not released along with the other children, because she refused to convert to Islam. According to Christian Solidarity Worldwide, she has subsequently been given to a Boko Haram fighter as a slave. In August 2018 an audio was released of Leah pleading for her freedom. In October 2018 her parents revealed that Boko Haram had threatened to kill her later that month, should the government not meet their demands. In February 2019 social media reports circulated about her death, but were dismissed by the government as politically motivated disinformation. On May 14, 2019, Leah celebrated her 16th Birthday in Boko Haram custody. She has spent over 400 days in captivity. Over 5000 Muslims gathered to pray for the release of Leah on Thursday, May 16, 2019 After spending almost two years in captivity, in January 2020, it was widely reported that Leah had given birth to a baby boy after being forcefully converted to Islam and married off to a Boko Haram commander. Her father, Nathan Sharibu dismissed the report saying that he would not want to hear such news. ==See also== * Chibok schoolgirls kidnapping * Buni Yadi attack * List of kidnappings * Yobe State school shooting ==References== Category:2010s missing person cases Category:2018 in Nigeria Category:2018 in women's history Category:Attacks on schools in Nigeria Category:Boko Haram kidnappings Category:Child abduction in Nigeria Category:February 2018 crimes Category:February 2018 events in Africa Category:Incidents of violence against women Category:Islamic terrorist incidents in 2018 Category:Kidnapped Nigerian children Category:Kidnappings by Islamists Category:Kidnappings in Nigeria Category:Missing person cases in Nigeria Category:Terrorist incidents in Nigeria Category:Terrorist incidents in Nigeria in 2018 Category:Violence against women in Nigeria Category:Yobe State ","title":"Dapchi schoolgirls kidnapping"},{"id":"56745995","text":"Name-ye Khosrowan (, The Book of Khosrows/Kings) is a historical book written by the Qajar prince, Jalal al-Din Mirza Qajar between 1868 and 1872 CE.

However, other reasons for human trafficking is for the removal of organs, forced marriage, and other exploitations. South America is one of the biggest source and destination locations in the world and has struggled with the issue for many years. The ILO estimates that of the 20.9 million victims of human trafficking in 2012, 1.8 million were from Latin America. There are many factors that cause human trafficking, like a high demand for domestic servants, sex laborers, and factory workers, the existence of already established trafficking networks that often take advantage of young women and children, corruption in the governments and local law enforcement agencies, a governmental disinterest in the issue and a lack of opportunity for women in South American regions where trafficking occurs. People who are typically exploited in human trafficking are impoverished, a member of an indigenous people, unemployed, victim of some kind of abuse, illiterate, substance users, is homeless and/or associated to gang activity. Research done by United States Department of State has also stated that there is a vulnerability for the LGBTQ+ and transgender people to be caught up in human trafficking. By far, sex trafficking is the leading type of human trafficking, making up 79 percent of all human trafficking. This is then followed by forced labor at 18 percent. About 20 percent of trafficking victims are children.United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. UNODC report on human trafficking exposes modern form of slavery. http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/human-trafficking/global-report-on-trafficking- in-persons.html Primary destinations for trafficking and illegal immigration are the United States, Spain, Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Canada. Globalization, capitalism and societal attitudes facilitates and reduces the barriers to human trafficking in the world today. == History of human trafficking in the region == The commercial use of humans within Latin and South America has been acknowledged since 1928 by the League of Nations. The commercial use of humans is mostly consisted of women and children. In 2000, human trafficking gain a lot of attention due to the Trafficking Victims Protection Act passed by the United States. While the act is a US policy, the act also consist of a anti-trafficking efforts that by the US to stop human trafficking in its southern neighbors. Currently, Latin America is the third largest source of trafficked humans. There is various theories as to why Central America, in particular, has seen increase cases of human trafficking. One theory is that due to the upheaval and political turmoil that occurred after the Spanish withdrew, crimes such as forced servitude and sexual exploitation increased without being checked. There it is the normalization of human exploitation that was left behind from colonialism. The acceptance of human exploitation stems from marginalization practices such as racism. The cultivation of conditions that allowed for human trafficking in Latin America can be dated back to the arrival of the first conquistadors in the 16th century. Since the 15th century there's been a continuous pattern of exploitation and extraction of the land and people inhabiting that region. First with the Spanish, then the dictatorships that replaced, and recently along with the dictators is neoliberalism. With neoliberalism, there are outside companies paying workers close to nothing wages while over working them. Due to past civil wars, lack of government regulation, and instances of past violations against human rights, Latin and South Americans have become exceedingly distrusting of their current governments. This situation makes it ideal for human traffickers to traffic people. == Types of human trafficking == ===Sex trafficking=== Sex trafficking is the practice of kidnapping people, typically young women and children, to be forced into the practice of sexual slavery and prostitution. Sex trafficking is the most common form of human trafficking. According to a report by the UNODC, 79 percent of trafficking is for sex trafficking. Typically, people with histories of sexual assault or sexual violence and people who live in poverty are targeted and kidnapped.Polaris Project(2002). Sex Trafficking From Latin America. https://polarisproject.org/es/initiatives/sex-trafficking-latin-america According to State Department officials, it is estimated that tens of thousands of Latin American women are trafficked each year, typically internationally. A large number of these victims come from Colombia or the Dominican Republic. According to a report made by the United Nations in 2016, multiple gangs, crime families, and drug trafficking organizations deal in human trafficking which may involve some 48,500 victims. These women and usually children are trafficked into prostitution, but can also be forced to work in pornography or stripping. Argentina and Brazil are very common destination countries for women from the Andes and some places in the Caribbean, like the Dominican Republic and Panama is a destination country for women from Colombia and Central America who are forced to work in the sex trade. Trafficking is a common occurrence along borders in Central and South America. The Mexican-Guatemalan border is especially popular due to undocumented migrants en route to the United States are often pushed into prostitution. ===Forced Labor=== Forced labor is the practice of intimidating a person into performing types of labor, through intimidation or violence.International Labor Organization (2014). The Meanings of Forced Labor. http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/forced-labour/news/WCMS_237569/lang-- en/index.htm The ILO reported that in 2012, about 1.8 million people in Latin America were laborers in forced labor. These numbers included victims of human trafficking. These numbers are estimated to be roughly 3.1 percent of the regions population, though it does not count the victims of human trafficking who are sent out internationally. Typically, men are approached by people looking for workers in urban areas where poverty and unemployment are common.International Labor Organization (2014). Fighting Forced Labor in Latin America. http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the- ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_075511/lang--en/index.htm From the 2014 UNODC report males make up anywhere from 67 to 70 percent of the trafficked victims for forced labor. These people promise good pay for work and often transport the workers to ranches and mines in remote areas. This is a common practice or occurrence in place like Peru, Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay where people are often forced to work on cattle ranches, lumber mills, cole mines and plantations where soy beans, cotton and corn are produced. Upon reaching their destination, the workers are told they are now in debt, and held in debt bondage. They are told that transportation costs will be taken out of their salaries. Other times, the workers aren't brought to the work site, but to a drop off point, where they sometimes wait for days or weeks for employers to come pick them up. Food, lodging and transportation are taken out of their salary, and they are held until their debt is paid. The indigenous people of Latin America are also highly susceptible to being taken into forced labor. Typically, they live in poverty and with discrimination and a low literacy rate working against them, they have no real way to protest against the laborers effectively. It is estimated that annually, about 1.5 million seasonal farm workers who are mostly from Latin America and the Caribbean Islands harvest produce in the United States. There have been an increasing amount of abuses due to forced labor because of the low wages, harsh working conditions, lack of legal protection and an increasing demand for cheap labor. ===Trafficking of children=== Typically, children are trafficked in countries that have large tourist attractions and centers on sex tourism. Street and orphaned children are the most vulnerable to be taken advantage of by traffickers, though there have been cases where the trafficked children still live with their family, and participate in commercial sexual activities to provide for the family. Some other factors that make a child vulnerable to becoming a victim of trafficking are poverty, infrequent attendance of school, involvement in criminal activity, drug or alcohol addiction, or physical or sexual abuse. Children are typically trafficked for the uses of illegal adoptions, child soldiers, sex slavey, or to work for an organized crime group. State Department officials estimate that roughly 1 million children work as domestic servants in Latin America and that 70 to 80 percent of unaccompanied children travel with smugglers.Seelke, Claire Ribando. Fas.org. Congressional Research Service, 13 October 2016. Web. 4 March 2018. The UNODC noted that children made up 30 percent of the trafficked victims in the Americas. == Structural Factors that contribute to human trafficking == ===Links to organized crime=== People are often trafficked by criminal organizations such as criminal gangs or mafia groups. Typically, organized crime groups take part in the sex trade and trafficking practice. In Guatemala, organized crime groups kidnap and transport women from other countries, often other Latin American countries, to participate in prostitution and sexual slavery. According to the Bilateral Safety Corridor Coalition, organized crime groups from Russia, Japan, Mexico, Central America, Ukraine and multiple other countries have been caught attempting to traffic people across the U.S.-Mexico border. The State Department states that there is evidence of children being forced to commit crimes in Ecuador, Chile, and Brazil. ===Supply and demand of Capitalism=== Human trafficking is unique in that the supply and demand are the same thing. The high demand for human bodies incentivizes the exploitation and dehumanization of human beings. In a SAGA publication there is an approximation of 32 billion dollars the human trafficking industry generates annually. Supply and demand of human trafficking is normalized in capitalist societies where consumers feel it is their right to receive the services they paid for. Giving a monetary value to humans, makes those selling them see them as object and their property. Due to the supply and demand of humans, the final destination for trafficked humans correlates with tourism. Tourism and sexual exploitation are positively correlated in modern day cities in Latin America. ===Stigma and societal attitudes=== Additional factors that perpetuates human trafficking, forced labor, and forced prostitution are stigmas and attitudes a society has in regard to individuals in the human trafficking industry. Research done by Jo Bindman, claims in general sex workers face significantly higher discrimination by law enforcements, governmental authority and society. This presents an issue concerning human trafficking as those who are unwilling forced into sex work are at a disadvantage of receiving help due to the conversation around sex work. ===Systemic Inequality=== Due to inequality and disparities that result from globalization and the lack of regulation, there are certain groups who are more vulnerable than others of becoming victims of human trafficking. These groups include and is not limited to individual who are impoverished, lack job opportunities, queer, and/or engage in harmful cultural traditions. Those who are living in poverty and lack the opportunity to at acquire a safe, honorable job are easily susceptible to the deceiving, manipulative tactics of human traffickers. In their desperation, people find themselves in the human trafficking system. ===Illegal immigration=== Some people go to traffickers looking to be brought into a new country, typically illegally. The most common countries people are brought to are The United States, Britain, Italy, Canada, Spain and the Netherlands. These countries have come to rely on migrant workers doing jobs in agriculture, construction, manufacturing and domestic service for low paying wages. Because of a concern about job competition, security and many other issues related to taking in large amounts of foreign-born populations, this has caused many of these countries to strengthen and tighten their border security. Though this has only caused a rise in illegal immigration. Many people from Guatemala and Belize travel through Mexico to get to the United States border. Because of the increasing security along the borders, smugglers will take more dangerous routes, which makes the smuggling more costly. To pay for this, smugglers will force the migrants into forced labor or prostitution. According to Zdrojewski, many of the trafficked women and children in Central America originate from Nicaragua, Dominica Republic and Guatemala. Most immigration is from the south to the north, to the United States. ==Efforts to combat Human Trafficking== Human Trafficking is underreported making for there to be a substantial amount of data missing concerning human trafficking. The two reasoning behind this is one the inadequate legislation surrounding and lacking of testimonies from victims and witness. Most of the underrepresented types of human trafficking fall in categories of forced labor, domestic servitude, forced marriage, organ harvesting and children trafficking. In 2000, the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, also known as the Trafficking Protocol, supplements the United Nations convention against transnational organized crime. Its intended person is to prevent and fight against human trafficking by facilitating international corporation. Since the creation of the protocol more countries are implementing laws in effort to prevent further human trafficking. Human Trafficking in Latin America did not become a central issue until the late twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first century, after the U.S. Trafficking Victims Protection Act and the Trafficking Protocol from the United Nations. The TVPA has provided funding to support local efforts against trafficking. Socially, there its an increase awareness about the issue and how to best support the victims. There are programs training individuals to recognize and care for human trafficked victims. However, many Latin American countries find it make progress against trafficking because they lack the resources and political power to enforce existing programs. Much of their resources and time goes into other issues such as drug trafficking and gang violence. Many countries even lack shelters for trafficked victims and follow up plans after the victim is freed. == References == Category:Human trafficking by continent ","title":"Human trafficking in South America"},{"id":"56746124","text":"Katheyondu Shuruvagide is a 2018 Indian Kannada-language romantic drama film directed by Senna Hegde and starring Diganth and Pooja Devariya (in her Kannada debut). == Cast == *Diganth as Tarun Manchale *Pooja Devariya as Tanya Mehra *Ashwin Rao Pallaki as Pedro *Shreya Anchan as Swarna == Release == The Times of India gave the film a rating of four out of five stars and noted that \\"Those looking at a getaway for three hours in a cinema hall for some laughs, a little tears and a story that is soulful and satisfying, this is definitely recommended\\".

Some authors have included L. tenellus in Lotus glaucus, a species found in Madeira and the Salvage Islands. L. leptophyllus may be treated as a synonym of L. tenellus or as a separate species. L. tenellus has yellow flowers, with usually no more than three flowers in each flower head (umbel). Its leaves are made up of five leaflets. ==Description== Lotus tenellus is a perennial herbaceous or shrubby plant. The leaves are either unstalked (sessile) or have a very short petiole, and are made up of five pinnate leaflets. The two basal leaflets are 1‚Äì5 mm long. A short axis (rhachis) 1‚Äì2 mm long, shorter than the basal leaflets, separates them from the other three leaflets, which are 2‚Äì7 mm long, usually longer than the basal leaflets. The stems and leaves have either straight hairs which lie flat along the surface or curved upright hairs ‚Äì sometimes a mixture of the two. The hairs are not particularly dense, so that the surface is clearly visible. The yellow flowers are arranged in umbels, usually with one to three flowers, occasionally up to four. The peduncule (stem) of the umbel is two to six times as long as the subtending leaves. The upper petal (the standard) is nearly as long as the keel petals, being 9‚Äì14 mm long. The wing petals are usually just shorter than the keel at 8‚Äì13 mm. The fruit pods are straight. ==Taxonomy== Lotus tenellus was first described, as Pedrosia tenella, by Richard Thomas Lowe in 1862. Lowe created a new genus, Pedrosia, for some species of Lotus. (The genus is now usually treated as Lotus section Pedrosia.) Lowe distinguished Pedrosia tenella (Lotus tenellus), found in the Canary Islands, from Pedrosia glauca (Lotus glaucus), found in Madeira. Subsequent authors did not accept either his genus or this distinction, sinking Lotus tenellus into Lotus glaucus. A survey of Lotus sect. Pedrosia in 2006 accepted Lowe's separation of the two species, transferring his Pedrosia tenella to Lotus. Lowe distinguished Pedrosia tenella (Lotus tenellus) from Pedrosia leptophylla (Lotus leptophyllus). Some sources accept Lotus leptophyllus as a distinct species. A 2006 survey of Lotus section Pedrosia treats L. leptophyllus as a synonym of L. tenellus. ==Distribution and habitat== Lotus tenellus is found in the coastal zone of Tenerife and Gran Canaria. ==References== tenellus Category:Flora of the Canary Islands ","title":"Lotus tenellus"},{"id":"56746204","text":"Cail is a name.

It is the type species of the genus Enoploteuthis, which is in turn the type genus of the Enoploteuthidae. ==Description== Enoploteuthis leptura have hooks on their arms, less on arms I-III than on arms IV, the males have many tiny papillae covering the oral surfaces of arms I-III. In males right arm IV is hectocotylised and has a flap created by an expansion of the ventral protective membrane and there are about six pairs of hooks on the distal third of the arm on the opposite side to the flap. On the dorsal side the protective membrane expands a little to create a series of small flaps on the other side of the arm from the large flap made by the ventral membrane. The tentacles are long and slender and the tentacular club is narrow with two rows of hooks on its manus, a ventral series having 6-7 large hooks and a dorsal series with 4-5 smaller hooks. The dactylus has 10-15 suckers in two series and there is a long, thin carpal cluster. The ventral mantle has six series of complex photophores on the anterior integument with a seventh series which curves either to the left or right to join with one of the nearby series and so does not extend to the anterior mantle margin. On the ventral, anterior edge of the mantle there is a discontinuous row of photophoresin which the gaps correspond to the spaces between the series of photophores on the mantle. The ventral surface of the head has six series of photophoresin which the outermost series are interrupted by a ventral window in the skin. There are no photophores between these ventral windows and the photophores on the eyelids. They grow to a mantle length of 92mm. ==Distribution== Enoploteuthis leptura has been recorded from the Gulf of Guinea, the eastern and western central Atlantic Ocean from Bermuda and Madeira in the north to Brazil and southwestern Africa in the south. The Indo- Pacific species Enoploteuthis magnoceani is considered by some authorities to be a subspecies of E. leptura. ==Habitat and Biology== Enoploteuthis lepturais a mesopelagic squid which occurs in the warmer water areas of the Atlantic. Increment analysis of statolith growth of specimens collected from the Gulf of Guinea showed that it has a short life span of approximately 6 months with individuals attaining sexual maturity in 45‚Äì60 days in males and 80‚Äì90 days in females. The maximum age is 153 days for mature males and they had grown to 72mm mantle length with females living to 143 days and attaining a mantle length of 92mm. Spawning occurs throughout much of the year up to September in the Gulf of Guinea with two peaks occurring in January and June‚ÄìJuly. This species is a vertical diel migrant, i.e. they spend the day at depths and move upwards towards the water surface at night to feed. ==References== Category:Squid Category:Cephalopods described in 1817 ","title":"Enoploteuthis leptura"},{"id":"56746244","text":"The six-petal rosette is a design with six-fold dihedral symmetry composed from six Vesica piscis lenses arranged radially around a central point, often shown enclosed in a circumference of another six lenses.

Yanyarrie is located within the federal division of Grey, the state Stuart, and the local government area of the District Council of Orroroo Carrieton. ==References== Category:Towns in South Australia ","title":"Yanyarrie, South Australia"},{"id":"56746347","text":"The women's 1500 metres at the 2017 Asian Winter Games was held on February 21, 2017 in Obihiro, Japan. ==Schedule== All times are Japan Standard Time (UTC+09:00) {class = \\"\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! width=220Date ! width=50Time ! width=100Event -  Tuesday, 21 February 2017  13:00  bgcolor=ffffccFinal } == Records == ==Results== { class=  !width=40Rank !width=40Pair !width=250Athlete !width=80Time !width=50Notes -   7  align=left  1:56.07 - 8align=left1:58.13 - 35align=left1:59.45 - 44align=left1:59.77 - 9align=left2:00.14 - 67align=left2:01.26 - 76align=left2:01.69 - 89align=left2:01.76 - 94align=left2:01.78 - 105align=left2:01.83 - 113align=left2:02.37 - 128align=left2:03.67 - 136align=left2:06.73 - 142align=left2:08.74 - 153align=left2:14.61 - 162align=left2:18.25 - 171align=left2:42.48 } * Zhang Hong was awarded bronze because of no three-medal sweep per country rule. ==References== ==External links== *Results Women 1500 ","title":"Speed skating at the 2017 Asian Winter Games ‚Äì Women's 1500 metres"},{"id":"56746373","text":"::Not to be confused with the Argyll and Bute Artillery Militia The 1st Argyll & Bute Artillery Volunteers was a part-time unit of the British Army's Royal Artillery formed in Scotland in 1860 in response to a French invasion threat. It 1908 it became the only Mountain Artillery unit in the Territorial Force, and saw action at Gallipoli and Salonika during World War I. Before World War II it became the first Territorial Anti-Tank unit. One of its successor units was captured at Saint-Valery-en-Caux during the Battle of France, but others saw action in the campaigns in North Africa and Sicily, and in North West Europe from D Day to VE Day, including Arnhem and the Rhine Crossing. It continued in the postwar Territorial Army until 1955. ==Artillery Volunteers== The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle and Artillery Volunteer Corps composed of part- time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett.Grierson, pp. 1‚Äì12.Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 1‚Äì4.Spiers, pp. 163‚Äì8. The 1st Administrative Brigade, Argyll Artillery Volunteers, was formed with headquarters (HQ) at Oban, on 10 October 1861 to include the following corps of Argyllshire Artillery Volunteer Corps (AVCs):Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 24‚Äì6.Grierson, pp. 149‚Äì51.Army List, various dates.Beckett, Appendix VIII. * 1st Corps formed at Easdale on 7 March 1860 (two batteries) * 2nd Corps formed at Tarbert, Loch Fyne, on 12 April 1860 (disbanded 1862) * 3rd Corps formed at Oban on 8 March 1860 * 4th Corps formed at West Tarbert on 12 April 1860; moved to Dunmore 1864, and Eonachan 1866 (disbanded 1874) * 5th Corps formed at Ardgour on 16 January 1861 (one subdivision, disbanded in 1865) * 6th Corps formed at Campbeltown on 11 February 1861 (Increased to two batteries, 1870) * 7th Corps formed at Port Ellen, Islay, on 3 July 1861 * 8th Corps formed at South Hall on 10 September 1861; moved to Castle Toward 1878. * 9th Corps formed at Tobermory, Mull on 15 May 1862 (Reduced to a half -battery, 1874). * 10th Corps formed at Lochgilphead on 15 May 1862 * 11th Corps formed at Tarbet on 13 February 1866 * 12th Corps formed at Inveraray on 2 April 1867 (Recruited from men of the Furnace Quarries) In 1863 the 1st Bute Artillery Volunteers at Rothesay (raised on 20 March 1862) were added to the unit. In 1867 the 2nd Bute Artillery Volunteers from Millport, Cumbrae (raised on 5 October 1867) were also added to the unit. In 1864 brigade HQ moved to Lochgilphead, and in 1870 to Rothesay. In May 1880 the brigade was consolidated as the 1st Argyll and Bute Artillery Volunteers, with twelve and a half batteries, distributed as follows: *Nos. 1 and 2, Easdale (late 1st Argyll) *No. 3, Oban (late 3rd Argyll) *Nos. 4 and 5, Campbeltown (late 6th Argyll) *No. 6, Port Ellen, Islay (late 7th Argyll) *No. 7, Castle Toward (late 8th Argyll). *No. 8, Rothesay (late 1st Bute) *No. 9, Millport (late 2nd Bute) *No. 10, Lochgilphead (late 10th Argyll) *No. 11, Tarbert (late 11th Argyll) *No. 12, Inveraray (late 12th Argyll) *Half-battery, Tobermory, Mull (late 9th Argyll) (disbanded in 1887) In 1887 a new 12th battery was formed at Rothesay, and in the following year the 8th Battery moved to Dunoon. ===Royal Garrison Artillery=== In 1882 all the artillery volunteers were affiliated to one of the territorial garrison divisions of the Royal Artillery (RA) and the 1st Argyll & Bute AVC became part of the Scottish Division. In 1889 the structure was altered, and the corps joined the Southern Division. In 1899 the RA was divided into separate field and garrison branches, and the artillery volunteers were all assigned to the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA). In 1902 their titles were changed, the unit becoming the 1st Argyll & Bute Royal Garrison Artillery (Volunteers), with its HQ at Tarbert. During the South African War in 1900, 211 men of the 1st Argyll and Bute volunteered their services, but only eight were accepted for active service. The corps was one of the most scattered in Britain. For example, No 6 Company had detachments at Bowmore, Bridgend, and Ardbeg. Personnel of the corps were spread over fifteen localities in some of the largest and least accessible country in Scotland. Owing to the varying occupations of the men, 75% were Gaelic-speaking, three training camps were arranged at different times of the year. In addition the corps had to maintain 15 carbine ranges. Many prizes were won by the corps, both in gun practice and repository exercises, at the Scottish National Artillery Association camps - the King's Cup was won at Barry Buddon in 1903 by the Easdale companies. The pipe band consisted of over thirty pipers. ==Territorial Force== When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908Beckett, pp. 247‚Äì53.Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. the bulk of the personnel of the 1st Argyll & Bute RGA (V) formed IV (4th) Highland (Mountain) Brigade, RGA, while the remainder formed one company of the Forth and Clyde Royal Garrison Artillery. The new brigade, which included the Lochcarron, Ross-shire, company from the former Highland Artillery Volunteers, was the only TF mountain artillery unit. It formed part of the Highland Division and had the following organisation:Litchfield, pp. 276‚Äì7.London Gazette 20 March 1908.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 101‚Äì7.51st (H) Division at Long, Long Trail.51st (H) Division at Regimental Warpath. 10-Pounder mountain gun preserved at the Royal Artillery Museum. IV Highland (Mountain) Brigade, RGA * HQ at Russell Street, Rothesay * Argyllshire (Mountain) Bty at Campbelltown * Ross and Cromarty (Mountain) Bty at Lochcarron * Buteshire (Mountain) Bty at Rothesay * 4th Highland (Mountain) Ammunition Column at Tarbert The batteries were equipped with the 10-pounder mountain gun,Becke, Pt 1, pp. 117‚Äì24. a 2.75-inch calibre 'screw gun' originally developed for the Indian Army's mountain batteries. ==World War I== ===Mobilisation=== The Highland Division received a warning order for mobilisation on 29 July 1914, and the order to mobilise was received at 17.35 on 4 August. IV Highland Mtn Bde arrived at Bedford on 10 August, where the division concentrated over the following days. During the winter of 1914‚Äì15 a number of units left the division to join other formations in the field. On 10 March 1915 IV Highland Mtn Bde (except the Bute Bty) transferred to the 29th Division. This was a new division formed mainly from Regular Army units returned from stations round the Empire, and was allocated to the forthcoming Dardanelles operation. The battery left from Avonmouth Docks on 16 March, bound for Malta and then Alexandria, where it disembarked.29th Division at Long, Long Trail.29th Division at Regimental Warpath. ===Gallipoli=== Sgt Paterson, 4th Highland (Mountain) Brigade, with 10-pdr mountain gun ca 1915. 29th Division re-embarked at Alexandria and landed at Cape Helles on the Gallipoli Peninsula at 07.00 on 25 April 1915. IV Highland Mtn Bde and its two batteries served through the difficult opening weeks of the campaign with 29th Division, including the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battles of Krithia and the Battle of Gully Ravine, before transferring to 11th (Northern) Division on 29 July. The 11th was a newly arrived formation of 'Kitchener's Army' volunteers recruited since the outbreak of war. It was concentrating on the island of Imbros for a fresh landing on the peninsula at Suvla Bay, which was carried out on 7 August. This landing was no more successful than the first, and the campaign bogged down again. Once at Suvla the Argyll Battery transferred to the command of another Kitchener formation, the 10th (Irish) Division, on 8 August, followed by the rest of the brigade on 13 August.Becke, Pt 3a, pp. 19‚Äì25.Becke, Pt 3a, pp. 11‚Äì18. The IV Highland Bde fought with 10th (I) Division through the campaign, including the Battle of Hill 60 and the following trench warfare. When the division was withdrawn on 30 September the artillery, including IV Highland Bde, remained in action until the final evacuation of Suvla on the night of 19/20 December, when every gun was successfully withdrawn without loss. Men of the IV (Highland) Mountain Brigade with 2.75-inch mountain gun at Kamberli, Salonika, June 1918. ===Salonika=== After the evacuations from Gallipoli, the troops were transported back to Egypt for rest and reorganisation. The IV Highland Bde was classed as 'Army Troops' with the Egyptian Expeditionary Force in the Suez Canal defences. In September 1916 the brigade was sent to Salonika as reinforcements for the Macedonian front. The Bute Battery, which had remained behind in Scotland and later England with the second line troops of the Highland Division (later the 64th (2nd Highland) Division), sailed direct from England to Salonika, disembarking on 20 September.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 55‚Äì9.'Mountain Batteries, RGA', The National Archives, file WO 95/5494/1. Each mountain battery in Macedonia had four of the improved 2.75-inch mountain guns.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, Annex 1. The Macedonian Front was another area of stationary trench warfare until late in the war, when the final offensive began on 1 September 1918. IV Highland Bde and its batteries were allocated to different formations as required. The brigade was with 28th Division from December 1916 until 22 July 1918, when the Bute Bty went to 27th Division. The rest of the brigade left 28th Division on 10 September to come under XVI Corps before joining 26th Division on 23 September. The Bute Bty left 27th Division on 8 September when it went to XVI Corps, returning on 23 September. On 25 September the battery rejoined IV Highland Bde, which had left 26th Division and was then operating with 14th Greek Division as the campaign came to a successful end.Becke, Pt 1, pp. 97‚Äì103.Becke, Pt 1, pp. 105-11.Becke, Pt 3a, pp. 143‚Äì9. ==Interwar== The unit reformed in 1920 under the command of Lt-Col W.H. Macalpine-Leny, DSO, as the 26th Highland Pack Brigade, RGA with HQ at the Drill Hall at Tarbert. The Bute Bty (initially listed as 102 (Howitzer) (Bute) Pack Bty) had a Cadet Corps affiliated to it. The TF was reorganised as the Territorial Army (TA) in 1921 and; the RGA was subsumed into the Royal Artillery (RA) in 1924. The brigade (which was the only 'pack' unit in the TA) changed its number to 13th, with the following organisation: * HQ, Drill Hall, Tarbert * 49 (Argyll) Bty, Drill Hall, Oban * 50 (Bute) Bty, Drill Hall, Rothesay * 51 (Ross) Bty, Drill Hall, Stornoway The brigade changed its designation again from 'Pack' to 'Light' in 1927, but it underwent a more fundamental reorganisation in 1936 when it was converted into a field artillery unit as 54th (West Highland) Army Field Brigade: * HQ, Drill Hall, Tarbert * 214 (Argyll) Bty, Campbeltown * 215 (Bute) Bty, Drill Hall, Rothesay * 219 (Ross) Bty, Drill Hall, Stornoway * 371 (Oban) Bty, Drill Hall, Oban However, this was short-lived: by the late 1930s a need for specialist anti-tank (A/T) artillery had been recognised, and in 1938 the regiment (as RA brigades were termed from that year onwards) became the first such unit in the TA as 51st (West Highland) Anti-Tank Regiment. ==World War II== ===Mobilisation=== The TA was doubled in size following the Munich Crisis of 1938, with existing units splitting to form duplicates before the outbreak of World War II. 51st A/T Regiment reorganised as follows:Scottish Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files. 51st (West Highland) A/T Rgt 51 (WH) A/T Rgt at RA 1939‚Äì45. * RHQ at 130 George Street, Oban * 201 (Argyll) A/T Bty at Campbeltown * 202 (Bute) A/T Bty at Rothesay * 203 (Ross) A/T Bty at Stornoway * 204 (Oban) A/T Bty at Oban204 & 242 Oban A/T Btys at 51st HD website. 61st (West Highland) A/T Rgt 61 (WH) A/T Rgt at RA 1939‚Äì45. * RHQ at Rothesay * 241 (Highland) A/T Bty * 242 (Oban) A/T Bty * 243 A/T Bty * 244 A/T Bty The establishment of an A/T battery at this time was 12 x 2-pounder guns organised in Troops of four guns.Ellis France and Flanders, Appendix I. ===51st (West Highland) A/T Regiment=== 51st (West Highland) Anti- Tank Rgt mobilised at Oban under Lt-Col C.N. Roney-Dougal, MC, a Regular RA officer, and trained at Bordon Camp before crossing to France on 2 February 1940 to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) with 51st (Highland) Division.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 16. On 22 April the division was sent for a tour of duty with 3rd French Army on the Saar Front, and took over a section of the line in front of the Maginot Line forts by 6 May.Joslen, pp. 83‚Äì4.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter II.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 21.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter XVII. ====Battle of France==== The Battle of France began on 10 May with the German invasion of the Low Countries. While the rest of the BEF responded by executing the pre-arranged Plan D and advanced to defend Belgium, 51st (H) Division stayed on the Saar Front, which remained quiet until 13 May. At 04.00 that morning the Germans began a heavy bombardment, and strong probing attacks were driven off. Attacks on the following days were half-hearted. On the night of 22/23 May the division was relieved in the line. By now German troops had reached Boulogne and cut off most of the BEF, and 51st (H) Division was ordered to move west to link up with the British 1st Armoured Division operating south of the Somme.Farndale, Years of Defeat, pp. 85‚Äì6. 51st (H) Division held the line of the Bresle, but was very stretched: one battery of 51st (WH) A/T Rgt had to cover of the river. Attacks by the division against a German bridgehead over the Somme were unsuccessful, and at 04.00 on 5 June the enemy attacked all along the division's front. The Bresle line was outflanked by German Panzers racing for Rouen, and the division received orders to withdraw during the night of 8/9 June.Ellis, France and Flanders, Chapter XIX.Farndale, Years of Defeat, pp. 87‚Äì9. During 9 June the division was cut off, and that night an ad hoc brigade group formed at Arques-la-Bataille and known as Arkforce was sent back to protect the approaches to Le Havre, where Operation Cycle was under way to evacuate base troops. Arkforce was formed around 154th Infantry Brigade and accompanied by 204 (Oban) A/T Bty. It set off during the night of 9/10 June, but shortly after it arrived the rest of 51st (H) Division was cut off from Le Havre. The division moved back to Saint-Valery-en-Caux where there was a chance that it could be evacuated. But Erwin Rommel's 7th Panzer Division broke through to the cliffs overlooking the harbour. 201 (Argyll) Bty fought furiously to prevent this, but one by one its guns were put out of action. 51st (Highland) Division was forced to surrender on 12 June. All of 51st (WH) Anti-Tank Regiment except 204 (Oban) Bty became prisoners of war and the regiment ceased to exist.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter XX.Farndale, Years of Defeat, pp. 89‚Äì91.Surrender at St Valery at 51st HD website.Henry Owens' account of his capture at 51st HD website. ===204 (Oban) Anti-Tank Battery=== Arkforce was successfully evacuated from Le Havre the day after the surrender of the rest of the division at St Valery. 204 (Oban) Bty was under the command of Maj Donald Carmichael, who refused to allow the men to embark until their precious 2-pdrs were safely aboard. Arkforce was taken first to Cherbourg, where a new BEF was to be formed, then evacuated to the UK on 15 June (Operation Aerial) after that attempt was abandoned.Farndale, Years of Defeat, pp. 89‚Äì93.Joslen, p. 341. Back in the UK, 204 became an independent A/T Bty with 29th Independent Infantry Brigade Group, a new formation made up of Regular infantry battalions brought back from India. As one of the few fully equipped formations in the UK, the brigade served with XII Corps in the most threatened area of South East England during the 'invasion summer' of 1940, then in the West Sussex County Division along the South Coast from November 1940. When the West Sussex Division moved away in February 1941, 29th Bde remained guarding the South Coast under IV Corps and South Eastern Command. 204 (Oban) Bty left on 5 May 1941 when the brigade came under War Office control to prepare for overseas service.Collier, Maps 17 & 20.Joslen, pp. 116, 276, 542‚Äì4. 204 (Oban) Independent A/T Bty was with 1st (Guards) Independent Brigade Group between 11 April and 5 August 1942.Joslen, p. 225. When that brigade was assigned to 78th Division assembling for Operation Torch, the battery transferred on 5 August to 1st Airborne Division. On 23 October 1942 it was redesignated 2 (Oban) Air-Landing A/T Bty, equipped (with 6-pounder A/T guns) and trained for glider operations.Joslen pp. 104‚Äì5.2 A/L A/T Bty at Paradata website. The emblem of British Airborne Forces, Bellerophon riding the flying horse Pegasus. ====Air-landing battery==== The battery served with 1st Airborne in the Tunisian Campaign, but its participation in the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky) was cancelled at the last minute. A shortage of transport aircraft for the invasion of mainland Italy meant that 1st Airborne Division landed by sea at Taranto (Operation Slapstick); although the landing was unopposed, the battery suffered heavy casualties (the battery commander, Maj James Wilson, one other officer and 22 other ranks (ORs) when the mine-layer it was travelling aboard (HMS Abdiel) struck a mine in Taranto harbour and sank.Molony, Vol V, pp. 242‚Äì3. 1st Airborne Division was withdrawn from Italy in the Autumn of 1943 and prepared for operations in North West Europe. The division was not called upon in the invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord). A number of airborne operations were planned and cancelled before the attempt to 'bounce' the bridges up to and across the lower Rhine (Operation Market Garden) was launched. Just beforehand, 2 (Oban) A/L A/T Bty was issued with some of the newer 17-pounder A/T guns: one 6-pdr Troop was converted and three additional 17-pdr Troops organised. The new gun could be transported in the large Hamilcar glider. During the operation that battery flew in eight Hamilcars and 24 Horsa gliders from RAF Tarrant Rushton and participated in the Battle of Arnhem. After the failure of the operation, one officer and 58 ORs were evacuated across the river out of 158 who had gone in. The battery commander, Maj A.F. Haynes was among those taken prisoner. The reduced 1st Airborne Division did not see action again, but it was sent to liberate Norway after VE Day (Operation Doomsday). By then the battery had been combined with the other A/L batteries into a new 1st Airlanding A/T Rgt. It was disbanded in November 1945 after returning from Norway.Farndale, Years of Defeat. Annex M. ===61st (West Highland) A/T Regiment=== 61st (West Highland) Anti-Tank Rgt mobilised at Rothesay in 9th (Highland) Infantry Division, the 2nd Line duplicate of 51st (H) Division. It remained training in Scottish Command until 7 August 1940 when 9th (H) Division was redesignated as 51st (H) Division to replace the original formation lost at St Valery.Joslen, p. 55. 244 A/T Battery left the regiment on 22 September and was replaced by 296 A/T Bty on 15 December 1941. The regiment added the 'West Highland' subtitle on 17 February 1942. 296 A/T Battery left on 10 May 1942 and was replaced by 193 A/T/ Bty. After completing training in Scotland, the division sailed for Egypt on 16 June 1942, landing on 12 August.61 A/T Rgt 1944‚Äì45 at WW2 Talk. ====North Africa==== 6-pounder A/T gun and crew in the Western Desert, 1942. The division's first action was the Second Battle of El Alamein, for which the regiment was equipped with 16 x 2-pdrs and 48 of the new Ordnance QF 6-pounder gun.Joslen, p. 572. It moved up during the preceding nights, occupying gun positions and dumping ammunition, and remaining concealed during daylight. The bombardment began at 21.40 on 23 October and the advance began 20 minutes later. 51st (H) Division ran into several centres of resistance and only on the extreme left did it reach its final objective; however, the 'break-in' phase of the battle had started well.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 31, 35‚Äì8. Over following days 51st (H) Division made progress towards its own objective as the 'dog-fight' phase continued. The 'break-out' phase began on the night of 1/2 November with Operation Supercharge, preceded by another powerful barrage. In the early hours of 4 November 51st (H) Division broke through to the Rahman Track, and the Axis forces began to retreat.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 48, 56‚Äì7, 66, 74‚Äì5. 51st (H) Division then took part in the pursuit to El Agheila and Tripoli in January 1943. By 25 February it was past Medenine in Tunisia and facing the Mareth Line. The Axis force made a spoiling attack on 6 March (the Battle of Medenine) but there was plenty of warning. 51st (H) Division was positioned along the Wadi Zassar, a natural anti-tank ditch, and the A/T guns had been positioned to 'kill tanks' rather than protect the infantry from them. The Axis advance was easily repulsed.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 107, 223‚Äì4, 232, 234‚Äì6, 316, 320, 324‚Äì6.Horrocks, p. 147. The Battle of the Mareth Line began on the night of 16/17 March when 51st (H) Division took the outpost line against negligible opposition. The main attack followed on 20/21 March with another massive night barrage, but little progress was made over the Wadi Zigzaou for the first two days and the line held until it was outflanked by other forces in the south. The Axis defence collapsed on 28 March and the following day 51st (H) Division was on its way to Gab√®s.Horrocks, pp. 148‚Äì55.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 335, 338‚Äì41, 353. The next Axis defence line was along Wadi Akarit. The barrage for 51st (H) Division's assault began at 04.15 on 6 April, and the division's attack, in the words of the Official History, 'went like clockwork'. 61st (WH) Anti-Tank Rgt went into action with its 6-pdrs towed by tanks while the gun crews rode on the back of the tanks with their ammunition. The tanks then formed a protective screen while the A/T gunners dug in under shellfire. For the first time the regiment encountered Tiger tanks, but these remained out of range of the 6-pdrs using their longer range guns to shell the Highlanders. Axis troops then began counter-attacks and the Highlanders had to fight hard to hold their gains. Some A/T guns got through to support 7th Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (A&SH;), but not to 7th Bn Black Watch, who were isolated away. However, the positions were held.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 364‚Äì7, 370‚Äì2.61 (WH) A/T Rgt reminiscences of Wadi Akarit, at 51st HD website. The pursuit was resumed the following day, through Sfax. From 22 April the division was in action in the hills around Enfidaville, until the end of the campaign on 15 May.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, p. 377. ====Sicily==== 51st (H) Division then went into training for the Allied landings in Sicily (Operation Husky). Together with its 6-pdrs the regiment was issued with a few of the new 17-pounder A/T guns on the stop-gap Pheasant carriage (adapted from the 25-pounder field gun).61 (WH) A/T Rgt in Sicily, at 51st HD website. 51st (H) Division sailed in the invasion convoy from Sfax on 8 July and the assault brigade (154 Bde) landed near Pachino at 03.00 on 10 July. There was little opposition and 241 A/T Bty's guns were got ashore and deployed at pre-arranged sites in the morning. The larger Landing Ships, Tank, arrived about 12.00 and the rest of the regiment went ashore that night. 242 A/T Battery was assigned to 153 Bde and 243 Bty to 152 Bde, while 193 A/T Bty remained with RHQ as divisional reserve. The division then moved forward to Vizzini and Francofonte, where it met its first opposition on 13 July. 243 A/T Bty fired the first rounds of the campaign at a pillbox with great effect, and thereafter the divisional policy was to have A/T guns well up with ths infantry as close assault guns for use against pillboxes and machine gun posts in houses.Molony, Vol V, pp. 61, 78, 82, 93. The division continued with scarcely a pause towards the Dittaino river, where it sent a composite force of infantry and armour ('Arrow Force') accompanied by 243 AT Bty to cross the Dittaino and attempt to capture Patern√≤. It achieved a bridgehead on 17 July but further advance was checked, so on the night of 20/21 July the division made an attack against the main enemy defences at Gerbini Airfield. 7th A&SH; made the attack supported by A Trp and half of B Trp (Pheasants) and some tanks. Although the attack succeeded, fierce counter-attacks by the Hermann Goring Division drove the Highlanders out the following morning, after which 51st (H) Division was put onto the defensive. Further counter-attacks and heavy shelling on 23/24 July led to more casualties. Because of casualties in men and guns 193 A/T Bty made use of three captured German 75 mm A/T guns and H Trp was immobilised to keep the others up to strength.Molony, Vol V, pp. 115‚Äì7. The division was relieved on 30 July and redeployed for operations against Adrano (the battles round Etna). The A/T guns were assembled at Sferro under fire, so that they could be quickly deployed as soon as the infantry were on their objectives. 51st (H) Division took its new bridgeheads over the Dittaino on the night of 31 July/1 August and the A/T guns were in action by daylight. Enemy armour put in a counter-attack at 14.00 and a few tanks got close enough to be destroyed by the A/T guns.Molony, Vol V, pp. 150‚Äì2, 158‚Äì9. Patern√≤ fell on 4 August, Biancavilla on 6 August, and the division began a 'sidestep' north of Zafferana on 12 August. By now the Axis forces were evacuating Sicily, which was completed on 17 August. During the Sicily campaign the regiment lost 1 officer and 5 ORs killed, 1 officer and 40 ORs wounded, and 2 ORs missing.Molony, Vol V, p. 179. 51st (H) Division did not take part in the subsequent Italian Campaign, having been earmarked for Operation Overlord. ====Normandy==== 17-pounder A/T gun and crew in Normandy 1944. 51st (Highland) Division was in the first follow-up wave of formations in Overlord. On 2 June 1944 it embarked at East India Docks, London, bound for Normandy and began landing on 7 June (D + 1).Ellis, Normandy, pp. 79, 247‚Äì50. The first troops ashore on D + 1 included 242 A/T Bty with 153 Bde Gp and the 17-pdr Trp of 193 A/T Bty with Divisional troops.Overlord Ops order at 51st HD website. The division then got bogged down for several weeks in operations round 'The Triangle' north-east of Caen.The Triangle at 51st HD website. It then supported 3rd Division's attack on the flank of Operation Goodwood on 18 July.Ellis, Normandy, p. 343. On 8 August 51st (H) Division spearheaded II Canadian Corps' attack towards Falaise (Operation Totalize). The attack began before dawn and by first light the break-in was going well, with a number of villages taken. 4th Canadian and 1st Polish Armoured Divisions then passed through to continue the advance.Ellis, Normandy, pp. 419‚Äì24. Breakout at 51st HD website.Totalise at 51st HD website.Totalise accounts at 51st HD website. The Canadians renewed the advance to Falaise on 14 August in Operation Tractable, with 51st (H) Division attacking towards the Laison Valley on the left flank. By 21 August the Falaise Pocket had been closed and the division was advancing eastwards towards Lisieux.Ellis, Normandy, pp. 430‚Äì1, 449. It was then sent across the Seine to liberate St Valery, site of the original division's surrender in 1940.St Valery at 51st HD website. 51st (H) Division then moved in for the assault on Le Havre (Operation Astonia). This was a major operation, with heavy air and artillery bombardment and armoured support, which cowed the opposition. It was followed by a similar assault to take Boulogne (Operation Wellhit), and operations to mask Dunkirk.Ellis, Germany, pp. 14‚Äì5.Lindsay, pp. 76‚Äì81.Le Havre at 51st HD website.Dunkirk at 51st HD website. ====Low Countries==== The division next made a long move to the Antwerp area at the end of September, then spent three weeks in the line at Sint-Oedenrode.Lindsay, pp. 82‚Äì95.Low Countries at 51st HD website. 61st (WH) Anti-Tank Rgt was deployed to cover the chain of bridges captured during Operation Market Garden, engaging occasional targets such as occupied houses or with long-range harassing fire. On 13 October 193 Bty helped drive off a 'small but well organised' German attack with their A/T guns and Bren guns, while 241 Bty contributed fire from 2-inch mortars. The regiment also practised assault river crossings, using stormboats to ferry Jeep-towed 6-pdrs and improvised pontoons with outboard motors to carry 17-pdrs and Quad tractors.61 A/T Rgt war diary at RA Netherlands. On 23 October the regiment took part in Operation Colin, a divisional attack on Schijndel.Operation Colin at 51st HD website. Schijndel was taken relatively easily and the division pressed on to take Vught on 25 October.Vught at 51st HD website. On 4 November the division began an operation against 'The Island' west of 's-Hertogenbosch with a crossing of the Afwaterings Canal. Deception shoots were carried out by 193 Bty on the right flank and by 243 Bty on the left flank, including giving covering fire from 12 Bren guns for the infantry crossing.The Island at 51st HD website.Aftwaterings crossing at 51st HD website.Ellis, Germany, pp. 126‚Äì7. On 14 November the division carried out an assault crossing of the Willems Canal near Weert (Operation Ascot), then moved on to the Zig Canal and crossed that on 17 November with much less preparation. Once the canal had been bridged, 61st (WH) A/T Rgt's guns were deployed to defend the bridgehead, helped through the bad conditions by being towed by Kangaroo armoured personnel carriers.Ellis, Germany, p. 160.Lindsay, pp. 116‚Äì24.Operation Ascot at 51st HD website. 51st (H) Division was then tasked with holding the wet low-lying country between Nijmegen and Arnhem that had been captured during Operation Market Garden, some of which subsequently had to be evacuated (Operation Noah) when the Germans broke the dykes and flooded the area. At the beginning of December the division was pulled out of the line for rest.Ellis, Germany, p. 237.Lindsay, pp. 124‚Äì37.Operation Noah at 51st HD website. In December the division was suddenly moved south as part of the response to the German breakthrough in the Ardennes (the Battle of the Bulge), and then in January 51st (H) Division fought its way into the flank of the 'Bulge' in winter conditions.Horrocks, pp. 238‚Äì41.Lindsay, pp. 138, 141, 150‚Äì64.Ardennes at 51st HD website.Ronchamps at 51st HD website.La Roche at 51st HD website.Ardennes ‚Äì subsequent operations at 51st HD website. Archer SP 17-pdr. In the winter of 1944‚Äì45 the A/T batteries of infantry divisions were restructured to have one Troop each of towed 6-pdrs, towed 17-pdrs and Archer self-propelled (SP) 17-pdrs on Valentine tank chassis. ====Rhineland==== 51st (H) Division was next engaged in the fighting in the Reichswald (Operation Veritable). It began at 05.00 on 8 February with a huge artillery preparation, after which the Highlanders attacked and were on their objectives by 23.00 that night. 61st (WH) A/T Rgt's batteries were as usual attached to the infantry brigades (and 193 Bde with RHQ), but the guns were not actually needed. On 10 February the SP Trp of 242 Bty came into action against enemy machine gun posts and houses, though several Archers of 242 and 243 Btys were bogged or damaged by enemy A/T fire. The slow advance continued through Gennep on 11 February, and the gunners suffered from enemy shellfire. One of the regiment's officers reconnoitring in a Valentine observation post (OP) tank on 12 February attacked and drove off an enemy party in the forest. On 13 February the SP guns destroyed a tank and a church steeple at Hekkens used as an enemy OP, while other gunners drove off local attacks by German paratroopers with small arms fire. On 16 February 243 Bty's SP and towed 17-pdrs supported a night attack by 152 Bde on Asperden. The final phase of the operation for 51st (H) Division began on 18 February against Goch, which was successfully taken after stiff fighting.Horrocks, pp. 248‚Äì55.Ellis, Germany, pp. 258‚Äì67.Lindsay, pp. 173‚Äì208.Reichswald at 51st HD website.Hekkens at 51st HD website.Goch at 51st HD website. An Archer 17-pdr SP gun of 61st (WH) A/T Rgt being rafted across the Rhine The division took a leading part in the Rhine crossing (Operation Plunder). The division then continued through Isselburg and Anholt.Ellis, Germany, pp. 288‚Äì92.Horrocks, p. 257.Lindsay, p. 218.Saunders, pp. 46, 66‚Äì7, 195‚Äì218.Rhine at 51st HD website. The division reached the Dortmund‚ÄìEms Canal on 8 April. After a pause at the canal, it advanced rapidly towards Bremen against delaying actions. It reached Delmenhorst on 20 April and closed in on the centre of Bremen. The German surrender at L√ºneburg Heath ended the fighting on 5 May.Ellis, Germany, pp. 307, 311‚Äì2, 316, 339‚Äì40.Horrocks, pp. 262‚Äì6.Lindsay, pp. 237‚Äì54. Advance on Bremen at 51st HD website.Victory 1945 at 51st HD website. 61st (WH) A/T Rgt was disbanded in 1947. ==Postwar== When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the regiment reformed as 254th (West Highland) Anti-Tank Regiment with HQ at Dumbarton, forming part of 51st/52nd (Lowland) Division.Litchfield, Appendix 5.Watson, TA 1947.235‚Äì265 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on. In 1950 the regiment re-roled as 254th (West Highland) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment.Litchfield, p. 282. In 1954 it absorbed 417th (Dumbartonshire) (Mixed) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Rgt (originally the Clyde RGA, to which the 1st Argyll & Bute Artillery Volunteers had contributed personnel). The combined regiment reverted to being 254th (West Highland) A/T Rgt, with one battery from the 417th.414‚Äì443 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on. Finally, on 10 March 1955 the regiment was amalgamated into the Greenock-based 277th (Highland) Field Rgt and the Argyll & Bute lineage ended. ==Uniforms & insignia== The original uniforms varied greatly. Colonel F. Campbell (commanding 1884-1903) wrote:'The corps had their separate uniforms, which were tunics or Garibaldi shirts, caps with red, yellow, or white bands ; belts brown, black, or white. The officers' dress was even more varied. They joined simply to encourage the movement, and wore much what they chose, utilising any old uniform that they might have worn some time or other, whether cavalry, infantry, or other. Swords of all patterns, perhaps presentations to their forefathers before and after Waterloo'. In 1860 the 3rd Corps had blue uniforms with scarlet facings, white pouch belts, black waistbelts, and busbies. The 4th Corps wore a jumper and trousers of blue flannel, and a broad Kilmarnock bonnet, such as was usually worn by Tarbert fishermen, of whom it was mainly composed.Grierson, Plate V. On the creation of the TF in 1908 IV Highland (Mtn) Bde adopted the usual brass shoulder titles consisting of 'T' over 'RGA' over the territorial designation, but in this case the three batteries adopted individual titles: T/RGA/ARGYLL, T/RGA/ROSS&CROMARTY; and T/RGA/BUTE. While serving in Macedonia in 1916 IV Mtn Bde was issued with Balmoral bonnets for officers and Kilmarnock bonnets for ORs. Tartan flashes were worn behind the RA gun badge, each battery having a different tartan: * HQ Bty: Royal Stewart * Argyll Bty: Campbell * Ross Bty: Hunting Stewart * Bute Bty: Mackenzie ==Commanding Officers== The following served as Commanding Officer (CO) of the units: * Major-General J.
