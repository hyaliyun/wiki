He later hosted the Tuesday night UKG show, but on 4 November 2015 it was announced that he would be replaced by a new DJ called Jamz Supernova who would be playing R&B.; The music Cameo produces varies from 2-step vocals, to 4x4, to grime, and sublow. In 2004, Cameo was voted winner of the \\"Best Newcomer\\" Award for the garage scene's 2004 Peoples Choice Awards held in London. Cameo also received two back to back awards on behalf of Uptown Records, winner of best record shop. == Biography == DJ Cameo began his DJing career in 1997 playing in local bars and clubs in West London. His main influences at that time were Tuff Jam, EZ and the Dreem Teem. In March 1999, Cameo landed a set on London's 92.5 Taste FM alongside MCs Mr. Kaos and Double G, together collectively known as The Specialist Crew and later Special Edition. In their weekly 4pm‚Äì6pm Sunday show, they were amongst the early pioneers of a changing scene and introduced the concept of 'radio raving' with 2 MCs effectively 'bringing a rave into your living room'. This allowed Cameo to be heard on the UK underground music scene and to gain experience in working on a radio station. With success on Taste FM, Cameo also featured on other pirate stations such as Delight FM, Ice FM and Lush FM. In 2001, he secured a job at Uptown Records, a European underground music store and has since been promoted to head buyer for the UK garage department. That same year, Cameo teamed up with Danny C and MC Viper to produce \\"Addicted\\". Cameo then got involved with producer J-Sweet to produce the underground track \\"Hi Grade\\" featuring Mr. Kaos and Double G that was then signed to the MOBO 2002 compilation, and more recently the 2003 garage anthem \\"Original Bad Girl Style\\" featuring Gemma Fox for Ministry of Sound's Street Beats compilation. In October 2005, Cameo started his own label, On A Level, and Kamikaze Recordings working with artists such as Jon E Cash, DaVinChe, Terror Danger, P-Jam, Dexplicit, Vital, Delinquent, TnT, J-Sweet, IMP, Jiggalo, Black Jack and Scandalous. Also in 2005, the Garage Anthems CD compilation, mixed by Cameo was released on Virgin Records. Cameo went on to become head A&R; of Def Jam mobile, a ringtone company offering UK and US tracks for download. That same year, Cameo promoted his Hot Off The Block Grime Allstars concert tour alongside Rebecka Prochnik. It showcased established and new UKG talent in a live concert format enabling fans around the world to truly experience the UKG phenomena on their doorstep. A world tour was set up with dates in New York, Germany, Spain, Sweden and Paris. The UK was also covered with dates at Glastonbury Festival, V Festival, Cargo and various universities. The tour included acts such as Crazy Titch & J2K, Lethal B, Roll Deep, JME, Skepta, Bruza, No Lay, L Man, Purple and Tinchy Stryder, to name a few. It aimed to take the UKG scene to another level providing artists and producers with unlimited global exposure. In early 2006, on behalf of 1xtra and BBC Radio 3, Cameo hosted Urban Classic, a music event which brought urban street stars such as Bruza Purple Pace Tor, Faith Sfx and Davinche together with the BBC Symphony Orchestra for a performance at the Hackney Empire. Cameo also appeared on the TV drama series Dubplate Drama. ==Discography== *Garage Anthems 2005 *The Sound of the Pirates *DJ Cameo Presents Bassline ==References *DJ Cameo playing on Taste FM on YouTube *Taste FM 92.5 on YouTube *Interview With Underground Kulture Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Black British radio presenters Category:Grime music artists Category:UK garage musicians Category:BBC Radio 1Xtra presenters Category:English people of Saint Lucian descent ","title":"DJ Cameo"},{"id":"20207665","text":"Treasure Coast Square is a shopping mall in Martin County, Florida, United States. It comprises 115 stores, including anchor stores Dillard's, JCPenney, and Macy's, as well as a food court and Regal 16-screen movie theater. The mall is managed by Simon Property Group, and opened in 1987. ==History== The mall opened in 1987 with original anchor tenants J. C. Penney, Jordan Marsh, and Lord & Taylor. The mall's opening caused the decline of the existing Martin Square Mall in nearby Martin, from which J. C. Penney relocated, and Boca Mall (now known as Mizner Park) in Boca Raton. At the time of opening, the latter two stores included the only escalators in Martin County. A 1989 expansion brought Sears, while a second expansion in 1993 added a Dillard's department store. When Lord & Taylor closed its location at the mall in 1990, its space became Mervyns.http://articles.sun- sentinel.com/1990-11-20/business/9002260549_1_lord-taylor-taylor-sites-five- stores The Mervyns store closed in 1997 and, although Simon Property Group was initially in talks to convert the space to Bed Bath & Beyond, the space instead became a Borders Books & Music. Also, the Jordan Marsh converted to Burdines and then to Macy's. After Borders went out of business in 2011, the space became an hhgregg electronics store which closed in 2017.https://www.tcpalm.com/story/money/business/bargainista/2017/03/08/more- store-closings/98849866/ The opening of the mall attracted nearly 800,000 square feet of new retail development in its area in the first ten years of opening. On November 8, 2018, it was announced that Sears will be closing this location in early 2019 as part of a plan to close 40 stores.https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/08/sears-to-shut-40-more-stores-early- next-year.html ==References External links == * Treasure Coast Square Mall home page Category:Simon Property Group Category:Shopping malls in Florida Category:Buildings and structures in Martin County, Florida Category:Tourist attractions in Martin County, Florida Category:Shopping malls established in 1987 ","title":"Treasure Coast Square"},{"id":"20207671","text":"Gabaculine is a naturally occurring neurotoxin first isolated from the bacteria Streptomyces toyacaensis, which acts as a potent and irreversible GABA transaminase inhibitor, and also a GABA reuptake inhibitor.Allan RD, Johnston GAR, Twitchin B. Effects of Gabaculine on uptake, binding and metabolism of GABA. Neuroscience Letters. 1977;4:51-54. Gabaculine is also known as 3-amino-2,3-dihydrobenzoic acid hydrochloride and 5-amino cyclohexa-1,3 dienyl carboxylic acid. Gabaculine increased GABA levels in the brain and had an effect on convulsivity in mice. == Mechanism of action == Gabaculine includes a comparable structure to GABA and a dihydrobenzene ring. This comparable GABA structure is used in order to be able to take the place of GABA during the first steps of transamination, including transaldimination and 1,3-prototrophic shift to the pyridoxamine imine. Following this, a proton from the dihydrobenzene ring is abstracted by an enzymatic base, thus causing the ring to become aromatic. The aromatic stabilization energy of the aromatic ring is what causes this reaction to be irreversible, thus causing the complex not to react further. ==Preclinical studies== Animal studies to determine the effect of gabaculine on GABA levels in the brain were heavily conducted around the 1970s. These in vivo studies involved mostly the use of mice that underwent intravenous administration of this drug. Each of these studies concluded that gabaculine has a great potential to increase the GABA levels in the brain of these mice in a time dependent manner. Along with determining the effect of GABA levels, in vivo studies were conducted to investigate the ability of gabaculine to inhibit convulsions in mice. Results indicated that gabaculine provided a clear anticonvulsant effect against seizures induced by high doses of chemoconvulsants or electroshock. The toxicity of this compound was also investigated using animal mouse models. This study showed that at anticonvulsant doses, gabaculine is extremely potent and toxic when compared to other GABA transaminase inhibitors, with an ED50 of 35 mg/kg and of 86 mg/kg. Because of this potential lethal effect, gabaculine was proved to be too toxic for use as a drug however, it can still be used as a compound to alter GABA levels in studies of experimental epilepsy. ==Regulation== Gabaculine has not been approved by the FDA as a pharmaceutical entity; however, it can be used as a chemical compound for research purposes only. This compound is not considered a hazardous substance according to OSHA 29 CFR 1910.1200. ==References== Category:Neurotoxins Category:GABA transaminase inhibitors Category:GABA reuptake inhibitors Category:Amines Category:Carboxylic acids Category:GABA analogues ","title":"Gabaculine"},{"id":"20207678","text":"Ancient Spirit Rising is the fifth album by Domine.

Frison started his professional career at Veneto side Treviso. He played for Treviso's youth set-up from 2000 to 2007 and was part of the Primavera under-20 team since the 2005‚Äì06 season. Frison was primary deployed as the first choice goalkeeper for the Primavera squad, before being promoted to the first team in 2006. He was awarded the number 12 jersey in the first team, and worked as the fourth choice goalkeeper behind Vlada Avramov, Alex Cordaz and Maxminio Montresor. Frison officially graduated from the youth team in June 2007, and was loaned to Lega Pro Prima Divisione side Manfredonia in July 2007. With the Lega Pro Prima Divisione club, Frison was the first choice goalkeeper, ahead of Giacomo Bindi and Manolo Leacche. His performances at the club were not enough to avoid relegation as Manfredonia finished last in Group A and were relegated to the Lega Pro Seconda Divisione as a result. On 30 June 2008, Frison returned to Treviso, and ahead of the 2008‚Äì09 Serie B season, the goalkeeper was retained to the first team, to act as an understudy to Cordaz. On 1 September, however, Frison transferred to fellow Serie B side Vicenza in a co-ownership deal, for ‚Ç¨300,000,Vicenza Calcio S.p.A. bilancio (financial report and accounts) on 30 June 2009 (in Italian), PDF purchased from Italian C.C.I.A.A. and in exchange, veteran Matteo Guardalben moved from Vicenza to Treviso as part of the deal, for ‚Ç¨50,000. Vicenza Frison officially joined Vicenza on the deadline day of the 2008 summer transfer window. At Vicenza, he was awarded the number 1 jersey, and he worked as understudy to veteran goalkeeper, Marco Fortin, but Frison went on to make 8 league appearances that season. In June 2009 Vicenza bought Frison outright from Treviso for an additional ‚Ç¨5,000. Treviso went bankrupted in summer 2009. During the 2009‚Äì10 Serie B campaign, Frison continued as the club's second choice goalkeeper behind Fortin and ahead of Cristian Cicioni and Jos√© Rocchi. On 18 January 2010, Serie A side Genoa signed Frison on a six-month loan deal from Vicenza. In return, Danilo Russo moved to Vicenza in a co-ownership agreement. Once at Genoa, Frison was given the number 1 jersey, and served as the third choice goalkeeper behind Marco Amelia and Alessio Scarpi. Despite making no Serie A appearances for the Ligurian club, Frison played a friendly match for Genoa at the end of season. Frison returned to Vicenza on 30 June 2010, ahead of the 2010‚Äì11 Serie B season. Upon his return to the club, Frison became a regular at the biancorossi, making 12 league starts for the club in this first half of the new season. On 19 January 2011, however, he was loaned out to Frosinone. On 31 January 2011, Pierluigi Frattali transferred from Frosinone to Vicenza, in exchange. During his loan spell with Frosinone, Frison became the first choice keeper, making 17 league appearances. On 30 June 2011, Frison returned to Vicenza following the expiration of the loan deal. Following his return to Vicenza, Frison took the number 88 jersey, and was expected to compete with veteran Paolo Acerbis for a starting spot. He instantly became the club's starting goalkeeper following his return and would go on to become an indispensable part of the team's 2011‚Äì12 squad, making over 45 appearances in all competitions with 41 appearances in the league. In January 2012, Frison was strongly linked with a move to several clubs. Frison remained at Vicenza, but was unable to prevent the club's eventual relegation to the Lega Pro Prima Divisione following the play-off loss on aggregate to Empoli. Catania On 6 July 2012, Frison transferred to Catania in a co-ownership agreement on a five-year contract. The total cost of the transfer was ‚Ç¨650,000,Calcio Catania S.p.A. bilancio (financial report and accounts) on 30 June 2013 (in Italian), PDF purchased from Italian C.C.I.A.A.Vicenza Calcio S.p.A. bilancio (financial report and accounts) on 30 June 2013 (in Italian), PDF purchased from Italian C.C.I.A.A. though fullback Raffaele Imparato transferred to Vicenza as part- exchange for free. Frison was expected to compete with Argentina international Mariano And√∫jar for a starting role following the loan return of Juan Pablo Carrizo to Lazio, the departure of Tom√°≈° Ko≈°ick√Ω to Novara and the expiration of Andrea Campagnolo's contract. Since his arrival at the Sicilian club, Frison has served as a backup to And√∫jar, and has made three appearances in the 2012‚Äì13 Coppa Italia. He would go on to make his Serie A debut, in an away loss to Milan on 28 April 2013, after And√∫jar was handed a three-match suspension from league play. On 5 May 2013, Frison earned his first Serie A clean sheet in a 3‚Äì0 home victory over Siena. In June 2013, Catania signed Frison outright for another ‚Ç¨700,000. Frison became a first choice since mid of 2013‚Äì14 Serie A season. He followed the club relegated to 2014‚Äì15 Serie B. In January 2015 Frison was signed by Serie A club U.C. Sampdoria in a temporary deal. Due to a match-fixing scandal, Catania was relegated to Lega Pro at the start of 2015‚Äì16 season. On 31 August 2015, Serie B newcomer Salernitana signed Frison on loan with an obligation to sign outright at the end of season, as well as Moses Odjer in a temporary deal with an option to sign outright. At the same time Cataina signed keeper Luca Liverani (in a 1-year contract), forwards Andrea Russotto and Caetano Calil in definitive deals. However, on 2 September he was released. Sambenedettese On 4 August 2016 Frison was signed by Sambenedettese in a 1-year contract. ==International career== Frison has been capped for Italy national youth teams since 2004, all in friendly matches. He was named in the 23-man preliminary squad for the 2005 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship, which Italy automatic qualified as host, but was excluded from the 18-men final squad. After Enrico Alfonso was sent off in the group stage of the tournament, Frison was originally eligible for selection to the squad as emergency backup, but was injured. Frison played his only match for the under-18 team in 2005, ahead of Enrico Alfonso and Paolo Tornaghi. He was capped for the Italy under-20 team at the 2007‚Äì08 Four Nations Tournament, and in an unofficial friendly against Serie D Best XI.

On 1 October 2010, Frison received a call-up from the under-21 team for the first time. He participated in both legs of the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship play-off round as an unused substitute. Italy were eliminated and Frison would no longer be eligible to the U21 team of 2011‚Äì13 season, effectively ending his short U21 career. ==Personal life== He is the son of former football goalkeeper Lorenzo Frison, who played professionally for teams such as Palermo and Pescara in the 1970s and the 1980s. ==References * *Profile at Football.it *Profile at La Gazetta dello Sport (2009‚Äì10) *FIGC National Team data * Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:People from the Metropolitan City of Venice Category:Italian footballers Category:Italy youth international footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:A.C.D.

For the book, certain university circles celebrated Margaret Murray as the expert on western witchcraft, though her theories were widely discredited. For the period 1929-1968, she wrote the \\"Witchcraft\\" article in the successive editions of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. In 1962, The Witch-Cult in Western Europe was reprinted by Oxford University Press. Her theory, also known as the witch-cult hypothesis, suggests that the accusations made towards \\"witches\\" in Europe were in fact based on a real existing pagan religion that worshiped a horned god. ==Overview==  Thesis  Murray's theory, as she explained in this book and the subsequent The God of the Witches (1931), consists of the following elements: * Until the 17th century there was a religion, much older than Christianity, which all over Western Europe had supporters both among ordinary people and the ruling classes. * Central to the worship stood a horned god with two faces, known to the Romans as Janus or Dianus. (This cult of Dianus was of the type James Frazer described in detail in The Golden Bough). * The horned god represented the cycle of seasons and harvests. It was believed that he died and periodically returned to life. * On earth, the horned god was represented by chosen human beings. There were some celebrities among them, such as William Rufus, Thomas Becket, Joan of Arc and Gilles de Rais. They all died a tragic death as a ritual sacrifice to insure the resurrection of the god and the renewal of the earth. * In the villages the witches‚Äô meetings were presided over by the horned god. Christian observers of these events might have thought the witches were worshiping the devil, when in reality they were celebrating the pre-Christian god Dianus. * The preservation of this ancient religion was entrusted to a variety of indigenous peoples, small in stature, who were driven out from their land with each new invasion. This would also explain the stories about fairies, gnomes and other ‚Äòsmall people‚Äô. These creatures were very shy but were able to pass the knowledge of their religion to ordinary people. The witches were their pupils and thus the heirs of the ancient religion. * According to Murray, the (local) covens consisted of thirteen members: twelve ordinary men and women, and an officer. All members were required to hold a weekly meeting (named 'esbat' by Murray) and to attend the larger Sabbats. * There was a strict discipline in the covens, and whoever missed a meeting could be severely punished and was sometimes put to death. * The organization and structure were so good that Christianity had to wait until the Reformation before getting a stronger grip on the population. A blatant attack on the influential rival was needed, and that occurred with the great witch persecutions. Origins Murray's Witch-cult hypothesis was preceded by a similar idea proposed by the German Professor Karl Ernst Jarcke in 1828. Jarcke's hypothesis claimed that the victims of the early modern witch trials were not innocents caught up in a moral panic, but members of a previously unknown pan-European pagan religion which had pre-dated Christianity, been persecuted by the Christian Church as a rival religion, and finally driven underground, where it had survived in secret until being revealed in the confessions of those accused in the witch trials. The idea was later endorsed by German historian Franz Josef Mone and French historian Jules Michelet. In the late 19th century, variations on the witch cult hypothesis were adopted by two Americans, Matilda Joslyn Gage and Charles Leland, the latter of whom promoted it in his 1899 book Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches. Interpretation of witch trial evidence Murray was interested in ascribing naturalistic or religious/ceremonial explanations to some of the more fantastical descriptions found in early modern witch trial records. Murray suggested, based in part on the work of James Frazer in The Golden Bough, that the witches accused in the trials worshiped a pre-Christian god associated with forests and the natural world. Murray identified this god as Janus (or Dianus, following Frazer's suggested etymology), who she described as a \\"Horned God\\" of the wilds in order to explain descriptions of a horned Satan provided by witch trial confessions. Because those accused of witchcraft often described witches meetings as involving sexual orgies with Satan, she suggested that a male priest representing Dianus would have been present at each coven meeting, dressed in horns and animals skins, who engaged in sexual acts with the gathered women. Murray further interpreted descriptions of sexual intercourse with Satan as being cold and painful to mean that the priest would often use artificial implements on the witches when he became too exhausted to continue. Unlike most modern forms of religious witchcraft, Murray's conception of the witch-cult was therefore strictly patriarchal. In her hypothesis, witches worshiped a single god, and though a female figure in a role known as \\"the Maiden\\" would be present at coven gatherings, Murray did not consider her to represent a goddess. In this way, Murray's hypothesis, which had been based primarily of her interpretations of witch trial records, differed strongly from Leland's belief in a goddess-centered witch-cult focused on Diana and Aradia, derived from supposed rural Italian folk practices. One key aspect of Murray's witch-cult hypothesis, later adopted by Wicca, was the idea that not only were historical accounts of witches based in truth, but witches had originally been involved in benevolent fertility -related functions rather than malevolent hexing and cursing as traditionally portrayed. In examining testimony from the early modern witch trials, Murray encountered numerous examples of the kinds of curses and nefarious activities the accused people confessed to. Seeking to fit these into a framework in which descriptions of witchcraft had both a natural and pagan-religious explanation, Murray posited that these malevolent actions were actually twisted interpretations of benevolent actions, altered either under duress during the trials, or by practitioners themselves who had, over the years, forgotten or changed the \\"original\\" intent of their practices. For example, Murray interpreted Isobel Gowdie's confession to cursing a farm field by setting loose a toad pulling a miniature plough as originally having been not a curse on the field as Gowdie stated, but a means of ensuring fertility of the crops. Murray stated that these acts were \\"misunderstood by the recorders and probably by the witches themselves.\\"Murray 1921, p. 115. With these kinds of interpretations, Murray created for the first time the idea of the witch as a practitioner of good magic and religious rites to ensure fertility of people and the land. This ran counter to all previous ideas about what witchcraft was in history and folklore - even Leland's variant of the witch-cult hypothesis in Aradia depicted witches as not fully benevolent, but rather as revolutionary figures who would use cursing and black magic to exact revenge on their enemies, the upper classes, and the Catholic Church.Gary, Gemma (2018). \\"Forward\\". In Leland, Charles G. Aradia or the Gospel of Witches. London: Troy Books Publishing. Murray combined testimony from several witch trials to arrive at the idea that witches met four times per year at coven meetings or \\"Sabbaths\\". She also used one piece of testimony to arrive at the conclusion that covens were usually composed of 13 witches, led by a male priest who would dress in animal skins, horns, and fork-toed shoes to denote his authority (the dress was assumed to be a naturalistic explanation for accused witch's descriptions of Satan). According to Murray, the traditional name for coven gatherings, \\"Sabbath\\", was derived from s'esbattre, meaning \\"to frolic\\". Most historians disagree, arguing instead that the organizers of the witch trials adopted terms predominantly associated with Judaism, including \\"Sabbath\\", in order to denigrate witches as the equivalent to Jews, who were also highly denigrated in mainstream European culture during this period. In fact, many witch trial accounts used not only \\"Sabbath\\" but also \\"synagogue\\" in reference to gatherings of witches. == Reception == The idea of a witch cult that until early modern times managed to survive was quickly dismissed by historians. From the 1920s on, Murray's theory was assailed by critics such as George Lincoln Burr, Hugh Trevor-Roper and more recently by Keith Thomas. Most mainstream folklorists, including most of Murray's contemporaries, did not take her hypothesis seriously. Rather than accept Murray's naturalistic explanation for the magical feats and rituals ascribed to witches during the early modern trials, other scholars argued that the entire scenario was always fictitious and did not require a naturalistic explanation. The supposed details of the rituals and witchcraft practices described in trial records were simply invented by victims under torture or threat of torture, based on the kinds of diabolic rites that clergy of the time would have expected to hear about. Almost all of Murray's peers regarded the witch-cult theory as incorrect and based on poor scholarship. Modern scholars have noted that Murray was highly selective in the evidence she pulled from trial accounts, favoring details that supported her theory and ignoring details that clearly had no naturalistic analogue. Murray often contradicted herself within her own books, citing accounts in one chapter as evidence for naturalistic explanations while using exactly the same passages to argue opposite points in the next. A few scholars, however, argued that despite the exaggerated claims Murray made, there could be some truth in her hypothesis. Arno Rune Berg noted in his 1947 book Witches, Demons and Fertility a number of \\"ordinary\\" elements that were cited in descriptions of the witches' Sabbath. This could be an indication there had actually been meetings, which would have transformed into phantasmagoria later, under the influence of the imagination.Berg, A. (1947). Witches, Demons and Fertility. Most modern scholars of the history of witchcraft agree that it is very unlikely that such a witch-cult really existed, or that this cult or religion came to an end because the Christian church wanted to eradicate the followers of a pagan tradition. One of these modern critics, social anthropologist Alan Macfarlane criticized Murray's work in his book Witchcraft Prosecutions in Essex, 1500-1600: A Sociological Analysis. He says that his main criticism on Murray's work is that she used all sorts of things of European folklore, pulling them out of context thus creating a totally wrong image of European witchcraft. He argued that she had taken the things that people believed as a representation of what actually happened. Although in her book she had shown that people believed in a witch- cult, she failed to show that there really had been such a thing. From his own research on witchcraft in Essex Macfarlane concluded that he did not find much of the claims she had made: no traces of a Sabbath, Coven or the demonic pact were found, except perhaps with the witch trials of 1645. In his study he had found no evidence that there had been a pagan, underground cult, nor any organization of people who were called witches. Likewise Keith Thomas criticises Murray for her selective use of evidence and what he calls 'the deficiencies of her historical method'. Though most late 20th and early 21st century historians have been critical of Murray's ideas and methods, a few credit her hypothesis with least a bit of underlying truth. Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, for example, argued that while most of Murray's arguments were \\"near nonsense\\", he also pointed to Carlo Ginzburg's discovery in the 1960s of the Italian benandanti, folk magicians who practiced anti-witchcraft magic and were themselves put on trial for witchcraft, as evidence that in at least some cases, the accusations of the witch trial organizers were not based entirely on panicked fantasy. Ginzburg himself distanced himself from Murray's hypothesis, though he also argued that the benandanti were a continuation of a pre-Christian shamanic tradition, an assertion which has itself been criticized by other scholars as lacking solid evidence. == Influence == Despite criticisms of her work, Murray was invited to write the entry on \\"witchcraft\\" for the 1929 edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, which was reprinted for decades, last appearing in the 1969 edition. Rather than write an article that reflected the historical consensus on the witch trials, Murray used the opportunity to promote her own hypothesis in the Encyclop√¶dia, presenting it as fact. It was so influential that, according to folklorist Jacqueline Simpson, Murray's ideas became \\"so entrenched in popular culture that they will probably never be uprooted.\\"Jacqueline Simpson (1994). Margaret Murray: Who Believed Her, and Why? Folklore, 105:1-2: 89-96. DOI: 10.1080/0015587X.1994.9715877 Charles Leland's idea of an 'old religion' and Murray's surviving pagan cult would inspire subsequent 20th century modern witchcraft movements like Wicca, and heavily influenced writers such as Robert Graves, whose book The White Goddess also influenced Wicca. Feminist scholars have also taken up a variant on Murray's thesis about persecuted witches in Medieval Europe as members of a religion; not one centering on a Horned God, but rather a cult of the Mother Goddess which supposedly originated in the Paleolithic era. == References == * == External links == * Full text of The Witch-Cult in Western Europe at the Internet Archive Category:1921 non-fiction books Category:Anthropology literature Category:Witchcraft ","title":"The Witch-Cult in Western Europe"},{"id":"20207824","text":"The Greater Poland Regional Assembly () is the regional legislature of the Voivodeship of Greater Poland.

In 1985, Rennie's father accepted a call to the Old Parish Church, in Larbert and the family moved there. Rennie was schooled at Ladeside Primary, and Larbert High School, at weekends he would watch Falkirk F.C. play, later becoming a ballboy for the team. Rennie went on to study for a business degree at Glasgow Caledonian University. In his final year, he received a tryout for the Charlotte Eagles but suffered a cruciate ligament injury to his right knee. Returning to Scotland, Rennie continued to play for Scottish Junior Football Association teams Dunipace and Bo'ness whilst working in sales and marketing for Blackbaud. With the money earned from his sales and marketing work, Rennie was able to personally pay for his SFA coaching course costs. Rennie quickly rose through the coaching ranks and attained his UEFA 'A' Licence becoming assistant manager at Rosyth F.C. at 26. In 2003 Rennie was asked by charity Ambassadors Football to embark on a playing tour of Africa, visiting, Mozambique, Sudan and South Africa. The tour comprised players from United States-based teams Charlotte Eagles, Cascade Surge, and Minnesota Thunder, a South Africa international, a Nigeria international and several players from the UK. During the trip, Rennie was offered an opportunity to manage the Cascade Surge. ==Coaching career== Cascade Surge Rennie took over as head coach with the Cascade Surge in Oregon, in 2005. Under him the Premier Development League team reached its best level of success during its existence between 1995 and 2009. In his only season in charge Rennie led the Surge to the North West Division Title, West Coast Championship Final, US Open Cup Qualification and the Fair Play Award. Out of 16 games, the Surge won 12 games, and drew 2. Following this success Rennie had to return to his work with Blackbaud, and began to make plans for full-time work with AIS. In 2006 Rennie accepted an invitation to become the a director of AIS, as well as Head Coach of both USL-2 expansion team, the Cleveland City Stars and youth team Ambassadors FC (both owned by AIS). Cleveland City Stars In the club's first season, the City Stars lost only one regular season game. Rennie won the coach of the year award in a season where the team conceded a USL all-time record low of 13 goals. The team finished its first season as the runners up in the USL Second Division. The Cleveland City Stars won the 2008 United Soccer Leagues Championship with a 2‚Äì1 victory over the Charlotte Eagles in front of a sold-out crowd at Krenzler Stadium in Cleveland and live to a TV audience throughout the United States. Again Rennie's work was recognized in the shape of the coach of the year award. Some of the top young players that Rennie had recruited and coached in 2007 were transferred to professional teams at a higher level before the 2008 season began. Once again at the end of the 2008 season some of the most talented players were recruited by MLS and European teams. Carolina RailHawks Rennie began to coach the Carolina RailHawks from USL 1. With the Carolina RailHawks he inherited a team that had only made the playoffs once in the history of the Franchise and had never finished above eighth place in a regular season campaign. Rennie only kept 3 players from the previous RailHawks roster. He then completely changed the team culture and environment, introducing psychological, tactical and physical concepts that had never been implemented at this level before. In 2009 the team missed out on the regular season title by only 2 points finishing runners up to Portland who recorded one of the best regular season records in the 25-year history of the USL. Rennie was finalist for the coach of the year award and his team was recognized for the turnaround that had taken place in just one season. In 2010, the RailHawks established themselves as arguably the premier team in US Soccer outside of MLS. The RailHawks won the NASL title and continued their success into the post season with a run to the Championship final. the team that had previously never scored a playoff goal. For the fourth year in a row Rennie was recognized as a finalist for the Coach of the Year Award, a feat that had never been achieved before at this level of professional soccer. The RailHawks also broke franchise records for a single season including conceding only 14 goals and scoring 54. Rennie attributes much of his coaching success to the leadership and psychological lessons he learned during his career in the corporate world as well as the support he has had from assistant coaches Brian Irvine and Paul Ritchie, both former Scotland national football team players. Vancouver Whitecaps FC On 9 August 2011, Rennie was announced as the new coach of Vancouver Whitecaps FC, however he did not assume that role until after the season was over, on 2 November 2011. At the end of the 2011 season Rennie revamped his playing squad by introducing experienced imports from the Scottish and English football league systems ‚Äî Kenny Miller, Barry Robson and Andy O'Brien ‚Äî then in his first season in charge the Whitecaps reached the play-offs. In the process Rennie became the first coach to lead a Canadian team to the MLS post season.

Common parlance employs the word superstition for what folklorists generally refer to as folk belief.For example, see discussion in Georges & Jones (1995:122). A proponent of this conceptualization includes Alan Dundes, the American folklorist who proposed that the term as superstition denote traditional expressions that have conditions and results, signs and causes. There are also those who include in the term's coverage the belief narratives such as legends, which are differentiated from folktales in the sense that they are believable for telling stories about human beings who lived in the recent past. ==NotesReferences== * Georges, Robert A. & Jones, Michael Owen. 1995.

The use of BodyKom does not require any change in the care routines at the hospital, other than the patient getting a new type of patient kit which includes ECG electrodes, a small portable sensor and a smart cell phone. Monitoring data is collected by the sensor and is wirelessly transferred to the cell phone. The ECG data is then transferred via the mobile network to a decision support system for adjustment and then forwarded to the caregivers system for analysis. From a medical and technical point of view the patient is connected in the same way as with conventional ECG methods, like using a Holter monitor. BodyKom was developed by Kiwok in cooperation with Karolinska University Hospital in Sweden. ==External links== * * * Category:Medical equipment ","title":"BodyKom"},{"id":"20207969","text":"Urmston Musical Theatre (UMT) is an amateur theatre company based in Urmston, Greater Manchester, UK. ==History== The organisation was formed in 1911 as the Urmston and District Operatic Society, and produced H.M.S.

In March 1903, on the campus of New York City, Normal College (now Hunter College), seven young women created a new sorority . The J.A.P., or \\"Jay-ay-peez\\", focused on religious education and settlement house work. The founders were Hannah (Finkelstein) Swick, Olga (Edelstein) Ecker, Sadie (April) Glotzer, Rose (Posner) Bernstein, Rose (Delson) Hirschman, May (Finkelstein) Spielgel, and Frances (Zellermayer) Delson. Frances Zellermayer was a sister to Zeta Beta Tau founder Maurice Zellermayer and later married the brother of fellow founder Rose Delson. In 1913, with the new name Iota Alpha Pi, the members began the traditional sorority expansion process. The original organizers grouped themselves as Alpha chapter and the succeeding group became Beta chapter. Early expansion was at other schools in the New York Area, Gamma at the Brooklyn Law School, Delta at NYU Washington Square and Epsilon at the New Jersey Law School The Sorority became international in 1929 with the founding of Kappa chapter at University of Toronto, University of Manitoba had a particularly prosperous chapter. In 1924, a Rotation Scholarship Fund was created, allowing money to be loaned to worthy students by the sorority on the expectation of it being repaid. In 1925 the sorority began creating its own semi-annual bulletin. Iota joined the National Panhellenic Conference as an associate member in November 1953The Crescent of Gamma Phi beta, December 1953. p 20 and became a full member on November 4, 1957.The Crescent of Gamma Phi Beta, March 1958. p.4 Although many chapters were planted, Iota Alpha Pi could not keep up with its rapidly growing competitors. Historian Marianne Sanua recounts the life of Iota Alpha Pi in her book, Going Greek: Jewish College Fraternities in the United States, 1895- 1945. The sorority was \\"not for the especially popular, affluent, or snobbish, but just a group of good friends\\" (p. 81) The American Jewish Yearbook 5692 describes the sorority as Jewish in a positive way\\". This accolade probably stems from Iota's studies on women in the Bible. By 1966, Iota Alpha Pi had granted a total 23 charters. A report by Wilson Heller indicates that the sorority was strong until 1968. Heller posits that the sorority saw dramatic declines in membership, particularly with the cessation of the \\"Christians only\\" clause in non-Jewish organizations. In 1969, Iota Alpha Pi had new chapters at the University of Maryland College Park and Hunter College Park Avenue. An NPC report indicated that Iota Alpha Pi had 11 chapters , 8 Alumnae groups and 5,802 sisters as of June 1, 1967 and 13 chapters, 8 Alumnae groups and 6,204 as of June 1, 1969.Sigma Kappa Triangle Summer 1970, p 23 In July 1971, the international headquarters voted to disband Iota Alpha Pi (Heller). As of 2008, some alumni continue to hold reunions and other events. However, no formal organization exists to coordinate these gatherings. ==Insignia== The original name of the sorority was J.A.P. Their publication was The J.A.P. Bulletin. With the name change to Iota Alpha Pi, the magazine was also renamed: The Heights. The first official badge was a scarlet horizontal diamond surrounded by seed pearls. The scarlet diamond bore the letters Œô Œë and Œ†, in gold. Above the Œë, in gold, was a skull and crossbones. Later versions of the badge included two full blown roses at the points of the diamond. Official colors:red and black. As of 1931, the sorority used in \\" a diamond of scarlet surrounded by jewels\\" where a crest would otherwise be used.

Newlands of Nevada and drafted by Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Charles Patrick Neill. It created the Board of Mediation and Conciliation (BMC). The BMC was a precursor to today's National Mediation Board (NMB). ==Background== In response to railroad strikes during the 1870s and 1880s,See, for example, Great Railroad Strike of 1877. Congress passed the Arbitration Act of 1888, which authorized the creation of arbitration panels with the power to investigate the causes of labor disputes and to issue non-binding arbitration awards.Arbitration Act of 1888, , October 1, 1888. The Act was a complete failure: only one panel was ever convened under the Act, and that one, in the case of the 1894 Pullman Strike, issued its report only after the strike had been crushed by a federal court injunction backed by federal troops. Congress attempted to correct these shortcomings in the Erdman Act, passed in 1898.Erdman Act of 1898, June 1, 1898, ch. 370, . This law likewise provided for voluntary arbitration, but made any award issued by the panel binding and enforceable in federal court. It also outlawed discrimination against employees for union activities, prohibited \\"yellow dog\\" contracts (employee agrees not to join a union while employed), and required both sides to maintain the status quo during any arbitration proceedings and for three months after an award was issued. The arbitration procedures were rarely used. ==Newlands Act and the BMC== President Woodrow Wilson signed the Newlands Act on July 15, 1913.United States. An Act Providing for mediation, conciliation, and arbitration in controversies between certain employers and their employees (Newlands Act). Ch. 6, . Approved July 15, 1913. The law created the Board of Mediation and Conciliation, which was administered by U.S. Commerce and District Court Judge Martin Augustine Knapp and assisted by U.S. Alabama District Court Judge and Commissioner William Lea Chambers. The Board adjusted and arbitrated disputes between railroad companies and their operating employees, where those disputes threatened to interrupt operation of the carriers to the \\"serious detriment of the public interest.\\" Voluntary arbitration was also provided for those disputes that could not be settled by mediation. The Board was functionally replaced on December 26, 1917, by the creation of the United States Railroad Administration, although it continued to exist with its activities restricted to short-line railroads. In 1920, the Esch‚ÄìCummins Act (formally called the Transportation Act) created a new Railroad Labor Board which regulated wages and settled disputes, and permanently replaced the duties of the BMC.Esch‚ÄìCummins Act, Pub.L. 66-152, .

His career is described in Niccol√≤ Machiavelli's Il Principe. ==Biography== Early life and rise to power Euffreducci was born in Fermo. During his childhood, he was brought up by his uncle, Giovanni Fogliani after he was left fatherless.The Prince, page 30, Chapter VIII; Niccol√≤ Machiavelli; Published by Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2004 He was sent to serve as a soldier under the condottiero Paolo Vitelli in order to win high command. In 1495, he fought with Vitelli first at Pisa and then in Naples for the French. In 1499, the two were fighting for the Florentines against Pisa, but both were accused of treason by Florence. Vitelli was summarily put to death while Oliverotto was spared due to the intervention of the government of Fermo. He then united with Vitellozzo Vitelli, Paolo's brother, and both went into the service of Cesare Borgia. As his ambition grew, Oliverotto wanted to seize Fermo for himself. Consequently, he wrote to his uncle, claiming he wanted to meet him. Suspecting no foul play from his nephew, Fogliani brought the citizens of Fermo and lodged him in his own mansion. Soon, Oliverotto prepared a formal banquet in which he invited the prominent people of Fermo and his uncle. As Machiavelli put it: Then, Oliverotto laid siege to the palace of the governing council, and, having scared them all, set up a government and gave himself absolute power.The Prince, page 31, Chap. VIII; Niccol√≤ Machiavelli; Published by Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2004 Later, he made himself a formidable ruler to all of his neighboring states. Downfall and legacy In May 1502, Oliverotto conquered Camerino for Cesare Borgia. However, realizing that the Duke was becoming stronger, he attended the meeting at La Magione with Giulio, Paolo and Francesco Orsini, Gian Paolo Baglioni, Pandolfo Petrucci, Vitelli and others, on 9 October. Although Oliverotto was against Paolo Orsini's line of reconciliation with Cesare Borgia, he nonetheless took Senigallia in Cesare's name. But this didn't change Borgia's secret design, and the Duke had him captured and strangled, together with Vitellozzo Vitelli, on 31 December 1502.The Prince, Chapter 8; Niccol√≤ Machiavelli; Published by Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2004 Oliverotto was succeeded as ruler by his son Ludovico, who ruled until he was killed at the Battle of Monto Giorgio in 1520, when Fermo became again directly subjected to the Holy See. As with Agathocles of Syracuse, he is immortalized in Machiavelli's The Prince as one of the leaders who gained power via criminal means. He is portrayed as a violent and cunning character. ==References== Category:1475 births Category:1502 deaths Category:People from Fermo Category:Condottieri Category:Italian murder victims Category:People murdered in Italy Category:Assassinated Italian politicians Category:Deaths by strangulation ","title":"Oliverotto Euffreducci"},{"id":"20208059","text":"Amrabat is a surname.

Tiebout (2 January 1896 ‚Äì 2 April 1966) was an American psychiatrist who promoted the Alcoholics Anonymous approach to the public, patients and fellow professionals. He served on the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous from 1957‚Äì1966 and was president of the National Council on Alcoholism from 1951‚Äì1953. ==Early life and education== Harry Tiebout was raised in Brooklyn, New York. He earned his bachelor's degree at Wesleyan University in 1917, then went to Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, where he also completed an internship with a specialization in psychiatry. The psychiatry service at Hopkins was led by Adolf Meyer, who had an eclectic approach in which Freudian theory was contributory but not dominant. John B. Watson was also at Hopkins during the time Tiebout was there, conducting research in behaviorism which would have substantial influence on the field of child development during the 1920s. ==Clinical work== Tiebout was on the staff of New York Hospital, Westchester Division from 1922-24. He then began work in child guidance clinics in New York City, joining the Institute for Child Guidance as staff psychiatrist shortly after it was founded in 1927. The Institute was a well-funded center for training and research, dominated by psychoanalysis and specializing in \\"exhaustive case histories 75 pages long.\\" During these years Tiebout was also on the staff of Cornell Medical School and the Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic. In 1935 he became medical director of Blythewood Sanitarium in Greenwich, Connecticut. Privately owned, Blythewood was situated on a beautiful, rustic estate once owned by Boss Tweed. At its peak, it had eight main buildings, eight cottages, a chapel, a building for occupational therapy, and a small golf course. There were no bars on the windows. Artistic and cultural pursuits were encouraged as part of the therapeutic program. Although the sanitarium was primarily for care of the mentally ill, it also provided care for alcoholics. In 1939, Tiebout received a pre-publication copy of the book, Alcoholics Anonymous. After looking it over, he gave it to one of his patients, Marty Mann. She had been at Blythewood for over a year but seemed no closer to conquering her alcohol problem than when she arrived, so he considered her a good test of whether the book had value. At first she read the book eagerly, delighted to know for the first time that there was a name (alcoholism) for what ailed her. However, she was soon repelled by the overbearingly religious message and told Tiebout that she could never accept it. Tiebout, according to Mann's biographers Sally and David Brown, quietly encouraged her to keep reading. Eventually taking the book to heart, she had an epiphany during a crisis of resentment and fury and was converted. Other references, also based on Mann's recollections, portray Tiebout's role a little differently. They describe an ongoing verbal battle lasting several months, in which Tiebout refused to accept Marty's rejection of the book. In the end, Mann did become an active member of AA and within a few years made education about alcoholism, and promotion of alcohol-abuse treatment, her second career. With Tiebout's support, she founded the National Council on Alcoholism (NCA). Tiebout also became a friend and supporter of AA founder Bill Wilson, providing personal psychiatric care when Wilson developed depression in the 1940s. It was largely through Tiebout's influence that Bill Wilson was invited to speak at a New York state medical society meeting and then at a meeting of the American Psychiatric Association, and had his talk published in the American Journal of Psychiatry. ==Alcoholism: Approach to the patient== Tiebout had many years of training and experience in the management of alcohol problems before his first exposure to Alcoholics Anonymous. However, his earliest detailed article concerning alcoholism was published in 1944, 5 years into his relationship with AA, and is primarily a description of AA itself. Over the next 10 years he published a number of articles outlining his theories about alcoholism, the psychodynamic causes of the disorder and his reasons for endorsing AA as the definitive solution. Howard J. Clinebell, in a book for clergy on alcoholism counseling, recalled that Tiebout \\"likened the 'runaway symptom' of alcoholism to the dangerously high fever of pneumonia. The fever is a symptom of the underlying infection, but unless it can be lowered, the person may die of the 'symptom\\".\\" Psychiatrists, Tiebout felt, had been ineffectual because they ignored the deadly symptom in an attempt to treat a (theoretical) underlying disease. He credited AA with an ability to target the symptom directly. Tiebout's understanding of the alcoholic mind cannot be entirely separated from his understanding of the 12-step approach, but the primary themes in his writings can be summed up under several points. The alcoholic personality In one of his early papers Tiebout discounted the idea, common among psychoanalytically-inclined doctors, that there was a classic type of pre-alcoholic personality. In his view all of the personality characteristics associated with early alcoholism were manifestations of the tension state accompanying intermittent alcohol binges. These features included: # An unconscious need or drive to dominate # A prevailing negative, hostile feeling-tone # A capacity for ecstatic peaks # A sense of loneliness and isolation # Feelings of inferiority and superiority which exist simultaneously in the individual # A striving for perfection Howard Clinebell understood Tiebout to mean that there was, in fact, a pre- alcoholic personality but that \\"the distinctive factors have not yet been isolated\\". In a 1947 lecture, Tiebout located the roots of alcoholism in poor parenting, either excessive strictness which caused the child to suffer \\"perpetual frustration and blocking of his desires and expectations,\\" or over- indulgence. Either way, \\"Since the alcoholic's sense of self-discipline has not been developed at this point, his natural reaction is to reject all discipline. He now cannot face the realities of his existence. This would indicate that the whole point of treatment is to get the alcoholic to face and accept his limitations and capacities.\\"Syracuse Herald Journal, 25 February 1947 The disease model The concept of alcoholism which dominated treatment approaches in the second half of the 20th century, and is still influential today, defined alcoholism as a disease. The idea that alcohol problems constituted a disease was not new, but the particular synthesis associated initially with the Yale Center of Alcohol Studies (now at Rutgers) and the National Committee for Education on Alcoholism had unique features not found in earlier theories. The NCEA was one of Marty Mann's projects, and thus influenced by Tiebout. A 1990 Hazelden pamphlet cites Tiebout, Dr. William Silkworth and E.M. Jellinek as formative influences. Tiebout seems to have been somewhat ambivalent about the disease model, however. In 1955, speaking of the scientific underpinnings of the alcoholism movement in general, he said \\"I cannot help but feel that the whole field of alcoholism is way out on a limb which any minute will crack and drop us all in a frightful mess.\\" He was consistent in his belief that the acceptance of alcoholism as a disease was essential, but this belief was partially pragmatic. In his experience, chronic alcoholics did not take the steps necessary to recover unless they became conscious of themselves as people with a disease. He emphasized a different aspect of the model in public lectures, however. Family members, friends and employers of alcoholics were encouraged to keep in mind that the condition was an illness and not a moral failing. Role of the ego In a 1954 article Reprinted in Harry Teibout: The Collected Writings Tiebout introduced a definition of the term \\"ego\\" which was to become important in his later writings, particularly those for AA audiences. Although his use of the term was new, the concept behind it had been developed by Tiebout during the early 1940s. In these early articles he was addressing a professional readership, and use of the term might have created confusion between the psychoanalytic meaning of ego and the colloquial \\"ego\\" which was Tiebout's essential meaning. Based on work with 250 alcoholics during his first 10 years at Blythewood, Tiebout developed the following conception of the alcoholic mind: :In the normal individual there is a tendency to create some privacy for his inner life, for his motivations, reflections and emotions, so that they are not completely accessible to the environment. Normally this attempt interferes only slightly with the freedom of movement of outgoing and incoming stimuli and impulses. The boundary which the normal individual sets up between himself and the environment may be called a floating or diffuse boundary. In incipient alcoholism, however, it appears that the boundary is drawn somewhat tighter than is usual, and that with each stage of further development of the alcoholism more and more gaps are closed until the alcoholic seems to have erected what may be called a barrier which permits only a minimum of interplay between the inner self and the environment. Using examples from dreams of patients he had analyzed, Tiebout presented evidence for the existence of this rigid barrier. As long as the barrier remained, \\"As long as the self feels protected in a deep unconscious sense, it cannot be and is not disturbed by the warnings of reality, which characteristically roll like water off a duck's back.\\" For the analyst, :Tactics are governed not only by strategy; they are also guided by three basic principles in technique. These are, briefly, that the patient must suffer or feel anxiety about himself and his condition; second, that it is the impersonal pressures of reality which activate suffering; and third, that it is the first and most immediate task of the psychiatrist to overcome the patient's refusal, unwillingness or inability to sense or feel these pressures of reality. In his 1954 article, 'The Ego Factors in Surrender in Alcoholism,' Tiebout began using the term \\"ego\\" to describe this concept of a self barricaded by defenses. He related it to Freud's \\"His Majesty the Baby\\" and to a similar concept introduced by Sandor Rado in 1933. Rado hypothesized that the elation induced by alcohol produced a reaction in the form of a \\"tense depression\\", which then reactivated the childish megalomania normally outgrown by adulthood. The result was a type of magical thinking in which \\"the ego secretly compares its current helplessness with its original narcissistic stature . . and aspires to leave its tribulations and regain its old magnitude.\\" Tiebout acknowledged his indebtedness to Rado's conception, while eliminating much of the psychoanalytic complexity of the original. He also felt that Rado was incorrect in advising only the \\"reduction\\" of the ego. Tiebout's view was that \\"reduction\\" represented a compromise and that there should be no compromise with the ego. The old ego should be eliminated entirely and replaced with a new one through \\"surrender\\". Surrender and conversion The hallmark of Tiebout's work was his ability to explain 12 step ideas in psychoanalytic terms. The primary source for the steps was a religious movement popularized by Frank Buchman, with elements of the Higher Life movement tradition combined with the personal-evangelism techniques developed within the YMCA movement in the early 20th century. The Oxford Group had a successful program involving public and private meetings for witness and confession, as well as individual work. Their concept of \\"surrender\\" was the traditional Christian one, as a contemporary observer noted: :Surrender means the complete surrender of the will to Christ. They make no claim that this is easy. It may mean an entire change in one's whole life plan. It has meant just that for many of the Groupers. But it is necessary. So long as there are reserved areas in a man's life, they assert, he cannot expect to enter into a wholly satisfying experience of God. Conversion, surrender, confession, restitution and the necessity of evangelizing others were ideas brought from the Oxford Group to Alcoholics Anonymous by members who had found that the intense religious devotion they inspired was the key to a changed life. Tiebout understood the concepts in a more secular way, and approved of them. Reprinted in Harry Tiebout: The Collected Writings Reprinted in Harry Tiebout: The Collected Writings Tiebout had found that superficial compliance in therapy often correlated with lack of real change, and he saw in the AA concept of surrender an antidote to this phenomenon. An act of surrender was the only cure, or practically the only one, to the problem of \\"compliance\\", or partial surrender to the psychiatrist's authority and the authority of the reality principle. Tiebout described true surrender as \\"an unconscious event, not willed by the patient even if he or she should desire to do so. It can occur only when an individual with certain traits in his or her unconscious mind becomes involved in a certain set of circumstances,\\" essentially the circumstances of \\"hitting bottom\\". Conversion, for Tiebout, was a spiritual awakening made possible by the person's recognition of his own egocentricity. The central effect of Alcoholics Anonymous was \\"to develop in the person a spiritual state which will serve as a direct neutralizing force upon the egocentric elements in the character of the alcoholic.\\" A \\"vague, groping, skeptical intellectual belief\\" would not accomplish this but only a true emotional religious feeling, for \\"unless the individual attains in the course of time a sense of the reality and the nearness of a Greater Power, his egocentric nature will reassert itself with undiminished intensity, and drinking will again enter into the picture.\\" ==Later life== Tiebout retired as medical director of Blythewood in 1950. The sanitarium was gradually changing into a long-term care facility for the elderly, with fewer psychiatric patients. He continued to see patients privately and kept up an active speaking schedule, as well as serving on the boards of various alcohol-related organizations. He died in Greenwich in 1966 of cardiac causes. He was the husband of the former Ethel Mills and father of Harry Tiebout, Jr., a philosophy professor; Charles Tiebout, an economics professor; and Sarah T. Worn. ==References== Category:1896 births Category:1966 deaths Category:Alcohol abuse counselors Category:American psychiatrists Category:Wesleyan University alumni Category:Johns Hopkins School of Medicine alumni ","title":"Harry Tiebout"},{"id":"20208066","text":"Triptans is a word commonly used for a class of anti-migraine drugs that are selective 5-hydroxytryptamine/serotonin1B/1D (5-HT1B/1D) agonists. Migraine is a complex disease which affects about 15% of the population and can be highly disabling. Triptans have advantages over ergotamine and dihydroergotamine, such as selective pharmacology, well established safety record and evidence- based prescribing instructions. Triptans are therefore often preferred treatment in migraine. ==History== Search for a new anti-migraine drug started at Glaxo in 1972. Studies in the 1960s showed that vasoconstriction from 5-HT, ergotamine and noradrenaline could reduce migraine attacks. Research also showed that platelet 5-HT level is reduced during migraine. Because there are too many side-effects for 5-HT to be used as a drug, scientists started research on the receptors of 5-HT in order to discover and develop a more specific agonist for 5-HT receptors. Research on the 5-HT receptors and their effect led to discovery of several types and subtypes of 5-HT. AH24167 showed a vasodilation effect instead of vasoconstriction due to the agonist effect on another type of 5-HT receptors later assigned the name 5-HT7. AH25086 was the second compound developed and showed a vasoconstriction effect but was not released as a drug due to low per oral bioavailability. Continued research led to the discovery of the first triptan drug, sumatriptan, that had both vasoconstriction effect, as well as better oral bioavailability. Sumatriptan was first launched in the Netherlands in 1991 and became available in the United States during 1993. ==Mechanism== Triptans are specific and selective agonists for the 5-HT1 receptors. Sumatriptan binds to 5-HT1D receptors, zolmitriptan, rizatriptan, naratriptan, almotriptan, and frovatriptan binds to 5-HT1B/1D and eletriptan binds to 5-HT1B/1D/1F receptors. Triptans are believed to exert their effects through vasoconstriction, leading to reduced carotid arterial circulation without affecting cerebral blood flow, peripheral neuronal inhibition, or inhibition of transmission through second order neurons of the trigeminocervical complex. ==Receptors== 5-HT receptors are all G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) except for 5-HT3 which is a ligand gated ion channel. The receptors that have been found to be involved in migraine are 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D and 5-HT1F receptors. 5-HT1B are found in meningeal arteries, agonism of 5-HT1B causes vasoconstriction in cranial nerves. The 5-HT1D receptors are located primarily in the trigeminal nerve in the central nervous system (CNS). They are also found in vascular smooth muscles, mediating contraction. Agonism of 5-HT1D receptors subdues the release of inflammatory inducing nerve stimulants. The amino acids contributing to the binding of ligands to the receptor are aspartic acid (Asp), phenylalanine (Phe), serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), tryptophan (Trp) and tyrosine (Tyr). It has been shown that both 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors in humans have a very similar amino acids structures which demonstrates the similarities in binding properties. ==Design== All triptans have an indole structure identical to the neurotransmitter 5-HT. Classic triptan structure contain side chain on the indole ring, and a basic nitrogen in a similar distance from the indole structure. The main structural difference of the triptans is the position of the sulfonamide and the side chain attached to it (see figure 1 and table 1). Rizatriptan and zolmitriptan have instead of a sulfonamide a triazole and 2-oxazolidone respectively. Another exception to the classic structure is seen on eletriptan where the nitrogen-alkyl chain connected to the indole ring is replaced with a dimethyl-pyrrolidine, and in naratriptan where the nitrogen-alkyl chain is replaced with a 1-methyl- piperidine ring. One of the frovatriptan side chains forms an additional ring with the indole, resulting in a carbazole ring system. Structures of the triptans File:Triptan - indole structure.PNGFig 1.

Pharmacophore model for the triptans. Fig 3. Shows how different ligands fit to the pharmacophore. 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors are considered very similar, they share amino acid homology and their ligands expose similar binding properties thus they have similar pharmacophore. The pharmacophore model for these receptors ligands is qualitative and defines the relative positions of important groups. It is defined with following five main features: an aromatic group (usually the indole), protonated amine (a donor of hydrogen bond), acceptor of hydrogen bond, additional hydrogen bond site (both donor and acceptor) and hydrophobic region located between both hydrogen bond sites, see figure 2. The main binding points were concluded to be the protonated amine and the hydrogen bond site. It was observed that the double bond region in the indole was necessary for the agonism in this series of compounds. Figure 3 shows how different drugs fit the pharmacophore, with an C and N linked analogues of 5-HT1D agonist. The marked sites on the figure are responsible for the affinity. The pharmacophore can be characterized as amphipathic, that means that the structure has both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups. Relevant structural features of triptans and binding to the receptor Triptan structures were designed from the structure of 5-HT to attain affinity to 5-HT receptors, hence the identical indole structure. The hydroxyl group (-OH) on the hexane of the indole core and the alkyl-amine side chain on position C3 on 5-HT have been replaced with other compounds, such as sulfonamides or azol-ring structured derivatives and different amine-alkyl side chains. An electro-negative group can form a hydrogen bond with Thr in the pocket of the receptor. Sulfonamide derivatives attached to the hexane ring of the indole structure have electro-negative properties, as well as the triazole and 2-oxazolidone on rizatriptan and zolmitriptan respectively. This can increase binding ability of the compound and the efficacy, especially with the 5-HT1D receptor. Fig 4. Schematic picture of sumatriptan binding to 5-HT1D receptor A schematic drawing of the binding of sumatriptan to 5-HT1D receptor can be seen in figure 4. One study showed that sumatriptan fits better in the binding site of the receptor when the side chain with the protonated nitrogen atom is folded back over the indole structure. This alignment contributes to the hydrogen bonding between the nitrogen in the sulfonamine and the Ser138 in the binding site. It is also favorable to the formation of the hydrogen bond between the oxygen of the sulfonamine and Thr202. Other binding in the pocket of the binding site occurs with the nitrogen atom in the pentene ring of the indole structure of the triptan and the amino acid Ser352. This energetically favorable position of the agonist makes it possible for additional binding of the ligand to other Ser in the binding site, along with additional anchoring between Phe in the pocket of the binding site and the indole of the agonist. The binding of Phe and the triptan is caused by œÄ stacking interactions of the indole and amino acid and an additional effect on this interaction is because of dispersive effect of amino acid leucine (Leu; not shown in figure 4). The amino acids Trp343 and Tyr346 both have electron rich œÄ-systems in their aromatic structures. With their position in the binding site they create a sort of aromatic cage around the protonated nitrogen atom of the side chain on position C3 on the triptans (this nitrogen atom is protonated at physiological condition), and thereby stabilizes the ion bond the nitrogen atom has formed with a carboxylate on aspartic acid. Side chains of the surrounding amino acids can have an effect on the binding of the nitrogen atom, mainly three Phe can affect the methyl groups bound to the nitrogen atom (not shown in figure 4). Eletriptan has higher affinity for the receptor, which is probably a result of the bulky substituents of the structure. The amine is protonated at physiological pH condition, triggering better uptake. The uptake rate of the agonist is different depending on whether the amine in R2 is primary, secondary or tertiary but the latter seem to give the best results. For the R1 substituent an electron rich sulfonamide groups and amide group has shown the best results in receptor binding and activity. It has been observed that a relationship is between absorption and molecular size hence larger hydrophilic molecules tended to have poor absorption. A small R1 substituent is necessary to maintain the rapid oral bioavailability of triptans. By placing an electron-withdrawing group or large group on position C2 on the indole structure the 5-HT agonist is conversed into an antagonist. This is thought to be because the indole ring is unable to occupy the aromatic part of the binding site. ==Triptan drugs== Properties of formulations Sumatriptan was the pioneer drug in this class. The second generation's triptans such as zolmitriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, almotriptan, eletriptan and frovatriptan soon became available. Different triptans are available in different formulations and in different strengths (see table 2). They have been formulated as subcutaneous injections, oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets, nasal spray and as rectal suppositories. Delivery system of the triptans may play an important role in the onset of action. The selection of anti-migraine drug for patients depends on their symptoms. The first selective 5-HT1B/1D agonist, sumatriptan, was first synthesized as a subcutaneous injection, then as an oral tablets and more recently as a nasal spray, it is also available in some countries as suppositories. The subcutaneous injection is the fastest way to stop a rapidly progressing migraine attack. The sumatriptan nasal spray provides faster onset of action than the tablets but it produces a similar headache response at 2 hours. Some patients prefer the nasal spray as it works more rapidly than the tablets and does not have as many adverse effects as the subcutaneous injection. Nasal spray is although not suitable for all patients, because some patients experience bad taste and lack of consistency of response. Zolmitriptan was developed with the strategy to create a more lipophilic compound, with faster absorption and better ability to cross the blood brain barrier than sumatriptan. It is available as tablets, orally disintegrating tablets and as nasal spray in some countries. Rizatriptan is available as tablets and orally disintegrating tablets but naratriptan, almotriptan, eletriptan and frovatriptan are only available in tablets, for now. {  border=\\"1\\" + Table 2: Properties of triptan formulations - - !

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a new drug April 15, 2008, which is a combination of sumatriptan 85 mg and naproxen 500 mg (NSAID). Triptans and NSAIDs work on distinct mechanism involved in migraine and therefore may offer improved treatment when administrated together. Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic properties (see table 3) are important when new drugs are developed. Patients seek rapid onset of action to relief the headache. Relatively short tmax, good bioavailability and lipophilicity are pharmacokinetic properties that have been associated with rapid onset of action. It has been speculated that good ability to cross the blood brain barrier and relatively long terminal elimination half-life may result in a lower incidence of headache recurrence. Sumatriptan and rizatriptan undergo first pass hepatic metabolism and result in lower bioavailability. {  border=\\"1\\" + Table 3: Pharmacokinetic properties of triptans in tablet formulation - !

They were signed to Sony (then CBS Records) and released two studio albums, Judges and Bagmen (1990) and Everything You Want (Nothing That You Need) (1993). At the ARIA Music Awards of 1991 they were nominated for Breakthrough Artist ‚Äì Single for \\"Sleeping Through Another War\\" (1990). The group disbanded in 1994. ==History== Seven Stories future members Michael Boundy, Sue Oliver and Andrew Tanner were involved in the Adelaide music scene from the late 1970s. They were sessions musicians at the Good God recording studio, which was run by Rod Boucher and Chris Adams. In 1978 Tanner contributed drums and vocals to Good God recordings, later moving to guitar in the band, the Retreads, which released a self-titled album, in 1980. Boundy played bass guitar for the bands, Thumbs Up and then the Retreads (with Tanner) before joining Perfect Strangers in 1980. In 1984 Tanner composed a track, \\"Dreams and Visions\\", Note: For additional work user may have to select 'Search again' and then 'Enter a title:' &/or 'Performer:' which became a banner song for the Uniting Church's National Christian Youth Convention in Adelaide in 1985. \\"Dreams and Visions\\" is about Pentecost and is still used by Australian congregations. Boundy on bass guitar, Oliver on percussion and backing vocals and Tanner on guitar and lead vocals joined up with Jeff Algra on drums, percussion and backing vocals, Glyn Lehmann on keyboards, accordion, French horn and backing vocals to form a rock group, Tall Stories, in Adelaide, in 1986. Their first major recording was a self-produced, self- distributed 12\\" mini LP Sleeping Through Another War, released in 1987. Oliver left during that year. Gaining commercial airplay, a major breakthrough came with the signing of the band by Sony (then CBS Records) to a five-year deal. Around 1989 the band changed its name to Seven Stories, to avoid confusion with a United States band, Tall Stories. The deal with Sony led to the critically acclaimed Judges and Bagmen album in 1990. All ten tracks were written by Tanner and it was recorded between October and December of the previous year with Kevin Moloney producing at Platinum Studios, Melbourne. Rolling Stones reviewer, in January 1991 stated, \\"it is the music which makes Judges and Bagmen such a compelling album\\" Additional musicians on the recording are Vika and Linda Bull and Broderick Smith. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1991 Seven Stories were nominated for Breakthrough Artist ‚Äì Single for \\"Sleeping Through Another War\\" (1990). \\"Sleeping through Another War\\" and \\"Walk through Babylon\\" were released by CBS as singles off the album. The band toured extensively throughout Australia supporting artists such as Midnight Oil, INXS, The Black Sorrows, Hothouse Flowers, Hunters and Collectors and Paul Kelly. High-profile producers T-Bone Burnett and Boom Crash Opera's Richard Pleasance were engaged by Sony for Seven Stories' second album, Everything You Want (Nothing That You Need) (1993), which provided two singles, \\"Is that It?\\" and \\". Although he contributed to the album, Lehmann had officially left the band by the time of its release, leaving Algra, Boundy and Tanner as the remaining core.Liner notes ‚Äì Everything You Want (Nothing That You Need), 1993 The band toured Europe and North America to support the album. Guitarist David Carr, engaged to augment the band for this recording, relates the band's sudden abandonment by Sony: \\"We toured that album very successfully, recorded a JJJ Live at the Wireless and had a string of singles before the whole of Sony was instructed to 'drop everything' and divert all energy to making Mariah Carey number one.\\" Seven Stories subsequently disbanded in 1994. Andrew Tanner worked in Melbourne as a writer and is a member of the psychedelic-styled band The Sand Pebbles and the Woodland Hunters. Boundy, Algra and Lehmann all returned to Adelaide and remained active musically. Drummer Algra played and recorded with a large number of artists including, T-Bone Burnett, The Waifs, The Borderers (with Glyn Lehmann), Jeanette Wormald, Jim Hermel, Andrew Clermont, Liam Gurner, and Jet O'Rourke. Lehmann has had a musical career as composer, songwriter, arranger, performer and music producer. He has created original music, songs and soundtracks for Australian Broadcasting Corporation television and radio, and the feature-length documentary I Told You I Was Ill ‚Äì The Life and Legacy of Spike Milligan. He has also worked with the State Theatre Company of South Australia and the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra. Boundy has played with Adelaide bands, Verandah and Vivid and played with Lehmann in the band, Sun Theory.

They are used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Inhibition of the DPP-4 enzyme prolongs and enhances the activity of incretins that play an important role in insulin secretion and blood glucose control regulation. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disease that results from inability of the Œ≤-cells in the pancreas to secrete sufficient amounts of insulin to meet the body's needs. Insulin resistance and increased hepatic glucose production can also play a role by increasing the body's demand for insulin. Current treatments, other than insulin supplementation, are sometimes not sufficient to achieve control and may cause undesirable side effects, such as weight gain and hypoglycemia. In recent years, new drugs have been developed, based on continuing research into the mechanism of insulin production and regulation of the metabolism of sugar in the body. The enzyme DPP-4 has been found to play a significant role. ==History== Since its discovery in 1967, serine protease DPP-4 has been a popular subject of research. Inhibitors of DPP-4 have long been sought as tools to elucidate the functional significance of the enzyme. The first inhibitors were characterized in the late 1980s and 1990s. Each inhibitor was important to establish an early structure activity relationship (SAR) for subsequent investigation. The inhibitors fall into two main classes, those that interact covalently with DPP-4 and those that do not. DPP-4 is a dipeptidase that selectively binds substrates that contain proline at the P1-position, thus many DPP-4 inhibitors have 5-membered heterocyclic rings that mimic proline, e.g. pyrrolidine, cyanopyrrolidine, thiazolidine and cyanothiazolidine. These compounds commonly form covalent bonds to the catalytic residue Ser630. In 1994, researchers from Zeria Pharmaceuticals unveiled cyanopyrrolidines with a nitrile function group that was assumed to form an imidate with the catalytic serine. Concurrently other DPP-4 inhibitors without a nitrile group were published but they contained other serine- interacting motifs, e.g. boronic acids, phosphonates or diacyl hydroxylamines. These compounds were not as potent because of the similarity of DPP-4 and prolyl oligopeptidase (PEP) and also suffered from chemical instability. Ferring Pharmaceuticals filed for patent on two cyanopyrrolidine DPP-4 inhibitors, which they published in 1995. These compounds had excellent potency and improved chemical stability. In 1995, Edwin B. Villhauer at Novartis started to explore N-substituted glycinyl-cyanopyrrolidines based on the fact that DPP-4 identifies N-methylglycine as an N-terminal amino acid. This group of new cyanopyrrolidines became extremely popular field of research in the following years. Some trials with dual inhibitors of DPP-4 and vasopeptidase have been represented, since vasopeptidase inhibition is believed to enhance the antidiabetic effect of DPP-4 inhibition by stimulating insulin secretion. Vasopeptidase-inhibiting motif is connected to the DPP-4 inhibitor at the N-substituent. ==DPP-4 mechanism== 350pxFig.1: During a meal, the incretins glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) are released by the small intestine into the blood stream. These hormones regulate insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. (GLP-1 has many roles in the human body. It stimulates insulin biosynthesis, inhibits glucagon secretion, slows gastric emptying, reduces appetite and stimulates regeneration of islet Œ≤-cells.) GLP-1 and GIP have extremely short plasma half-lives due to very rapid inactivation, catalyzed by the enzyme DPP-4. Inhibition of DPP-4 slows their inactivation, thereby potentiating their action, leading to lower plasma glucose levels, hence its utility in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. (Figure 1). DPP-4 distribution and function Fig.2: DPP-4 cleaves two amino acids from the N-terminal end of peptides, such as GLP-1.DPP-4 is attached to the plasma membrane of the endothelium of almost every organ in the body. Tissues which strongly express DPP-4 include the exocrine pancreas, sweat glands, salivary and mammary glands, thymus, lymph nodes, biliary tract, kidney, liver, placenta, uterus, prostate, skin, and the capillary bed of the gut mucosa (where most GLP-1 is inactivated locally). It is also present, in soluble form, in body fluids, such as blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. (It also happens that DPP-4 is the CD26 T-cell activating antigen.) DPP-4 selectively cleaves two amino acids from peptides, such as GLP-1 and GIP, which have proline or alanine in the second position (Figure 2). At the active site where DPP-4 has its effect, there is a characteristic arrangement of three amino acids, Asp-His-Ser. Since alanine and proline are crucial for the biological activity of GPL-1 and GIP, they are inactivated by cleaving away these amino acids. Thus, preventing the degradation of the incretin hormones GLP-1 and GIP by inhibition of DPP-4 has potential as a therapeutic strategy in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. ==DPP-4 characteristics== Since DPP-4 is a protease, it is not unexpected that inhibitors would likely have a peptide nature and this theme has carried through to contemporary research. Structure X-ray structures of DPP-4 that have been published since 2003 give rather detailed information about the structural characteristics of the binding site. Many structurally diverse DPP-4 inhibitors have been discovered and it is not that surprising considering the properties of the binding site: 1\\\\. A deep lipophilic pocket combined with several exposed aromatic side chains for achieving high affinity small molecule binding. 2\\\\. A significant solvent access that makes it possible to tune the physico-chemical properties of the inhibitors that leads to better pharmacokinetic behavior. DPP-4 is a 766-amino acid transmembrane glycoprotein that belongs to the prolyloligopeptidase family. It consists of three parts; a cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane region and an extracellular part. The extracellular part is divided into a catalytic domain and an eight- bladed Œ≤-propeller domain. The latter contributes to the inhibitor binding site. The catalytic domain shows an Œ±/Œ≤-hydrolase fold and contains the catalytic triad Ser630 - Asp708 - His740. The S1-pocket is very hydrophobic and is composed of the side chains: Tyr631, Val656, Trp662, Tyr666 and Val711. Existing X-ray structures show that there is not much difference in size and shape of the pocket that indicates that the S1-pocket has high specificity for proline residues Binding site Fig.3: The key interactions between the ligand and DPP-4 complex. The ligand's basic amine forms a hydrogen bonding network. The nitrile reacts with the catalytic active serine and forms an imidate adduct DPP-4 inhibitors usually have an electrophilic group that can interact with the hydroxyl of the catalytic serine in the active binding site (Figure 3). Frequently that group is a nitrile group but can also be boronic acid or diphenyl phosphonate. This electrophilic group can bind to the imidate complex with covalent bonds and slow, tight-binding kinetics but this group is also responsible for stability issues due to reactions with the free amino group of the P2-amino acid. Therefore, inhibitors without the electrophilic group have also been developed, but these molecules have shown toxicity due to affinity to other dipeptidyl peptidases, e.g. DPP-2, DPP-8 and DPP-9. DPP-4 inhibitors span diverse structural types. In 2007 few of the most potent compounds contain a proline mimetic cyanopyrrolidine P1 group. This group enhances the potency, probably due to a transient covalent trapping of the nitrile group by the active site Ser630 hydroxyl, leading to delayed dissociation and slow tight binding of certain inhibitors. When these potency enhancements were achieved, some chemical stability issues were noted and more advanced molecules had to be made. To avoid these stability issues, the possibility to exclude the nitrile group was investigated. Amino acids with aryl or polar side chains did not show appreciable DPP-4 inhibition and in fact, all compounds without the nitrile group in this research suffered a 20 to 50-fold loss of potency corresponding to the compounds containing the nitrile group. ==Discovery and development== It is important to find a fast and accurate system to discover new DPP-4 inhibitors with ideal therapeutic profiles. High throughput screening (HTS) usually gives low hit rates in identifying the inhibitors but virtual screening (VS) can give higher rates. VS has for example been used to screen for small primary aliphatic amines to identify fragments that could be placed in S1 and S2 sites of DPP-4. On the other hand, these fragments were not very potent and therefore identified as a starting point to design better ones. Three-dimensional models can provide a useful tool for designing novel DPP-4 inhibitors. Pharmacophore models have been made based on key chemical features of compounds with DPP-4 inhibitory activity. These models can provide a hypothetical picture of the primary chemical feature responsible for inhibitory activity. The first DPP-4 inhibitors were reversible inhibitors and came with bad side effects because of low selectivity. Researchers suspected that inhibitors with short half- lives would be preferred in order to minimize possible side effects. However, since clinical trials showed the opposite, the latest DPP-4 inhibitors have a long-lasting effect. One of the first reported DPP-4 inhibitor was P32/98 from Merck. It used thiazolidide as the P1-substitute and was the first DPP-4 inhibitor that showed effects in both animals and humans but it was not developed to a market drug due to side effects. Another old inhibitor is DPP-728 from Novartis, where 2-cyanopyrrolidine is used as the P1-substitute. The addition of the cyano group generally increases the potency. Therefore, researchers' attention was directed to those compounds. Usually, DPP-4 inhibitors are either substrate-like or non-substrate-like. Fig.4: A generic structure of a substrate-like inhibitor Substrate-like inhibitors Substrate-like inhibitors (Figure 4) are more common than the non-substrate- likes. They bind either covalently or non-covalently and have a basic structure where the P1-substituent occupies the S1-pocket and the P2-substituent occupies the S2-pocket. Usually they contain a proline mimetic that occupies the S1-pocket. Large substituents on the 2-cyanopyrrolidine ring are normally not tolerated since the S1-pocket is quite small. Since DPP-4 is identical with the T-cell activation marker CD26 and DPP-4 inhibitors are known to inhibit T-cell proliferation, these compounds were initially thought to be potential immunomodulators. When the function against type 2 diabetes was discovered, the cyanopyrrolidines became a highly popular research material. A little later vildagliptin and saxagliptin, which are the most developed cyanopyrrolidine DPP-4 inhibitors to date, were discovered. Cyanopyrrolidines Cyanopyrrolidines have two key interactions to the DPP-4 complex: 1\\\\. Nitrile in the position of the scissile bond of the peptidic substrate that is important for high potency. The nitrile group forms reversible covalent bonds with the catalytically active serine hydroxyl (Ser630), i.e. cyanopyrrolidines are competitive inhibitors with slow dissociation kinetics. 2\\\\. Hydrogen bonding network between the protonated amino group and a negatively charged region of the protein surface, Glu205, Glu206 and Tyr662. All cyanopyrrolidines have basic, primary or secondary amine, which makes this network possible but these compounds usually drop in potency if these amines are changed. Nonetheless, two patent applications unveil that the amino group can be changed, i.e. replaced by a hydrazine, but it is claimed that these compounds do not only act via DPP-4 inhibition but also prevent diabetic vascular complications by acting as a radical scavenger. =Structure-activity relationship (SAR)= Important structure-activity relationship: 1\\\\. Strict steric constraint exists around the pyrrolidine ring of cyanopyrrolidine-based inhibitors, with only hydrogen, fluoro, acetylene, nitrile, or methano substitution permitted. 2\\\\. Presence of a nitrile moiety on the pyrrolidine ring is critical to achieving potent activity Also, systematic SAR investigation has shown that the ring size and stereochemistry for the P2 position is quite conditioned. A 5-membered ring and L-configuration has shown better results than a 4-membered or 6-membered ring with D-configuration. Only minor changes on the pyrrolidine ring can be tolerated, since the good fit of the ring with the hydrophobic S1 pocket is very important for high affinity. Some trials have been made, e.g. by replacing the pyrrolidine with a thiazoline. That led to improved potency but also loss of chemical stability. Efforts to improve chemical stability often led to loss of specificity because of interactions with DPP-8 and DPP-9. These interactions have been connected with increased toxicity and mortality in animals. There are strict limitations in the P1 position and hardly any changes are tolerated. On the other hand, a variety of changes can be made in the P2 position. In fact, substitution with quite big branched side chains, e.g. tert-butylglycin, normally increased activity and chemical stability, which could lead to longer-lasting inhibition of the DPP-4 enzyme. It has also been noted that biaryl-based side chains can also give highly active inhibitors. It was originally believed that only lipophilic substitution would be tolerated. Now it is stated that also the substitution of polar negatively charged side-chains as well as hydrophilic substitution can lead to excellent inhibitory activity. =Chemical stability= Fig.5: Trans-rotamers are more stable then cis-rotamers. Cis-rotamers undergo intramolecular cyclization. In general, DPP-4 inhibitors are not very stable compounds. Therefore, many researchers focus on enhancing the stability for cyanopyrrolidines. The most widespread technique to improve chemical stability is to incorporate a steric bulk. The two cyanopyrrolidines that have been most pronounced, vildagliptin and saxagliptin, were created in this manner. K579 is a DPP-4 inhibitor discovered by researchers at Kyowa Hakko Kyogo. It had improved not only chemical stability but also a longer-lasting action. That long-lasting action was most likely due to slow dissociation of the enzyme- inhibitor complex and an active oxide metabolite that undergoes enterohepatic circulation. The discovery of the active oxide was in fact a big breakthrough as it led to the development of vildagliptin and saxagliptin. One major problem in DPP-4 inhibitor stability is intramolecular cyclization. The precondition for the intramolecular cyclization is the conversion of the trans-rotamer, which is the DPP-4 binding rotamer (Figure 5). Thus, preventing this conversion will increase stability. This prevention was successful when incorporating an amide group into a ring, creating a compound that kept the DPP-4 inhibitory activity that, did not undergo the intramolecular cyclization and was even more selective over different DPP enzymes. It has also been reported that a cyanoazetidine in the P1 position and a Œ≤-amino acid in the P2 position increased stability. =Vildagliptin= Vildagliptin (Galvus)(Figure 6) was first synthesized in May 1998 and was named after Edwin B. Villhauer. It was discovered when researchers at Novartis examined adamantyl derivatives that had proven to be very potent. The adamantyl group worked as a steric bulk and slowed intramolecular cyclization while increasing chemical stability. Furthermore, the primary metabolites were highly active. To avoid additional chiral center a hydroxylation at the adamantyl ring was carried out (Figure 6). The product, vildagliptin, was even more stable, undergoing intramolecular cyclization 30-times slower, and having high DPP-4 inhibitory activity and longer-lasting pharmacodynamic effect. =Saxagliptin= Fig.6: The basic structure of cyanopyrrolidines compared with vildagliptin, saxagliptin, and denagliptin Researchers at Bristol-Myers Squibb found that increased steric bulk of the N-terminal amino acid side- chain led to increased stability. To additionally increase stability the trans-rotamer was stabilized with a cis-4,5-methano substitution of the pyrrolidine ring, resulting in an intramolecular van-der-Waals interaction, thus preventing intramolecular cyclisation. Because of that increased stability, the researchers continued their investigation on cis-4,5-methano cyanopyrrolidines and came across with a new adamantyl derivative, which showed extraordinary ex vivo DPP-4 inhibition in rat plasma. Also noted, high microsomal turnover rate which indicated that the derivative was quickly converted to an active metabolite. After hydroxylation on the adamantyl group they had a product with better microsomal stability and improved chemical stability. That product was named saxagliptin (Onglyza) (Figure 6). In June 2008 AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb submitted a new drug application for Onglyza in the United States and a marketing authorization application in Europe. Approval was granted in the United States by the FDA in July 2009 for Onglyza 5 mg and Onglyza 2.5 mg. This was later combined with extended-release metformin (taken once daily) and approved by the FDA in January 2011 under the trade name Kombiglyze XR. =Denagliptin= Denagliptin (Figure 6) is an advanced compound with a branched side-chain at the P2 position, but also has (4S)-fluoro substitution on the cyanopyrrolidine ring. It is a well-known DPP-4 inhibitor developed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). Biological evaluations have shown that the S-configuration of the amino acid portion is essential for the inhibitory activity since the R-configuration showed reluctantly inhibition. These findings will be useful in future designs and synthesis of DPP-4 inhibitors. GSK suspended Phase III clinical trials in October 2008. Azetidine based compounds Informations for this group of inhibitors are quite restricted. Azetidine-based DPP-4 inhibitors can roughly be grouped into three main subcategories: 2-cyanoazetidines, 3-fluoroazetidines, and 2-ketoazetidines. The most potent ketoazetidines and cyanoazetidines have large hydrophobic amino acid groups bound to the azetidine nitrogen and are active below 100nM. Non-substrate-like inhibitors Non-substrate-like inhibitors do not take after dipeptidic nature of DPP-4 substrates. They are non-covalent inhibitors and usually have an aromatic ring that occupies the S1-pocket, instead of the proline mimetic. In 1999, Merck started a drug development program on DPP-4 inhibitors. When they started internal screening and medicinal chemistry program, two DPP-4 inhibitors were already in clinical trials, isoleucyl thiazolidide (P32/38) and NVP-DPP728 from Novartis. Merck in-licensed L-threo-isoleucyl thiazolidide and its allo stereoisomer. In animal studies, they found that both isomers had similar affinity for DPP-4, similar in vivo efficacy, similar pharmacokinetic and metabolic profiles. Nevertheless, the allo isomer was 10-fold more toxic. The researchers found out that this difference in toxicity was due to the allo isomer's greater inhibition of DPP-8 and DPP-9 but not because of selective DPP-4 inhibition. More research also supported that DPP-4 inhibition would not cause compromised immune function. Once this link between affinity for DPP-8/DPP-9 and toxicity was discovered, Merck decided on identifying an inhibitor with more than a thousandfold affinity for DPP-4 over the other dipeptidases. For this purpose, they used positional scanning libraries. From scanning these libraries, the researchers discovered that both DPP-4 and DPP-8 showed a strong preference for breaking down peptides with a proline at the P1 position but they found a great difference at the P2 site; i.e., they found that acidic functionality at the P2 position could provide a greater affinity for DPP-4 over DPP-8. Merck kept up doing even more research and screening. They stopped working on compounds from the Œ±-amino acid series related to isoleucyl thiazolidide due to lack of selectivity but instead they discovered a very selective Œ≤-amino acid piperazine series through SAR studies on two screening leads. When trying to stabilize the piperazine moiety, a group of bicyclic derivatives were made, which led to the identification of a potent and selective triazolopiperazine series. Most of these analogs showed excellent pharmacokinetic properties in preclinical species. Optimization of these compounds finally led to the discovery of sitagliptin. Sitagliptin Fig.7: The structure of sitagliptin Sitagliptin (Januvia) has a novel structure with Œ≤-amino amide derivatives (Figure 7). Since sitagliptin has shown excellent selectivity and in vivo efficacy it urged researchers to inspect the new structure of DPP-4 inhibitors with appended Œ≤-amino acid moiety. Further studies are being developed to optimize these compounds for the treatment of diabetes. In October 2006 sitagliptin became the first DPP-4 inhibitor that got FDA approval for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Crystallographic structure of sitagliptin along with molecular modeling has been used to continue the search for structurally diverse inhibitors. A new potent, selective and orally bioavailable DPP-4 inhibitor was discovered by replacing the central cyclohexylamine in sitagliptin with 3-aminopiperidine. A 2-pyridyl substitution was the initial SAR breakthrough since that group plays a significant role in potency and selectivity for DPP-4. It has been shown with an X-ray crystallography how sitagliptin binds to the DPP-4 complex: 1\\\\. The trifluorophenyl group occupies the S1-pocket 2\\\\. The trifluoromethyl group interacts with the side chains of residues Arg358 and Ser209. 3\\\\. The amino group forms a salt bridge with Tyr662 and the carboxylated groups of the two glutamate residues, Glu205 and Glu206. 4\\\\. The triazolopiperazine group collides with the phenyl group of residue Phe357 Fig.8: The structure of ABT-341 Constrained phenylethylamine compounds Researchers at Abbott Laboratories identified three novel series of DPP-4 inhibitors using HTS. After more research and optimization ABT-341 was discovered (Figure 8). It is a potent and selective DPP-4 inhibitor with a 2D-structure very similar to sitagliptin. However, the 3D-structure is quite different. ABT-341 also has a trifluorophenyl group that occupies the S1-pocket and the free amino group, but the two carbonyl groups are orientated 180¬∞ away from each other. ABT-341 is also believed to interact with the Tyr547, probably because of steric hindrance between the cyclohexenyl ring and the tyrosine side-chain. Omarigliptin is one of such compound which is in Phase-III development by Merck & Co. Pyrrolidine compounds The pyrrolidine type of DPP-4 inhibitors was first discovered after HTS. Research showed that the pyrrolidine rings were the part of the compounds that fit into the binding site. Further development has led to fluoro substituted pyrrolidines that show superior activity, as well as pyrrolidines with fused cyclopropylrings that are highly active. Xanthine-based compounds This is a different class of inhibitors that was identified with HTS. Aromatic heterocyclic-based DPP-4 inhibitors have gained increased attention recently. The first patents describing xanthines (Figure 10) as DPP-4 inhibitors came from Boehringer- Ingelheim(BI) and Novo Nordisk. When xanthine based DPP-4 inhibitors are compared with sitagliptin and vildagliptin it has shown a superior profile. Xanthines are believed to have higher potency, longer-lasting inhibition and longer-lasting improvement of glucose tolerance. Alogliptin Fig.9: Quinazolinone structure and alogliptin Alogliptin (Figure 9) is a novel DPP-4 inhibitor developed by the Takeda Pharmaceutical Company. Researchers hypothesized that a quinazolinone based structure (Figure 9) would have the necessary groups to interact with the active site on the DPP-4 complex. Quinazolinone based compounds interacted effectively with the DPP-4 complex, but suffered from low metabolic half-life. It was found that when replacing the quinazolinone with a pyrimidinedione, the metabolic stability was increased and the result was a potent, selective, bioavailable DPP-4 inhibitor named alogliptin. The quinazoline based compounds showed potent inhibition and excellent selectivity over related protease, DPP-8. However, short metabolic half-life due to oxidation of the A-ring phenyl group was problematic. At first, the researchers tried to make a fluorinated derivative. The derivative showed improved metabolic stability and excellent inhibition of the DPP-4 enzyme. However, it was also found to inhibit CYP 450 3A4 and block the hERG channel. The solution to this problem was to replace the quinazolinone with other heterocycles, but the quinazolinone could be replaced without any loss of DPP-4 inhibition. Alogliptin was discovered when quinazolinone was replaced with a pyrimidinedione. Alogliptin has shown excellent inhibition of DPP-4 and extraordinary selectivity, greater than 10.000 fold over the closely related serine proteases DPP-8 and DPP-9. Also, it does not inhibit the CYP 450 enzymes nor block the hERG channel at concentration up to 30 ¬µM. Based on this data, alogliptin was chosen for preclinical evaluation. In January 2007 alogliptin was undergoing the phase III clinical trial and in October 2008 it was being reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Linagliptin Fig.10: The structure of xanthine type inhibitors (TOP) and linagliptin (BOTTOM) Researchers at BI discovered that using a buty-2-nyl group resulted in a potent candidate, called BI-1356 (Figure 10). In 2008 BI-1356 was undergoing phase III clinical trials; it was released as linagliptin in May 2011. X-ray crystallography has shown that that xanthine type binds the DPP-4 complex in a different way than other inhibitors: 1\\\\. The amino group also interacts with the Glu205, Glu206 and Tyr662 2\\\\. The buty-2-nyl group occupies the S1-pocket 3\\\\. The uracil group undergoes a œÄ-stacking interaction with the Tyr547 residue 4\\\\. The quinazoline group undergoes a œÄ-stacking interaction with the Trp629 residue ==Pharmacology== {  align=\\"center\\" + Comparative pharmacology of sitagliptin and vildagliptin. - !

It was first published in 1981 by Avon Books in New York, and subsequently in London by Allison & Busby in 1984. The novel tells the story of Tommy, a character who first appeared in Wideman's short-story collection Damballah. Tommy is a party to a bungled smash-and-grab raid that leaves a dead man in a parking lot, so he hides out with Mother Bess, a crazy old woman who lives in Homewood, an African-American neighborhood of the East End. Elements of the character Tommy parallel the life of Wideman's brother Robbie, whose story he relates in a memoir published three years later called Brothers and Keepers. Hiding Place is the middle volume of what some critics call \\"The Homewood Trilogy\\". The other books are Damballah and Sent for You Yesterday. In 1992 the University of Pittsburgh Press published the three in one volume under the title The Homewood Books. In its preface Wideman admits discomfort with the term trilogy because it implies a plan of linking the volumes, and he claims he did not compose the books that way. ==References== * Category:1981 American novels Category:Novels set in Pittsburgh Category:Novels by John Edgar Wideman Category:Allison and Busby books ","title":"Hiding Place (novel)"},{"id":"20208285","text":"Warehouse and office of Holland on the canal Herengracht 149 in Amsterdam, March 1964.

The first publications were financed by his wife who had been a successful fashion cutter in Paris. After a few years the business could be located on the canal Herengracht in Amsterdam. In these years Holland specialized in social, Christian publications by original Dutch writers. A few translations were published, for instants (1937) S√∏ren Kierkegaard, (1951) P√§r Lagerkvist, and (1940) Denis de Rougemont. Next to books Holland also published a Christian literary magazine called Opwaartsche Wegen, which was published for 17 years. Poetry was published since 1950 in a series called De Windroos ==From 1951 until 1981== Warehouse and office of Holland on the river Spaarne in Haarlem In 1951 Jan Bernhard van Ulzen was assisted by his son Rolf van Ulzen, who succeeded in the late sixties of the previous century. As Rolf van Ulzen had started to participate in large international co-productions for encyclopaedia's and fairy tales, the location for office and warehouse in Amsterdam was no longer suitable. The lofts on the Herengracht were not strong enough to bear the weight of heavy books. The building in Haarlem was more suitable with storage possibilities on the ground floor. In 1955 (Bonte Boekjes series) he started with children's book. For these scripts he asked poets as he thought the imagination for poetry must be the same as for children's books.

Self-taught, he devoted himself to saving France's historic monuments, sculptures and tombs from the ravages of the French Revolution, notably those of Saint-Denis and Sainte-Genevi√®ve. == Life == The ravages of the Revolution caused the birth of the Mus√©e des monuments fran√ßais. Thanks to support from Jean Sylvain Bailly, Alexandre Lenoir successfully demanded that all art objects from state properties be gathered together in this museum. These objects were confiscated at different religious houses and stored in a single place to avoid their dispersal and destruction. Mandated by the National Constituent Assembly in 1791, he brought together the various objects he sought to conserve in the Couvent des Petits Augustins, a building which later was converted to become the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts. On 1 August 1793, the National Convention decreed that the tombs of \\"former kings\\" should be destroyed. Alexandre Lenoir witnessed the destruction of the royal tombs, with the bones thrown into a ditch. He struggled against revolutionary vandalism and managed to save statues and loot which he stored at the couvent des Petits-Augustins. In 1795, he opened the Mus√©e des monuments fran√ßais to the public ‚Äî he was its administrator for 30 years. In October 1796, Lenoir was among a number of artists who signed a petition supporting plans to seize works of art from Rome, in response to an early artists' petition orchestrated by Quatrem√®re de Quincy that remonstrated against these plans. In 1816, under the Bourbon Restoration, he had to return the majority of his collections to their former public and private owners. His wife, Ad√©la√Øde Binart (1771‚Äì1832), exhibited at the Salons under the name Ad√©la√Øde Lenoir.

His excellent figures had Victoria scuttled out for a paltry 78 off 26 overs. Despite the excellent bowling effort, Tasmania's batsmen, including Brown who made only 7, could not support the bowlers, and were also skittled, all out for 51, with John Tabart top scoring on 8. Brown again excelled at bowling in Victoria's second innings, taking 8 for 31 including two caught and bowled. Victoria had been dismissed for 67 off 20 overs, leaving Tasmania with a victory target of 95. Once again though, the Victorians demolished Tasmania's batting line-up, bowling the hosts out for just 25, with Brown out for a duck. Despite taking astonishing match figures of 15 for 73, as well as 4 catches, it was to be the only first-class match Brown would ever play. William Brown died on 28 August 1859 in Hobart, Tasmania, aged 52 years. ==See also== * List of Tasmanian representative cricketers ==External links== *Cricinfo Profile *Cricket archive Category:1807 births Category:1859 deaths Category:Australian cricketers Category:Tasmania cricketers Category:English emigrants to Australia ","title":"William Brown (Tasmanian cricketer)"},{"id":"20208445","text":"The Uniform Bills of Lading Act was adopted in 1909 and passed by the US Uniform Law Commission.

In 2007, Foulds published his first book, The Truth About These Strange Times. The novel, which is set in the present day, is concerned in part with the World Memory Championships. In 2008, Foulds published a substantial narrative poem entitled The Broken Word, described by the critic Peter Kemp as a \\"verse novella\\". It is a fictional version of some events during the Mau Mau Uprising. Writing in The Guardian, David Wheatley suggested that \\"The Broken Word is a moving and pitiless depiction of the world as it is rather than as we might like it to be, and the terrible things we do to defend our place in it\\". In 2009, his novel The Quickening Maze was published. Recommending the work in a 'books of the year' survey, novelist Julian Barnes declared: 'Having last year greatly admired Adam Foulds's long poem \\"The Broken Word\\", I uncharitably wondered whether his novel The Quickening Maze (Cape) might allow me to tacitly advise him to stick to verse. Some hope: this story of the Victorian lunatic asylum where the poet John Clare and Tennyson's brother Septimus were incarcerated is the real thing. It's not a \\"poetic novel\\" either, but a novelistic novel, rich in its understanding and representation of the mad, the sane, and that large overlapping category in between'. On 7 January 2010, he was published on the Guardian Website's \\"Over by Over\\" (OBO) coverage of day five of the Third Test of the South Africa v England series at Newlands, Cape Town. Foulds's published email corrected the OBO writer, Andy Bull, who, in the 77th over, posted lines by Donne in reference to Ian Ronald Bell in verse form: \\"No doubt I won't be the first pedant to let you know that the Donne you quote is in fact from a prose meditation. The experiment in retrofitting twentieth century free verse technique to it is interesting but the line breaks shouldn't really be there.\\" In 2013 he was included in the Granta list of 20 best young writers,.

He was also an ordained Canon in the Catholic clergy. Falc'hun was professor at the Universities of Rennes and Brest. Contrary to the mainstream opinion of linguists, Falc'hun took the view that Breton was derived from the Gaulish form of Continental Celtic, rather than from the Brythonic Celtic that were introduced by British migrants. He was accused of using linguistics to promote a French nationalist political agenda. ==Theories== Falc'hun's early work included an edition of the writings of Jean-Marie Perrot. He created a particular Breton orthography (known as \\"university\\" orthography) which was intended to replace the spelling system known as \\"Peurunvan\\", used from 1911 to 1941. His spelling, which does not use \\"zh\\", also abandons the Breton \\"c'h\\" convention, introduced in the seventeenth century, and which is even used in the official French form of Falc'hun's own name. In 1951 Falc'hun developed his view that Breton developed from native Gaulish, arguing that the incoming Britons encountered a Gaulish-speaking rather than Latin-speaking population, and that the two variants of Celtic merged.Glanville Price, The Celtic Connection, Colin Smythe, 1994, p.7 Criticising the views of Joseph Loth and L√©on Fleuriot, Falc'hun claimed that the Vannetais dialect of eastern Breton was almost wholly Gaulish. \\"I am convinced that the dialect of Vannes, especially in southern Blavet, is a Gallic survival, little influenced by British contributions, and other dialects are simply Gaulish marked by the language of origin of the island immigrants\\".Je suis persuad√© que le dialecte vannetais , surtout au sud du Blavet , est une survivance gauloise peu influenc√©e par l‚Äôapport breton, et les autres dialectes un gaulois simplement plus marqu√© par la langue des immigr√©s d‚Äôorigine insulaire¬ª (Perspectives nouvelles sur l‚Äôhistoire de la langue bretonne, p. 530) ==Controversy== Falc'hun's views became controversial after the publication of his 1981 book, Perspectives nouvelles sur l‚Äôhistoire de la langue bretonne (New Perspectives on the History of the Breton Language), in which his theories were linked to nationalist ideology. It was published in a series entitled \\"The nation in question\\", as part of several texts entitled \\"the critical national ideology of...\\". These books were published in the context of a struggle against Breton nationalism, which sought to emphasise that the Bretons were non- French.\\"s‚Äôinscrivant dans le cadre d‚Äôune lutte contre le nationalisme\\", Perspectives nouvelles sur l‚Äôhistoire de la langue bretonne, p.7 Because of this, Falc'hun became a hate figure among Breton nationalists. According to his friend Fran√ßoise Morvan, he suffered numerous \\"telephone harassment campaigns\\".Fran√ßoise Morvan, Le Monde comme si - Nationalisme et d√©rive identitaire en Bretagne, Actes Sud, 2002, p 132. L√©on Fleuriot has accepted Falc'hun's view that Breton was influenced by surviving local forms of Celtic, but rejects Falc'hun's argument that Vannetais is native Gaulish. ==Publications== * Le syst√®me consonantique du breton avec une √©tude comparative de phon√©tique exp√©rimentale - Th√®se pr√©sent√©e √† la facult√© des Lettres de l'universit√© de Rennes, Rennes, imp.

He started in pirate radio and DJ'ing in the 1970's. He presented various TV shows such as The Beatbox and had radio shows on 2FM. He is also known for making contributions to the cult children's television strand, Dempsey's Den, hosted by his radio colleague at that time, Ian Dempsey. He resigned from RT√â in 2002 and disappeared from public until 2011. Young is distinguishable by his moustache which he grew when he was 15 after noticing in the RT√â Guide that people who worked in RT√â had moustaches. Tony Fenton affectionately called him \\"Simes.\\"Young, Gifted And Er, Back? Hot Press. 19 September 2011. ==Career== Young presented Simon's Choice or Simon's Saturday Choice on Saturday mornings from 10:00 - 13:00 in the late 1980s. The catchphrase \\"Hey Simon, What toime is ittt?\\" originates from this time. Choice was a marketing tool used by the Bank of Ireland, which offered cheap \\"Fair Cards\\" for under-26s who opened a \\"Choice\\" account at one of their branches. Young gave the British band Bros his approval as they gained minor success with the song, \\"When Will I Be Famous?\\". Young made regular substitute appearances for Ian Dempsey, and these appearances extended as far as the children's television favourite Dempsey's Den on RT√â Two. He was often seen in convulsions laughing at Dustin the Turkey, which at times rendered him speechless on camera. Young's other radio shows included The Beatbox and the 2FM Weekend Breakfast Show on Saturday and Sunday in the late 1990s. Young also filled the role of Jimmy in the 30-minute Jimmy's Slot for a time on Dempsey's 2fm breakfast show in the 1990s, popularising the phrase \\"Ger owa dat garden!\\" After Young was forced to leave 2fm, the station continued broadcasting Ireland's Biggest Jukebox, currently fronted by station controller John Clarke. Young stopped working for RT√â in 2002. He returned to the public in July 2011 when he gave an interview to Hot Press. Young appeared on RT√â Radio 1's The John Murray Show in August 2011 and talked about his battle with depression and other illnesses.

The Staiths is a large multi-level timber structure built out into the river on a curved planform, originally built to load bulk materials, (particularly coal), from railway carriages on railway tracks into merchant vessels moored alongside. The curved shape of the Staiths encloses part of the river to form a protected basin. This section of the river is subject to tidal influence and the usable basin area therefore varies with the tide. The mud exposed at low tide is an important wading ground for coastal birds. ==History== After a long period of industrial use throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, including development of a large gasworks for the production of town gas from coal, the site became disused. In order to regenerate the area, Gateshead Council included the site in the Gateshead Garden Festival, held between May and October 1990. Remediation for the purposes of the Garden Festival was restricted to regrading and capping to provide a suitable medium for planting. This included the use of earth mounding to cover the remaining buried structures, such as gasometer bases. Following the Garden Festival the site was sold to a subsidiary of the Sir Robert McAlpine civil engineering business. Part of the site was designated an Enterprise Zone in order to encourage new employment uses but repeated marketing over nearly a decade failed to attract any commercial or industrial buyers for the site. Gateshead Council's original intention was that the site would be taken up for a major employment use. Japanese construction equipment manufacturer Komatsu had sponsored the Japanese Garden on the site for the Festival and would have fitted this expectation but concentrated their production capacity in nearby Birtley instead. After years of lying vacant awaiting a use, a final remarketing exercise was undertaken by local land agents in 1999. This invited offers for any use, with the intention of changing the Council's expectations for an employment use on the site. As a result of this process, the North East region of Wimpey Homes made an acceptable financial offer based on redevelopment of the land for housing. ==Reclamation and redevelopment== Initially, use of the land for housing was considered undesirable by the local statutory bodies for two reasons; the Council's continued wish to protect the site for much needed employment in the area, and; the Environment Agency's concerns regarding the extent and nature of the remaining contamination Regarding the protection of the site for a major employer, after almost a decade of marketing and false starts, no employment use was in prospect so this was unnecessarily blocking redevelopment of a significant urban brownfield site. Gateshead Council had been particularly concerned to maintain sites in their area which were large enough to attract a major manufacturing facility. As time went on, the likelihood of such an employer wishing to establish themselves in the area became less and less likely so it became harder for the Council to justify sterilising the land with an unrealistic intended use. Regarding the EA's concerns, this needed to be addressed by a comprehensive programme of sampling, analysis and risk assessment prior to designing a reclamation scheme. This was put in motion by Wimpey Homes who assembled a project team to carry out pre acquisition due diligence and pre planning consultation. This proceeded despite Gateshead Council's continuing concerns about loss of employment land until the project team was joined by fashion designer Wayne Hemingway, who brought his personal passion for innovation and skills of persuasion to bear on key members and officers of the Council. As a result of internal reorganisation, Wimpey's interest in the site was then transferred to their newly formed specialist city centre development business, George Wimpey City. While conceptual design work with the Hemingways continued apace, the considerable challenges of achieving a workable remediation scheme were tackled by AIG and Arup in negotiation with the Environment Agency. The central question was whether residential development could take place without removal of all of the underlying contaminated material. After much investigation and testing of the existing ground, a remediation scheme was prepared which removed the isolated hotspots of contamination and cut off pathways from the remaining lower level contamination to the surface and adjoining river, involving a further regrading and capping exercise using clean material imported into the site. AIG undertook to carry out the remediation with Arup involved in verification of the completed work. AIGs works also included removing many of the large buried obstructions which still remained from the earlier industrial uses and Arup's completion testing included ensuring the bearing capacity of the remediated site was suitable for the intended use. Most importantly, the thickness of the proposed clean capping material was to be measured after being placed to satisfy George Wimpey and Gateshead Council that the work was in compliance with the remediation design. The twin barriers to development of planning use and contamination are not unusual issues to be overcome for development to take place, however, they were of notable complexity on this particular site and they were only resolved with considerable effort by the professional team involved. As it happened, neither of these issues were to prove the most contentious barrier to planning consent or implementation, as revealed when the design of the project moved into detailed consultation with the Council. ==Design process== Wayne and his wife, Gerardine, complimented the existing professional team rather than replacing any part of it, although there was a change of Architect in order to provide a clean break from previous design studies. There remained a need for a team of housing development design professionals as the Hemingways were concept driven and did not claim to be able to provide detailed technical information which would still be required for regulatory approval and construction. The project team comprised; Hemingway Design IDP Partnership, Newcastle upon Tyne (Architects) Glen Kemp, Gateshead (Landscape Architects)- note that for the purposes of achieving the desired Homezone, Glen Kemp were given design responsibility for the public realm in its entirety, replacing much of the conventional highway design role Arup, Newcastle (Civil and Structural Engineers) Hall & Partners, Newcastle upon Tyne (Cost Consultants) As mentioned previously, the sampling, analysis and design for the remediation of the site was dealt with by specialist sub contractor AIG Remediation, with Arup undertaking a parallel role monitoring post reclamation contamination and ground engineering information. In addition to the design team, a North East Public Relations firm, Cool Blue PR, were engaged by the developers to assist in managing media interest and the production of marketing material. The Hemingway's approach was to follow European models of large scale housing, in particular the modern design aesthetic of newbuild housing in Malmo and the use of Homezone shared circulation routes mixing pedestrians with vehicles, as practiced in the Dutch Woonerf. At the time, the development was the largest newbuild Homezone in the UK. This was an ironic turn in the development of this style of shared external circulation space, as these were experimented with in Warrington and other English newbuild housing in the early 1970s, before being taken up on continental Europe and developed into the predominant residential street form in the Netherlands. Wayne and Gerardine's conceptual aesthetic and functional ideas were interpreted into a gridlike circulation layout creating horseshoes of around 20 terraced properties backing onto a shared garden space, enclosed & gated to provide privacy and security. These groupings around shared gardens were intended to create a tangible sense of neighbourhood, each grouping and garden being different from the next. Initial pre planning consultation with the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, (the Government's advisor on architecture, urban design and public space), produced some adverse comments on the 'grid like' street pattern which had resulted from creating these groups of homes. Much time was spent considering whether the grid pattern would be apparent at street level as many of the long vistas were broken by staggers in junctions. In the event, this combination of deliberately blocked long views and a 'busy' public realm design, limited the perception of the overall layout for anyone stood within the Homezone or garden areas. While the Hemingways' influence was to cover all aspects of the project, Gerardine was particularly effective in selecting external materials which were interesting for both their colour and texture. Research into the durability and cost of the proposed materials was often inconclusive as not only were they not already in use for housing construction, they were often not even available in the UK. Despite the elevational treatments being unconventional, Gateshead Council exerted relatively little influence on these and instead concentrated their comments and concerns on the public realm design, most particularly the Homezone areas. It was these Homezones that became the single most contentious aspect of the scheme, involving frequent meetings of 12 to 15 people, (with representatives from the Council, George Wimpey City and the professional team), solely to discuss how the Homezones could function without compromising safety. The Homezone, despite being prototyped in the UK in the late 1960s and early 1970s, was at the time alien to most of established highway design practice in the UK. The much evolved and refined Dutch version, the Woonerf, is supported by legislation which gives pedestrians priority over vehicles within these shared streets. This inverts the expectation of UK motorists, who would expect a pedestrian in the carriageway to give way to a vehicle. Resolving these legislative differences involved the involvement of central Government officers who were already aware of various other Homezone projects around the UK. All of these projects, (whether newbuild or remodelling existing streets), suffered from a mismatch between their design intent to create a higher quality of public realm which could be actively used by residents with the existing legislation that presumed anyone standing in the road was inviting an accident. The support of central Government included an award of Homezone grant towards the additional costs involved in the creation of a more complex public realm. This grant was specific to external works costs in the first phase of the development so would provide early support for the design principles being established for the project as a whole. It was only after many months of negotiation and compromise that a workable public realm design was achieved. The key to finally obtaining the Council's consent was the combination of a sophisticated design solution prepared jointly by Glen Kemp and Arup with a management regime prepared by George Wimpey Citynd CPM, the Managing Agents who would act on behalf of residents to maintain the unadopted and communally owned elements of the development. ==Implementation and outcome== Once planning consent was obtained, the remediation contract was placed with AIG and work began. The masterplan for the development was divided into phases with the initial construction intended to take place to either side of the new main access off Team Street towards the east end of the site. This access included provision for the dedicated route of the new high speed bus link between Gateshead town centre and the MetroCentre. As AIG's works moved westwards across the site, their working area was redefined and fenced to allow construction to begin of the initial phase of housing. The development had received much local publicity during the planning process due to the involvement of the Hemingways. This initial interest from potential buyers enabled an early marketing launch of the first phase of the project, i.e. selling off plan. While this early selling process was becoming the norm for large capital intensive projects which would be attractive to investors, such as city centre apartments, it was not common practice for the sale of family/'estate' housing. This was partly due to a reluctance by developers to commit to selling prices too early in the development programme, thereby losing out on any possible increases either due to inflation or by demonstrating the actual product using an onsite showhome. The initial sales release was launched at the Marriott Hotel in Gateshead. Such was the interest that had built up, based mostly on press coverage of the Hemingways' involvement, that potential buyers queued for many hours before the evening launch and most of the first release was sold out in a few hours, Sales staff working into the early hours with buyers to complete reservation paperwork. In order to limit the influence of speculators, buyers were restricted to a maximum of two properties each. The success of this initial launch event prompted an early review of selling prices, which were increased for the second release. The development has won a number of national and regional awards, which include: RIBA Housing Design Award 2005 - Best large project CABE Building for Life 2005 - Silver Award and Best Residential Project Building Magazine - Best Housing-Led Regeneration Project Northumbria in Bloom - Silver Gilt Award and Urban Regeneration Category Winner RICS North East Renaissance Awards 2006 - Residential Category Winner Staiths South Bank achieved the highest rating of any large scale scheme in a recent CABE audit. Despite the acclaim that the development has received from the design community, the complex design and management of the public realm has caused difficulties for the leaseholders. Most obviously, maintenance of such an environment is an expensive operation placing severe pressure on service charges and this has created a tension between leaseholders and the Managing Agents. These remain relatively affordable properties whose buyers may not be willing or able to pay significant additional costs to maintain the estate as a whole. These maintenance issues are combined with the difficulty of ensuring that vehicles are parked within areas designated for parking rather than obstructing the circulation space within the Homezone. As is often the case, car ownership exceeds that envisaged by the design team so there are more vehicles than allowed for. The usual design/regulatory approach is restrict parking provision to restrict car use, in practice residents tend not to accept this restriction and find space to park wherever they can, preferably as close to their front door as possible. A good example of design and regulation failing to recognise the realities of human behaviour. The challenge for future Homezone projects is to: 1\\\\. Achieve a public realm which is usable for shared circulation and play while being affordable in relation to the ability to pay of the residents/leaseholders. 2\\\\. Achieve a workable balance between control of the vehicle to enhance the value of the public realm for non drivers and realistic parking provision.

Born in Azerbaijan and of Iraqi descent, Hamad moved to Sweden and represented their national team before switching to represent Iraq. ==Early and personal life== Hamad was born in Azerbaijan, and is of Kurdish descent. His family originates from Ranya, Iraqi Kurdistan. They sought refugee status in both Turkmenistan and Russia before settling in Sweden in 1992, when Jiloan was two years old. Mohammed Hamad, Jiloan's father, was a guerrilla warrior in the Kurdish peshmerga for 15 years before fleeing Iraq together with his wife and children. ==Club career== BK Forward Jiloan Hamad started his footballing career at the local club BK Forward in √ñrebro, where he grew up. He debuted in the senior team in 2006, aged 16, when the club competed in the Swedish third tier called Division 1. During the upcoming two seasons, he played 23 competitive games for the club, scoring 8 goals. During this period, he enjoyed a fruitful partnership with Jimmy Durmaz, his childhood friend who later would move on to play with him at Malm√∂ FF. Before switching to the Scanian team he was refused by the local giants √ñrebro SK, with the club citing that Hamad \\"was too short\\". Malm√∂ FF Hamad with Malm√∂ FF in 2011 Hamad came to Malm√∂ FF from BK Forward in December 2007. He made his Allsvenskan debut on 17 September 2008 in a 0‚Äì4-loss against IF Elfsborg. After only having played one match for the club in 2008, Hamad had a breakthrough in 2009 when he played 20 matches and scored two goals. In 2010, he battled with teammate Jimmy Durmaz for the position as left midfielder. Hamad ended up playing 27 games although only starting in 10, the majority of which were played as right midfielder. In the final game of 2010, he scored the game-winning goal against Mj√§llby AIF that secured the title, the day after his 20th birthday. In 2011, Hamad started the season with injury problems and missed the start of the season. He recovered and became the natural choice for playing right midfielder after team-mate Guillermo Molins was sold in the summer transfer window of 2011. Hamad also participated in the club's campaign to qualify for the 2011‚Äì12 UEFA Champions League and scored the goal that took the club through to the play-off round after equalizing at home against Rangers. He continued to play in Europe as the club qualified for the group stage of the 2011‚Äì12 UEFA Europa League after losing in the play-off round of the Champions League. During the 2011 season Hamad signed a new contract to the end of the 2013 season. Hamad played all of Malm√∂ FF's 30 league matches during the 2012 season. He also scored six goals which was his best goal production since joining the club. Hamad was also given the captaincy for the majority of the team's matches. Former captain Daniel Andersson had stepped down to focus on coaching duties before the beginning of the season and new captain Ulrich Vinzents received limited time on the pitch. The 2013 season was Hamad's first and only season as full-time captain for the club. In total he played 28 matches and scored eight goals in the league. He also played all matches for the club during the qualification stage for the 2013‚Äì14 UEFA Europa League and scored two goals. Some of his goals in the early part of the season was match-deciding, on 14 April 2013 he scored the only goal of the game in the home fixture against Kalmar FF, one week later he made the same accomplishment in the away fixture against AIK.

Deputies for Education, Research, and Students and Culture are some of the other departments. In addition, there is a Science and Technology Park, and central library with more than 100000 books and magazines. IKIU has formed the Brilliant-Talent students‚Äô office to recognize top students and to support and guide the students, providing educational and welfare facilities. It has seven faculties. The Persian Language Teaching Center has hosted students from more than 96 countries, enjoying language labs, library, and computer site. Amirreza Vakilifard is the founding member of the first-ever Persian Language teaching department aimed at foreign learners in Iran. He has been teaching Persian language to foreign students since 1995 at the Imam Khomeini International University(IKIU) in Qazvin, Iran. ==History== The university was established in 1991 to further culture, civilization, and thought of Muslim world. As an educational, research, and cultural institution under the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology, IKIU has the following aims: * Furthering and promoting Islamic culture in the Muslim world * Propagating Islamic culture and thought and science and technology on an international scale * Introducing grand figures of the Muslim world with the purpose of consolidating Islamic culture * Taking advantage of innovations and developments in science and technology to the benefit of Iran and other Islamic countries * Training committed specialists with the purpose of making Islamic countries scientifically and culturally self-reliant * Contributing toward the development of higher education in IranMain aims behind the establishment of IKIU ==Status== The university offers 30 undergraduate courses and 13 master courses with a faculty of 183 staff teachers.

A total of 200 to 250 international students are admitted into the Center for Teaching Persian to non-natives each year. Since not all of the academic levels and programs of study required by such students are available in IKIU and because the number of international applicants is on the rise, some international students will be referred to other leading universities in the country to continue their studies after they complete Persian language and pre-university courses. 500 international students from 55 countries are doing their 22 undergraduate and graduate courses at IKIU. Country-wide, around 5000 such students are doing humanities, engineering, science, and medicine. ==Campus== The main campus of Imam Khomeini International University is in Qazvin, Iran.

Four houses were formed, each associated with a name and a colour. They were Atkinson (yellow), Lyon (blue), de Lacy (green) and King Edward (red). Classes corresponding to years were numbered from 1 to 5 with three streamed classes in each year from and including Form 2. Upon entry to the school boys were placed in classes 1A, 1B and 1C ordered by surname alphabetically. In the second form streaming started with the top 30 rated pupils being placed in 2R (R for Rapid as year 3 was skipped by these pupils, passing directly to 4R). The other classes in the second form were 2A, 2B, 2C based on academic level. Thereafter the classes were for example in the 5th form: 5R, 5A, 5B. All pupils had a form master and went to classes with specialist Teachers. There were not enough rooms for all classes to have a form room - some of the upper sixth form used to have the corridor outside the dining room as their form room. Only a few pupils stayed on for the sixth form, many pupils left the school at 16. It was expected that the R-class pupils would go on to the sixth form. The Grammar school had a tradition of playing Rugby Union and there were fields outside for this purpose, which were converted for cricket in the summer. Comprehensive The school became a comprehensive with a sixth form in 1978. Pontefract Girls' High School, the girls' grammar school became New College, Pontefract, and 11-18 school. In 1987, Pontefract schools lost their sixth form, with a sixth form college being established at NEW College, Pontefract. Academy The school converted to academy status on 1 April 2013 and is one of two high schools with Carleton High School in Pontefract Academies Trust.

They are used in structured programming to arrange program modules into a tree. Each module is represented by a box, which contains the module's name. The tree structure visualizes the relationships between modules.James Martin, Carma L. McClure (1988). Structured Techniques: The Basis for Case. Prentice Hall. p.56. == Overview == This hierarchy chart represents data passing between two modules. When the module Pay_Bill is executed, the pseudocode checks if the bill is already paid by searching for the payment receipt (execute Search_Receipt). If the receipt is not found then it will execute the module Give_Money_To_Debt_Collector to finish the job. A structure chart is a top-down modular design tool, constructed of squares representing the different modules in the system, and lines that connect them. The lines represent the connection and or ownership between activities and subactivities as they are used in organization charts.H. Fujita & V. Gruhn (2004). New Trends in Software Methodologies, Tools and Techniques. Page 6. In structured analysis structure charts, according to Wolber (2009), \\"are used to specify the high-level design, or architecture, of a computer program. As a design tool, they aid the programmer in dividing and conquering a large software problem, that is, recursively breaking a problem down into parts that are small enough to be understood by a human brain. The process is called top-down design, or functional decomposition. Programmers use a structure chart to build a program in a manner similar to how an architect uses a blueprint to build a house. In the design stage, the chart is drawn and used as a way for the client and the various software designers to communicate. During the actual building of the program (implementation), the chart is continually referred to as \\"the master-plan\\".David Wolber (2009) \\"Structure Charts: Supplementary Notes Structure Charts and Bottom-up Implementation: Java Version. Accessed 8 November 2009 A structure chart depicts * the size and complexity of the system, and * number of readily identifiable functions and modules within each function and * whether each identifiable function is a manageable entity or should be broken down into smaller components. A structure chart is also used to diagram associated elements that comprise a run stream or thread. It is often developed as a hierarchical diagram, but other representations are allowable. The representation must describe the breakdown of the configuration system into subsystems and the lowest manageable level. An accurate and complete structure chart is the key to the determination of the configuration items (CI), and a visual representation of the configuration system and the internal interfaces among its CIs(define CI clearly). During the configuration control process, the structure chart is used to identify CIs and their associated artifacts that a proposed change may impact. == Structure chart construction == A process flow diagram describing the construction of a structure chart by a so-called Subject Matter Experts (SME). According to Wolber (2009), \\"a structure chart can be developed starting with the creating of a structure, which places the root of an upside- down tree which forms the structure chart. The next step is to conceptualize the main sub-tasks that must be performed by the program to solve the problem. Next, the programmer focuses on each sub-task individually, and conceptualizes how each can be broken down into even smaller tasks. Eventually, the program is broken down to a point where the leaves of the tree represent simple methods that can be coded with just a few program statements\\". In practice, see figure, first it is checked if a structure chart has been developed already. If so an expert needs to review it to ensure it represents the current structure and if not, updates the chart where needed.. == See also == * Computer-aided software engineering * System context diagram * Decomposition diagram * Function model * HIPO * Structured Analysis and Design Technique * Warnier/Orr diagram * Work breakdown structure == References  Further reading == * Sarah Brooks (1981). \\"Structure Charts and Basic Programming\\". in: MATYC Journal, v15 n2 p. 107-112 Spring 1981. * Tom DeMarco (1979).

Detrick, who was a teaching surgeon on the faculty of the Johns Hopkins University Hospital, Baltimore, served in France during the First World War and was a member of the Maryland National Guard when he died of a heart attack in 1931. ==Biography== Although born in Frederick County, Maryland, where his family had lived for five generations, Detrick lived a portion of his childhood in Orange, Virginia, where his grandfather owned Montpelier, President James Madison‚Äôs former home. He graduated from the Rockefeller Institute and completed his medical internship at Bellevue Hospital, both in New York City. He was appointed a lieutenant in the Medical Reserve Corps, U.S. Army in April 1918. His first brief assignment was to the installation hospital at Camp Wadsworth, South Carolina, followed by a tour of duty with the 28th Aero Squadron, 3rd Pursuit Group in France. He supported the major American offensives at the battles of Saint-Mihiel and of Meuse/Argonne. He was discharged at Camp Dix, New Jersey, in July 1919. Detrick returned to Baltimore and opened a private practice on Linden Avenue, eventually earning a teaching position on the staff and faculty of Johns Hopkins University Hospital.

The 416th was among the first USAAF dedicated night fighter squadron formed. Trained in the Douglas P-70, a modified A-20 Havoc bomber using a U.S. version of the British Mk IV radar. At the time the P-70 was the only American night fighter available.Northrop P-61 Black Widow‚ÄîThe Complete History and Combat Record, Garry R. Pape, John M.

After completing its initial training by April, the squadron crossed the Atlantic on the RMS Queen Elizabeth and landed in the United Kingdom on 11 May. Pausing briefly for training under VIII Fighter Command the Squadron was attached to the Royal Air Force) for familiarization i bnb theater night fighter techniques. There, it was equipped with RAF Bristol Beaufighters through a \\"reverse Lend-Lease\\" program until an American aircraft could be produced. Upon arrival in England the squadron received additional training with Royal Air Force night fighter units at several bases in early 1943 achieving the first victory on 24 July. Through the summer, they conducted daytime convoy escort and strike missions, but thereafter flew primarily at night. 416th Night Fighter Squadron Northrop P-61B-15-NO Black Widow 42-39682 The unit then moved to North Africa for operations with Twelfth Air Force. There, the squadron fell under the operational control of the Northwest African Coastal Air Force, a Combined allied organization with British, Free-French, and other American units. Carried out defensive night patrols over Allied held territory during the North African campaign, also conducted night interdiction raids on German positions in Algeria and Tunisia. The defeat of German, Italian, and Vichy French forces in North Africa allowed the 416th to move with other allied forces into Italy in September 1943. During its first year there, the squadron patrolled harbors and escorted shipping; however, in September 1944 the 416th shifted to more aggressive activities to provide defensive cover for the Fifth Army and make intruder sweeps into enemy territory. Also continued defensive patrols and offensive night attacks on Axis positions on Sardinia, Corsica, and in Southern France. With the fall of Germany, the unit became part of the United States Air Forces in Europe army of occupation. Moved in August 1945 to AAF Horsching, Austria, for occupation duties. A year later, the 416th relocated to AAF Schweinfurt, Germany, where it inactivated on 9 November 1946. Cold War Reactivated in 1953 at George AFB, California as an F-86 Sabre Fighter-Bomber Squadron. Initially equipped with F-51D Mustang aircraft, the 416th quickly converted to F-86F Sabre jet aircraft and started participating in air defense operations, exercises, and firepower demonstrations. Then in September 1953, the 416th received Arctic indoctrination at Eielson AFB, Alaska. Next, the squadron joined its parent unit, the 21st Fighter-Bomber Group, in Operation Boxkite at North Field, South Carolina from 17 April to 15 May 1954.History and Lineage of the F-117A Stealth Fighter Organizations, Special Study HO-91-2, Office of History, Headquarters 37th Fighter Wing, Twelfth Air Force, Tactical Air Command, December 1991 416th TFS F-100D 55-3604 at Kunsan AB, South Korea The 416th moved to France in November‚ÄìDecember 1954. For this move, the ground echelon left George AFB, California, on 26 November and arrived at Toul-Rosieres Air Base on 12 December. The flight echelon left George on 13 December and traveled to France by the northern air route. Bad weather, however, delayed the movement, and the flight element did not reach Toul-Rosiere until 22 February 1955. From then until December 1957, the squadron participated in NATO tactical operations and exercises, stood air defense alert, and periodically deployed aircraft and crews to Wheelus AB, Libya, for fighter weapons training. The unit was not operational from 10 January to 8 February 1958. On 25 March 1958, the 416th activated under Fifth Air Force at Misawa Air Base, Japan, where it started converting from F-84G Thunderjets to F-100 Super Sabres. Later in July, the squadron joined the 21st Fighter-Bomber Wing; however, the USAF directed the 416th to transfer its F-100s to another unit. This order temporarily interrupted its conversion and forced the 416th to fly F-84Gs until May 1959, when a full complement of F-100s arrived. During this period in the Far East, the units crews flew tactical operations and exercises in South Korea, Taiwan, Okinawa, Singapore, the Philippines, and other places in the Far East. Vietnam War In June 1964, the 416th moved to England AFB, Louisiana, where it joined the 3d Tactical Fighter Wing (Tactical Air Command) for training. From 17 October through 7 December 1964, the squadron deployed a flight to Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, where it operated under various higher headquarters. This deployment, however, was just a precursor to even greater involvement in Southeast Asia (SEA) as the entire squadron deployed there in March 1965. It operated in turn from Clark AB, Philippines, Da Nang AB, South Vietnam, Bien Hoa AB, South Vietnam, and again at Clark until July 1965, when it returned to England AFB. While in SEA, the unit flew 1,711 combat sorties between 19 March and 14 July to fly flak suppression, weather reconnaissance, MiG combat air patrol, and air strike missions. The 416th deployed with the 3 TFW to SEA in November 1965 to Tan Son Nhut AB, South Vietnam. There, the 6250th Combat Support Group controlled the squadron's operations until June 1966, when it rejoined the 3 TFW at Bien Hoa AB. The 416th remained at Bien Hoa until its April 1967 reassignment to the 37th TFW. In May, the squadron moved to Ph√π C√°t Air Base without a break in combat missions. Forward air control assignments On 15 June 1967, Detachment 1, 416 TFS became the nucleus of Commando Sabre, a special activity using F-100F two-seat trainers to fly fast Forward Air Control (FAC) operations under the call sign Misty. From the 16th to the 28th, they learned aerial refueling techniques. The unit's participation in Commando Sabre even continued after a move to Tuy Hoa AB and reassignment to the 31 TFW. At that time, operational control over Commando Sabre passed from the 37th TFW to the 31st TFW.Schlight, John (1969). Project CHECO Report: JET FORWARD AIR CONTROLLERS IN SEASIA.

The original 16 Misties were flight leader qualified with over 100 combat missions to their credit; four of them were already trained as FACs. After this quartet trained the other dozen, planes from this FAC detachment would fly missions into North Vietnam's Route Package 1 or against the defenses of the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Steel Tiger. The Misty pilots committed to serving for either 120 days or 75 FAC sorties, whichever came first. Their standard operating profile of 450 KIAS at 4,500 feet altitude allowed their survival where Slow FACs dared not venture.Rowley, Ralph A. (1975).

The Misties, having proved their worth, an attempt to expand the detachment began in August 1967. Only one additional F-100F was located to transfer to the unit. Nevertheless, by April 1968, Misty FACs had flown 565 FAC sorties against the Mu Gia Pass and the Ban Karai Pass and directed 850 air strikes against this northern end of the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The 1 April 1968 cessation of bombing north of the 20th Parallel intensified operations in Route Pack 1 and increased the Misty FAC workload.Schlight, John (1969). Project CHECO Report: JET FORWARD AIR CONTROLLERS IN SEASIA.\\" Headquarters Pacific Air Force. ASIN B00ARRLMEY. pp. 1‚Äì15. On 1 June 1968, the Misties began the loan of their services to the U.S. Navy for their Operation Sea Dragon. On 11 June 1968, the Misties began the first night Fast FAC missions of the war. On the nights of 13 and 14 June, they tested a Starlight Scope for FAC operations. The preliminary results seemed promising, so the Misties began flying missions with the Scope in the rear seat with the observer on 8 July. As it turned out, the Scope was too bulky for easy use, and did not work in moonless periods. A Misty was lost in action on 16 August 1968, and another the following night. The night FAC mission not having observed anything more than an ordinary fighter pilot, it was cancelled after this second loss.Schlight, John (1969).

On 12 August 1968, the Misty FACs began training two aircraft commanders from the 366th Fighter Wing as FACs. On 2 September 1968, the first \\"Stormy\\" FACs began FACing in Route Pack 1.Schlight, John (1969). Project CHECO Report: JET FORWARD AIR CONTROLLERS IN SEASIA.\\" Headquarters Pacific Air Force. ASIN B00ARRLMEY. p. 23. With the 1 November 1968 halt of bombing North Vietnamese targets, the Misties ceased operations in Route Pack 1 and shifted their FAC mission towards the Ho Chi Minh Trail. By that time, the Misty FACs had flown 1,441 combat sorties, directed 3,988 air strikes, and lost nine airplanes.Schlight, John (1969). Project CHECO Report: JET FORWARD AIR CONTROLLERS IN SEASIA.\\" Headquarters Pacific Air Force. ASIN B00ARRLMEY. p. 21. From 1 November 1968 until June 1969, the Misties flew 1,530 combat sorties and directed 2,321 air strikes against the Ho Chi Minh Trail.Schlight, John (1969). Project CHECO Report: JET FORWARD AIR CONTROLLERS IN SEASIA.\\" Headquarters Pacific Air Force. ASIN B00ARRLMEY. p. 26. Plagued by shortages of aircraft, the Misties stood down on 14 May 1970. By that time, about a quarter of the 93 Misty FAC pilots had been shot down, though most had been rescued. The Fast FAC concept having been proven, other Fast FAC units had taken up the fight. In the meantime, the 416th still flew regular combat missions, logging its 30,000th SEA combat sortie on 20 April 1970. Most of those missions involved close air support or direct air support. The unit stood down from combat operations on 5 September 1970, and its resources were transferred to other units. Tactical Air Command On 28 September 1970, the squadron moved without personnel to England AFB, Louisiana. Anticipating the 416th's reassignment, the 4403d TFW at England AFB began forming a new squadron cadre in August 1970. This cadre started training its pilots to instructor status and was immediately available when the Air Force transferred the unit to England that September. After receiving more equipment and people, the 416th achieved combat ready status and began normal participation in exercises and other tactical operations. Inactivation appeared imminent again as the Air Force phased the last F-100s out of its inventory. By December 1971, the 416th was the only active flying squadron in the 4403d TFW. On 1 April 1972, its operational training commitment ended, and as a result the Air Force transferred all personnel to other units and aircraft to the Air National Guard. From May 1972 until its 1 July inactivation, the 416th served as a holding unit for a new A-7D Corsair II squadron that would replace it. Re-designated the 416th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron (TFTS), the unit activated again on 15 March 1979 under the 479th Tactical Training Wing at Holloman AFB, New Mexico. At Holloman, the squadron used AT-38B aircraft to provide transitional training to new pilots preparing for assignment to operational fighter wings. The 416th inactivated on 1 September 1983 as the 433d TFTS assumed its mission.

Performed training mission for pilots to transition to single-seat, subsonic F-117. Was given designation of 4451st Tactical Squadron, 11 July 1981, and assigned to 4450th Tactical Group which was formed to bring the F-117 from development to operational status. Was moved to Tonopah Test Range Airport on 28 October 1983, performing training missions with the F-117A in a clandestine environment. Performed dual mission of training F-117 pilots with the A-7Ds as well as providing a cover story for the classified Stealth Fighter project. All Tonopah training flights conducted at night under the cover of darkness until late 1988. On 10 November 1988, the Air Force brought the F-117A from secrecy by publicly acknowledging its existence, but provided few details about it. The official confirmation of the F-117A's existence, however, had little impact on Tonopah operations. Pilots began occasionally flying the F-117A during the day, but personnel were still ferried to and from work each Monday and Friday from Nellis. Everyone associated with the project was still forbidden to talk about what they did for a living, and the program remained shrouded in secrecy. Operated at Tonopah with A-7Ds until late 1989 when F-117 project was revealed to the public. Retired its A-7Ds, being the last active duty USAF squadron to operate the A-7D, and transitioned to the Northrop T-38A Talons. The squadron was re- designated as the 416th Tactical Fighter Squadron (Ghostriders) on 5 October 1989 when the 4450th Tactical Group was inactivated, and F-117A operations coming under the 37th Tactical Fighter Wing. There, it assumed the mission of the 4451st Test Squadron to become one of two operational F-117A Stealth Fighter squadrons. On 19 December 1989, just 13 months after the Pentagon had disclosed the existence of the F-117A, squadron aircraft were first used in combat during Operation Just Cause. In mid-December 1990, was deployed to King Khalid International Airport, Saudi Arabia as part of the buildup of United States forces prior to Operation Desert Storm. Flew combat operations over Iraq against high-priority targets January‚ÄìFebruary 1991. After combat operations ceased in February 1991, some wing personnel and aircraft remained on indefinite alert in Saudi Arabia as a component member of the post-Desert Storm task force in Southwest Asia, although most returned to Tonopah by the end of March.Peebles, Curtis, (1999), Dark Eagles, Presidio Press; Revised edition, Most of the F-117As deployed to Saudi Arabia returned home to Tonopah in early April 1991, although a few remained as part of the post- Desert Storm task force in Southwest Asia. After Desert Storm, the Air Force re-designated the squadron as the 416th Fighter Squadron on 1 October 1991. The squadron realigned from under the wing as a subordinate of the 37th Operations Group on 1 November 1991. In 1992, as part of the post Cold War budget cutbacks in the Air Force, the F-117As were moved to Holloman AFB, New Mexico; the 37th Fighter Wing and its subordinate organizations were inactivated and the aircraft, equipment, personnel and mission of the squadron were re-designated as the 8th Fighter Squadron, being assigned to the 49th Operations Group at Holloman AFB.

The original members of the Trilobites were Mike Dalton on vocals, Scott Leighton on bass guitar, Martin Martini & Paul Skates on guitars and Paul Styman on drums. Their first two singles, \\"Venus in Leather\\"' and \\"American TV\\" reached number 1 on the alternative chart. They released three albums, Turn it Around in 1987, Savage Mood Swing in 1990 and The Lost Generation in 1992. ==History== Vocalist Mike Dalton and drummer Paul Styman played together in a high school band, The Pyschotics, in the late 1970s. Bass guitarist Scott Leighton celebrated his 21st birthday in 1984 by showcasing his new band, The United Underworld. Included in The United Underworld were Martin Martini on rhythm guitar, Paul Skates on lead guitar and Paul Styman on drums and Steven Stradbrook on Vocals. Shortly after this performance Dalton was asked to join as vocalist. All members had attended the same high school together, Sydney Technical High School, albeit in different grades. They soon changed their name to The Trilobites and began gigging in Sydney's plethora of suburban and inner city pubs and clubs. They debuted on 20 June 1984, at the Vulcan Hotel in Ultimo (incidentally same as the debut of The Hard Ons). Their first release was a live cassette only album, 'Let's Pump' self-released on Atomic Records. Later, The Citadel label issued the band's first two singles : \\"Venus in Leather\\" (1985) and \\"American T.V.\\" (1986). Both singles reached No. 1 on the alternative charts, and the band toured to a strong response . Both songs appeared on the Citadel's compilation album Take Everything, Leave Nothing (March 1988). In the meantime, the Trilobites had signed a new deal with the Big Time label which resulted in the single, \\"Night of the Many Deaths (May 1987). On 24 October 1987 The Trilobites decided to record their show at The Caringbah Inn and turn it into a live LP, Turn It Around. It was released on the Waterfront label and only as a vinyl release. Waterfront also put out the Trilobites fourth single, \\"Jenny's Wake\\" (June 1988). In 1988 the Trilobites came to the attention of the fledgling rooArt label. The band contributed \\"All Hail the New Right\\" to rooArt inaugural Youngblood compilation album. That led to a full recording contract which resulted in the release of their EP, I Can't Wait for the Summer to End which gained strong success on the American college radio circuit. During March 1989, The Trilobites' debut studio album, Savage Mood Swing was produced by Englishman, Steve James (Toyah, The Lambrettas, John Otway) and released in March 1990. Between recording the album and its release, the Trilobites also undertook a successful European tour (late 1989). The album was also released in the United States on the Polygram label, with a promised tour of the States. In 1991, following rooART's last minute decision to pull the band's U.S. tour, Dalton left the band to take employment at MTV Australia. and was replaced by Gary Slater (Voodoo Lust). Paul Styman left at this point to be replaced by Glen Abbott. This version of the band then released a single, \\"Tears You Apart/Don't Hide\\", and a six track mini-LP on vinyl. These songs formed the basis of their second album, The Lost Generation, which was produced by Rob Younger (Radio Birdman, New Christs). It was released in February 1992 by Citadel and became the band's final release. The original line-up re-formed for a series of Sydney shows in 1996. * Gary Slater returned to Brisbane and performed in bands including The Pot Monsters and Grumpy, later rejoining Voodoo Lust. * Glen Abbott joined Machine Gun Fellatio. * Martin Martini joined Spurs For Jesus & The Upsets * Michael Dalton has been a producer and reporter at Channel 9 since 1993 and has worked on numerous shows including the NRL 'Footy Show', 'Good Morning Australia' and 'A Current Affair' ==Members== * Glen Abbott ‚Äì drums (1991‚Äì1992) * Mike Dalton ‚Äì vocals (1984‚Äì1991) * Scot Leighton ‚Äì bass guitar (1984‚Äì1992) * Martin Martini ‚Äì rhythm guitar (1984‚Äì1992) * Paul Skates ‚Äì lead guitar (1984‚Äì1992) * Gary Slater ‚Äì vocals (1991‚Äì1992) * Paul Styman ‚Äì drums (1984‚Äì1989) ==Discography== Cassette * Let's Pump ‚Äì Atomic Records (Self Released) (December 1984) Albums/EPs * Turn it Around ‚Äì Waterfront (December 1987) * I Can't Wait for Summer to End (EP) ‚Äì rooArt (March 1989) * American TV (EP) ‚Äì Citadel/Normal (1989) * Savage Mood Swing ‚Äì rooArt (March 1990) * The Lost Generation ‚Äì Citadel (February 1992) Singles * \\"Venus in Leather\\"/\\"Amphetamine Dream\\" ‚Äì Citadel (October 1985) * \\"American TV\\"/\\"Legacy of Morons\\" ‚Äì Citadel (August 1986) * \\"Night of the Many Deaths\\"/\\"Living by a Different Yardstick\\" ‚Äì Big Time Records (May 1987) * \\"Jenny's Wake\\"/\\"I Can See\\" ‚Äì Waterfront (June 1988) * \\"All Hail The New Right\\" split EP with Tall Tales and True ‚Äì rooArt (1988) * \\"Fuck = Love\\"/\\"Little Death\\"/\\"Legacy of Morons ‚Äì Remix\\" 12\\" vinyl ‚Äì rooArt (September 1989) * \\"New Head\\"/\\"Savage Mood Swing\\" ‚Äì rooART (November 1989) * \\"Minibar of Oblivion\\"/\\"Attack of the Yes Man\\" 7\\" & 12\\" vinyl ‚Äì rooART (February 1990) * \\"Don't Hide\\"/\\"Tear You Apart\\" ‚Äì Citadel (October 1991) ==References== Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1992 Category:Musical groups established in 1984 Category:New South Wales musical groups ","title":"The Trilobites"},{"id":"20208972","text":"Finnish general pennant, blue-cross pennant Household pennant is a quite common Finnish tradition. A household pennant (, ) can be flown whenever there is no flag day and it is usually a means of telling that the \\"master of the house\\" is at home. These pennants have a long, narrow, triangular shape, usually half the length of the flag pole. The triangle has a base of roughly one tenth of the length and it is connected to the pole via a single lanyard, giving the pennant the ability to rotate while flying.Finnish \\"husband\\" pennants Flags of the World The different regions of Finland have been connected with some traditional colors (often from the coats of arms of the historical provinces of Finland and modern provinces), and these are often reflected in the household pennant. The pennants sometimes also incorporate the regional arm into the design. The shapes, designs and uses of the pennants are however not regulated by law, as long as they do not interfere with uses of the regular flag, which is regulated. It is also allowed to fly a pennant overnight. In addition to the general pennant (which is based on the flag of Finland) and the regional variants, there are also family, city and municipality variants, of which any may be flown. A common practice is to either fly the pennant of the region of residence or the pennant from which the family members come. {  Finland  250 px -  Swedish-speaking Finns  250 px } == Finnish regional household pennants == The different regions of Finland have been connected with some traditional colors (often from the coats of arms of the historical provinces of Finland and modern provinces), and these are often reflected in the household pennant.

The character first appeared on- screen on 3 November 2008 until his exit on 28 May 2010. He was introduced as the younger brother of then established Zoe Carpenter (Zo√´ Lister), when he moved into the college halls of residence. In March 2010, series producer Paul Marquess axed the character as part of his cast cull and major revamp of the series. ==Character creation== Background Archie's character was created to be a new student studying at Hollyoaks Community College and was given immediate links with other characters such as an on-screen sister, Zoe Carpenter, played by Zo√´ Lister. It has been mentioned on and off screen that the two character experienced different upbringings from their parents. Casting Auditions were held for the part of Archie Carpenter with the result of the auditions seen to be unique other castings within the series as the news of the actor to portray the character first surfaced on a reality television series. In 2007 a new reality television series was commissioned by MTV in the United Kingdom called Living on the Edge, which focused on teenagers living their lives in the wealthy village of Alderley Edge in the United Kingdom. During series two only one cast member returned to the series, Stephen Beard. Whilst the second season was airing Beard was seen auditioning for various roles and documented the whole audition process for the character of Archie. He was later offered the part on a six-month contract, later being offered another contract for the same period of time. In early 2010 it was announced that Allan had stepped down from the position of executive producer, with Paul Marquess taking over the role. It was soon revealed that he planned revamp Hollyoaks, changing the productions team, then began a cast cull starting with the axing of three established characters. Stephanie Waring (who plays Cindy Hutchinson) then revealed that all remaining cast members feared their characters would be next to depart from the series. One month later the cast cull continued as Marquess announced his plans to axe a further 11 characters, including Archie at the end of Beard's contract. He finished filming in early 2010 ==Character development== Personality and identity Archie has been portrayed as a promiscuous character, one that doesn't think of the consequences of his hasty actions. At the time of joining the show, Beard said of his character: \\"He is a bit of a womaniser, he's constantly on the look out for new talent but he gets shot down a lot too, I think he thinks far too highly of himself! He'll go to the point that not many blokes will, he will never give up.\\" In an interview with media website Digital Spy he said of his character: \\"He's definitely a wild one. People who have watched Living On The Edge may draw some comparisons. I go to a certain point in life, but Archie's definitely got bigger balls - he'll take things all the way. He's got no fear. At the same time, though, he has a sensitive side. He's like the big class clown but when he gets a knock, he really feels it. I think Archie's intended to bring a bit of light-hearted humour to the show.\\" He has also been described as a wannabe entrepreneur coming up with wild ideas of how to make money fast. The character's promiscuous ways have been clearly portrayed on- screen through his many one-night stands with characters including: Sarah Barnes (Loui Batley), Hayley Ramsey (Kelly-Marie Stewart), India Longford (Beth Kingston) and Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber-Lane). ==Storylines== In December 2008, Leila Roy (Lena Kaur) accused Archie of stealing chocolates from her advent calendar however it was later revealed she had been sleepwalking and stole them herself. He shares a kiss with Sarah Barnes (Loui Batley), who later witnesses Archie intimate with another girl. Archie attempts to reunite with Sarah occasionally, however she continuously rejected him. In a final attempt to regain her affection, he posts a billboard of himself half-nude. In February 2009, he kisses Sarah again. In March, Sarah succumbs to temptations and begins a relationship with him however Sarah dumps him as she notices his affection for her lesbian friend Lydia Hart (Lydia Kelly). Sarah revengefully dances with Lydia. In June, Archie endeavours to prevent his parents from uncovering Zoe's failed college course by \\"collapsing\\". Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber-Lane) resuscitates him and he verbally abuses by calling her a \\"troll\\", leading to Myra and Mercedes Fisher (Jennifer Metcalfe) trying to attack him. Later, Archie was undressed in bed, kissing an unseen person. He lay back and confesses to sleeping with Myra. Archie, along with Kris Fisher (Gerard McCarthy), Elliot Bevan (Garnon Davies) and Zak Ramsey (Kent Riley), move into Warren Fox's (Jamie Lomas) old flat after his death. While clearing out the attic, the boys found ¬£100,000 of Warren's money and agree to keep the money safe for months, deciding if the money didn't belong to anyone, they would split it four ways. However, things become dangerous as Archie's greediness worsens. He calls his friend Jed to assist him in pretending to kidnap him in order for the other boys to give Jed the money, leading to Archie fleeing with it. However, Kris runs to Nancy Hayton's (Jessica Fox) house with the money and plans to go to the police. Jed actually kidnaps Archie seriously and gives him an ultimatum; either he receives the money or he would throw Archie over a roof. Elliot, Zak, Kris and Nancy salvaged him but, realising how the money affected their friendship, Kris abandoned it. After this, everyone neglected Archie, furious for Archie's betrayal. During Freshers week, Archie has a one-night stand with India Longford (Beth Kingston) and humiliates her by ignoring her publicly. In October 2009, Archie receives a call, which he doesn't identify on screen. The unknown caller informs him that Zoe is charged with the murder of her best friend and Archie's ex-girlfriend, Sarah, who has just died in a skydiving accident when her parachute failed to deploy which resulted in her death. Unbeknown to everyone, Lydia, Sarah's girlfriend has framed Zoe for Sarah's death as she was the culprit who sabotaged Sarah's parachute that was intended to kill Zoe. Archie is keen to support his sister. During an argument with Lydia, Archie realises Lydia was the saboteur and accuses her during Sarah's wake. Zoe is found not guilty with everyone believing Sarah committed suicide. Archie develops a drug habit and drops an ecstasy tablet in Nancy's flat which is then nearly taken by her young nephew Charlie Dean (Joshua McConville). Elliot also gets the blame as he had let Archie in. Neither Nancy nor Elliot want to speak to Archie again. On a night out with Kris and Zak, Archie makes comments about Zak's dead brother Caleb who was killed on patrol in Afghanistan. These comments offended Zak and he punches Archie. This leaves Archie with no friends in the village. Archie leaves after Elliot is taken into hospital having taken Archie's pills. ==Reception== In 2009 Ruth Deller of entertainment website Lowculture criticised Archie stating: \\"Zoe‚Äôs generic lairy student brother serves no purpose, essentially being an even more obnoxious version of Zak, whilst Zak is still on the show. And there‚Äôs no believability about his relationship with Zoe whatsoever.\\" ==References * Archie Carpenter on the E4 website Category:Hollyoaks characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2008 Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Archie Carpenter"},{"id":"20209057","text":"Mario Massa (June 20, 1892 - February 16, 1956) was an Italian freestyle swimmer who competed in the 1908 Summer Olympics, in the 1912 Summer Olympics, and in the 1920 Summer Olympics.

To understand loan default, it is helpful to have a few common terms defined: *Loan deferment is a postponement of a loan's repayment. There are many reasons why someone might seek to defer a loan, including a return to school, economic hardship, or unemployment. *Loan delinquency is a failure to make loan payments when they are due. Extended delinquency can result in loan default. *Loan default is the failure to repay a loan according to the terms agreed to in the promissory note. A lender may take legal action to get the money back. ==Consequences== Defaulting on a loan can adversely affect credit for many years. Default typically occurs when a loan receives no payment for 270 days. The loan leaves repayment status and is due in full when the lender requests. New collection costs are added to the loan's balance and the loan becomes drastically more expensive or eliminated through negotiation or legal action. There are other negative consequences resulting from a defaulted loan. A student who wishes to return to school cannot qualify for federal aid in the United States until satisfactory payment arrangements are made on the defaulted loan or the loan is rehabilitated, a process that can take as long as a full year of on-time payments. Individuals who are worried that they are unable to service their student loan debt should receive advice and counseling. There are few options available for American students other than payment in full. The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act makes discharging student loans through bankruptcy virtually impossible. Critics have noted that this lack of bankruptcy protection for consumers results in a \\"risk-free\\" loan for creditors, removing pressure on creditors to negotiate lower payments. ==Garnishment of wages and tax refund== In addition, the IRS can take the borrower's income tax refund until the defaulted loan is paid in full. This is a popular way of collecting on loan debt, and the Department of Education collects hundreds of millions of dollars this way. To object, a written statement must be presented within 65 days of the IRS' notice, and must give evidence of any of the following: *The loan has been repaid. *Payments have been made under a negotiated repayment agreement, or a cancellation, deferment or forbearance has been granted. *The borrower has filed for bankruptcy. *The borrower is totally and permanently disabled. *The loan in question is not the borrower's loan. *The borrower dropped out of school and the school owes a refund. *The borrower attended a trade school and the school closed. *The school falsely certified the borrower as being eligible for a loan. The government can also garnish wages as a way to recover money owed on a defaulted student loan. The United States Department of Education or a Student Loan Guarantor can garnish 15% of a defaulted borrower's wages. The loan holder does not have to sue the borrower first. The borrower can object to the garnishment, but only under very specific circumstances, such as if his weekly gross income is less than or equivalent to 30 hours at the federal minimum wage (currently $7.25/hr x 30 hrs = $217.50). Defaulting on student loans can also end in a lawsuit. The government and private lenders can sue in order to collect on loans. There is no time limit on suing to collect on federal student loans, and the borrower can be sued indefinitely. Private student loans, in most cases, are subject to statute of limitations laws depending on the state. ==Getting out of default== There are rehabilitation programs designed to help borrowers get out of debt. Rehabilitation is a federally mandated program that gives federal student loan borrowers a way to bring their loans out of default. Rehabilitation can reverse the many negative consequences of defaulting on a student loan, and participation is one of the few rights granted to federal education loan borrowers. In the rehabilitation program, a borrower must do a number of things. He or she must make at least 9 qualifying, on-time student loan payments. If any payments are missed, the borrower must begin the repayment schedule from the beginning. After borrowers complete the agreement, the guarantor transfers the loan to a lender and servicer. The default status will be removed from your loan. You will regain eligibility for benefits that were available on the loan before you defaulted, such as deferment, forbearance, a choice of repayment plans, and loan forgiveness, and you will be eligible to receive additional federal student aid. ==Rehabilitation benefits== After completing loan rehabilitation, borrowers once again become eligible to receive financial aid. With the loan no longer in default, wage garnishment and the seizure of tax refunds ceases. Borrowers are able to apply for deferment and forbearance benefits as long as these have not been exhausted during default. And lastly, the outstanding balance of the loan is no longer due in full. ==Default prevention initiatives== Several new initiatives have arisen to combat high student loan cohort default rates, including an outreach effort by the Department of Education to borrowers struggling to repay their loans. ==Debt levels== Distribution of student loan debt in the U.S. The Economist reported in June 2014 that U.S. student loan debt exceeded $1.2 trillion, with over 8 million debtors in default. Public universities increased their fees by a total of 27% over the five years ending in 2012, or 20% adjusted for inflation. Public university students paid an average of almost $8,400 annually for in-state tuition, with out-of-state students paying more than $19,000. For two decades ending in 2013, college costs have risen 1.6% more than inflation each year. Government funding per student fell 27% between 2007 and 2012. Student enrollments rose from 15.2 million in 1999 to 20.4 million in 2011, but fell 2% in 2012. ==See also== *Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act *Cohort Default Rate *Default (finance) *Garnishment *Higher Education Act of 1965 *Loan *Student loans in the United States ==References== Category:Student loans in the United States ","title":"Student loan default in the United States"},{"id":"20209119","text":"Agostino Frassinetti (1897‚Äì1968) was an Italian freestyle swimmer who competed in the 1920 Summer Olympics and in the 1924 Summer Olympics.

After secondary school studies and a year as a lecturer in Wales, she was admitted to the school of Library Studies in Paris built after World War I with the help of American aid. She there became an assistant and in 1926-1928 went on a training course to the United States. On her return to France in 1929 she became a librarian at the Trocad√©ro Museum in the Palais de Chaillot while continuing her activity in the Council of Librarians and Association of French Librarians. Her name remains attached to the Guide du biblioth√©caire amateur (Guide for the amateur librarian), published in 1930 by Charles-Henri Bach; and this with the text revised and corrected became the Petit guide du biblioth√©caire being considerably added to after 1945 and republished under two names with certain editions being illustrated. The Trocad√©ro Museum became the Mus√©e de l'Homme, and its library, open to the public and methodically classified (according to an adaptation of the classification of the Library of Congress) represents a turning point in study library management. For the Universal Exhibition of 1947 she was given the task of organising the Libraries section. ==French Resistance== Yvonne Oddon was an early resister of German occupation of France in the Second World War. While serving as the Head Librarian of the mus√©e de l'Homme, she had sent books and clothing to French prisoners of war. With Lucie Boutillier du R√©tail, Oddon helped prisoners escape and find shelter and food as well as safe haven. In 1940 she took part, with Boris Vild√© and Agn√®s Humbert, in the creation of a resistance group called the Groupe du mus√©e de l'Homme, initially to help prisoners and aviators to escape. She was also present at the birth of a clandestine newspaper named R√©sistance. On 10 February 1941 the participants of the group were arrested following their denunciation by an employee. On 7 February 1942, the six men in the group were sentenced to death,The six, executed by firing squad at Fort Mont Val√©rien, were Boris Vild√©, Anatole Lewitsky, Pierre Walter, Leon-Maurice Nordmann, Georges Ithier, and Jules Andrieu, with 18-year-old Ren√© S√©n√©chal but for the three women, including Yvonne Oddon,The three women were Yvonne Oddon, Sylvette Leleu and Alice Simmonet the sentence was suspended and they were deported to Germany. Yvonne went to several prisons before being sent to the camp at Ravensbr√ºck on 20 November 1944. Freed by the International Red Cross, she arrived back in Paris on 14 April 1945 as part of an exchange negotiated between the Red Cross and Heinrich Himmler. ==Post-war== After the war, Yvonne Oddon, while continuing her work at the Mus√©e de l'Homme, took part in numerous missions under the aegis of UNESCO (Ha√Øti, 1949) and took part in the organisation of education conferences based in Malm√∂ in 1950 and in Ibadan in 1954; then the creation of the International Council of Museums, for which she made a classification system; and she took part, after her retirement, in numerous missions, particularly to the Museum centre in Jos, Nigeria. She was awarded the rank of Chevalier (L√©gion d'honneur) for her resistance work and was later promoted to Officier. She died in 1982, and was buried at Menglon (Dr√¥me), the cradle of her family. ==See also== Georges Henri Rivi√®re == Notes  References == *Humbert, Agn√®s (tr.

The church is a Grade I listed building, having been added to the listed buildings register on 10 July, 1957. ==History== The parish was called St Cross in 1261, but by 1310 it was known as St Grada, Virgin. The font dates from the 13th century and the church contains a brass to James Eryssy and his wife, 1522. Parts of the church, which is built in the Decorated style, are of thirteenth century origin and the tower dates from around 1400. The thirteenth and fourteenth century nave and chancel were rebuilt in 1862‚àí63, incorporating some of the original structure to the designs of the architect Edward William Godwin of Bristol. The construction is mainly of rubble stone, with some large blocks of granite and serpentine in the tower. There are separate slated, steeply-sloping roofs for the nave, chancel, vestry and porch. The unbuttressed tower is at the west end and has two stages. The font from the previous church was retained. The serpentine and Caen pulpit was the gift of the Lizard Serpentine Company. The lectern was the gift of Mr Cox, the agent of the company. The church was reopened for worship on 24 July 1863. The funds for the rebuilding in 1862‚àí63 ran out and it was not until 1882 that an organ chamber and vestry were built, according to the original plans of Godwin. The organ was built by Brewer and Co and a specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register. ==Parish status== The settlements of Grade, Ruan Major and Ruan Minor were united into a single civil parish called Grade-Ruan in 1934.

In the course of a decade, it developed into a network that included centres from more European countries. Yearly meetings of the member centres were instrumental for the development of multiple links between them. Starting in 1998, international conferences on a variety of thematic areas were organized in different countries. In the new millennium, the organization of European Conferences on African Studies (ECAS), open to everybody, became the central activity. These conferences are taking place every two years, always in a different country. The first European Conference on African Studies was held at the School of Oriental and African Studies and the Institute of Commonwealth Studies in London in July 2005; the second Conference was held at the African Studies Centre in Leiden, Netherlands, in July 2007.

She made her first appearance on 24 November 2008. The character was introduced as an extension of already established McQueen family and quickly became a fan favourite for her cute, bubbly personality and dark storylines. During her first five years on the show, Porter was featured in numerous high-profile storylines, including: underage sex; the murder of Calvin Valentine (Ricky Whittle); teenage pregnancy; being the target of serial killer Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle); falling down a lift shaft; discovering her boyfriend, Ethan Scott (Craig Vye) was dating two other women and forming a friendship with the girls; finding her long-lost father; relationships with Dodger Savage (Danny Mac), Will Savage (James Atherton) and Joel Dexter (Andrew Still); and her arrest for Calvin's murder. Porter announced her departure from the soap in October 2013 so she could focus on Dancing on Ice. Her exit scenes aired on 9 January 2014. It was announced in April 2014, four months after her exit scenes aired, that Porter would be returning to the serial as Theresa, with her return scenes airing on 25 August 2014. Theresa's storylines since her return have included: a breakout from prison; giving birth to her second child, this time with Dodger and her subsequent on-off relationship with him; a feud with Sonny Valentine (Aaron Fontaine); being involved in a train crash which saw Calvin's wife and her cousin, Carmel (Gemma Merna) save Theresa and die; being kidnapped by Will; agreeing to donate a kidney to Nico Blake (Persephone Swales-Dawson); a relationship with Patrick Blake (Jeremy Sheffield) which saw her care for him as he suffered from motor neurone disease; and being targeted by Nico as she plotted to kill her for her other kidney. It was revealed that Porter had chosen to leave the soap again to pursue a career in Hollywood; she agreed to reprise the role in 2020 for the programme's 25th anniversary. ==Casting== The character was announced in early November 2008. 20-year-old actress Jorgie Porter was cast as Myra McQueen's (Nicole Barber-Lane) 15-year- old niece, Theresa. She was described as a \\"teen temptress\\" and \\"lolita type\\". Porter, speaking of her new role, said: \\"I'm thrilled to be joining not just Hollyoaks but one of soap's most notorious families. Although she's feisty with outsiders, Theresa's ranking within the family is low so she's eager to impress. I can‚Äôt wait to see how Theresa earns her stripes as part of the McQueen clan!\\" Due to the departures of Tina McQueen (Leah Hackett) and John Paul McQueen (James Sutton) earlier in 2008, Hollyoaks producer Bryan Kirkwood added a new member to the McQueen family. Theresa was mentioned earlier before her entrance to the soap on-screen during a conversation between Myra and Nana McQueen (Diane Langton), her mother Kathleen McQueen (Alison Burrows) was also mentioned when it was revealed she was in prison. ==Development== Characterisation The character of Theresa was first described as \\"A 'teen temptress' and 'Lolita type' who has a distinct lack of self-awareness. Her vulnerability is her status within her family and she is alert to the fact that she has a long way to go before she becomes a real member of the McQueens.\\" Also her keen love of men was noted. In 2010, Porter commented on the character, saying: \\"She's got load of attitude, but she's got a good heart, too. Although she'd probably flirt with your boyfriend. She wouldn't mean to hurt you, but she'd think, 'Your boyfriend fancies me. Watcha gonna do?'\\" Following the revelation that Theresa shot Calvin Valentine (Ricky Whittle), Porter commented about what it would show from Theresa's character, saying: \\"I was a bit excited, too, because it's another side Theresa can show.\\" Calvin's murder and pregnancy Ricky Whittle plays Calvin Valentine, the character Theresa kills. In December 2009, Hollyoaks broadcast the first ever flashforward episode. The episode, set in May 2010, featured the wedding of Calvin and Carmel Valentine (Gemma Merna), as well as the murder of Calvin. This started a six-month-long 'whodunnit'. During May 2010, Theresa was revealed as the killer. When asked what her reaction to the news that she was the murderer, Porter said: \\"I was a bit gutted because I thought I'd be gone, because everyone gets puts away for life if they kill someone. I believe one day she should get her comeuppance and I think she does.\\" In an interview with Digital Spy, Porter was asked what happened in the aftermath, saying: \\"It's the whole guilt trip really. It was never planned because Theresa's not that type of person. She's not a murderer ‚Äî she's a 17-year-old girl with little girl tendencies. She wants to talk about boys and clothes and make-up, then this comes along and totally changes her.\\" She also explained Theresa's motive: \\"Well, she'd recently had a night of naughtiness with Calvin, and as a result she fell pregnant. She was really stressed out about it and he's getting married so she thinks, 'If I go and tell him maybe he won't get married to her and maybe he'll want to bring up the baby with [me]'. I think she thought he would be with her.\\" Porter admitted that she thinks it allows viewers to see a \\"completely different side to her character,\\" but also believes Theresa is probably \\"a little too young.\\" She also admitted her view on Theresa's personality after Calvin's murder: \\"You see her become really vulnerable. You saw her vulnerable when her mum left but this is a total helplessness, she just doesn't know what to do.\\" Whittle, who portrayed Calvin, told Inside Soap that he was \\"very surprised\\" when he learnt the identity of the killer. He later admitted he wanted a different killer. He stated: \\"My opinion was it would have been someone else. If I was going to pick a killer for Calvin I don't think anyone had a strong enough motive apart from Mercedes (Jennifer Metcalfe), Malachy and Spencer. Obviously, with Malachy, I was sleeping with his wife. Mercedes is a woman scorned, and I don't think Spencer understands consequences so he could probably act without realising that if he shot Calvin he would die and that would be forever. I thought it could possibly been him because he was upset that Calvin left Warren to die, so those are the only three I felt had enough motive to pull the trigger.\\" Along with Calvin's murder, Theresa's next main storyline was her pregnancy. Porter commented on having to wear the fake bump, saying: \\"It's so hot! I have to wear a big padded bra as well as the bump and I can get quite irritable.\\" She also expressed her concern about acting with a child: \\"I'm not looking forward to acting with a baby, either. Some kids can be quite laid-back, but I've worked with ones who've just screamed in my face the whole time. Nightmare!\\" After Theresa gave birth to Angel McQueen in Hollyoaks Later, Merna, who plays Carmel, explained Carmel's plan to take baby Angel and raise her as her own: \\"In Carmel's mind, the baby is hers. It's Calvin's baby, therefore it is her baby because they were supposed to be the ones who were going to have a child together. She's really angry and wants to make Theresa pay for ruining her life. But she also dearly wants to bring the baby up. She believes she can give Angel a better life than Theresa, who's young and still wants to go out and have fun.\\" 2014 departure and return On 13 October 2013, it was announced that Porter had chosen to leave her role as Theresa after five years and would be filming her final scenes in late 2013. It was revealed, two months later, that Porter would be leaving to compete in the final series of Dancing On Ice, having previously appeared in the show in 2012. Theresa's exit storyline would see her face consequences for Calvin's murder that occurred four years previously, to which the show's executive producer, Bryan Kirkwood said: \\"Theresa has got away with murder for many years, so it is time for her to face the consequences.\\" Entertainment website, Digital Spy reported that Porter was expected to return after a break, with the door left open. Speaking of her decision to leave, Porter said: \\"I've loved playing Theresa and of course being a McQueen. I've been so lucky to have been given some amazing storylines over the last five years. I start to feel a little emotional when I think about leaving but the time is right for me to move on. I've still got a while to go yet so there'll be plenty more mischief from Theresa over the next few months.\\" Meanwhile, Kirkwood described Porter as \\" a real talent, beautiful, sexy and a delightful presence on and off screen.\\" Porter had since stated she had backed her exit, while co-star, Gemma Merna (Carmel Valentine) expressed her sadness over Porter's decision to leave as well as stating she hoped that Porter would return soon. Porter filmed her exit scenes on 17 December 2013 and was pictured in an emotional farewell party, surrounded by her colleagues. In January 2014, speaking in an interview with Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy, Porter revealed that the main reason behind her exit was appearing in Dancing on Ice and being unable to cope with both programmes and the tour when she appeared in 2012. She also mentioned that she was excited upon hearing that Sonny Valentine would be returning to the cast, now played by Aaron Fontaine, but quickly realised that Sonny would behind her exit. Porter also spoke about how she would miss her on-screen family, the show and her family. Theresa's exit scenes aired on 9 January 2014 as she was arrested for the murder of Calvin, following the return of Sonny. Porter appeared on Dancing on Ice, but was eliminated in week 1, leaving her shocked and humiliated - having chosen to leave Hollyoaks to give a focus on the competition. On 24 April 2014 - four months after her exit scenes aired - it was announced that Porter would be returning to Hollyoaks and that her return scenes would be air during the year. Theresa's return storyline would feature \\"more twists and turns\\" in the build-up to her trial. Of her return, Porter said: \\"I am excited to be returning. Theresa is awaiting trial but has some serious unfinished business before then so I am thrilled to be able to come back and finish what we started.\\" Meanwhile, the show added: \\"Theresa is on a mission and she's got a secret that's going to shock a lot of people around the village.\\" Fontaine also spoke about Theresa's return, stating that Sonny still wants justice for his brother's murder and is looking forward to the drama between Sonny and Theresa. He also stated that he expects to be involved in Porter's return, \\"It'd be weird if Sonny wasn't involved in it, because obviously he still wants justice for his brother. If Theresa is released from prison so quickly, he'll feel that justice hasn't been served.\\" Porter later expanded on her return and expressed that she would like Theresa to be nice upon her return to the village. Porter revealed that she would be filming within the summer and that she is unaware of her return storyline as well as that she would like to stay with soap for \\"a while\\". It was also announced in July 2014 that Nicole Barber-Lane would be returning to her role as Myra McQueen to tie in with Theresa's return. Porter's return scenes were previewed in the annual Hollyoaks: Six Weeks of Summer trailer that showed what would happen in the space of six weeks between 21 July and 29 August. In July 2014, Kirkwood later promised that Theresa's return would \\"cause havoc\\" upon the McQueen family as well as revealing that Porter had begun filming with the soap. Kirkwood described Theresa upon her return as \\"renewed and reinvigorated\\". Porter also promised show fans that Theresa would have a secret upon her return, but was unable to reveal the secret because she does not want to spoil the surprise. She also stated: \\"When you see Theresa again, she is definitely desperate to get her baby back. She's had a lot of time to think in prison as there isn't much to do, so she's grown a bit desperate.\\" It was later revealed that Theresa's return scenes would air on 25 August and see her request to see Carmel and Kathleen-Angel. Unfortunately for Theresa, Sonny arrives at the prison after telling Carmel that Theresa cancelled the visit, before warning Theresa to back off. To coincide with Theresa's return, Alison Burrows also returned in a guest stint as Kathleen McQueen. Upon her return, Theresa gave birth to a second daughter Myra-Pocahontas which was her surprise secret. It was shortly discovered that old flame, Dodger Savage (Danny Mac) was the father of the baby. 2016 departure & 2020 return On 18 July 2015, it was announced that Porter would be leaving for the second time, having only returned in August 2014, with her final scenes airing in early 2016. Show bosses have chosen to keep Theresa's departure storyline unrevealed for now, but have promised more drama for Theresa between summer 2015 and 2016. Reports have suggested that Porter is hoping to pursue a career in Hollywood after finishing filming, having visited America on a recent holiday and already planning a career. It was also suggested that this exit is being treated as a break, with Porter promised not to be killed off so that she could return in the future.

Theresa and her aunt Myra do come and go from Hollyoaks village but we do not comment on individual artistes' contracts.\\" In March 2020, it was announced that Porter agreed to reprise the role for the show's twenty-fifth anniversary. ==Storylines== Theresa is first mentioned by Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber-Lane) and Nana McQueen one month before her introduction. During her arrival, Theresa is attracted to Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard) while in The Loft, whom she meets during an educational-themed night. Sexual tension mounts between the pair and ultimately spend the night together, with Tony unaware that she is only fifteen. Theresa falls in love with Tony, who realises her deception, and destroys any chances of a future with him. A dejected Theresa turns to her family, the McQueens. Jacqui McQueen (Claire Cooper), who is still infuriated with Tony for his fling with her sister Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe), is angered with Tony for his night with Theresa. She immediately calls the police, who charge him. Theresa then moves in with the McQueens, sharing a room with cousin Michaela McQueen (Hollie-Jay Bowes), whom she previously had turned to for advice. Jacqui is not pleased at Theresa moving in but soon warms. Theresa then tells the police she was deceptive about spending the night with Tony, who is released. Theresa finds an unlikely friendship in Anita Roy (Saira Choudhry) and auditions for the part of The Virgin Mary in a nativity play produced by older cousin Carmel Valentine (Gemma Merna) and Cindy Cunningham (Stephanie Waring). However, she is heckled off the stage by some teenagers, who clearly know she is not a virgin. On Christmas Day, Anita finds a DVD containing CCTV footage of Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas) sleeping with Mandy Richardson (Sarah Jayne Dunn) and gives it to the McQueens, who set off to ruin Warren's wedding to Louise Summers (Roxanne McKee). Theresa begins battling against Lauren Valentine (Dominique Jackson) for friendship with Anita. When Lauren makes a comment about the McQueens, Theresa reminds her that Carmel is married to Lauren's brother Calvin. Theresa follows her family by using a fake pregnancy bump to shoplift. Having a proper relationship with Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson), Theresa is dumped by him, who wants to focus on son Lucas Hay (Jude). After the McQueens home becomes infested with rats, Theresa and Carmel move in with Anita and her family. Anita begins to feel she is ugly and becomes increasingly ashamed of her skin colour after racial abuse from Gaz Bennett (Joel Goonan). She starts using Theresa's picture to speak to a boy named Ricky Campbell (Ashley Margolis) on the internet. Theresa finds out about Anita using her picture and is angry. Anita uses Theresa's jacket and smashes a window in the school. Anita's father Govinda Roy (Anthony Bunsee) tells Myra, Carmel and Theresa to leave, believing it was Theresa. After Anita admits the truth, her mother Bel Roy (Nila Aalia) begs Myra, Carmel and Theresa to stay, and tells them that Anita had poured bleach over her legs to change her ethnicity. Theresa feels guilty for not helping Anita and she apologises before reassuring her that she does not need to change her appearance. After a game of 'truth or dare', Theresa has to kiss Newt (Nico Mirallegro). They eventually get together, which is revealed by Anita's partner Ricky, causing Lauren to be extremely jealous. Theresa follows her wish and becomes a model for a project by Zoe Carpenter (Zo√´ Lister), for \\"Buff TV\\" while Newt breaks up with her, not a fan of her future career. Theresa is then disgusted when he starts dating Anita, so she slaps her and stops speaking to both of them. Carmel is also shocked with the modelling, and cannot believe that Zoe is using a sixteen-year-old. Due to this, Theresa is spotted and discovered by a modelling agency in London. Theresa makes her way with Michaela, and are followed by Jacqui and Carmel. When she gets there, she decides to visit her mother Kathleen in prison. Kathleen tells Theresa to move back in with her grandmother, showing hostility towards the other McQueens. Kathleen then leaves an upset Theresa. Back in Hollyoaks, Theresa refuses to speak to Anita, however supports her when she develops an eating disorder. Theresa is happy to hear that Kathleen is visiting for Christmas, after being released from prison. The rest of the McQueens are skeptical, which proves correct when Kathleen does not arrive. Several days later, Kathleen arrives in Hollyoaks and asks Myra for money, which Theresa's father left for her. Myra refuses and tells her to leave before Theresa finds her. Later, Theresa meets Kathleen just as she is leaving the village. Kathleen, not wanting to disappoint her daughter, claims she has come to stay. Kathleen gives Theresa expensive gifts like a gold charm bracelet. Theresa accepts it, desperate to believe her mother has changed. Kathleen then encourages Theresa to shoplift, which causes more tension between Kathleen and the rest of the McQueens. Kathleen also tells Theresa that they should run away together to London, to which Theresa agrees and says goodbye to Anita, while the rest of the McQueens are out. However, when saying goodbye, Theresa finds her mother's purse which contains a credit card in the name of her dead cousin Tina and is horrified. Myra and Jacqui find out Kathleen and Theresa's plan to run away and tries to stop Theresa from going, to which she agrees. Kathleen then leaves, which leads to Theresa holding a grudge against Jacqui. Carmel's fianc√©, Calvin Valentine (Ricky Whittle), and Theresa spend time together in the Loft. The atmosphere heats up and they end up sleeping together. Later, Theresa gets pregnant with Calvin's child. Theresa begins a romance with Kyle Ryder (Neil Toon) after she fixes his car. At Calvin and Carmel's second wedding, Theresa admits to Calvin that she is pregnant. Calvin tells her he wants her to have an abortion, which shocks Theresa. He then lies to Carmel about the paternity after she finds out about Theresa's pregnancy. Feeling emotional and rejected, Theresa sees a gun in Jacqui's bag at the wedding reception and snatches it. She shoots Calvin and he dies in Carmel's arms. Mercedes and Jacqui quickly flee the scene with Theresa to protect her. Jacqui is then told that Calvin's passionate rendezvous with Theresa has caused her to fall pregnant. Jacqui stands by Theresa and hides the gun, before lying to police when they are questioned. Theresa decides to run away with Kyle, still in shock at killing Calvin. However, Kyle treats his pregnant girlfriend curtly, and introduces her to his new girlfriend, Stacey. Theresa returns home to the McQueen's. Jacqui tries to force Theresa into terminating the pregnancy, but Carmel convinces her to keep the baby. Jacqui plants the gun used to kill Calvin on racist Gaz, who is caught holding Anita hostage and arrested for killing Calvin. Theresa is unwilling to let Gaz go to prison for Calvin's murder, however is convinced to stay quiet. Myra discovers Theresa is pregnant and eventually uncovers the truth about Calvin's death. Following this, Kyle is arrested for armed robbery and charged with Calvin's murder, as it was his gun that was used to shoot him. Carmel later discovers the baby is Calvin's and that Theresa killed him. Angry, she agrees to let Theresa have the baby, but insists she will go to the police after the birth. Still trying to pursue a modelling career, Theresa performs a catwalk for Heidi Costello's (Kim Tiddy) fashion show, where she develops a crush to Riley Costello (Rob Norbury). Later, Theresa talks to Heidi's cousin Mitzeee (Rachel Shenton), who on purpose does not switch her headset off. Mitzeee then reveals to Theresa, and everyone at the fashion show, that she was involved in an affair with Heidi's husband Carl Costello (Paul Opacic) before arriving in the Village.

Theresa meets Logan Fairhurst (Thomas Sean Hughes), and an attraction grows. Theresa almost admits to killing Calvin, but stops when Logan tells her he is a police officer. After being attacked by Mitzeee, Theresa goes into labour and gives birth to a daughter. Carmel tells Theresa that she meant what she said, and will take her to the police for Calvin's murder. Theresa dumps Logan after being influenced by her family that it's for the best. Jacqui manages to convinces Carmel the baby will go into care even though that would be far more appropriate.

When Theresa is home alone, she hears a knock on the door, she goes to answer it but there is no one there, she walks up to the bins and finds a black balloon with a picture of a fox on it, she goes back in the house and finds Warren, who accuses her of telling someone that he forced a weak man into the burning building after he escaped, revealing to the viewers that she knew the whole time that Warren wasn't dead. Warren recaps on how he escaped the fire, forcing her for answers of who she told, he threatens to drop her off the village wall arch, this leads her to confess that she killed Calvin. Police officer Ethan Scott (Craig Vye) arrives at the McQueens' home to question Carmel over Warren's fake death. He and Theresa talk and he later brings Kathleen to the McQueens' after she is caught using fake money. Ethan agrees not to arrest Kathleen if Theresa goes for a drink with him.

When Carmel arranges to christen the baby \\"Angel\\" without Theresa's consent, Kathleen is furious and brings her priest boyfriend round to conduct her granddaughter's christening in secret, and the baby is christened as \\"Kathleen Khloe Angel McQueen\\". After the christening, Mercedes reminds Carmel that if she doesn't want to go to jail, then she will comply with her demands. Heeding her sister's warning to save herself from going to prison, Carmel agrees to let Theresa keep her daughter. Theresa hears rumours that Kyle is back in the village, and decides it is best for everyone if she leaves. As she is leaving, Kyle kidnaps Theresa and baby Kathleen-Angel, and takes them to an abandoned bank. He threatens to kill her but Theresa escapes and calls Warren, Carmel and Ethan. They arrive and they try to reason with Kyle, but a fight ensues and Ethan is thrown down a lift shaft and Kyle is shot and killed by Warren. Kathleen-Angel is also in the lift shaft, and when Ethan passes her up, Theresa tries to save Ethan.

The day after, Theresa throws Dodger's clothes into a bin and sets them on fire but Jim throws a beer over it. Carmel discovers that she has chlamydia and breaks up with her boyfriend Jim McGinn (Dan Tetsell). While trying to comfort her, Theresa recounts that she had chlamydia around the time they were both sleeping with Calvin, leading to Carmel realising that she has unknowingly had it ever since. As a result of her missed diagnosis, Carmel learns that she is unlikely to ever conceive a child, resulting in her obsessing over Kathleen-Angel, and Theresa's poor parenting skills. On Christmas Eve, Theresa comes home with an expensive dollhouse for her daughter, despite previously mentioning that she had no money and when Carmel discovers her credit card missing, she later finds out that it was Theresa who had taken it, causing a feud to break out between the cousins. Carmel soon discovers that Theresa had been sending malicious messages to Dodger from a e-mail account belonging to Texas, and she tells Dodger causing him to split up with Theresa. Carmel is also arrested after the police accuse her of shoplifting a dollhouse, though in reality it was Theresa, leading to her feeling her chances of adopting a child were over. In a bid to get revenge on Carmel for facilitating her break-up with Dodger, Theresa climbs into bed with a drunk Jim and claims they had sex, though Nana soon uncovers the truth.

Carmel desperately tries to convince him to help him get Kathleen away from Theresa, and when Sonny refuses, Carmel blurts out that Theresa killed Calvin. Carmel soon regrets this and is horrified to discover that Sonny has joined the police force since leaving the village. Sonny confronts Theresa on the street, causing her to panic that she is about to be arrested, so Mercedes and Nana hatch a plot for Theresa to leave the country, and she reluctantly agrees to leave Kathleen-Angel with Carmel for the time being.

Theresa is found at the airport, where she tries to evade the police but is soon caught. Carmel soon arrives at the airport, believing Theresa has taken Kathleen-Angel with her. However, Sonny shows up and reveals he took Kathleen-Angel. Theresa is then arrested. Sonny pressures Theresa during the interview and, despite Jim telling her not to say anything, she confesses to killing Calvin. Theresa is charged and Sonny allows Carmel to speak to her. Theresa asks Carmel to look after Kathleen-Angel and tell her she loves her.

Phoebe reveals this to Carmel, who drives out into the woods with a doll in the back, and Sonny follows her. Sonny then kidnaps Carmel, but she returns to the village, making her family believe she escaped. Carmel is actually working with Sonny to take Kathleen-Angel, and plans to abduct her on their cousin Porsche McQueen's (Twinnie Lee Moore) wedding day, but she later backs out of the plan. At the reception, which takes place on a party train, Theresa discovers Kathleen-Angel's passport in Carmel's bag and is shocked. She and the rest of the McQueens disown Carmel, before Sonny sneaks onto the train using Carmel's invitation which she discarded.

Jacques d'Amboise (between 1440 and 1450 ‚Äì 27 December 1516) was a French religious dignitary and patron of medieval France. He was abbot of Jumi√®ges then of Cluny, and bishop of Clermont. He was a member of the House of Amboise, an old noble family. ==Life== He was the son of Anne de Bueil and Pierre d'Amboise, lord of Chaumont, as their seventh of eighteen children. Entering the Benedictine order he was elected abbot of Jumi√®ges in January 1474, replacing his brother Louis on his appointment as bishop of Albi. Jacques took his oath of loyalty as abbot on 20 February 1474 and took possession of the abbey on 28 May. In 1485 he succeeded a Bourbon as abbot of Cluny, rebuilding the Cluny abbots' h√¥tel in Paris as well as its now-lost chapel and coll√®ge. Located beside the Gallo-Roman ruins, the h√¥tel de Cluny hosted several royal visits and would be inhabited by cardinal Mazarin in 1634. He also built the abbatial palace of Paray-le-Monial.

The act created the United States Coast Guard as a new service outwardly modeled on the structure of the U.S. Navy and under the command of the Department of Treasury. Its men wore uniforms and had the responsibility of protecting American coastal cities and waters from hostile attack, enforcing customs duties and performing search and rescue missions at sea and in coastal environments. The U.S. Coast Guard is a branch of the United States Armed Forces authorized to stop, search and arrest suspected smugglers and other unlawful intruders into American waters. ==Mergers== The Coast Guard was created from the merged United States Life-Saving Service and the United States Revenue Cutter Service, which had been established in 1790 to prevent smuggling until the reestablishment of the Navy in 1798. Although placed under the U.S. Treasury Department the Coast Guard was temporarily transferred to the Navy Department during World War I and again during World War II. In 1939, the Coast Guard also integrated and incorporated the United States Lighthouse Service and, in 1942, the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation. In 1967, the Coast Guard was placed under the United States Department of Transportation. ==Further Amendment== Since 2003, the U.S. Coast Guard has fallen under the jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security and as before in times of war and emergency when declared by the president it reverts to the navy's control. ==References * http://www.uscg.mil Category:1915 in American law Category:History of the United States Coast Guard Category:United States federal legislation ","title":"Coast Guard Act"},{"id":"20209382","text":"Aimie Allen Atkinson (born 5 June 1987) is an English stage actress and singer. ==Early life== Born and raised in Stevenage, by her mother Faith Allen and her father - Tom Atkinson - who played part-time in a rock band, which Atkinson would try to imitate. Whilst studying at Collenswood School, Stevenage, Atkinson was part of the Fusion Performing Arts group, and took part in many of their productions. After leaving school having studied to GCSE level, she worked as an admin assistant in a music publishing company, and also ran a franchise for the Stagecraft school in Stevenage. ==Career== After agreeing with a friend whilst studying at the Arts Educational School that both should apply to the BBC Radio 2 Voice of Musical Theatre competition, Atkinson was told that she could only apply for the amateur competition. After winning that, she joined a final competition against the final professional contestants - those with at least five years of stage experience - and also won that. Aged 19, Atkinson left Arts Educational and became a full-time stage actress, taking her first professional job in Howard Goodall's Days of Hope at the King's Head Theatre. She then took on various parts, before starting an intensive course in musical theatre at the Royal Academy of Music. However, she left the academy after two months to join the UK touring production of Zorro, playing the part of Luisa. Subsequently landing a part in a musical as a sassy 40-year-old singer, the producer of the show then asked Atkinson to audition for the role of Daniela in the musical In The Heights, which she subsequently played at the King's Cross Theatre. She has since played Princess Jasmine in Aladdin alongside Priscilla Presley, Serena in Legally Blonde at Kilworth House, and Snow White opposite Jerry Hall at Richmond Theatre. She has also originated the role of Katherine Howard in the West End production of Six. Atkinson is currently playing the role of Vivian Ward in the West End production of Pretty Woman: The Musical alongside Danny Mac at the Piccadilly Theatre; the show had its first preview on 13 February 2020. It later officially opened on 2 March 2020. Recording Atkinson released her debut studio album Step Inside of Love with Jay Records in 2017. As a member of the girl group Goldstone, she competed in Eurovision: You Decide 2018 with the song \\"I Feel The Love\\". Atkinson's recordings include: *Step Inside of Love - debut solo album *I Feel The Love - BBC *100 Greatest Musicals - recorded at Abbey Road Studios *Postman and The Poet *Kurt Weill's One Touch of Venus * ‚ÄòSix The Musical‚Äô Studio Cast recording Concert performances * ‚Äò'Fridays Night is Music Night‚Äô' on many occasions. * Barbara Windsor's 70th Birthday BBC Radio 2 live from Hackney Empire. * Great British Musical (Perfect Pitch) - What's On Stage Awards. * Stephen Sondheim's 70th Birthday Concert.

Its chemical structure is similar to cystine but contains a methylene (single carbon) unit in between the two sulfur atoms. ==Toxicity== The toxicity of djenkolic acid in humans arises from its poor solubility under acidic conditions after consumption of the jenkol bean. The amino acid precipitates into crystals which cause mechanical irritation of the renal tubules and urinary tract, resulting in symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, loin pains, severe colic, nausea, vomiting, dysuria, gross hematuria, and oliguria, occurring 2 to 6 hours after the beans were ingested.Barsoum, R.

Urolithiasis can also happen, with djenkolic acid as the nucleus. In young children it has also been reported to produce painful swelling of the genitalia.J. B. Harborne, H. Baxter, G. P. Moss (Eds.) (1999) Phytochemical Dictionary: A Handbook of Bioactive Compounds from Plants. CRC Press. p. 81. . Google Book Search. Retrieved on November 16, 2008. Treatment for this toxicity requires hydration to increase urine flow and alkalinization of urine by sodium bicarbonate. Furthermore, this poisoning can be prevented when consuming djenkol beans by boiling them beforehand, since djenkolic acid is removed from the beans. == Discovery and synthesis == Djenkolic acid was first isolated by Van Veen and Hyman from the urine of the natives of Java who had eaten the djenkol bean and were suffering from poisoning. They then succeeded in isolating the djenkolic acid crystals from the djenkol beans treated with Ba(OH)2 at 30¬∞C for a prolonged period of time. Djenkolic acid was later reported to be found as much as 20 grams in every kilogram of dry djenkol beans, and it has also been reported to be found to a lesser extent in the seeds of other leguminous plants such as Leucaena esculenta (2.2 g/kg) and Pithecolobium ondulatum (2.8 g/kg).D'Mello, J.

Du Vigneaud and Patterson managed to synthesize djenkolic acid by the condensation of DCM with 2 moles of L-cysteine in liquid ammonia and to show that their synthetic compound was identical with the naturally occurring djenkolic acid. Later on, Armstrong and du Vigneaud prepared djenkolic acid by the direct combination of 1 mole of formaldehyde with 2 moles of L-cysteine in a strongly acid solution. == References == Category:Sulfur amino acids Category:Plant toxins Category:Toxic amino acids ","title":"Djenkolic acid"},{"id":"20209394","text":"Macrosaccus robiniella is a moth of the family Gracillariidae. ==Distribution== It is native to North America (where it is distributed from Ontario south to South Carolina and west to Missouri and Texas), but is an introduced species in Europe, where it was first reported near Basel, Switzerland, in 1983. Later, it was also reported in France, Germany, northern Italy (1988), Austria (1989), and Slovakia (1992). It spread gradually through Austria, reaching Hungary in the mid 1990s. ==Adult description== The wingspan is 5.5 to 6.5 mm. There are two to three generations per year. ==Life history== The larvae feed on Robinia pseudoacacia, Robinia viscosa and Robinia hispida. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine begins as an elongate serpentine track which enlarges to an elongate-oval, whitish blotch located on one side of the midrib and usually on the underside of the leaflet. Eventually the mine becomes slightly tentiform due to the silk laid down by the later instar larvae. There are five larval instars. The earliest instars are highly modified sapfeeders with strongly depressed bodies and reduced chaetotaxy with a maximum length 3.7 mm. Later instars are tissue feeders, with cylindrical bodies and a maximum length of 4.7 mm.

It is very similar to the blue-tailed damselfly, Ischnura elegans but on that species the blue spot is mostly on segment 8. Females undergo a change of colour as they mature.

The Arch of Germanicus is an ancient Roman arch in Saintes, Charente-Maritime in France. It was built in 18 or 19 by a rich citizen of the town (then known as Mediolanum Santonum), C. Julius Rufus, and dedicated to the emperor Tiberius, his son Drusus Julius Caesar, and his adoptive son Germanicus. It has two bays and was originally sited over the terminus of the Roman road from Lyon to Saintes. On the proposal of Prosper M√©rim√©e in 1843 it was moved fifteen metres during works on quays along the river, and it was restored in 1851. ==Inscription== Dedication Arch of Germanicus Right next to Paule's place, is this very impressive Roman Arch. The dedicatory inscription on the attic (CIL XIII, 1036 = Inscriptions Latines des Trois Gaules, 148) is heavily worn in the area naming the emperor Tiberius and is son Drusus. The dedication to his nephew and adoptive son, Germanicus, is better preserved and not only allows the arch to be dated to 18 or 19 but also gives it its usual name: GERMANICO [CAESA]R[I] TI(berii) AUG(usti) F(ilio) DIVI AUG(usti) NEP(oti) DIVI IULI PRONEP(oti) [AUGU]RI FLAM(ini) AUGUST(ali) CO(n)S(uli) II IMP(eratori) II \\"To Germanicus Caesar, son of Tiberius Augustus, grandson of the deified Augustus, great- grandson of the deified Julius, augur, flamen, augustales, consul for the second time, hailed imperator for the second time.\\" Donor Arch of Germanicus Below the dedication the inscription in the entablature gives the name of the arch's financer, C. Iulius Rufus and his ancestors. This is repeated on all 4 sides of the arch. C(aius) IVLI[us] C(aii) IVLI(i) OTUANEUNI RVFVS C(aii) IVLI(i) GEDOMONIS NEPOS, EPOTSOVIRIDI PRON(epos) [SACERDOS ROMAE ET AUG]USTI [AD A]RAM QU[A]E EST AD CONFLUENT[E]M, PRAEFECTUS [FAB]RUM, D(at). \\"Caius Julius Rufus, son of Caius Julius Otuaneunus, grandson of Caius Julius Gedemo, great-grandson of Epotsovirid(i)us, priest of Rome and of Augustus at the altar at Confluens, prefect of works, gave [this arch]\\". The difficulties in establishing the text, which is heavily worn, have long meant that Catuaneunius has been read as the name of Rufus's father and Agedomopas as the name of Rufus's grandfather. Asserting this lineage witnesses to Rufus's aristocratic consciousness and his family's long-standing at the head of the city. Julius Gedemo was the first member of the family to receive Roman citizenship, probably from Julius Caesar (taking his name as his own) and possibly during the Gallic Wars or shortly afterwards. Rufus was the first member of the family to adopt a completely Roman name rather than retaining a third name that was Celtic in origin, showing the Romanization chosen by Gallic noblemen. This notable Gaul, a third-generation Roman citizen, was also known as a priest of Rome and of Augustus through his dedicatory inscription found on the amphitheatre at Lugdunum (Lyon), known here as Confluens. ==See also== *List of Roman triumphal arches == External links== * Structurae == Bibliography == * L.

Fat free mass (FFM) is calculated by subtracting body fat weight from total body weight: total body weight is lean plus fat. In equations: :LBM = BW ‚àí BF ::Lean body mass equals body weight minus body fat :LBM + BF = BW ::Lean body mass plus body fat equals body weight LBM differs from FFM in that cellular membranes are included in LBM although this is only a small percent difference in the body's mass (up to 3% in men and 5% in women) The percentage of total body mass that is lean is usually not quoted ‚Äì it would typically be 60‚Äì90%. Instead, the body fat percentage, which is the complement, is computed, and is typically 10‚Äì40%. The lean body mass (LBM) has been described as an index superior to total body weight for prescribing proper levels of medications and for assessing metabolic disorders, as body fat is less relevant for metabolism. LBW is used by anesthesiologists to dose certain medications. For example, due to the concern of postoperative opioid- induced ventilatory depression in the obese patient, opioids are best based on lean body weight. The induction dose of propofol should also be based on LBW Stoelting's Anesthesia and Co-Existing Disease, 6th Edition. Pages 329-330. ==Estimation== LBM is usually estimated using mathematical formulas. Several formulas exist, having different utility for different purposes. For example, the Boer formula is method of choice for LBM estimation to calculate the dose given in contrast CT in obese individuals with BMI between 35 and 40. A nomogram based on height, weight and arm circumference may be used. Boer For men: LBM = (0.407 √ó W) + (0.267 √ó H) ‚àí 19.2 For women: LBM = (0.252 √ó W) + (0.473 √ó H) ‚àí 48.3 where W is body weight in kilograms and H is body height in centimeters. Hume The following formula may be used: For men: LBM = (0.32810 √ó W) + (0.33929 √ó H) ‚àí 29.5336 For women: LBM = (0.29569 √ó W) + (0.41813 √ó H) ‚àí 43.2933 where W is body weight in kilograms and H is body height in centimeters. ==Actual measurement== Instead of mathematical estimation the actual value of LBM may be calculated using various technologies such as Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). ==References== Category:Body shape Category:Human weight Category:Ratios ","title":"Lean body mass"},{"id":"20209438","text":"Spulerina simploniella (bark miner) is a moth of the family Gracillariidae.

From the 10th century to the French Revolution it was served by a community of canons, regular until the 13th century, and thereafter secular. ==History== Chevet under snow West door According to tradition, the church was founded by the Bishop of Clermont, Saint Avitus, in the 6th century and was rebuilt in the 11th or 12th centuries after being burned down by the Normans. The establishment here of a community of canons took place no earlier than the middle of the 10th century, under bishop √âtienne II of Clermont. The church was formally declared a basilica minor on 3 May 1886. In the 19th century the bell tower was added, and the Romanesque roof tiles were replaced by lava slabs. These have since been removed again and the roof restored as near as possible to its original state. A major restoration programme took place in the church interior between 2007 and 2008, consisting of the cleaning of all the stonework, the removal of cement pointing from the restoration of the 19th century, the restoration of the pictures and the replacement of the lustres (the crypt however was not included). On Sunday 7 December 2008 the statue of Notre-Dame du Port (\\"Our Lady of the Port\\") was reinstalled in the church, having been kept safe in Clermont Cathedral during the restoration works, thus marking the reopening of the building to the public. In 1998 the Basilica of Notre-Dame du Port was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list as part of the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France. The name \\"du Port\\" supposedly comes from the fact that the church was built in the \\"port\\" district, in Latin portus, here in the sense of \\"market\\" rather than \\"seaport\\". The church at first bore the name of Sainte-Marie-Principale; the description Portus or du Port is not known before the 11th century. Nor was the Port district, at least in the Middle Ages, a particularly commercial one: the districts of Saint-Pierre and Saint-Gen√®s were much more so. ==Description== Plan from Dictionnaire raisonn√© de l'architecture fran√ßaise du XIe au XVIe si√®cle, by Eug√®ne Viollet-Le-Duc, 1856 The basilica is one of the five Romanesque churches in Auvergne known as the \\"greater\\" churches (majeures), the others being the church of Saint- Austremoine in Issoire, the Basilica of Notre-Dame of Orcival, the church of Saint-Nectaire, and the church of Saint-Saturnin. Built of arkose, a sort of sandstone, the building has an almost perfect harmony supposedly resulting from the application of the ratio of the Golden Number. The church is built on a Latin cross ground plan with a nave of six bays between two low side aisles with simple vaults. There is a transept with a semi-circular chapel on each arm, and a quire surrounded by an ambulatory from which open four radiating chapel, none of them on the main axis, thus forming a chevet, which with its fine mosaics is a notable example of the Romanesque art of Auvergne. The capitals, which are among the finest in Auvergne, principally depict scenes from the Bible, but also some from the Psychomachia of Prudentius. ==Gallery== Image:NDPort-4675-0023.jpgDormition and Assumption of the Virgin Image:NDPort-4675-0026.jpgDetail of the Assumption Image:NDPort-4672-s-0025.jpgDetail of a capital Image:NDPort-4672-s-0032.jpgDetail of a capital == Bibliography == * Br√©hier, nd: La sculpture romane en Haute-Auvergne.

However, similarly to the transition from Windows XP to Windows Vista, certain capabilities and programs that are present in Windows Vista are no longer present in Windows 7 or have changed. The following is a list of features that originated in earlier versions of Windows and included up to Windows Vista. ==Windows shell== Windows Explorer * Windows 7 removes the \\"Customize\\" tab for a folder if its properties are opened via Libraries. If the same folder is opened in Explorer without accessing it via Libraries, the Customize tab is available in its Properties. * The Registry settings for modified colors for compressed files, EFS-encrypted files, item hot-tracking (single click hover) etc. are ignored by the ItemsView control in Windows 7 Explorer. * Running Explorer shell as administrator or even opening an Explorer window temporarily as administrator is not possible in Windows 7 without modifying permissions in the registry of system values because of a DCOM restriction. * Control Panel views are limited to Small icons and Large icons (which is actually Tiles view). List view, Details view, Extra large icons view, Large icons view and Medium icons view with text at the bottom are not available. The ability to show Control Panel items in groups is also removed. * IDeskBand interface and Explorer Bars are no longer supported in Windows Explorer but still supported in Internet Explorer.Adding Explorer Bars * Some Control Panel settings, such as Add Hardware, Bluetooth, Game Controllers, Pen and Touch, People Near Me, Tablet PC Settings, Offline Files, and Scanners and Cameras, are not listed, even under All Control Panel Items. The 32-bit Speech applet is no longer accessible through the Control Panel. While some of these settings are accessible only from Category view, or by searching, they can be made accessible via All Control Panel Items with a modification to the registry. * The slide show button from Windows Explorer starts the Windows Photo Viewer, which‚Äîunlike Windows Live Photo Gallery‚Äîdoes not support viewing slide shows with themes and rich transitions. * It is not possible to run the 32-bit version of Windows Explorer as a file manager or as the shell in 64-bit editions of Windows 7. 64-bit editions of Windows Vista and Windows XP allowed executing the 32-bit shell/Windows Explorer and making it the default for compatibility with shell extensions. As a result, all 32-bit shell extensions are incompatible with 64-bit versions of Windows 7. * Because of the Software Explorer being removed from Windows Defender, there is no user notification any more if UAC blocks a startup program which needs administrator privileges. Users were notified about blocked startup programs set to run as administrator in Windows Vista.Error message when you start a Windows Vista-based computer: \\"Windows has blocked some startup programs\\" * An undocumented incompatible Items view control replaces the List view controlWindows Browse and Organize Features: Windows 7 Technical Library used in Windows Explorer and Start Menu breaking applications that customized the Explorer list view control.SysExporter incompatibility with Windows 7 Explorer The Item view also does not support custom positioning, custom ordering, or hyperlinks, which were supported in the Windows Vista list view.IFolderViewOptions Interface Because the control is undocumented, it is not possible for developers to disable auto arrange or customize views. Because ItemsView is not considered part of the Win32 common controls reusable by developers, the sound for the Select system event no longer plays in Explorer in Windows 7. * The new items view control also ignores certain \`desktop.ini\` parameters like \`IconArea_Image\` and \`IconArea_Text\` preventing users from setting a background picture for folders. In Windows Vista, this feature was not built- in, however the list view control supported this if shell extensions or folder customization utilities which set the correct desktop.ini parameters and attributes were installed. * Each toolbar or desk band is forced to be on its own row in Windows Explorer. Windows Explorer forces the RBBS_BREAK style for every band.Classic Shell: Codeproject.com * When items are grouped by any criteria, multiple selection of groups by clicking the group header while holding down is not possible as could be done in Windows Vista. * The entire folder tree view in the navigation pane cannot be collapsed vertically as could be done in Windows Explorer on Windows Vista. * Full row selection cannot be turned off for details view as was possible in Windows Vista.Disable Full Row Select: Keith's Windows Stuff * The Share overlay icon for shared items in Explorer has been removed. * When navigating to a folder from a library, it is not possible to view the folder's contents in the view the user has set or customized. The folder uses the library's view. * The Remember each folder's view settings option to set Explorer to persist or not persist folder views and icon sizes per folder has been removed.Is Remember each folder's view settings functionality gone for good? * It is not possible to set Windows Explorer to remember individual folder window sizes and positions. Each folder window shares the same size, and their position cascades as more windows are opened. * Dotted lines that connect folders and subfolders do not appear as the option to turn off simple folder view is missing.Description of Simple Folder View in Windows XPChange folder views and behavior * When clicking on a folder in the folders pane, it isn't automatically expanded to show its subfolders as the option to turn on simple folder view is missing. * The size of any selected item(s) is not shown on the status bar but is shown in the details pane just above the status bar. Free disk space is not shown on the status bar and the status bar is not visible by default. The details pane only shows the size of 15 selected items by default and viewing the total size of more than 15 selected items requires clicking \\"Show more details\\" each time the selection changes. * When no items are selected in a folder, neither the details pane nor the status bar show the total size of files in the folder. * Icons on the command bar in Windows Explorer and common application dialogs for Open/Save. * Disabling Auto Arrange and Align to Grid is not available in Windows Explorer windows.Disable Auto Arrange in folder view, not available in W7 As a result, users can no longer manually arrange items via drag and drop within a folder; this feature is only available on the desktop. * The bar with column headers for sorting, grouping, filtering and stacking that appears for any view in Windows Vista Explorer only appears for Details view. Even in details view, the column headers only allow sorting and filtering; they no longer allow grouping and stacking. As a result, grouping must be done from the context menu in all views and sorting must also be done from the context menu in all other views except Details view. Filtering by columns can only be done in Details view. * Automatic horizontal scrolling in the left pane is removed as well as the horizontal scrollbar to manually scroll. * The Arrange By option (called Stack By in Windows Vista) is only available for libraries and folders included in libraries. In addition, users can only Stack By predefined categories depending on the library type. For example, users can only Stack by Folder, Album, Artist, Song, Genre, and Rating for the Music library, whereas in Vista, users could Stack By any properties that exist for a file (common examples would be bit rate, year, composer, play count, etc. for audio files). * Changing the sort criteria when multiple items are selected causes all items to be de-selected. * Selection of multiple items is not retained across back and forward navigation. Taskbar * Tooltips for program icons only show the name of the app. They no longer show the comment field. * 16-bit applications can no longer display their icon on the taskbar when running. The taskbar shows the icon for NTVDM.exe, which is the 32-bit host process for running 16-bit applications. * Quick Launch was removed in favor of 'pinned' applications. It is possible to revert to Quick Launch by manually adding it as a custom toolbar referencing %AppData%\\\\Microsoft\\\\Internet Explorer\\\\Quick Launch (check citation for how-to) if users prefer the taskbar layout from earlier versions of Windows, although Windows 7 and later have issues with Quick Launch getting automatically disabled and all its settings getting reset after a logoff or restart. * Clicking a grouped application's taskbar button or thumbnail when it is active (in the foreground) does not minimize it. Only ungrouped application buttons minimize upon being clicked again. * Icons have been removed from the tooltips for the notification area system icons such as Volume, Network, Power and the taskbar date and time. * Floating Deskbands (toolbars) are no longer available. The feature was previously deprecated in Windows Vista; all deskbands can only be pinned to the taskbar. It is no longer possible to place toolbars on the other (non-taskbar) edges of the desktop. * The ability to disable grouping (placing next to each other) similar taskbar buttons (for example, Explorer windows) is removed; users can still disable combining multiple taskbar buttons of the same type into one button. * The configurable registry option TaskbarGroupSize, which allowed fine-grained control over taskbar groupingHow to Change the Behavior of Taskbar Grouping under previous Windows versions is not supported. In Windows 7, users can only configure to either combine buttons, not combine or combine when the taskbar is full. * The number of combined taskbar windows is not calculated and shown next to the combined buttons. * Network activity animation on Network Connections icon in the notification area cannot be turned on. The Network icon only indicates the type of network (wired or wireless) and Internet connectivity. * The ability to turn off taskbar window previews (thumbnails) while still using Aero, as was configurable in Windows Vista.Windows Vista User Experience Walkthrough Guide It is possible to turn off taskbar thumbnails when two or more windows are combined by setting a registry value, though.Windows 7 Taskbar reg tweaks * The ability to disable the taskbar's \\"always on top\\" setting is removed. * When grouping is disabled, the ability to manage multiple taskbar items using multiselect (Ctrl+click) to tile, cascade, minimize or close the selected group of windows has been removed. * Only two power plans, one of them always being Balanced, and the other being \\"Power saver\\" by default, are available to choose from the taskbar. The \\"High Performance\\" power plan is hidden by default in the Control Panel. * When the taskbar is vertical, there cannot be multiple columns of icons. Start menu * Applications can no longer be excluded from appearing in the Start Menu's Most Frequently Used program list using the NoStartPage registry value as was possible in Windows XP and Windows Vista.How To Prevent a Program from Being Displayed in the Most Frequently Used Programs List in Windows XP * Programs started from outside the Start Menu such as from the Desktop, the Run dialog or from folders no longer show up in the Start Menu's Frequently Used Programs list, unless launched at least once from the Start Menu. * Classic Start menu is removed. This feature can be added by third-party programs, like Classic Shell. Certain features that were present only in the Classic Start menu are not available, such as expanding the menu columns instead of scrolling, expanding folders by hovering instead of clicking, opening folders by double clicking, launching multiple programs by holding down Shift key while clicking, and creating expandable shortcuts to folders by dragging them to the Start menu. * Dynamically pinning default Internet browser and e-mail client software programs on Start menu is no longer possible. Programs can still be, however, manually pinned to the Start menu in Windows 7. * Internet Explorer Favorites and History are no longer grouped under a separate header in the Windows 7 Start Menu as they were in the Windows Vista Start Menu. They are shown under the Files group. Windows Search features * Advanced search builder UI (Search Pane). Due to the removal of this UI, it is not possible to change the location of where to search in the same Explorer window unless at least one search has already been performed, after which Explorer shows a button to search a \\"Custom\\" scope. For saved searches (stacked views), changing the scope of the search (location for example) is no longer possible because of this removal. * The option to always search only file names has been removed from Folder Options, Search tab. * The Windows Search protocol handler addin to index network paths is incompatible with Windows 7.Availability of the Windows Desktop Search add-in for Files on Microsoft Networks The Windows Search service needs to be installed and running on the remote computers to search them. * Pre-defined saved searches in the Searches folder (\\"Recent Documents\\", \\"Recent E-mail\\", \\"Recent Music\\", \\"Recent Pictures and Video\\", \\"Recently Changed\\" and \\"Shared by Me\\") have been removed. Other shell features * The Snap To mouse pointer option to move the pointer automatically to the default button in a dialog is broken on many re-designed system and application dialog boxes and windows in Windows 7. The mouse pointer simply does not move or snap to the default button in several dialogs which are re-designed. * For security reasons, AutoPlay will support AutoRun only on optical media, such as CDs and DVDs.

In 2005, however, England died, having completed only two of the full-sized sculptures. England's long-time friend and fellow sculptor Gary Henson was asked to complete the project. Henson was provided license by the Ballet and Historical Society to complete the remaining sculptures in his own style, which differed slightly from that of England. == References == Category:American ballerinas Category:20th- century Native Americans Category:Native American dancers ","title":"Five Moons"},{"id":"20209683","text":"The International Journal of e-Collaboration is a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal that covers the interdisciplinary field of e-collaboration at the intersection of human-computer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work, and electronic commerce.

He set world records from two-thirds of a mile to 50 miles, and the record for the distance ridden in a six-day race. ==Biography== Career Goullet - pronounced to rhyme with roulette - was born in the Gippsland region of Victoria, Australia and grew up in Emu, north of Melbourne. He created a cycling track at home by leading a horse as it dragged a log to clear the grass. He made a name in Australia and was contracted to ride in the United States. He landed at New York in winter 1910 \\"in a snowstorm, wearing a sleeveless shirt and a straw hat because it was summer at home.\\" He was 19. He settled in Newark and raced on outdoor tracks set in parks and sports grounds. In Salt Lake City in 1912 he set world records at two-thirds of a mile, three- quarters of a mile and a mile. A reporter there wrote: That winter Goullet won the first Paris six-day race, paired with Joe Fogler of Brooklyn. He returned to America and in November 1914 won the six-day at Madison Square Garden, paired with another Australian, Alfred Grenda. The Six hundred miles further than the modern Tour de France, which lasts three weeks they covered is still a record. Goullet rode the last hour of the race - a six-day relay race - without Grenda's help. His partner had appendicitis. He wrote in the Saturday Evening Post after his first six-day race in New York: Goullet took American nationality in 1916. He joined the navy when the USA joined World War I in 1917 but never left the country. Goullet was so popular in the 1920s that he was paid of $1,000 a day. The historian Peter Nye says a National Football League franchise could be bought at the time for a few hundred dollars. National Football League teams sold for $100 each in the 1920s, making all 11 teams together worth $1100. Goullet made 10 times as much. Such was the crowd - 15,000 - to see him at Madison Square Garden in 1921 that firemen surrounded the building to stop gatecrashers. The New York Times said: \\"Goullet won the race through the greatest exhibition of sustained speed ever known in history.\\" He and a Tour de France rider, Maurice Brocco, picked up $50,000, , on the last night. Damon Runyon wrote in The New York Times that Goullet was the king of six-day racers, proclaiming, \\"Long live the king!\\" By 1925, Goullet had won around 400 races, established six world records and won the New York six-day eight times. Later life and recognition Goullet retired at 34, recently married, after that December's race at Madison Square Garden. The organisers paid him an appearance fee of $10,000. He estimated he earned $100,000 from cycling at a time when a manual worker brought home $5 a day. At his peak he earned more than the $20,000 paid to baseball's Babe Ruth in the year he hit 54 home runs for the Yankees. He began selling life insurance and owned and ran a skating rink in Wayne Township. He was inducted into the Madison Square Garden Hall of Fame in 1968, then flew to Melbourne - his first trip to Australia in 75 years \\\\- to join the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1986. He was enrolled in the US Bicycling Hall of Fame in May 1988. He died in a nursing home aged 103 in Toms River, New Jersey. He was survived by his son, Richard, daughter Suzanne, six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. In 2016, he was posthumously inducted into the Cycling Australia Hall of Fame. ==Palmar√®s== ;1909 *National sprint champion ;1912 *Melbourne six-day, with Paddy Hehir *Sydney six-day, with Paddy Hehir ;1913 *National sprint champion *Six Days of New York, with Joe Fogler *Paris six-day, with Joe Fogler ;1914 *Boston six-day with Alf Hill *New York six-day, with Alfred Grenda *Newark six-day, with Alf Hill ;1916 *Boston six-day, with Alfred Grenda ;1917 *New York six-day, with Jake Magin ;1919 *New York six-day, with Eddie Madden ;1920 *New York six-day, with Jake Magin ;1921 *New York six-day, with Maurice Brocco ;1922 * New York six-day, with Gaetano Belloni * Chicago six-day, with Ernst Kockler ;1923 *New York six-day, with Alfred Grenda ==References * Category:1891 births Category:1995 deaths Category:Australian centenarians Category:Sportspeople from Toms River, New Jersey Category:Australian male cyclists Category:American male cyclists Category:American track cyclists Category:Cyclists from Victoria (Australia) Category:Sport Australia Hall of Fame inductees ","title":"Alf Goullet"},{"id":"20209818","text":"Tredington is a village and civil parish on the River Stour in Warwickshire, England.

A rare population, known from Homestead (Smith et al., 1994), is said to have mostly white individuals. Some feel that the dainty sulphur is so unique among pierids, in shape and in several structural features, that it should belong in a separate subfamily. Its appearance is highly variable but identification should not be a problem. The forewings elongated shape is distinctive. The upperside of the wings is yellow with the tip of the forewing being black. Black bars extend along the trailing edge of the forewing and the leading edge of the hindwing. Male dainty sulphurs have an oval scent patch (called an androconial spot) in each hindwing bar. The androconial spot is reddish orange but fades to pale yellow after death. The underside of the wings varies depending on the season. Summer individuals have yellowish hindwings whereas winter individuals have greenish-gray hindwings. Both forms have black spots near the forewing margin and have a yellowish- orange patch near the base of the forewing. ==Similar species== Similar species in the dainty sulphur's range include the barred yellow (Eurema daira) and the little yellow (Eurema lisa). The barred yellow is larger than the dainty sulphur, and the underside of the wings is either all grayish white or brownish red. The little yellow is also larger than the dainty sulphur, lacks the dorsal forewing and hindwing black bars, and on the underside of the forewing lacks the black spots and the yellowish-orange patch. ==Habitat== The species lives in almost any open space including coastal flats, deserts, fields, roadsides, vacant lots and waste areas. It usually flies very low to the ground. ==Life cycle== Males patrol just inches above the ground in search of females. If a male finds a female and is faced with rejection, males are likely to engage in an open-winged display, showing off their dorsal bars and their androconial spots. This last-resort effort to impress the female will often make her reconsider her unwise decision. Females lay their lemon-yellow or orange-yellow eggs singly on young or emerging leaves of the host plant. The eggs will hatch within 4‚Äì7 days. The larvae are quite variable. Some larvae are dark green, while others are dark green with bright pinkish-purple stripes. The stiff haired larvae have two pinkish-red bumps just above the head. The green or yellow-green chrysalis is covered with yellow-white dots. It lacks a projection on the head which is found in most pierids. The dainty sulphur will migrate south to spend the winter because it is unable to survive the cold. If day length is short when it is a larva, the dainty sulphur produces a winter phenotype upon forming its chrysalis which will then produce a butterfly with three times the usual number of dark scales. This allows it to absorb solar heat more easily. It has multiple broods per year. ==Host plants== Here are a list of host plants used by the dainty sulphur: * Spanish needles, (Bidens bipinnata) * Beggar ticks, (Bidens species) * Dogweed, (Dyssodia species) * Common chickweed, (Stellaria media) * Greentread, (Thelesperma species) ==Image gallery== Image:Dainty Sulphur, Megan McCarty59.jpgUnderside of a summer form dainty sulphur ==References== *Rick Cech and Guy Tudor 2005.

The story was published in the Civil and Military Gazette on April 30, 1886 under the title \\"Section 420, I.P.C.\\" (Indian Penal Code). (Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code of 1860 lays down that anyone who cheats and dishonestly induces a person to hand over any valuable property shall be punished with imprisonment and a fine.) Its first appearance in book form was in the first Indian edition of Plain Tales from the Hills in 1888. It was the third of the stories that appear in that collection to be written Charles Allen, Kipling Sahib, London, Little, Brown, 2007 \\"In the House of Suddhoo\\", therefore, is a story about deception. There are several layers of uncertainty in it. Suddhoo is a \\"very, very old\\" man who lets rooms in his house. The inhabitants are: on the ground floor, Bhagwan Dass, the grocer, and a man who claims to be a seal-cutter, together with their households; on the upper floor, Janoo (and formerly Azizun, who has now married and left), \\"Ladies of the City, and theirs was an ancient and more or less honourable profession\\" (that is, prostitutes). Here is one layer of questionable honesty - although Kipling is at pains to show Janoo as honest and intelligent. The narrator is in favour with Suddhoo, because he, a Sahib or Briton has got a job for one of Suddhoo's cousins. \\"Suddhoo says that God will make me a Lieutenant-Governor one of these days. [Another layer of dishonesty - or humour?] I daresay his prophecy will come true. [Again]\\" Suddhoo is very fond of his son, who lives at Peshawar, some 400 miles away. The young man contracts pleurisy. The seal-cutter, who understands the telegraph as Suddhoo cannot, has a friend in Peshawar who sends him the details before letters arrive. Suddhoo is worried at his son's health and invites the narrator to discuss it - specifically the prohibition on jadoo, or magic, by the Raj. The narrator reassures him that white magic is permitted, and that the officials of the Raj practise it themselves - Kipling adds, with more humour, \\"(If the Financial Statement [roughly, the Budget of the government of India] isn't magic, I don't know what is)\\". Suddhoo admits that he has paid much money for the 'clean sorcery' of the seal-cutter, who gets accurate reports \\"more quickly than the lightning can fly\\". So they approach Suddhoo's house, hearing noises from the seal-cutter's window. They climb the darkened stairs, to Janoo's room, where there is more space. Then the magician enters, stripped to the waist, and puts on a most impressive performance, face white and eyes rolled back. The narrator recognises the fire-eating and the ventriloquism, and realises that, however impressive - and frightening - the performance is, it is a fraud, as Janoo says in her own language hearing him twice claim a very precise fee. (It is, of course, the central fraud in the tale.) She is upset that Suddhoo is spending all his money, some of which she had counted on acquiring (by \\"wheedling\\", which may be accounted as another form of deception). Kipling summarises the narrator's problems: he has aided and abetted the seal-cutter in obtaining money under false pretences, so is guilty under British law; he cannot tackle the seal- cutter, as the latter will poison Janoo; and he fears that Janoo will poison the seal-cutter anyway. making him (the narrator) guilty as accessory to the act. So deception is manifold. :All quotations in this article have been taken from the Uniform Edition of Plain Tales from the Hills published by Macmillan & Co., Limited in London in 1899.

It was the 109th baseball season in school history. The team's head coach was Brad Hill who was in his sixth season at Kansas State. He was previously the head coach at Central Missouri State before coming to Manhattan in 2004. Kansas State made the NCAA Tournament for the first time in school history. The team finished the season by setting the school‚Äôs record for wins, eight more than the previous school record of 35 in 1976. ==Pre-season== The Wildcats, who recorded the most conference victories and its highest conference finish (tied for sixth) since 2002, return five pitchers who combined for 21 starts last season. The Wildcats will have junior A.J. Morris and seniors Lance Hoge and Todd Vogel, while sophomore Thomas Rooke, who tied for fifth in school history with 25 appearances out of the bullpen last year, could be called upon to start some games this year for the Wildcats. Offensively, K-State returns four of its top five hitters from a year ago, including junior infielder Justin Bloxom and senior outfielder Dane Yelovich. Bloxom led K-State in virtually every offensive category last season, including batting average (.288), hits (63), RBI (49), triples (2), total bases (105), total plate appearances (252), at bats (219), games played (58) and games started (57). Yelovich finished with a .286 average and stole 18 bases, good for fourth in the Big 12 Conference. Alongside Bloxom in the infield is expected to be sophomore Carter Jurica at second base, converted outfielder Jason King at third, while senior Drew Biery will man shortstop for the second-consecutive year. The outfield will feature Yelovich in center field, while fellow senior, Jordan Cruz, will return to right field after beginning the 2008 season as the starter. Left field will be a battle between junior Adam Muenster and true freshman Nick Martini. Muenster, who will be a switch-hitter this season, could also see time at second base. Rob Vaughn, a two-year starter at catcher, returns for his senior campaign, while a pair of juniors, Daniel Dellasega and David Masters will also see playing time behind the plate. ==Season== Regular Season Head Coach Brad Hill, in his sixth season at K-State, earned Big 12 Coach of the Year honors as he guided Kansas State to a 39-win season, including 14 conference victories to finish fourth in the league, all school bests. The team also earned their highest ranking in school history as they were number 10 in the Baseball America Top 25 earlier in the season. A.J. Morris won Big 12 pitcher of year, the first Wildcat ever to do so. Morris finished the regular season as the Big 12 leader in both wins (12) and ERA (1.61). He was also first in innings pitched (100.2), third in opponent batting average (.203) and tied for fifth in strikeouts (91). Morris became the first player in school history to be named a semifinalist for the Dick Howser Trophy. Brad Hill became the first Kansas State coach since Mike Clark in 1990 to be named conference coach of the year. Carter Jurica earned second- team accolades from the coaches after leading the conference‚Äôs top hitting team with a .366 average, which was third in the Big 12 individually. Jurica also finished the regular season third in stolen bases (21), fourth in hits (78), and fifth in both runs scored (57) and on-base percentage (.442). Seniors Drew Biery and Jordan Cruz, junior Justin Bloxom, sophomore Jason King and freshman Nick Martini were each named honorable mention All-Big 12. Kansas State was tied for 12th nationally with 39 wins. Kansas State has recorded 136 steals this season, the second-most in school history. The Wildcats have recorded 20 triples this season, which are tops in the Big 12, and the most by a K-State team since 1997. Conference Tournament The Wildcats earned a birth in the Big 12 Baseball Tournament for the second year in a row. The tournament was held at AT&T; Bricktown Ballpark in Oklahoma City Oklahoma. Kansas State first beat Kansas by a score of 5‚Äì4. They then beat Baylor, 9‚Äì4. They faced Texas next for the right to play in the tournament championship.

Eisenhower, resigning from the post in 1965 after policy conflicts with President Lyndon B. Johnson, and was appointed by Richard Nixon in 1972 to serve as president of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Loomis was born on April 19, 1919, in Tuxedo Park, New York. His father, Alfred Lee Loomis built a fortune financing public utilities and sold out just before the Wall Street crash of 1929. Alfred Loomis set up a physics laboratory in an old mansion where Henry worked with his father as a teenager on brain-wave research, including participating as a volunteer in his father's experiments. The two later took part in pioneering research on radar. Loomis attended Harvard University and left in 1940 during his senior year to enlist in the United States Navy. Harvard granted him an undergraduate degree in 1946 based on his radar instruction while in the navy.Holley, Joe. \\"Henry Loomis, 89; Physicist Led VOA and Public Broadcasting\\", The Washington Post, November 8, 2008. Accessed November 15, 2008. In the navy, he was on the staff of the Commander in Chief Pacific Fleet Headquarters in Pearl Harbor. Loomis was responsible for the creation of training materials for radar, and worked with pilots and officers on ships to help overcome their wariness of the technology and develop their skills in its use.

Those who qualified from each college might not necessarily be studying in the college where they took part. Those who qualified were: *Victor Lucas - Kolej Han Chiang *Kan Wai Ling - Sunway University College, Johor Bahru *Colin Chia Siang - Sunway University College, Johor Bahru *Felicia Tan - Taylor's University College *Mohd Farhan - SEGi University College, Kota Damansara *Atiqah Nabilah - Kolej Lagenda, Nilai *Adam Jayarathim - INTI International University College, Penang *Azimah Arshad - SEGi University College, Kota Damansara *Birendra Bahadur - INTI International University College, Nilai *Belinda Chong - INTI International University College, Nilai *Arvind Kalia - Kolej Damansara Utama, Penang *Mea Hing Jian - Nilai International College *Carmen Leong - Nilai International College *Hadry Hyzan - Taylor's University College *Fatin Johanna - Taylor's University College *Teng Ivan - Metropolitan College, Subang Jaya *Radiah Nazir - Taylor's University College *Mohd Izhafran - Kolej Lagenda Nilai *Shereen Liang - INTI International University College, Subang Jaya *Nicolette Ng - Metropolitan College, Subang Jaya *Syed Mohd Danial - Taylor's University College *Rhea M.

This was followed by an acting workshop led by Nazril Idrus and Sazzy Falak. The participants were made to make animal sounds for grouping; four distinct sounds were heard and thus they were divided into four groups. Each group took the stage to make a creative introduction before they practice what they were taught by playing a drama. The acting session ended with some \\"nice walk\\" training, in which each contestant is required to make a creative and expressive grand entrance toward the audience in the same manner as TV hosts. The weekend ended with Henry Golding and Marion Caunter stepping in as judges to test each contestant by asking questions and reviewing recorded confessions, to determine the Top 12. The lucky twelve who made it were: Farhan, Birendra, Adam, Ivan, Danial, and Jian (males); and Nicolette, Radi, Azimah, Fatin, Carmen, and Shereen (females). ==Top 12== The Top 12 were taken to the 1 Utama shopping centre for their next challenge: the Mall Hunt, to test their abilities as team players, leaders and participants. They were divided into two teams of six ‚Äì Team 1 and Team 2 (or Team A and Team B in the captions) ‚Äì to perform a total of six tasks in the mall within a 90-minute limit; one task for one member of each team only. Before they begin each next task, each team was given a clue to determine their next task. After completing each task, the member who performed it collected a tag to mark their completion. The Mall Hunt was probably held no later than mid-September; this can be told from the Mid-Autumn Festival stalls in the footage. The six tasks (and their riddles), in no particular order, were as follows: { !width=15% Task !width=15% Venue !width=35% Description !width=35% Clue -  The Batting Cages  It's a Hit! Batting Cages, Upper Roof  Hit baseballs machine-tossed at increasing speeds  One part of me is hidden in the bat cave, The other part is also called a popular song, All you need to do is swing and not miss me, Or you will stand in my cage for too long. -  The Rock Climb  Camp 5, 5th Floor  Climb a 12-metre wall and touch a specified marker  You could climb a ladder or you could climb a tree, While others just prefer to journey up me, My goosebumps are strong enough for hands to handle, But a bad rope could sometimes end you up on a tangle. -  The Polaroid Model  High Street, Ground Floor  As a team, find one among the shoppers for one of them holding the Polaroid camera to take some photographs  Find a model for the following Nivea tagline: \\"Beauty is a sparkle\\" (Team 2); \\"Men who zest for life\\" (Team 1) -  The Book Hunt  MPH Bookstores, 1st and 2nd Floors  As a team, complete the crossword, all the answers of which form the title of the book to be searched by one of them  I hold the stones that you type and write, And immortalise them on sheets for everyone's sight, Your discoveries are knowledge which I hold dear, Without me everything will be unknown to all ears. -  The Futsal Challenge  Futsal @ 1U, Upper Roof  Dribble a ball past the training cones and kick it into a small goal post  My game is similar to the famous other, While they count twelve I just take five, Some find my rules are not such a border, But a score is what keeps both games alive. -  The Snakey Business  Reptiles Exhibition, Lower Ground  Handle a python out of its enclosure, clean the reptile, and remove waste from the enclosure  In the Garden of Eden I whispered in your ear, In the school of magic I'm the simbol everyone fears, Should you ever drop by to visit my glass house, Will you please bring me a fat juicy mouse. } The following are the Top 12 and their respective tasks, in chronological order: {class= !colspan=2Team 1 !colspan=2Team 2 - !width=15%Member !width=30%Task !width=15%Member !width=30%Task - Farhan The Rock Climb Biren The Batting Cages - Nicolette The Book Hunt Radi The Polaroid Model - Ivan The Futsal Challenge Jian The Rock Climb - Fatim The Polaroid Model Carmen The Snakey Business - Adam The Snakey Business Azima the Futsal Challenge - Shireen The Batting Cage Danial The Book Hunt } Team 1 completed all their tasks and reached the finish line first, while Team 2 trailed behind by five minutes. At the decisive meeting with Caunter and Golding, all members of Team 1 were exempt from elimination as a reward for their success in the Mall Hunt, while those of Team 2 were called up for another round of questioning to ask them why each of them should remain in the game; as well as to determine which one girl and one boy should leave the competition. Radi and Biren wereeliminated from the challenge, leaving the Top 10 for their next challenge. ==Top 10== Hari Raya Aidilfitri celebrations were around the corner, so the Top 10 were taken to the Rumah Kasih Harmoni orphanage in Sungai Buloh for a weekend to test their ability to display dedication, compassion, and their being a role model to society. Among the tasks which they performed there included cooking, housekeeping, laundry, fun and games with the orphans, as well as preparing for Raya. On day two, the contenders were brought to Cineleisure Damansara where they were split into two again, i.e. the girls' and boys' stall, to sell as many Nivea \\"charity goodie bags\\" for five hours to raise as much money for Rumah Kasih Harmoni. Together they contributed RM3,000 to the orphanage fund (another RM7,000 was added by Nivea into the donation). At the end of the charity stint, the Top 10 again faced Caunter and Golding for another round of inquisition of their experiences throughout the challenge, to determine who would be eliminated this time; it was Jian and Shireen's turn to depart from the competition. ==Top 8== In October, four guys and four girls were assigned their final task before six of them would star in the Ultimate Prom Nite, which is a date with the hosts for dinner in Avanti's in Sunway Resort Hotel (Farhan, Carmen, Danial, Nicolette) or fun under the sun in Sunway Lagoon (Adam, Azima, Ivan, Fatin); the boys dated Sarah while Hansen went one-on-one with the girls. Earlier, after the Top 10 elimination, the remaining finalists picked a paper cutting from a transparent bowl to determine the venue of their date. \\"The Confidence Beauty Regime\\", their quick grooming-up with Nivea products, was a must for the contestants before each date. ;Dinner *Farhan & Sarah:Farhan presented Sarah a sunflower to leave a good first impression. He reminded her that he is not an adventurous eater who largely insists on chicken. Midway through dinner, he presented her with a rose. When asked on his history with girlfriends, he replied that \\"it depends on how much is many.\\" Moreover, he admitted that he had to abstain from 'sad' films that make him shed tears. After their meal, they played snooker in the lounge. At the end of the date, Farhan gave Sarah a collage of herself from the FHM magazine cover. *Carmen & Hansen: Carmen arrived at the dining table with brownies in a shopping bag for Hansen. When asked of herself, she answered that she was the eldest of four siblings; when asked back, Hansen just told her he was the youngest sibling of all sisters. When asked of her favourite qualities of men, her reply was those who could \\"make me laugh all the time.\\" After the meal, they strolled at the garden in the vicinity of the hotel, where Hansen learnt that Carmen wanted to make her dates as memorable as possible. *Danial & Sarah: Danial presented Sarah with a small bouquet of three orange roses and a lavender before the meal, which Sarah thought was a \\"sweet gesture.\\" Midway through their meal, Danial told Sarah he liked chicken rice but not durians. He also appeared less than adventurous in the garden walk. In the confession, Sarah said Danial's first impression was plain while their walk in the garden was \\"just a walk,\\" which in all made him \\"not meet the requirements.\\" *Nicolette & Hansen: Hansen commented on Nicolette's air of confidence when she walked in for dinner. When he asked of her ideal date, she replied that the date need not be fancy, just comfortable. She gave him a \\"cheeky\\" miniature teddy bear dressed with horns and a cape. They ended their date with dessert in the lounge. ;Theme Park *Adam & Sarah: Adam greeted Sarah with a rose, treated her with ice-cream and took her around the Animal Park. Adam told her his favourite animal was the dragon, and the edited footage appeared to recreate what Adam imagined of the animals in the mini-zoo. They also shown trying out the Pirate's Revenge and Buffalo Bill Coaster rides in the Amusement Park, among others, and taking a doctored picture with a tiger in the snow. *Azima & Hansen: Azima started their date by giving Hansen a floral garland. They were shown riding in the Amusement Park, playing in the arcade and enduring the Scream Park. Azima commented that she and Hansen liked extreme sports. When asked of her favourite man on a ride, she was stumped, after telling Hansen she was not a fussy girl. *Ivan & Sarah: The date started with Sarah looking down from a tower at Ivan kneeling toward her with a rose. Ivan told her he hated one-on- one dates, having lived in groups all the time. They were shown riding the G-Force catapult and the Tomahawk. Sarah commented that although Adam was problematic, she thought it was a great date in which they learnt more of each other. *Fatin & Hansen: They first chose an exciting ride in the form of the Tomahawk, before visiting the Animal Park and playing the simulation race and video games in the arcade. Hansen commented that Fatin's ooze of confidence could \\"intimidate a guy,\\" thus having passed with flying colours. On the carousel, Fatin presented Hansen a pencil sketch of himself on a sheet of paper. The Top 8 confronted their last cut-out in SEGi Kota Damansara, this time with the hosts joining Caunter and Golding on the panel of four in the most crucial elimination session to select the Top 6 finalists for the Prom Nite. The judges reminded them that they were looking for one male and one female who could reach out to everyone rather than somebody intelligent or charming. Each contestant was evaluated individually concerning their date and their take on the competition and what they learnt while in contention. Finally, the hosts short-listed Fatin, Adam, Azima, Ivan, Nicolette and Farhan as the Top 6 who would vie for the Ultimate Prom King and Queen crowns, leaving Danial and Carmen out of contention. From 27 November 2008, 10.30pm (after this episode was broadcast) till 10pm the next day, viewers would vote for their favourite contestant which forms 50% of the overall results, the other half being judges' evaluation, to determine the Prom King and Queen. ==Finale== The \\"prom nite\\" of the Ultimate Prom Nite season two was recorded in the night of 28 November 2008, only to be telecast on 11 December. The top six arrived by limousine at the Kota Damansara campus of SEGi University College, which was also attended by 2007 Prom King Reagan Kang Ti Kern. The event proper kicked off with a performance from the CHARM cheerleader squad, followed by the appearances in pairs of Adam and Nicolette, Ivan and Azima, and Farhan and Fatin, introduced by Lee and Lian in front of a dining hall audience. Also present were the judges Marion Caunter, Henry Golding and specially-invited Amber Chia on the panel. After the introductions, the hip- hop dance trio Floor Fever performed before the audience to the turntabling of DJ Iman. The finalists' first challenge in the Prom Nite was to dance a ballroom-jazz routing in pairs, which they practised in William & Luisa's Danceworld as shown in the footage. Adam and Nicolette danced to Let It Rock by Kevin Rudolf and Lil Wayne; Ivan and Azima to Keeps Gettin' Better (Christina Aguilera); and Farhan and Fatin to Womanizer (Britney Spears). The second and most important challenge for the top six was another question and answer session which seeks everything the judges needed to know to determine the most worthy for the crowns. Each contestant prepared a campaign video before they respond to judges' questions on their personality. *Adam‚Äôs campaign video had him preparing a meal in a kitchen to display the importance of living skills. After fulfilling her request to do a \\"catwalk\\", he responded to Marion's question of which challenge really affected him the most, which is the Raya charity stint in the orphanage, which he claimed reminded him to take a hard look at what he had which the orphans were not so lucky to have. *Fatin recorded herself in a futsal activity in her campaign video to display her sense of teamwork. Marion asked what was her definition of a role model, which she mentioned of her emphasis on time management. On Amber's question on life after college, she told that she would be a \\"super-cool\\" architect as well as pursuing a double diploma on architecture and fashion design. *Ivan made a music video of his own rap song. Henry asked for his motto in life; he gave \\"Success is not a destination; success is a journey.\\" *Nicolette performed her rendition of Colbie Caillat's Realize and danced in her video, to emphasise on enjoyment. Henry asked for her strengths and weaknesses; her strength was her sense of \\"passion\\" but being perfectionist made her soft spot. Amber gave the role model question again, and she advised on giving one's best in studies but enjoying life at the same time. *Farhan told the world his life was about cars by drifting. Henry asked what he learnt throughout the competition; the seasoned \\"team leader\\" said he learnt of teamwork, understanding, open minds and leadership. Amber asked of his future after college, he admitted his dream of living luxuriously in Germany. *Fatin recorded herself scuba diving in the pool as a hobby which defined herself. Marion asked of her life after studies, she spoke of herself opening up businesses, possibly scuba diving, around the world. Amber asked for her weakness, and Fatin admitted being shy. Before the results, a footage of whom the other 14 contestants voted for among the top 6 was screened. After the judges made their decision combined with the public votes, Adam and Nicolette were crowned the Ultimate Prom King and Queen respectively, each receiving RM10,000 and a 15-minute appearance on the 8TV Quickie. Nicolette appeared on the Quickie on 16 December; Adam on the 19th. ==References *The Ultimate Prom Nite on 8TV, including Catch-Up TV Ultimate Prom Nite 2 Category:2008 Malaysian television seasons ","title":"The Ultimate Prom Nite (Season 2)"},{"id":"20209979","text":"Ilia Beshkov Dunov (; 24 July 1901 ‚Äì 23 January 1958) was a Bulgarian painter, graphic artist, comics artist https://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/beshkov_ilia.htm, caricaturist https://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/beshkov_ilia.htm, cartoonist https://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/beshkov_ilia.htm, illustrator, writer and pedagogue. ==Life== Beshkov was born in 1901 in Dolni Dabnik, nowadays a small town near Pleven in Pleven Province, central northern Bulgaria.

The Sunshine Tour hoped that it would attract a stronger field as a result, and possibly lead to a co-sanctioning agreement with the European Tour in subsequent years. In 2009, it was announced that the Africa Open would be included on the 2010 European Tour schedule. It was the third event of the four tournament South African swing of the tour, held after the Alfred Dunhill Championship and the South African Open, and the week before the Joburg Open.

He was the son of a weaver named William Gracie. In 1776, Gracie moved to Liverpool and clerked for a London shipping firm. He used his earnings to purchase a part interest in a merchant ship. ==Career== In April 1784, he sailed to America with a cargo of goods that were his own profit stock. He used the proceeds to invest in a mercantile company in New York City. He later moved to Petersburg, Virginia, and engaged in the export of tobacco to Great Britain.American Heritage magazine Retrieved 2008-11-14. In 1793, he moved back to New York and became a commissary merchant and shipowner (Archibald Gracie and Sons, East India Merchants). Gracie was a business partner of Alexander Hamilton and a friend of John Jay.Morrison, p. 91. Gracie was a member of the Tontine Association, which supervised the trading of stocks. Gracie expanded his interests and became active in the banking and insurance industries. He was a director of New York's earliest savings bank New York Bank for Savings.Knowles, Charles, \\"History of the Bank for Savings in the City of New York,\\" 1936. He was an incorporator of the Eagle Fire Insurance Company and vice president of the New York Insurance Company, a director of the United States Bank and of the Bank of America.

Gracie Mansion Gracie Mansion In 1798, Gracie purchased a large tract of land on Horn's Hook near the East River, where the following year he constructed a large two-story wooden mansion on the crest of a hill. Used primarily as his country home, the mansion quickly became a hub of the New York city social scene. Gracie's distinguished guests at the mansion included Hamilton (who founded the New-York Evening Post, now the New York Post, there), future United States president John Quincy Adams, and future French king Louis Phillippe. In 1823, Gracie sold the estate to pay off debts. It was acquired by New York City in 1891 and now serves as the residence of the Mayor of the city. ==Personal life== Woodlawn Cemetery In 1784, he married Esther \\"Hetitia\\" Rogers (1757‚Äì1833), a daughter of Nehemiah Rogers (1718‚Äì1760) and Elizabeth Fitch (1723‚Äì1812).

Descendants Gracie's grandson, Archibald Gracie III (1832‚Äì1864), a general in the Confederate Army, was killed at the Siege of Petersburg during the American Civil War. Another grandson, and Archibald Gracie III's younger brother, James King Gracie (1840‚Äì1903), was married to Anna Louisa Bulloch (1833‚Äì1893), daughter of James Stephens Bulloch (1793‚Äì1849) and the sister of Martha Bulloch (1835‚Äì1884), who married Theodore Roosevelt, Sr. (1831‚Äì1878).

The magazine's mission was to be a magazine of ideas, becoming a node in a larger network of digital culture publishers.Bazzichelli, Tatiana, (2008), Networking - The Net as Artwork, Digital Aesthetics Research Center, Milano. The magazine was also committed to give its topics a proper visual frame: focusing on graphic design and how it could have expressed the electronic culture in a sort of printed 'interface', exploiting at the same time the \\"sensorial\\" possibilities of the printed page. So, for example the page numbering was strictly in binary numbers for three years, then decimal figures were added aside. There was a department with stereogram pictures and the centerfold hosted a few optical art artworks. The graphic design included a fixed space in every article for contact and links, being inspired by the Whole Earth Catalog experiments.Dmitry Vilensky, Materialities of Independent Publishing: A Conversation with Aaaaarg, Chto Delat?, I Cite, Mute, and Neural, chtodelat.org, 2011.

Originally established as North British Rubber Company in 1856, the company is headquartered in Edinburgh. Scotland. It also has offices in London, New York and D√ºsseldorf. Besides rubber boots, it sells other products such as bags, socks, and other accessories. It previously made tyres, conveyor belts, combs, golf balls, hot water bottles and rubber flooring. Hunter holds several Royal Warrants by Appointment as suppliers of waterproof footwear. Green Wellington boots, now manufactured in China,www.telegraph.co.uk: Hunter Boots owner Lord Marland looks for new prey are its best known product. ==History== Beginnings In early January 1856 Henry Lee Norris, an American entrepreneur from Jersey City, New Jersey, and his friend and partner Spencer Thomas Parmelee of New Haven, Connecticut, landed in Scotland to work a patent of Charles Goodyear for the manufacture of India-rubber overshoes and boots. They landed in Glasgow and began by searching for a suitable factory, which they eventually found at the Castle Mill in Edinburgh. A fine pair of condensing steam engines and boilers were included in the lease, which they were able to take up almost immediately due to the mill's partial occupation at the time. The pair were ready to begin operations in the midsummer of 1856. Originally the company was named Norris & Co., which existed until the first limited liability act was introduced to Great Britain - the North British Rubber Company (which much later became known as Hunter Boot Ltd) was registered as a limited liability company in September 1857. Norris was eventually succeeded at the company by William Erskine Bartlett, who arguably invented what is considered to be the accepted type of car tyre today. Around 1907, the fledgling British Dunlop tyre company bought the 'Bartlett' patent from the North British Rubber Company for US$973,000, in order to acquire the rights to manufacture and distribute tyres under the same name. It is estimated that, today, the patent would be worth more than US$200,000,000. The company made not only rubber boots but also tyres, conveyors, combs, golf balls, hot water bottles and rubber flooring. In the beginning there were only four people working for the company; by 1875 the team had grown to a 600. The company had offices in Edinburgh, London and New York. World War I and II Production of Wellington boots was dramatically boosted with the advent of World War I when the company was asked by the War Office to construct a sturdy boot suitable for the conditions in flooded trenches. The mills ran day and night to produce immense quantities of these trench boots. In total, 1,185,036 pairs were made to cope with the Army's demands. The Wellington boot was envied by German soldiers during World War I and its dependability was seen to contribute to the British army's success. For World War II, the company was again called upon to supply vast quantities of Wellington and thigh boots. Eighty percent of production was for war materials - from ground sheets to life belts and gas masks. In the Netherlands, forces were working in flooded conditions which demanded Wellingtons and tight boots in vast supplies. By the end of the war, the Wellington had become popular among men, women and children for wear in wet weather. It had become far roomier with a thick sole and rounded toe. Also, with the rationing of that time, labourers began to use them for daily work. Post-war After World War II, boot making had to move to a larger factory in Heathhall, Dumfries, to deal with the rise in demand. The factory was originally built for Arrol-Johnston (later Arrol-Aster), a Scottish automobile manufacturer, in 1913, before the company was liquidated in 1931. This is said to be the first car factory in Britain to use ferro-concrete (concrete reinforced with metal bars), and was designed by Albert Kahn. The company's most famous Wellington, the \\"Original Green Wellington\\", was first made in the winter of 1955. It was the first orthopaedic boot made by Hunter, and was launched alongside the Royal Hunter - another boot that remained in Hunter's range in 2012. Reaction from trade was slow, and an order of 36 pairs considered an achievement. However, the company persisted, taking them to county shows and trade fairs. Thought of as more up- market than the traditional black Wellington of the time, the 'Original' tended at first to be worn by middle- to upper-class rural people, who are still sometimes referred to as the 'Green Welly Brigade'. A pair of Hunter 'Original Tall' Wellington boots. 1966-2005: Ownership changes In 1966, North British Rubber was bought by Uniroyal Limited of Greenville, South Carolina. Formerly known as the U.S. Rubber Company, Uniroyal is best known for car tyres and still operates today. In 1976, having continued to supply boots to the royal households, Hunter was awarded a Royal Warrant from the Duke of Edinburgh. This was shortly followed by another from the Queen in 1986. By this time, a pair of Hunter boots had become an essential item for those guided in upmarket country fashion. By the end of the 1980s, they were synonymous with the much caricatured figures of the Sloane Ranger Handbook. In 1986 Uniroyal was bought by the Gates Rubber Company of Denver, Colorado. From the beginning of 1987, the company was known under the name of its new owner. It entered the drysuit market shortly after the takeover by Gates, at its peak becoming the number two producer in the market with a 35% market share. Its fortunes continued to improve over the next ten years until, in 1996, Gates Corporation, formerly known as The Gates Rubber Company, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Tomkins plc, ending 85 years of ownership by the Gates family. Tomkins paid a reported ¬£366m for the stake. At that time, Gates was the largest non-tyre rubber company in the world. Intent on strengthening its positions in its core engineering markets, Tomkins began to dispose of a number of businesses during the period 1998-2001. In 1999, it sold the Consumer and Industrial Division of The Gates Rubber Company to Interfloor, the country's largest carpet underlay manufacturer. The company became the Hunter Division of Interfloor. In early 2004, a management-led investor group acquired the Hunter Boots business of Interfloor Group Ltd for ¬£1.98m in a leveraged buyout transaction. For the first time, Hunter became an independent company under its own name, specifically, the Hunter Rubber Company. At the end of 2004, Hunter announced that they would be releasing a range of seven different coloured Wellingtons to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Green Wellington Boot. Each different coloured boot, along with the kids' range, represented one of eight charities and were used to raise funds for them. The company launched a dedicated website, www.giving-welly.co.uk, to this purpose, and raised over ¬£250,000 for charity. Hunter launched several extensions to the Wellington range in mid-2005. Along with developing boots under licence for the Royal Horticultural Society, the Lady Northampton riding boot, combining a molded waterproof rubber and canvas upper, was also added to extend from the company's traditional all-rubber Wellington boot range. 2006: Administration and buy-out In 2006, the Hunter Rubber Company was placed into administration due to cash flow problems. In spite of a reported turnover of over ¬£5m, accountants from KPMG said the firm suffered from high manufacturing costs, including fuel costs, and made a loss from the expansion of its business to the United States. According to documents filed with Companies House, Hunter reported a loss of ¬£600,000 from September 2003 to the end of February 2005, when it had a net debt of ¬£2.03m. A private consortium led by Lord Marland of Odstock and comprising Peter Mullen, ex CEO of Thomas Pink, and Julian Taylor, all of whom were previous shareholders in Hunter Rubber Company, supported by the Pentland Group plc, bought Hunter out of administration and Hunter Boot Ltd was born. After rapid re-structuring of the company, new supply routes and distribution partners were found in the UK and USA and the Hunter portfolio was rationalised to core products exhibiting the key skills and tradition of the company. Hunter regained a large market share of the traditional country and leisure footwear market in the UK after the buy-out, and positioned itself as a strong contender in the USA - opening showrooms on 7th Avenue in New York and Regent Street in London. A new management team retained many of the staff from Hunter Rubber. In November 2006, Hunter Diving Ltd - the arm of Hunter Rubber that was responsible for manufacturing drysuits - was sold to Swedish rival company Trelleborg Group for an undisclosed sum. 2007-present Spring 2007 saw the relationship between Hunter and the Royal Horticultural Society further strengthened by the launch of a new range of RHS boots at the Chelsea Flower Show in London in May. Hunter also set up the 'Century' Division to handle its global range of safety boots, and to develop new products in this sector. A little over a year later, Century Safety was acquired by the Tigar Corporation for an undisclosed sum. Hunter Boot Ltd enjoyed a record season in summer 2007 announcing, in August, an 85% sales increase against the same period in 2006 Despite this, Hunter remained faced with major financial challenges regarding production. High manufacturing and fuel costs that contributed to the company's move into administration in 2006 remained prominent and, like many UK manufacturing businesses, Hunter was forced to consider whether it was worth manufacturing in the UK. The company also had to negotiate a volatile relationship with its landlord and an expensive and inefficient 96-year-old factory. Eventually, alternative supply sources were sought and developed in Europe and the Far East and plans were made to leave the Dumfries plant and move the company HQ to Edinburgh. This move was finally made in September 2008. The Chinese made gumboots look like the original Scottish made gumboots apart from the addition of an internal seam. Some manufacturing efficiencies have also been made including the removal of the latex dipping process, making the boots virtually identical to those from many other manufacturers. Hunter formed many relationships and collaborations with other brands in 2008, further extending its reach into the US, festival and fashion markets, while also contributing strongly to charity organisations. It produced versions of the classic Hunter Original boot for Jack Wills, WaterAid, Cowshed and Fortnum & Mason, as well as a trench coat designed by Suzy Radcliffe, owner of denim brand Radcliffe. In September 2008, following the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China, Hunter Boot Ltd sent specially made gold Wellington boots to every member of the Great Britain Olympic team who won a gold medal at the games. In January 2009, Hunter announced that it would be collaborating with the fashion designer Jimmy Choo for a limited edition black Wellington boot, embossed with Jimmy Choo crocodile print and containing gold rivets and a leopard-print lining. Another boot was then launched in 2011. Hunter has since seen strong growth with international distribution in over 30 countries. However, some observers feel the quality of the products have suffered over recent years and the brand has seen a number of negative comments regarding quality posted on website reviews. The Hunter boot tooling from the Scottish factory, and the manufacturing technique, is now used in Eastern Europe (Serbia) by Tigar Footwear and the products are marketed as Century Boots. In 2012, Searchlight Capital Partners, with headquarters in Europe and North America, became the new controlling shareholder in Hunter Boot Ltd. In 2013, Alasdhair Willis was appointed Creative Director and two new brand categories Hunter Original and Hunter Field were introduced. The launch of Hunter Original has seen four pioneering catwalk shows at London Fashion Week showcasing new footwear, outerwear and accessories alongside the Original boot. Hunter Field is a technical collection. Introduced in SS15, a new Hunter Field logo was developed in Field Green to differentiate the two brands. The Balmoral Field boot is a technical style and features a Newflex Vibram outsole for extended use. In 2014, Hunter opened its first global flagship on London's Regent Street. The award-winning store takes inspiration from the brand's heritage presenting the full Hunter Original, Hunter Field and Hunter Kids collections over three floors. In the same year, magician Steven Frayne, also known as Dynamo, worked with Hunter to become an integral part of their London Fashion Week show. Frayne appeared to levitate and then made models, including Suki Waterhouse, vanish in front of the crowd which included Stella McCartney and Anna Wintour. In 2015, in collaboration with Checkland Kindleysides, Hunter won Best Store Concept at the VM Excellence Awards. A second global flagship was opened in the Ginza district of Tokyo in 2016. In 2016, Hunter launched the Duke of Wellington by Hunter Field collection, a range of all-purpose equestrian outerwear and footwear. Vincent Wauters was appointed CEO. Hunter continues to be chosen by festival goers the world over, and is particularly synonymous with the mud-filled Glastonbury Festival. Kate Moss first wore her Original Tall boots to Glastonbury in 2005, while recent years have seen Alexa Chung in the Original Chelsea Boot, Cara Delevingne wearing the Original Backpack and Niall Horan in Hunter Original outerwear. In 2016, Hunter launched its Core collection, a range of weatherproof Hunter icons in an array of colors. \\"Rain Starts Play\\" was coined as a hashtag for the launch. ==See also== * Mackintosh * Gumboot Day * William's Wish Wellingtons ==References * Hunter Boot Ltd Official Website * The Hunter Original Boot Category:Shoe companies of the United Kingdom Category:Boots Category:Companies based in Edinburgh Category:Clothing companies of Scotland Category:Manufacturing companies based in Edinburgh Category:British companies established in 1856 Category:Clothing companies established in 1856 Category:1856 establishments in Scotland Category:Clothing companies of the United Kingdom Category:Shoe brands ","title":"Hunter Boot Ltd"},{"id":"20210117","text":"thumb Seskar () () is an island in the Gulf of Finland, part of the Leningrad Oblast of Russia.

By providing financial assistance to artists, writers, and institutions, he had a significant impact on the cultural development of the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond.Katherine Field Caldwell, \\"An American Patron,\\" The Magazine of Art, August 1938, pp. 211-215.Ansel Adams, An Autobiography, pp. 64-77. ==Early life== Albert Maurice Bender was born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1866, the son of Rabbi Philip Bender and Augusta Bremer Bender, both of whom were German. In 1881 he immigrated to the United States in the company of one of his maternal uncles, Joseph Bremer. Bremer and his brother William had already settled in San Francisco, and William hired the young Bender to work in his insurance office. Bender eventually became a very successful insurance broker in his own right. ==Patron of the Arts== A lover of literature from an early age, Bender began collecting rare books and helped create the Book Club of California in 1912. Inspired by his cousin Anne Bremer, a professional artist, Bender began collecting art, with an emphasis on work by local artists and the arts of China, Japan and Tibet. He became very interested in getting to know and help the artists and writers of the San Francisco Bay Area. Bender enjoyed giving things away even more than he liked acquiring them, and he became a prolific donor to Bay Area museums and libraries. He was once called \\"the most active buyer‚Äîand donor‚Äîof the work of California artists the state had ever known.\\"Oscar Lewis, To Remember Albert M. (Micky) Bender: Notes for a Biography (San Francisco: R. Grabhorn & A. Hoyem, 1973), p. 20. He donated significant collections to what are now the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Mills College Art Museum, and the University of California Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive. Beginning in 1932 he donated 260 pieces of Asian art to the National Museum of Ireland in memory of his mother. He gave collections of rare books and fine printing to Mills College, Stanford University, the University of California and the San Francisco Public Library. His generosity in Europe earned him the titles of Fellow of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, Chevalier of the Legion of Honor of France and Cavaliere of the Crown of Italy. He received honorary degrees from Mills College, and the University of California, Berkeley. Stanford University has a Bender Room in its library, and at Mills College there is a Bender Room in the former library building. Bender served as a trustee of Mills College, a commissioner of the San Francisco Public Library, and a board member of the California Society of Etchers (today's California Society of Printmakers), California Historical Society, Book Club of California, Japan Society, the Home for Aged Disabled, and the San Francisco Symphony, Art Association, Museum of Art, Opera Association, and Opera Guild. Bender helped launch the career of many artists and photographers, including Ansel Adams. He financed the publication of Adams's first portfolio (Parmelian Prints of the High Sierras, 1927) and his first book (Taos Pueblo, with author Mary Hunter Austin, 1930). ==Judaism== Bender was described as \\"the best-known Jew in San Francisco\\" in the 1930s. He \\"was a founding board member of the Federation of Jewish Charities and a long-time congregant of Emanu-El, whose cavernous sanctuary could not hold all who came to his funeral.\\" ==Albert Bender Exhibition, Dublin== A permanent exhibition at the National Museum of Ireland opened in 2008, entitled \\"A Dubliner's Collection of Asian Art - The Albert Bender Exhibition.\\" This exhibition displays the material donated by Bender to the National Museum of Ireland during the 1930s.

They were founded in 1998, first presented by the Gaylactic Network in 1999. In 2002 they were given their own organization, the Gaylactic Spectrum Awards Foundation. Logo of the Gaylactic Spectrum Award Foundation Since their inception, awards have been given in categories for novels, short fiction, and best other work. Other categories have also been added and removed in intervening years. Works produced before the inception of the awards are eligible to be inducted into the \\"Hall of Fame\\". The novels category is open to submissions of novels released during the prior calendar year in North America that includes \\"significant positive GLBT content\\". The results are decided by a panel of judges from the list of submitted nominees; the long list of nominees is reduced to a short list of finalists, and the results are generally announced and presented at Gaylaxicon, an annual convention devoted to LGBT-themed science fiction. This article lists all the \\"Best Novel\\" award nominees and winners and novels inducted into the Hall of Fame. Each award consists of an etched image on lucite on a stand, using a spiral galaxy in a triangle logo, based on the logo the Gaylactic Network. The award winner's name, work title, award year, and award category are etched on a small plaque on the base or on the plexiglass itself. A small cash stipend is awarded to winners in the Best Novel category. The cost of the awards is met through individual donations and fundraising events. Laurie J. Marks and Melissa Scott have both won the award twice. Elizabeth Bear holds the record for most nominations, with ten nominations and one win. ==Novel winners and nominees== In the following table, the years correspond to the year of the award ceremonies; the books were released is the preceding years.

It operates T-38 Talon aircraft conducting flight training. The squadron is one of the oldest in the United States Air Force, its origins dating to 18 August 1917 when it was organized at Selfridge Field, Mount Clemens, Michigan as a pilot training Squadron during World War I. The squadron saw combat during World War II, and became part of Air Defense Command, later Aerospace Defense Command and finally Tactical Air Command during the Cold War. ==History== World War I It was activated as the 87th Aero Squadron. the 87th saw brief service in the 1910s and again in the 1930s. World War II It was reactivated in 1942 when it was transferred to North Africa to fight against Germany's Afrika Korps. Following the German defeat and withdrawal from North Africa the 87th participated in the Allied Invasion of Sicily and Invasion of Italy and subsequent drive up the Italian Peninsula. During the Allied offensive in Italy the squadron was briefly dispatched to support the invasion of Southern France in 1944. Following the war the 87th was stationed in Austria for a short time before its return to the United States and inactivation.

Equipped with the North American F-51D Mustang, it was later equipped with the North American F-86D Sabre in 1953 prior to being reassigned to USAFE, stationed at RAF Bentwaters, England in 1954 assisting in the air defense of the United Kingdom. It was returned to CONUS in 1956 at Lockbourne Air Force Base, Ohio with an air defense mission over the Ohio Valley. It was uas upgraded to the North American F-86L Sabre in 1957, an improved version of the F-86D which incorporated the Semi Automatic Ground Environment, or SAGE computer-controlled direction system for intercepts; upgraded again in 1960 to the supersonic Convair F-102 Delta Dagger interceptor. The 87th was re- equipped with new McDonnell F-101B Voodoo supersonic interceptor, and the F-101F operational and conversion trainer in 1960. The two-seat trainer version was equipped with dual controls, but carried the same armament as the F-101B and were fully combat-capable. On 22 October 1962, before President John F. Kennedy told Americans that missiles were in place in Cuba, the squadron dispersed one-third of its force, equipped with nuclear tipped missiles to Clinton County Air Force Base at the start of the Cuban Missile Crisis.McMullen, pp. 10-12NORAD/CONAD Participation in the Cuban Missile Crisis, p. 16 These planes returned to Lockbourne after the crisis. The F-101Bs were transferred to the Air National Guard in 1968 and the squadron moved to Duluth International Airport, Minnesota. At Duluth, was upgraded to the Convair F-106 Delta Darts. During this period the squadron became known for its ability to perform cold weather operations. The squadron was again moved to K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base, Michigan in 1971. Inactivated in 1985 after budget cuts forced the cancellation of its scheduled conversion to the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle. Flying training The squadron was reactivated in 1990 and its mission changed to providing flight training. Today the squadron operates Northrop T-38 Talon aircraft providing training to pilot students on track to operate fighters or bombers. ==Lineage== 87th Aero Squadron * Designated as the 87th Aero Squadron and organized, on 18 August 1917 : Redesignated Squadron B, Park Field on 25 July 1918 * Demobilized on 1 December 1918 * Reconstituted and consolidated on 1 December 1936 with 87th Pursuit Squadron as the 87th Pursuit SquadronLineage, including assignments, stations and aircraft in Bailey 87th Pursuit Squadron * Constituted as the 87th Pursuit Squadron on 19 February 1935 * Organized on 1 March 1935 * Inactivated 1 September 1936 * Disbanded on 1 January 1938 * Reconstituted and consolidated on 21 March 1979 with 87th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron as the 87th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron 87th Flying Training Squadron * Constituted as the 87th Pursuit Squadron (Interceptor) on 13 January 1942 : Redesignated 87th Pursuit Squadron (Interceptor) (Twin Engine) on 31 January 1942 * Activated on 9 February 1942 : Redesignated 87th Fighter Squadron (Twin Engine) on 15 May 1942 : Redesignated 87th Fighter Squadron, Single Engine on 21 August 1944 * Inactivated on 15 July 1947 : Redesignated 87th Fighter- Interceptor Squadron on 11 September 1952 * Activated on 1 November 1952 * Inactivated on 8 September 1955 * Activated on 8 April 1956 * Inactivated on 1 October 1985 : Redesignated 87th Flying Training Squadron on 9 Feb 1990 * Activated on 2 Apr 1990 Assignments * III Corps Observation Group, 18 August 1917 ‚Äì 1 December 1918Per Bailey.

It is part of a group of plants commonly called wheatgrasses because of the similarity of their seed heads or ears to common wheat. However, wheatgrasses generally are perennial, while wheat is an annual. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Trials with intermediate wheatgrass, the product of which is trademarked by the Land Institute as \\"Kernza\\", show that it can be grown as a ‚Äúmulti- functional‚Äù crop, yielding various commodities as well as ecosystem services. Whereas annuals such as corn tend to deplete soil organic matter and require inputs, a perennial grain such as intermediate wheatgrass can yield crops while building soil organic matter.Intermediate Wheatgrass.

Multiple species or subspecies have been described based on different morphologies, like the presence or absence of pubescence. Here is a partial list of the binomial synonyms for Thinopyrum intermedium:USDA PLANTS Database ;Agropyron aucheri ;Agropyron ciliatiflorum ;Agropyron gentryi ;Agropyron glaucum ;Agropyron intermedium ;Agropyron podperae ;Agropyron pulcherrimum ;Agropyron trichophorum ;Elymus hispidus ;Elytrigia intermedia Common names Intermediate wheatgrass is the most widely used common name for Thinopyrum intermedium in the United States. The name \\"intermediate\\" probably refers to the height of the plant, which is generally somewhat shorter than Thinopyrum ponticum known by the common name of \\"tall wheatgrass.\\" Wild triga is the common name that was given to Thinopyrum intermedium by researchers at The Rodale Institute. The name was intended to distinguish varieties of the species developed for use as a perennial grain crop from forage cultivars which are identified by the common name \\"intermediate wheatgrass\\". Wild Triga Kernza is a trademarked name held by the Land Institute for the processed grains of intermediate wheatgrass. ==Origin and distribution== The native range of intermediate wheatgrass extends from central and southeastern Europe to Asia Minor. Although it was first brought to the United States in 1907, the first successful introduction was from the Caucasus region in 1932.Intermediate wheatgrass fact sheet The plant can now be found growing wild throughout the Western United States and Western Canada.The Grass Manual: Distribution map for Thinopyrum intermedium (in North America; introduced species) . accessed 1/31.2013 Thinopyrum intermedium is best adapted to: * Regions with annual rainfall between 12 and 30 inches * Soil with a pH between 5.6 and 8.4 * Locations with full exposure to the sun * A wide range of soils but with a minimum depth of 16 inches * Locations where the minimum temperature exceeds -38 ¬∞F ==Uses== ; Forage Thinopyrum intermedium is among the most productive forage species for the western United States. Because it heads relatively late, it can be grown effectively in mixture with alfalfa to increase its productivity, longevity, and forage quality. It regrows slowly after grazing or cutting, making it best suited to management with a single harvest per year.Intermediate Wheatgrass Plant Guide If multiple harvests are needed per year, other species will be more productive. If managed well, stands can persist for up to 50 years. ; Habitat Habitat for wildlife - intermediate wheatgrass can be an excellent food source for grazing and browsing animals. Left unharvested, the vegetation is a good nesting habitat for some birds and waterfowl. Generally, it is not an invasive plant and coexists well with native plant species. ; Soil management Erosion control and land rehabilitation are additional uses for this plant. It establishes quickly to form a protective mat of roots and rhizomes, even when planted on soils degraded by earth moving or mining. Within five years, stands have produced up to 7000 pounds of the dry root mass per acre in the top 8 inches of soil. Heavy root production holds the soil in place and restores its natural fertility by increasing the soil carbon. ; Grain Thinopyrum intermedium is a perennial grain crop. In 1983, the Rodale Research Center evaluated close to 100 species of perennial grasses to identify those with good potential for development into perennial grain crops. Intermediate wheatgrass was selected as the most promising species based on flavor, ease of threshing, large seed size, resistance to shattering, lodging resistance, ease of harvest, and perennial growth.Wagoner, P., and A. Schauer. 1990. Intermediate wheatgrass has as a perennial grain crop. p. 143-145. In: J. Janick and J.E. Simon (eds.), Advances in new crops. Timber Press, Portland, OR. Intermediate wheatgrass is nutritionally similar to wheat, and the grain can be ground into flour and used for food products, including muffins, tortillas, pancakes, cookies, crackers, and bread. Some products have been marketed under the trade name Kernza.https://www.wired.com/2014/06/potato-bean/ ==Seed production== Although the primary use of Thinopyrum intermedium is as a forage, seed production is essential because farmers and ranchers continue to establish new stands by planting the seed. In 1988 over 500 metric tons of seed were harvested in Saskatchewan alone, although more recently the harvest has fallen to less than 225 metric tons in that Canadian province.Seed Production of Intermediate Wheatgrass Average seed yields are about 330 pounds per acre, but on-farm yields of up to 880 pounds per acre have been achieved. Seed is generally produced in rows spaced 30 to 36 inches apart. The wide row spacing (relative to grain crops like wheat) allows for sustained seed yields for five to ten years. Without spacing and occasional tillage between the rows, yields decline rapidly as the plant population becomes increasingly dense through rhizome spread. Despite this, Thinopyrum intermedium is still considered lesser than Wheat by some, as its seeds are comparatively tiny. ==Breeding for grain production== Intermediate wheatgrass, Thinopyrum intermedium, has been widely hybridized with wheat in the effort to transfer traits such as disease resistance or perenniality.Cox et al. 2002 Breeding Perennial Grain Crops. Critical Reviews in Plant Science 21:51-91 Transferring leaf rust and powdery mildew resistance to wheat has been a special interest. But, attempts to directly domesticate the species into a grain crop did not commence until workers at the Rodale Research Center began to evaluate collections in 1983.A. Schauer, 1990. Evaluation of Intermediate Wheatgrass Germplasm. Rodale Research Center, Kutztown, Pennsylvania. In 1989, after assessing 300 collections, the workers selected the best twenty based on grain yield and seed quality. The selected collections were allowed to intermate, and 380 progeny were evaluated between 1991 and 1994. The best eleven plants, plus three from another evaluation, had intermated, causing a second cycle to begin. Seeds from the best plants in the second cycle were passed to scientists at The Land Institute, where the research has continued. In 2001 and 2002, seed from the first and second breeding cycles of the Rodale Research Center was planted at The Land Institute. In the fall of 2003, 1000 individual plants were dug up and vegetatively propagated to obtain three clones of each plant. The 3000 resulting plants were randomly transplanted to the field on a three foot by three-foot grid. In this manner, genetic differences between plants were separated from environmental influences. In 2005, heads were harvested from every plant and threshed to remove the seeds. The seeds were both counted and weighed to determine the yield per seed head and weight per seed. The fifty plants with the highest yield and largest seed were selected to intermate in 2004. In the fall of 2004, 4000 progeny were planted to establish the second cycle of breeding at The Land Institute. In 2008, these plants were harvested separately by using a power scythe and threshed in a combine. Again the best 50 plants were selected, this time based on yield per head, seed size, shortness, and free-threshing ability. The selection methods described above have increased seed size and yield by about 10 to 18% per cycle.Cox 2008 But perhaps of greater importance has been the discovery of two Mendelian traits. The first is dwarfing, which results in stems about 30 cm shorter than wild-type plants and short, erect leaves (see photo). The second is a more subtle change in head shape which results in thick, non-brittle heads and slightly larger seeds (see picture). Both of these traits appear to be controlled by dominant genes. The whole process mentioned above is called mass selection, which is breeding and selecting the best individuals to spawn the next generation. Mass breeding, however, is a process by which large quantities of genetically diverse individuals are made. Due to Thinopyrum intermedium's grass-like structures, some believe that it still needs to be domesticated as much as possible to resemble wheat. The fact that Thinopyrum intermedium is a perennial grass is important with regards to its use as a grain. The plant persists and can be harvested year after year, and its domestication would yield an additional three months of agriculture; its leaves are most active in the months in which common wheat is not active: July through September. Despite the promise, the yield per acre of Thinopyrum intermedium is 26% of the yield of traditional wheat. Because of this, some are putting effort into hybridizing wheat and Thinopyrum intermedium instead of attempting to domesticate Thinopyrum intermedium to a more acceptable yield. == Hybridization with wheat == Attempts to hybridize Thinopyrum intermedium with wheat have also been done. This has some distinct advantages. First, there is wide evidence that hybridization of Thinopyrum intermedium with wheat is a method to confer fungal resistance to domestic wheat plants. However, which specific genes that protect against which specific fungus has not been as well studied. Thinopyum elongatum and Thinopyrum intermedium impart a total of four leaf rust resistance genes, while Thinopyrum intermedium confers two powdery mildew genes. There's evidence that Thinopyrum intermedium also has resistance to wheat streak mosaic virus, the Aceria tosichella mite, Barley yellow dwarf, and others. These conferred genes in wheat help increase yield and hardiness in times of environmental strain. Second, Thinopyrum intermedium also has genes that improve bread making when hybridized common wheat. While this may not seem like an important characteristic, better bread may mean more calories, feeding more people. In addition, bread that stays fresh longer may provide more opportunities for people to be adequately fed, and/or the bread can be transported to areas without much food access. The Land Institute has been working to develop viable wheat and Thinopyrum intermedium hybrid since 2001, and there have been several successful strains that shared 14 Thinopyrum intermedium chromosomes and 42 wheat chromosomes. These hybrids perform better regarding yield and resistance than either of their parents, but it cannot be widespread due to the changes of climate across the world. Also, perenniality is lost with these hybrids. This loss of perenniality is a common problem with hybridization attempts. All other desired characteristics are present in the hybrids - large seeds, good yields, etc. - except that the plants have taken on too many wheat characteristics: they are annual. However, crosses between durum wheat and Thinopyrum intermedium have resulted in hybrids that do exhibit perenniality in addition to other desired characteristics (increased vigor, hardiness in colder weather, good yield). There are two general strategies for creating an alternate grain crop. One strategy is to domesticate Thinopyrum intermedium through mass breeding and selection to create a strain that mimics wheat's seed size and yield but retains Thinopyum Intermedium's natural resistances, hardiness, and perenniality. In other words, this strategy gives Thinopyrum intermedium more wheat-like characteristics. A second strategy is to hybridize wheat with Thinopyrum intermedium to create a strain of wheat that mimics Thinopyrum intermedium's resistance and perenniality but retains wheat's seed size and yield. In other words, this second strategy gives wheat more Thinopyrum intermedium-like characteristics. Researchers hope that these two strategies will progress and meet in the middle. ==GalleryReferences Category:Pooideae Category:Flora of Europe Category:Flora of Western Asia Category:Grasses of the United States Category:Cereals Category:Forages Category:Crops Category:Crops originating from Asia ","title":"Thinopyrum intermedium"},{"id":"20210226","text":"Ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens is a type of familial, autosomal dominant ichthyosis, a rare skin disorder.Freedberg, et al. (2003). Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. . It is also known as bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma of Siemens or ichthyosis exfoliativa. It is a genetic disorder with no known cure which is estimated to affect about 1 in 500,000 people.Caputo, Ruggero and Tadini, Gianluca: Atlas of Genodermatoses, Page 19, Published by Taylor & Francis, 2005, ==Symptoms== Ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens has symptoms very similar to epidermolytic hyperkeratosis but is generally milder. Ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens affects only the upper layers of the epidermis whilst epidermolytic hyperkeratosis affects the suprabasal layer which is deeper in the skin.Harper, John; Oranje, Arnold P. and Prose, Neil S.: Textbook of Pediatric Dermatology, Page 1110, Published by Blackwell Science, 2000, At birth the baby's skin has a red appearance like a sun burn (erythema). Blistering is usually present at birth and may be extensive or localized depending on the severity of the disease. Over the first few weeks the redness disappears and is replaced by dry, flaking skin on the arms, legs and around the belly button.Barnhill, Raymond L. and Crowson, A. Neil: Textbook of Dermatopathology, Page 349, Published by McGraw-Hill Professional, 2004, Other areas of skin appear normal. The skin is fragile and is prone to blistering (caused by mild trauma or sweating). After a few months hyperkeratosis develops with a dark grey or brown, ridged appearance on the ankles, knees and elbows. Palms and soles are generally unaffected. A slightly unpleasant, sweet odour may be present. A distinctive characteristic of ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens that is not present in other forms of ichthyosis is called the \\"Mauserung phenomenon\\" (Mauserung is German for \\"moulting\\" and was first described by H.W.Siemens). These are small patches of bare, apparently normal skin in the middle of areas of hyperkeratosis.Kirkham, Nigel and Lemoine, Nicholas R.: Progress in Pathology, Page 107, Published by Cambridge University Press, 2001, As the sufferer ages the flaking and blistering should improve. The hyperkeratosis may grow more severe but more localized and is generally only present on flexural folds of the major joints. ==Genetics== Ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens is an autosomal dominant genetic condition caused by a mutation in the gene for keratin 2e on chromosome 12.James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. . This means an affected person has a 50% chance of passing the condition on to their child. However, in about half of cases, there is no parent with the condition the genetic fault is due to a spontaneous mutation. Elias, Peter M and Feingold, Kenneth R. Skin Barrier, Page 490, Published by CRC Press, 2005, ==Diagnosis== Mild forms of ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens should be diagnosable from appearance and patient history alone. Severe cases are hard to distinguish from mild epidermolytic hyperkeratosis.A skin biopsy shows a characteristic damaged layer in the upper spinous level of the skin. It may be difficult to distinguish from epidermolytic hyperkeratosis. The gene causing ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens is known and so a diagnosis can be confirmed by genetic testing. ==Treatments== Treatments for ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens generally attempt to improve the appearance of the skin and the comfort of the sufferer. This is done by exfoliating and increasing the moisture of the skin. Common treatments include: * Emollients: moisturisers, petroleum jelly or other emollients are used, often several times a day, to increase the moisture of the skin. * Baths: long baths (possibly including salt) several times a week are used to soften the skin and allow exfoliation. * Exfoliating creams: creams containing keratolytics such as urea, salicylic acid and lactic acid may be useful. * Antiseptic washes: antiseptics may be used to kill bacteria in the skin and prevent odour. * Retinoids: very severe cases may use oral retinoids to control symptoms but these have many serious side effects including, an increase in blistering.Vahlquist, Anders and Duvic, Madeleine: Retinoids and Carotenoids in Dermatology, Page 160, Published by CRC Press, 2007, ==History== Ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens was first described by the German dermatologist Hermann Werner Siemens in 1937 from his study of an affected family. In 1994 the gene causing ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens was discovered. In the same year, it was also proved that ichthyosis exfoliativa is the same disease as ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens.OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man), Johns Hopkins University, Ichthyosis Bullosa of Siemens == See also == * List of cutaneous conditions * List of cutaneous conditions caused by mutations in keratins ==References External links == Category:Genodermatoses Category:Rare diseases Category:Cytoskeletal defects ","title":"Ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens"},{"id":"20210251","text":"Antigon√´ is a former municipality in the Gjirokast√´r County, southern Albania.

Since the Albanian Government's attempts to stop the illegal cultivation of cannabis, there have been a growing number of activists from around the region demanding a special status for the small commune. The activists demand the right to legalize production and selling of cannabis inside municipality borders.

The statuette is otherwise known as the Affe, einen Sch√§del betrachtend (\\"Monkey viewing or contemplating a skull\\"). It was first exhibited in 1893 at the Gro√üe Berliner Kunstaustellung (Great Berlin Art Exhibition). ==Description== A common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) is sitting atop a pile of books and manuscripts. The subject is holding in its right hand a human skull, echoing the scene in Shakespeare's Hamlet where the Prince of Denmark mourns Yorick (\\"Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him‚Ä¶\\"). The chimpanzee cradles its chin with a hand in a contemplative posture. Sitting with its left leg supporting the right, the right leg holds the calipers in its foot. A spine of one of the closed books reads \\"Darwin\\". Image:HugoRheinholdApeWithSkull.DarwinMonkey.5.jpgDetail showing human skull Image:HugoRheinholdApeWithSkull.DarwinMonkey.4.jpgDetail showing contemplative posture Image:HugoRheinholdApeWithSkull.DarwinMonkey.6.jpgDetail showing pile of books and \\"Darwin\\" spine Image:HugoRheinholdApeWithSkull.InstituteEvolutionaryBiologyUniversityEdinburgh.rip.jpgDetail showing rip to Bible page The book open at the feet and facing the viewer has a single inscription on the right hand page: \\"eritis sicut deus\\" from Genesis 3.5 when the serpent is enticing Eve to eat of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil in the Garden of Eden against the Lord‚Äôs command, promising \\"And ye shall be as God [knowing good and evil]\\"), however the second half of this quote is missing, ripped from the lower half of the page.Richter, J. & Schmetzke, A. (2005) \\"Der Philosophische Affe und die Eule der Minerva.\\" In Kant, H. & Vogt, A., eds. Aus Wissenschaftsgeschichte und -theorie. Hubert Laitko zum 70. Geburtstag. Berlin: Berliner Verlag f√ºr Wissenschafts- und Regionalgeschichte Dr. Michael Engel: p. 19. Also Richter, J., & Schmetzke, A. (2007). Hugo Rheinhold's philosophizing monkey‚Äîa modern Owl of the Minerva. NTM‚ÄîInternational Journal of History and Ethics of Natural Sciences, Technology and Medicine, 15(2): p. 86. ==Motivation== What inspired Rheinhold in making his sculpture is unknown, although it has obvious parallels with Auguste Rodin‚Äôs The Thinker. It is perhaps surprising to discover that while Rodin had developed his statue as early as 1880, it was not cast into bronze and displayed until after the Affe mit Sch√§del had debuted.Richter & Schmetzke (2005), p. 22. Also Richter & Schmetzke (2007), p. 90. ==Interpretation== The excised Biblical quote possibly suggests good and evil cannot be known, or told apart. With the ape's study, the library of books and the caliper instruments, the suggestion is the statue is warning against the application of rationalism in the absence of morality. Furthermore, when a human is depicted holding a skull, it is usually a comment on mortality (see memento mori) and the inevitability of death; famously, Hamlet bereaves Yorick in one instance, but is soon repulsed by this macabre souvenir as it brings him face- to-face with all life's grim destiny. But, for Hugo Rheinhold's ape, it is something quite different. The ape is engaged in assessment and measurement (confirmed by the calipers). That we should even consider this level of intelligence in another species is a bold examination of ourselves through eyes that bear witness to the disproportionate leverage historically awarded humankind. Hugo Rheinhold's original inscription \\"eritis sicut deus\\" (sometimes wrongly \\"eritus ‚Ä¶.\\"), either suggests Darwinian understanding may lead to Frankenstinian abuse of life's essence, or a more inclusive innocence that recognises a place for other advanced life‚Äëforms on our intellectual podium, if only we can just accommodate those guests.Derry, J.F. (2005), Rheinhold's Philosophizing Monkey . (Pamphlet). University of Edinburgh Cultural Collections Audit. University of Edinburgh Museums and Galleries. The page on which the Book of Genensis quote eritis sicut deus (‚ÄúYou will be like God‚Äù) is written is torn with the second part Scientes bonum et malum (\\"knowing good from evil\\") lost. Hugo was sympathetic to Darwinian ideas but familiar with Goethe's Faust, where the same quote appears with a warning on the misuse of man's power of reason, the calipers being symbolic of the scientific method. ==Reproduction== While debuting at the Gro√üe Berliner Kunstaustellung, the Affe mit Sch√§del became noticed by the Gladenbeck foundry (set up by Carl Gustav Hermann Gladenbeck in 1851).Schmetzke, A. (1999/2008), Hugo Rheinhold ... and his Philosophizing Monkey: Gladenbeck. Retrieved 1. December 2008. Purchasing the rights to the statue, the foundry featured it as a bronze in their catalogue, and it became popular through its quirky originality.Schmetzke, A. (1999/2008), From the Gladenbeck Catalog. Retrieved 1. December 2008. The 30 cm full-size moulds disappeared with the closure of the Gladenbeck foundry, but Bildgie√üerei Seiler GmbH obtained the 13 cm Gladenbeck casting mould (Nr. 1194).Schmetzke, A. (1999/2008), Original Gladenbeck Pieces of Rheinhold's Monkey. Retrieved 1. December 2008. ==Distribution== Gladenbeck editions of the statue are displayed at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology, University of Edinburgh, Aberdeen‚Äôs Medico- Chirurgical Society, the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, the Boston Medical Library and the Medical Library of Queen‚Äôs University in Kingston, Ontario, and also in Calgary, Cottbus, Gloucester, Kerikeri, Munnekeburen, Oakville, Osaka, Oxford, Salem am Bodensee, Stevens Point, Vienna, and famously on Lenin‚Äôs desk in the Kremlin.Schmetzke, A. (1999/2008), Table 1: Bronzes of Rheinhold's \\"Philosophizing Monkey\\"--location, physical characteristics, foundry etc. Retrieved 1. December 2008.

December 2008. ==Variations== Two foundries (Seiler in Germany, Powderhall in Scotland) still produce faithfully accurate editions of the statue. These editions differ in size (13cm and 30cm, respectively) and patinas (a light traditional bronze, and a much darker penny bronze, respectively). Other versions less faithful to the original mutate the chimp's pensive contemplation to head‚Äëscratching bewilderment, or sacrifice metallic lustre by substitution of cheaper materials (e.g., clay), and often undermine the sculpture's poise with careless positioning of a plastic skull. Prices currently range from $10 to $4,500. When they do rarely surface in auction or through private sale, Gladenbeck pieces can fetch up to $6,000.

In Chechen folklore, he is remembered as a figure of outstanding courage. ==Historical role== Taimin is an important figure in the history of resistance to colonialism in Chechnya, described as Chechnya's \\"greatest and most famous war leader\\" and by the Russian poet Alexandr Pushkin as \\"The renowned Beibulat, the most feared man in the Caucasus\\". He may well be considered also as the first Chechen diplomat for his negotiating efforts at the height of armed clashes between mountaineers and regular troops. Taimin was a flexible politician and diplomat. He wanted good neighbourly relations between his people and the people of Russia, so he aimed at reconciling the interests of the two and called for peace talks. To this end, Taimin often met with the tsar‚Äôs commissioner in the North Caucasus, General Yermolov. He established diplomatic contacts with Iran and Turkey and went to visit the countries personally. Many historians say the role of Taimin in the political life of the North Caucasus in the first three decades of the 19th century was that of the leader of rebellions by Chechen and Ingush people. Among the uprisings that he led against the Russians was that in the name of Islam in 1825. However, he used his position to prevent revolts by mountaineers from turning into bloodshed and robbery. Taking the command of the mutinies Taimin never stopped his diplomatic activity. The circumstances of his death remain unclear, and there is a possibility that Taimin was eliminated by more radically minded associates. The political activity of Taimin lasted for 30 years. Sympathizing with his views, his struggle for independence and fair relations with Russia were Pushkin, Alexandr Griboyedov, the Decembrists, and later Mikhail Lermontov and Leo Tolstoy. ==In folklore== Though a real historical figure, Beibulat Taimin is also a leading character of Chechen folklore. In poems and songs he is depicted as a legendary dare-devil. In oral narrative the name of Beibulat is associated with courage or reckless boldness. ==References== Category:Chechen people Category:1779 births Category:1872 deaths Category:Chechen politicians ","title":"Beibulat Taimiev"},{"id":"20210450","text":"Playing Mona Lisa is a 2000 comedy film directed by Matthew Huffman and starring Alicia Witt, Harvey Fierstein, Johnny Galecki, Elliott Gould, Marlo Thomas, Molly Hagan and Brooke Langton.

An overlooked landmark piece of legislation, President Woodrow Wilson determined amidst the repeated incidents with Germany to build \\"incomparably, the greatest Navy in the world\\" over a ten-year period with the intent of making the U.S. Navy equal to any two others in the world. Ultimately, more than $500 million was to be spent on ten battleships, six battlecruisers, thirty submarines, fifty destroyers, and other support vessels, to be built over a three-year period. ==History== Opposition to heavily armored and thus expensive \\"Dreadnought\\" ships was strong in the House, but was overcome by the results of the one great naval battle of World War I between the British Royal Navy and the German High Seas Fleet, the Battle of Jutland (31 May‚Äì1 June 1916), which proved to Preparedness supporters that a heavy, great tonnage Navy armed with large guns was necessary to defend U.S. shores and merchant ships on the seas in the event of war. President Wilson told Col. Edward House that he was anxious to hasten the day when the U.S. Navy was larger than the United Kingdom's, proclaiming \\"Let us build a Navy bigger than hers and do what we please.\\" The Senate passed the \\"Big Navy Act\\" on July 21 although it specified that five of ten battleships specified would be replaced with battlecruisers. Not until August 8 did Rep. Lemuel P. Padgett, Tennessee Democrat and Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, confer with President Wilson and agree to support the Senate bill. Democrat Rep. Claude Kitchin of North Carolina despaired: \\"The United States today becomes the most militaristic naval nation on earth.\\" In Sept. 1918, the Navy Department's General Board recommended in addition to the sixteen capital ships called for in the initial act, that an additional twelve battleships and sixteen battlecruisers be built. By 1922, the U.S. Navy, if all the ships had been built, could have surpassed the Royal Navy in size and strength. However the expectation of a ruinous arms race with the British and the Japanese led to the Washington Naval Conference of 1921‚Äì22 and the tonnage limit ratio agreements with the US having parity with the Royal Navy. ==See also== :Naval Act of 1938 :Naval Appropriations Act For 1922 :RMS Lusitania :Two-Ocean Navy Act ==Footnotes *Naval Appropriations Act (Text) from Emergency Legislation Passed Prior to December, 1917.

One can usually be considered as having fertility issues when they are unable to have a clinical pregnancy after 12 months of attempts with intercourse. Infertility, or the inability to get pregnant, affects about 8-12% of couples looking to conceive or 186 million people globally. In some places, rates of infertility surpass the global average and can go up to 30% depending on the country. Areas with lack of resources, such as assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs), tend to correlate with the highest rates of infertility. The main procedures sought are in vitro fertilization (IVF), artificial insemination by a donor, as well as surrogacy. These methods are types of assisted reproductive technology (ARTs). Each of these three methods have varying popularity in different countries, with one method being more sought after in these destinations compared to another method in another country. People are mainly driven towards fertility tourism due to lack of resources and high costs, while other contributing factors include cultural, religious, legal, and safety and efficacy issues. Other impacts on the need for fertility treatments from other countries include those who are infertile, single, of older age, or identify as a part of the LGBTQIA+ community. With these rising conditions, people end up having to travel to other countries in order to get the fertility treatments not accessible to them in their home countries. ==IVF == IVF Laboratory Destinations About 20,000 to 25,000 women (often accompanied by their partners) annually seek cross-border assisted reproductive technology (ART) services. Some countries are more popular than others as IVF destinations due to higher success rates and fewer regulations. Even small countries such as Barbados provide JCI-accredited IVF treatment aimed at women from abroad.  Israel  Reproduction is a central goal in Israel, a leading fertility tourism destination for in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment with over three decades of major technologies in the assisted reproduction industry. The trajectory of assisted reproductive technology is outlined through the expansion of IVF, the globalization of donating gametes, and the privatization of service.  United States  The United States is the destination of many Europeans because of the higher success rates and liberal regulations, based on The Fertility Clinic Success Rate and Certification Act that was passed in 1992. Affiliation between the right and left sides of the political spectrum in the United States prompted towards the protection of human life, even during the in vitro embryonic stages.  India  India and other Asian countries are the main destinations for U.S. women seeking fertility treatment, being the destinations for 40% of U.S. women seeking IVF and 52% seeking IVF with egg donation. The success rate of embryonic transfer through IVF has continually increased, resulting in more pregnancy outcomes.  Mexico  In recent years, Mexico has become a popular destination for cross-border IVF treatment due to its liberal ART and egg donation policies with over 50 clinics throughout the country that utilize assisted reproductive technology. Mexico does not have legal regulations that restrict or prohibit IVF or egg donations in Mexican clinics, making it a top destination for infertility treatment for people in the United States.  Iran  With over 30 years of experience in infertility research and treatment, Iran is one of the world‚Äôs pioneers in effective infertility treatment especially IVF. IVF centers in Iran are using the most advanced methods and utilizing the up-dated equipment provide the infertility treatment services to all Iranian and foreign couples. The \\"Iranian ART revolution\\" is the term coined for the movement that has allowed the advancement of infertility treatment in Iran so much so that the country has over 70 IVF clinics, thus making it the one of the countries with the highest amount of clinics in the Middle East. Cost factors Women from countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom may travel for IVF treatment and medications to save money. The cost of one IVF cycle in the United States averages US $15,000, while for comparable treatment in Mexico it is about US $7,800, Thailand $6,500, India $3,300, and Iran $2,500. When calculating these costs, the costs of the hotel, travel, and hospital stay may also be considered in addition to the medical treatment. Egg donation Egg donation is illegal in a number of European countries including Germany, Austria, and Italy. Many women then will seek treatment in places where the procedure is allowed, such as Spain and the United States where donors can be paid for their donation. Almost half of all IVF treatments with donor eggs in Europe are performed in Spain. IVF with anonymous egg donation is also the main ART sought by Canadians traveling to the U.S, and is the sought procedure for 80% of cross-border treatments by Canadians.

Many countries have no restriction on how many embryos may be transferred into the uterus at the same time, increasing the risk of multiple pregnancy and resultant potential complications.Health warning to women over fertility tourism Xpert Fertility Care of California These complications may affect both the mother and the child. Birth defects have been thought to arise from IVF, however not enough information is available on this topic. In 2005, 35% of all IVF‚ÄìET births in the US were multiple births (twins, triplets, or more). The burden of multiple births generated by placing too many embryos is carried by the individuals and the home country. == Donor insemination == Two thousand babies are born from treatments using sperm donations every year. A woman may go to another country to obtain artificial insemination by donor. The motivation to seek donors from outside countries may come from a want for a greater variety of gamete donors. Stricter laws or an inability to meet the criteria necessary in ones respective countries are other possible reasons. The practice is influenced by the attitudes and sperm donation laws in the host country. There is generally a demand for sperm donors who have no genetic problems in their family, 20/20 eyesight, with excellent visual acuity, a college degree, and sometimes a value on a certain height, age, eye colour, hair texture, blood type and ethnicity .The Genius Sperm Bank June 2006Baby steps; how lesbian alternative insemination is changing the world.

This success mainly comes from the reputation of Danish sperm donors for being of high quality and, in contrast with the law in the other Nordic countries, gives donors the choice of being either anonymous or non- anonymous to the receiving couple.Assisted Reproduction in the Nordic Countries ncbio.org The maximum amount of families that may use the sperm of one donor is capped at 12.

More than 50 countries worldwide are importers of Danish sperm, including Paraguay, Canada, Kenya, and Hong Kong.  United States  US sperm is equally sought out for. Denmark and the United States both claim that they have the largest sperm bank supply. Specifically, the California Cryobank believes it is the largest sperm bank in the world. The donations from this sperm bank has reached over 100 countries and accounts for over 75,000 births globally. There is no limit as to how many families may use the donation of one sperm donor.  Barbados  Another emerging destination for fertility tourism is Barbados.http://www.patientsbeyondborders.com/hospital/barbados-fertility- center Donors must be between the ages of 18 and 34 years of age. Personal information about the donor is available. The donors must follow the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) guidelines. More and more Caribbean couples and couples of African origin are in need medical help to conceive, and often want eggs and sperm that match their genetic composition. Shortages Some countries such as United Kingdom and Sweden, have a shortage of sperm donors. Sweden now has an 18-month-long waiting list for donor sperm. As a consequence of the shortage of donor sperm in UK in the late 1990s and the early years of the 21st century, British women travelled to Belgium and Spain for donor insemination,Wordspy In turn citing Madeleine Bunting, \\"X+Y=$: the formula for genetic imperialism,\\" The Guardian, 16 May 2006 until those two countries changed their laws and imposed a maximum number of children one donor may produce. Prior to the change in the law, the limit in the number of children born to each donor depended upon practitioners at fertility clinics, and Belgian and Spanish clinics were purchasing donor sperm from abroad to satisfy demand for treatments. Anonymous donation was permitted in Belgium and is a legal requirement in Spain. These two countries also allowed single heterosexual and single and coupled lesbians to undergo fertility treatment. Ironically, at the time, many Belgian and Spanish clinics were buying sperm from British clinics donated by British donors, and they were able to use that sperm according to local laws and limits. In addition, lesbian women from France and eastern Europe travelled to these countries in order to achieve a pregnancy by an anonymous donor since this treatment was not available to them in their own countries. British fertility tourists must therefore now travel to other countries particularly those that do not include children born to foreigners in their national totals of children produced by each donor. Britain also imports donor sperm from Scandinavia but can only limit the use of that donor's sperm to ten families in the UK itself, so that more children may be produced elsewhere from the same donor.[Shortage of Sperm Donors in Britain Prompts Calls for Change] By DENISE GRADY. Published: 11 November 2008 The New York Times At least 250 Swedish sperm recipients travel to Denmark annually for insemination. Some of this is also due to that Denmark also allows single women to be inseminated. It is illegal to pay donors for eggs or sperm in Canada. Women can still import commercial U.S. sperm, but that's not true for eggs, resulting in many Canadian women leaving the country for such procedures.My scattered grandchildren The Globe and Mail. Alison Motluk. Sunday, 13 September 2009 07:53PM EDT == Surrogacy ==  Legal Controversies  alt= There are differing amounts of laws and regulations on surrogacy around the world regarding the legality of surrogacy, who can be a surrogate or receive this service, if fertility tourism is legal, and if surrogates can be compensated for their services; dictate where potential parents travel to obtain surrogacy. For instance, there are places where there is a lack of laws or guidelines for surrogacy and many custody battles have resulted in outlawing surrogacy and deeming parental rights to the surrogate over the intended parents, or fully legalizing surrogacy all together. In countries where surrogacy is banned, there have been many instances where the intended parents go to different destination for surrogacy, but then have difficulty bringing their new children back to their countries. Also, there are some countries that ban commercial surrogacy, but allow unpaid \\"altruistic surrogacy\\" and also provide contracts to the involved parties.  Religious Views  There are many differing religious views surrounding surrogacy with regards to lineage and heritability, motherhood, and marital fidelity. Judaism, Hinduism, Islam, and other Christian denominations outside of Catholicism generally approve of surrogacy, but each with some concerns. With Judaism, there are concerns regarding legitimacy and most tend to believe that motherhood belongs to the person who actively delivers the child. Hinduism views infertility as a curse to be cured by any means necessary, generally approving of surrogacy. There is Islamic religious concern centered mainly around the importance of and confusion of lineage and inheritance. Other Christian denominations have a wide variety of views from encouraging surrogacy as it shares the blessing of parenthood, to viewing surrogacy as a means of confused identity in a child and a disruption in traditional marital practices and procreation. Catholicism; however, generally views any third party involved in marriage or procreation to be an intrusion, and thus commonly views gestational surrogacy as an intrusion to the marital bond. Religion has lead to legal bans on surrogacy in some countries. For instance, in Costa Rica the Catholic church successfully lobbied to ban surrogacy.  Destinations  Some countries, such as the United States, Canada, Greece, Ukraine, and Russia are popular foreign surrogacy destinations. Eligibility, processes and costs differ from country to country. Previously popular destinations, India, Nepal, Thailand, and Mexico have since 2014 banned commercial surrogacy for non-residents or allow it only for heterosexual married couples. Thailand criminalized surrogacy by foreigners and same-sex couples in 2014, prompted by incidents of surrogate parents behaving badly. The most notable of those cases was that of Baby Gammy, a twin born with Down syndrome and left behind by the Australians who contracted his birth (his sister, who wasn‚Äôt born with the disorder, was taken with them to Australia). It didn't help that Gammy's biological father was also a convicted sex offender. Fertility tourism for surrogacy is driven by legal restrictions in the home country or the incentive of lower prices abroad. Popular destinations are those which permit commercial gestational surrogacy, where the cost is relatively low, and which give the intended parents legal rights over the newborn child, whether by streamlined adoption procedures or direct parental rights. India India was a main destination for surrogacy because of the relatively low cost until international surrogacy was outlawed in 2015. Although there are no official figures available, a 2012 United Nations report counted around 3,000 fertility clinics in India. India's surrogacy business was estimated at around $1 billion annually. Indian surrogates became increasingly popular amongst intended parents in industrialized nations because of the relatively low costs and easy access offered by Indian surrogacy agencies. Clinics charged people between $10,000 and $28,000 for the complete package, including fertilization, the surrogate's fee, and delivery of the baby at a hospital. Including the costs of flight tickets, medical procedures and hotels, this represented roughly a third of the price of the procedure in the UK and a fifth of that in the US. In 2013, surrogacy by foreign homosexual couples and single parents was banned. In 2015, the government banned commercial surrogacy in India and permitted entry of embryos only for research purposes. Russia Liberal legislation makes Russia attractive for ‚Äúreproductive tourists‚Äù looking for techniques not available in their countries. Intended parents come there for oocyte donation, because of advanced age or marital status (single women and single men) and when surrogacy is considered. Gestational surrogacy, even commercial is absolutely legal in Russia, being available for practically all adults willing to be parents. Foreigners have the same rights for assisted reproduction as Russian citizens. Within 3 days after the birth the commissioning parents obtain a Russian birth certificate with both their names on it. Genetic relation to the child (in case of donation) doesn‚Äôt matter. On 4 August 2010, a Moscow court ruled that a single man who applied for gestational surrogacy (using donor eggs) could be registered as the only parent of his son, becoming the first man in Russia to defend his right to become a father through a court procedure. The surrogate mother‚Äôs name was not listed on the birth certificate; the father was listed as the only parent. However, not always court is on the side of such parents. In 2014 a Moscow court denied registration of the baby born via surrogacy to the single man. Appeal court agreed with such decision. Ukraine Ukraine has seen a significant increase in international surrogacy since 2015, when the practice was banned in several Asian countries that had been popular destinations. Surrogacy is completely legal in Ukraine. However, only healthy mothers who have had at least one child before can become surrogates. Ukrainian surrogate mother are mostly from small towns or rural areas. The full surrogate package may cost around $50,000, with the surrogate receiving less than 50% of that amount. Surrogates in Ukraine have zero parental rights over the child, as stated on Article 123 of the Family Code of Ukraine. Thus, a surrogate cannot refuse to hand the baby over in case she changes her mind after birth. Only married couples can legally go through gestational surrogacy in Ukraine, but they have to be able to prove they cannot carry a baby themselves for medical reasons. Also at least one parent must have a genetic link to the baby (egg donors are therefore frequently used). Gay couples and single parents are prohibited to use gestational surrogates. Belarus Surrogacy is legally allowed in Belarus from 2006, however, major clients for such kind of services in this country are mainly Russian citizens. According to Belarussian legislation, surrogacy can be used here due to strict medical indications by married heterosexual couples and single women (for single women only in case they are able to provide their own oocytes). Unlike Russia or Ukraine, in Belarus Intended Mother is written not only in the legal birth certificate issued by local authorities, but also appear in the medical birth certificate given by the Maternity House, where delivery of the surrogate mother took place. This gives to the Intended Parents legal ability to take baby directly from the Maternity house, being sure that no one will claim parental rights over the children born via surrogacy. In Belarus only healthy women in the age from 20 to 35 years old, who are in legal marriage and have at least one healthy child can be surrogate mothers. Essential conditions of surrogacy agreement, that should be notarized, are also specified in the Law \\"On Assisted Reproductive Technologies\\". United States People travel to the United States for surrogacy procedures for the high quality of medical technology and care, as well as the high level of legal protections afforded through some US state courts to surrogacy contracts as compared to other countries. Increasingly, same sex couples who face restrictions using IVF and surrogacy procedures in their home countries travel to US states where it is legal. The United States is occasionally sought as a location for surrogate mothers by couples seeking a green card in the US, since the resulting child can get birthright citizenship in the United States and can thereby apply for green cards for the parents when the child turns 21 years of age.Harney, Alexandra (23 September 2013). \\"Wealthy Chinese Seek U.S. Surrogates for Second Child, Green Card\\". Reuters Health Information (via Medscape). Surrogacy costs in USA between $95,000 and $150,000 for the complete package, including fertilization, legal fees, compensation, the agency's fee.  Canada  Canada has recently become a more popular foreign surrogacy destination, with almost half the babies born to Canadian surrogates in British Columbia in 2016 and 2017 being for foreign parents. Numerous reasons have been proposed to explain Canada's rising popularity as an international surrogacy destination. For one, Canada is one of the few destinations that still allows surrogacy for foreign commissioning parents. While, Greece, Ukraine, Russia, Georgia and a few U.S. states also permit surrogacy for foreign commissioning parents, Canada does not discriminate on the basis of marital status or sexual orientation. Canada is also attractive because it is fairly efficient in granting legal parental rights, declaring legal parenthood and issuing birth certificates within weeks of birth. This contrasts with other countries with lengthier processes that often deter commissioning parents wanting to quickly return home with their new babies. Canada's strong and universal healthcare system also makes it a favourable international surrogacy destination, as pregnant women in Canada receive high-quality, publicly funded healthcare throughout pregnancy, during delivery, and after birth. This reduces the risk of pregnancy complications, which is often a significant concern of commissioning parents. ==Citizenship == The citizenship and legal status of a child resulting from surrogacy can be problematic. The Hague Conference Permanent Bureau identified the question of citizenship of these children as a \\"pressing problem\\" in the Permanent Bureau 2014 Study (Hague Conference Permanent Bureau, 2014a: 84-94). According to the Bureau of Consular Affairs, U.S. Department of State, either one or both of the child's genetic parents must be a U.S. citizen for the child to be considered a U.S. citizen. In other words, the only way for the child to acquire U.S. citizenship automatically at birth is if he/she is biologically related to a U.S. citizen. Further, in some countries, the child will not be a citizen of the country in which he/she is born because the surrogate mother is not legally the parent of the child. This could result in a child being born without citizenship. == References  External links == *IVF Treatment Abroad: Issues and Risks Category:Infertility Category:Medical tourism ","title":"Fertility tourism"},{"id":"20210655","text":"Orkney College is a further and higher education college in Orkney, an archipelago in northern Scotland.

It was the first of several November 2008 wildfires that burned hundreds of homes from November 13-15, 2008. The Tea Fire ignited in the Cold Springs section of Montecito at approximately 17:50 PST on November 13, 2008. The fire started at a Mar Y Cel historic structure called the \\"Tea House\\" above Mountain Drive, giving the fire its name. Spreading rapidly, it was fanned by offshore winds, known as Sundowner winds that blow down the Santa Ynez Mountains, gusting up to 85 mph (113 km/h). These winds caused the fire to spread into the city of Santa Barbara. The fire was 40% contained on the 15th, 75% on the 16th, and by November 17, 2008 it was 95% contained after burning 1,940 acres (785 ha), and on November 18, it was 100% contained. On November 15, 2008, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger visited areas burned in the Tea Fire, noting: \\"When you walk around the area that was destroyed, it looks like hell.\\" ==Cause== The cause of the fire was under investigation for the first four days when authorities determined on November 17 that it was \\"human caused\\". The following day, Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office investigators announced that the fire was caused by a group of ten men and women, age 18 to 22, college students, who went to the abandoned Tea House on the night of Wednesday, November 12 and held a bonfire party at the location, through the early morning hours of Thursday, November 13. The students told investigators they had put the fire out, but authorities believe the fire smoldered until the heavy winds ignited the fire on Thursday afternoon. On November 20, 2008, Dr. Andreea M. Serban, President of Santa Barbara City College, issued a statement noting that \\"nine of the ten individuals identified as allegedly responsible for the Tea Fire have been confirmed as Santa Barbara City College students.\\" That same day, Dr. Gayle Beebe, president of Westmont College, noted in a press release the college's relief to learn that none of the ten was enrolled at Westmont. Although the individuals were found guilty of trespassing and holding an illegal bonfire, the DA's office felt there was not enough evidence to convict them of starting the blaze. \\"After a months-long investigation by several agencies, the District Attorney‚Äôs Office decided it could only charge the group with the misdemeanor crimes, the DA felt as though she would be unable to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the campfire they had started ‚Äî and, according to group members, extinguished ‚Äî more than 12 hours earlier had led to the Tea Fire.\\" ==Impact== Injuries and evacuations Santa Barbara County officials stated that they had reports of 13 persons injured, including 10 who were treated for smoke inhalation and three with burn injuries, one of which was critical. There is a foundation for two burn victims of the fire, Lance & Carla Hoffman. Information on this foundation including benefits and donations can be found on Facebook's group \\"Tea Fire Survivors: Lance and Karla Hoffman\\". The fire resulted in the evacuation of 5,400 homes with 15,000 residents. Approximately 2,700 evacuees were back home by the November 16, 2008. There was one fatality amongst the evacuees, a 98-year-old man, though the county sheriff-coroner had not ascertained yet if the death was due to the fire or his multiple medical problems. Destruction of 210 homes House on Mountain Drive destroyed in the fire The Tea Fire resulted in the destruction of 210 homes in Montecito and Santa Barbara. Of the destroyed homes, 106 were in the city of Santa Barbara, and the remainder were in Montecito. One of the homes destroyed in the fire belonged to actor Christopher Lloyd (best known for playing \\"Doc\\" Brown in the Back to the Future trilogy). Westmont College The campus of Westmont College was heavily damaged, though no injuries were reported on the campus. The college's advance planning for a shelter-in-place was credited with this favorable human outcome. 800 people (students, employees, visitors and neighbors) hunkered down in the gymnasium as the fire burned to within ten feet. The Physics Lab, Psychology Building, Math Building, and 15 of the faculty homes were destroyed. Two of the residence hall buildings in Clark residence hall were completely gutted, along with the RD cottage. With the recovery phase initiated over the weekend, faculty and staff were allowed back on campus November 17, but the school was scheduled to remain closed to students until December 1. Mount Calvary Retreat House and Monastery The Mount Calvary Retreat House and Monastery in Santa Barbara, part of the Order of the Holy Cross, was also destroyed. ==Response and resources== California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency for Santa Barbara County due to the Tea Fire.

They were supported by 193 engines, 7 dozers, and 1 watertender. Resources were expanded on November 15 to include 2,235 firefighters and 9 helicopters with cost estimates of $3.5 million, which increased to $3.9 million the following day.

Sainsbury's later took full control of the stores alone in 1989, rebranding them as Sainsbury's SavaCentre, until 2005 when the stores were integrated into the Sainsbury's supermarket brand. The hypermarket stores ranged in size from to and the discount supermarkets ranged in size from to . At the time of its inception, it was the only dedicated hypermarket chain in the UK. ==History== The initial idea In the 1970s, the then chairman and chief executive of Sainsbury's, John Davan Sainsbury (later Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover), realised the threat from the emergence of hypermarkets, such as those being built by the French retailer Carrefour. The initial response by Sainsbury's was a 50:50 joint enterprise with British Home Stores, set up on 9 December 1975 as Sabre Hypermarkets Limited, which was changed to Savacentre Limited on 31 December 1976. These stores carried the complete range of Sainsbury's and British Home Stores products along with electrical goods like refrigerators, washing machines, audio and TV equipment. Typical counters included delicatessen and fresh fish counters, an in-store bakery, a restaurant and half the stores' sales areas were devoted to textiles, electrical goods and hardware. The stores also featured a petrol filling station and some stores had over 1,000 car parking spaces. Following Sainsbury's launch of its home improvements venture, Homebase, in 1981, home and gardening products featured in SavaCentre stores. Following the 1986 merger between Habitat Mothercare and British Home Stores to create Storehouse plc, baby care products were also sold in SavaCentre stores. The first stores open The first SavaCentre opened at The Galleries, Washington, Tyne and Wear, on 15 November 1977, with of sales area, and the slogan \\"The store with more for less.\\". This store was extended by a further to in 1986. On 17 October 1978, the second SavaCentre opened at the Hempstead Valley Shopping Centre in Kent. At the opposite end of the Hempstead Valley Shopping Centre a Presto opened, which later became a Safeway store. Following Sainsbury's buyout of Storehouse plc's 50% stake in SavaCentre in 1989, the British Home Stores branch was located in the former Safeway store, following Safeway's 2004 acquisition by Morrisons. Calcot, Reading The number of SavaCentres grew slowly during the 1980s. In March 1980, the third SavaCentre opened adjacent to the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Basildon with of sales area, but this store was sold to Asda in 2004. In October 1980, a fourth SavaCentre opened in Oldbury, West Midlands. In September 1981, the Calcot SavaCentre, opened in Reading,Sainsbury's statement, The Times, 5 November 1981, page 18 and this store was used in the SavaCentre TV adverts in 1983. The Calcot SavaCentre was further extended by in the 1990/91 financial year, but when the store was rebranded as Sainsbury's in 2005, the extension was sold off to Next. In 1984, SavaCentre started trading in Scotland following the opening of a store in Cameron Toll, Edinburgh. At the time of building the Cameron Toll SavaCentre was Scotland's largest single level store. This store also had to compete with a smaller Safeway supermarket in the same shopping centre, until the Safeway branch closed down in 1997. Colliers Wood, London Merton SavaCentre opened on 28 February 1989 with of sales area, making it the largest hypermarket in the UK at the time of its opening. This store was later split up, with Sainsbury's taking of the sales area. The remainder of the space was taken by Marks & Spencer in 2005, with the store exterior featuring branding of both companies. Due to having two major shops (not just Sainsburys) this branch is often still known as the London Savacentre. Becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Sainsbury's Logo under Sainsbury's full ownership In March 1989, Sainsbury's bought out Storehouse plc's 50% share in the partnership for ¬£123 million (valuing SavaCentre at ¬£246 million in total or each of its then seven stores at ¬£35.14 million each) and SavaCentre became a wholly owned subsidiary on 13 March 1989, in the last week of the financial year; the chain was rebranded \\"Sainsbury's SavaCentre\\". Sainsbury's initially negotiated a long-term contract with Storehouse to continue to supply SavaCentre with clothing, domestic textiles, lighting and other non-food lines, although these products were gradually phased out following the launch of Sainsbury's ‚ÄòLifestyle‚Äô range of own brand clothes in 1991. This was rebranded as 'I-N-I-T-I-A-L-S' in September 1996. The Sainsbury's own-label clothing range is now branded ‚ÄòTu‚Äô. At the time Sainsbury's believed there was scope for significant expansion. The deal also allowed Sainsbury's to integrate the company more fully with its existing food retailing chain, whilst retaining a separate management structure. Further expansion London Colney SavaCentre, off Junction 22 of the M25 motorway in Hertfordshire, opened on 13 March 1990 with of sales area, and at the time of its opening it also became the largest hypermarket in the UK. The London Colney hypermarket was so large that two-thirds of the sales space was devoted to non-food. This store was later split up, with Sainsbury's taking of the sales area. The balance was sold off to Marks & Spencer, and the store was then rebranded as \\"Sainsbury's M&S;\\" in 2005. The SavaCentre in Meadowhall Shopping Centre, Sheffield, opened in September 1990 with of sales area. This store was originally rebranded as a Sainsbury's in 1999, but was closed and relocated to Crystal Peaks in 2006. It was not until October 1993 that the tenth SavaCentre opened at Beckton in East London. This store became the smallest SavaCentre, with a sales area of . At the same time, a new concept store, with of sales area, was opened adjacent to the SavaCentre. This store was based on a club warehouse type format, and was branded as \\"Bulksava\\". This format was not a success and the Bulksava branch closed down a year later. In August 1995, the London Sydenham SavaCentre opened with a sales area of . Also in 1995, the Stockton-on-Tees SavaCentre opened, with of sales area, which was a former North Eastern Co-op store, and was later sold to Tesco in 2003. In 1997 a SavaCentre opened in the White Rose Centre, off the M62 motorway, in Morley, West Yorkshire, in Leeds, with of sales area. When this store was rebranded as Sainsbury's in 2005, the sales area was cut to . A fourteenth SavaCentre hypermarket planned for Braehead in Glasgow, Scotland, was also due to open in 1997. This store opened in 1999 before moving to a larger in the same complex in 2009. A fifteenth SavaCentre hypermarket was planned for Romford, North East London, but this store also only eventually opened as a large Sainsbury's. 1990s store formats strategy During the 1990s, Sainsbury's continued to build around 20 new freehold supermarkets of around a year. Sainsbury's argued that customers would rather experience a full grocery offer which was not compromised by non-food. With stores of SavaCentre size, not only could the full range of Sainsbury's grocery products be sold, but a further sales area of equivalent size could be devoted to non-food. SavaCentre was still only a small part of the group, and did not make a significant contribution to the Group in comparison to Sainsbury's Supermarkets. This came at a time when arch-rival Tesco was not only matching the Sainsbury's store portfolio, but also exceeding them in terms of store size. Tesco mimicked the Sainsbury's SavaCentre format, and launched its own Tesco Extra version only as recently as 1997, which was 20 years later than Sainsbury's. Tesco pursued an aggressive expansion of its hypermarket format, converting existing stores through extensions, and paying high prices for larger pieces of land to build new ones. Although Tesco Extras or ASDA Supercentres now dominate the hypermarket format, it was Sainsbury's who pioneered the modern hypermarket. Launching a strategic review of SavaCentre On 2 August 1997, Sainsbury's decided to launch a strategic review of its SavaCentre hypermarket format with the help of Coopers and Lybrand. The review concluded that to offer both the full Sainsbury's food offer and a comprehensive non-food offer, stores would have to have sales areas of at least . Obtaining planning permission for stores of these sizes in out-of-town locations was difficult, and there was also stiff competition from specialist non-food retailers at the time. It was therefore decided that the traditional SavaCentre hypermarket format would be scrapped, and the existing SavaCentre stores would be remodelled to look like a very large Sainsbury's Supermarket, concentrating on fresh foods and home meal replacements. Under the new format, DIY and gardening products, lighting, TVs and vacuum cleaners were to be removed. It was also decided that the SavaCentre name would be re-branded as \\"Sainsbury's Savacentre\\", to emphasise that the company was now a wholly owned subsidiary of Sainsbury's. In August 1998, the Calcot SavaCentre was the first to be remodelled to provide a greater emphasis on food, with the food to non-food ratio changing from 60:40 to 80:20. Non-food was based around four areas: Celebration - for party ideas; Indulgence - for beauty products; Baby and Toddler; and Cookshop. The refurbishment cost ¬£26m. The Store Director from 1996 - 2002 was Chris Diplock. The Chairman of Savacentre Ian Coull, MD Jack O'Brien and other Board members all resigned. The plan was to roll out the format, which was trialled at the Calcot SavaCentre, to the other 12 SavaCentres over the next three years. This format was not a success and the Calcot SavaCentre became the only hypermarket to be remodelled in this format. The Calcot SavaCentre was downsized and rebranded as Sainsbury's in 2005, but following a further refurbishment in 2008, a number of the products removed in the 1998 revamp were reintroduced. Launch of discount supermarkets On 29 May 2002, Sainsbury's announced that it would be extending the SavaCentre format to include discount supermarkets, under the \\"Sainsbury's savacentre\\" brand name, with the slogan \\"Making Life Taste Better For Less\\". These stores were aimed at family shoppers with a much stronger emphasis on Economy ranges than a core Sainsbury's Supermarket. These stores would range in size from to of sales area, with a third of the space devoted to non-food. The plan was to launch 90 of these discount supermarkets in total, after the successful launch of six trial stores. Only eight discount supermarkets were opened in total. The first store, with a sales area of , opened in Northfield, Birmingham on 30 May 2002. Further stores were opened in Wigan, on 17 August 2002; Ashton-under-Lyne, Wednesfield, Wolverhampton, in 2002; Knotty Ash, Liverpool, on 1 March 2003; Stoke-on-Trent, on 18 March 2003; and stores in Bolton and Grimsby both opened on 27 March 2003. This format was not a success and all eight stores have since reverted to the core Sainsbury's brand. Disappearance In April 1999, the Sainsbury's SavaCentre Head Office in Wokingham, Berkshire closed down and the administration moved to Sainsbury's Blackfriars headquarters in London. The Wokingham Head Office was originally opened in 1982. At the same time, SavaCentre hypermarkets were integrated into Sainsbury's new \\"Large Store Formats Group\\", as Sainsbury's largest store format, a position it held until September 2010. As a result of the ‚ÄòMaking Sainsbury‚Äôs Great Again‚Äô recovery plan by chief executive Justin King, revealed on 19 October 2004, it was announced that the Sainsbury's SavaCentre concept would be scrapped, and would be integrated under the main Sainsbury's brand. It is believed that the SavaCentre brand name was scrapped because the SavaCentre format had had mixed success over the years, and it left the option for Sainsbury's to launch a substantial non-food offer in its heritage supermarket estate, under its own brand, in the future. 10 of the 13 former SavaCentre hypermarkets now trade as Sainsbury's, and all seven of the former Sainsbury's SavaCentre discount supermarkets now trade as Sainsbury's. The former SavaCentres in London Colney and Merton are now joint-ventures with Marks & Spencer, and have the external fascia 'Sainsbury's M&S;'. The Meadowhall, Sheffield branch of SavaCentre was converted into a Sainsbury's supermarket store in 1999 and closed in 2005. At the same time as Meadowhall closed, in 2006, a replacement opened south of the city at Crystal Peaks. A number of the other SavaCentres were downsized, leaving the London Sydenham SavaCentre store the largest Sainsbury's store in the country until September 2010. Beyond the SavaCentre format In 2008, the London Sydenham and Oldbury SavaCentres were remodelled to trial a launch of a non-food offer. This was the first major attempt by Sainsbury's to launch its own substantial non-food offer since the launch of the \\"Lifestyle\\" clothing range in 1991. This format became a success, and later in 2008 Sainsbury's announced that it was going to extend as many as 100 existing Sainsbury's Supermarkets to SavaCentre store sizes of of sales area or more by 2014, to carry the new non-food offer trialled in the London Sydenham and Oldbury SavaCentres. For example, the Hayes, Middlesex branch was extended from to in sales area in November 2008. The Kempshott, Basingstoke branch was extended to of sales area and was both opened and reopened by Life President Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover himself in November 1988 and 25 August 2010 respectively. The largest format of Sainsbury's stores are now around 100,000 sq ft, launched from September 2010. These stores have sales areas of or more with a 55:45 split between food and non-food. The first three stores of this format were launched in Crayford, Lincoln and Stanway, Essex between September and December 2010. ==SavaCentre locations== Head offices * 45/47 Peach Street, Wokingham, Berkshire (1982-1999) * Stamford House, Stamford Street, Blackfriars, London (1999-2001) * 33 Holborn, London (2001-2005) Hypermarkets The former Sainsbury's SavaCentre at the White Rose Centre in Leeds. *The Galleries, Washington, Tyne and Wear, opened 15 November 1977 and rebranded as Sainsbury's in 2005 *Hempstead Valley Shopping Centre, Hempstead, Kent, near Gillingham, Kent, opened 17 October 1978 and rebranded as Sainsbury's in 2005 *Basildon Town Centre, adjacent to the East Gate Shopping Centre, Essex, opened March 1980 and closed on 13 March 2004.

Specifically, the average of any polynomial function of degree t over the design is exactly the same as the average over Haar measure. Here the Haar measure is a uniform probability distribution over all quantum states or over all unitary operators. Quantum t-designs are so called because they are analogous to t-designs in classical statistics, which arose historically in connection with the problem of design of experiments. Two particularly important types of t-designs in quantum mechanics are projective and unitary t-designs. A spherical design is a collection of points on the unit sphere for which polynomials of bounded degree can be averaged over to obtain the same value that integrating over surface measure on the sphere gives. Spherical and projective t-designs derive their names from the works of Delsarte, Goethals, and Seidel in the late 1970s, but these objects played earlier roles in several branches of mathematics, including numerical integration and number theory. Particular examples of these objects have found uses in quantum information theory, quantum cryptography, and other related fields. Unitary t-designs are analogous to spherical designs in that they reproduce the entire unitary group via a finite collection of unitary matrices. The theory of unitary 2-designs was developed in 2006 specifically to achieve a practical means of efficient and scalable randomized benchmarking to assess the errors in quantum computing operations, called gates. Since then unitary t-designs have been found useful in other areas of quantum computing and more broadly in quantum information theory and applied to problems as far reaching as the black hole information paradox . Unitary t-designs are especially relevant to randomization tasks in quantum computing since ideal operations are usually represented by unitary operators. == Motivation == In a d-dimensional Hilbert space when averaging over all quantum pure states the natural group is SU(d), the special unitary group of dimension d. The Haar measure is, by definition, the unique group-invariant measure, so it is used to average properties that are not unitarily invariant over all states, or over all unitaries. A particularly widely used example of this is the spin \\\\tfrac{1}{2} system. For this system the relevant group is SU(2) which is the group of all 2x2 unitary operators. Since every 2x2 unitary operator is a rotation of the Bloch sphere, the Haar measure for spin-1/2 particles is invariant under all rotations of the Bloch sphere. This implies that the Haar measure is the rotationally invariant measure on the Bloch sphere, which can be thought of as a constant density distribution over the surface of the sphere. An important class of complex projective t-designs, are symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measures POVM's, which are complex projective 2-design. Since such 2-designs must have at least d^2 elements, a SIC-POVM is a minimal sized complex projective 2-designs. == Spherical t-Designs == Complex projective t-designs have been studied in quantum information theory as quantum t-designs. These are closely related to spherical 2t-designs of vectors in the unit sphere in \\\\mathbb{R}^d which when naturally embedded in \\\\mathbb{C}^{d} give rise to complex projective t-designs. Formally, we defineA. Ambainis and J. Emerson, Quantum t-designs: t-wise independence in the quantum world; https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0701126 a complex projective t-design as a probability distribution over quantum states (p_i,\\\\phi_i\\\\rangle) if \\\\sum_i p_i (\\\\phi_i\\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\phi_i)^{\\\\otimes t} = \\\\int_{\\\\psi}(\\\\psi\\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\psi)^{\\\\otimes t}d\\\\psi Here, the integral over states is taken over the Haar measure on the unit sphere in \\\\mathbb{C}^d Exact t-designs over quantum states cannot be distinguished from the uniform probability distribution over all states when using t copies of a state from the probability distribution. However in practice even t-designs may be difficult to compute. For this reason approximate t-designs are useful. Approximate t-designs are most useful due to their ability to be efficiently implemented. i.e. it is possible to generate a quantum state \\\\phi\\\\rangle distributed according to the probability distribution p_i \\\\phi_i\\\\rangle in O(\\\\log^c d) time. This efficient construction also implies that the POVM of the operators Np_i \\\\phi_i\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\phi_i can be implemented in O(\\\\log^c d) time. The technical definition of an approximate t-design is: If \\\\sum_i p_i \\\\phi_i\\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\phi_i = \\\\int_{\\\\psi}\\\\psi\\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\psid\\\\psi and (1-\\\\epsilon)\\\\int_{\\\\psi}(\\\\psi\\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\psi)^{\\\\otimes t}d\\\\psi \\\\leq \\\\sum_i p_i (\\\\phi_i\\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\phi_i)^{\\\\otimes t} \\\\leq (1+\\\\epsilon)\\\\int_{\\\\psi}(\\\\psi\\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\psi)^{\\\\otimes t}d\\\\psi then (p_i,\\\\phi_i\\\\rangle) is an \\\\epsilon-approximate t-design. It is possible, though perhaps inefficient, to find an \\\\epsilon-approximate t-design consisting of quantum pure states for a fixed t. Construction For convenience d is assumed to be a power of 2. Using the fact that for any d there exists a set of N^d functions {0,...,d-1} \\\\rightarrow {0,...,d-1} such that for any distinct k_1, ..., k_N \\\\in {0,...,d-1} the image under f, where f is chosen at random from S, is exactly the uniform distribution over tuples of N elements of {0,...,d-1}. Let \\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\sum_{i=1}^d \\\\alpha_i i\\\\rangle be drawn from the Haar measure. Let P_d be the probability distribution of \\\\alpha_1 and let P= \\\\lim_{d\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\sqrt{d} P_d. Finally let \\\\alpha be drawn from P. If we define X = \\\\alpha with probability \\\\tfrac12 and X = -\\\\alpha with probability \\\\tfrac{1}{2} then: E[X^j] = 0 for odd j and E[X^j] = (\\\\tfrac{j}{2})! for even j. Using this and Gaussian quadrature we can construct p_{f,g} = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^d a_{f,i}^2}{S_1 S_2} so that p_{f,g}\\\\psi_{f,g}\\\\rangle is an approximate t-design. == Unitary t-Designs == Unitary t-designs are analogous to spherical designs in that they reproduce the entire unitary group via a finite collection of unitary matrices. The theory of unitary 2-designs was developed in 2006 specifically to achieve a practical means of efficient and scalable randomized benchmarking to assess the errors in quantum computing operations, called gates. Since then unitary t-designs have been found useful in other areas of quantum computing and more broadly in quantum information theory and in fields as far reaching as black hole physics. Unitary t-designs are especially relevant to randomization tasks in quantum computing since ideal operations are usually represented by unitary operators. Elements of a unitary t-design are elements of the unitary group, U(d), the group of d \\\\times d unitary matrices. A t-design of unitary operators will generate a t-design of states. Suppose {U_k} is a unitary t-design (i.e. a set of unitary operators). Then for any pure state \\\\psi\\\\rangle let \\\\psi_k\\\\rangle = U_k\\\\psi\\\\rangle. Then {\\\\psi_k\\\\rangle} will always be a t-design for states. Formally define[0809.3813] Unitary designs and codes a unitary t-design, X, if \\\\frac{1}{X}\\\\sum_{U \\\\in X} U^{\\\\otimes t}\\\\otimes (U^{*})^{\\\\otimes t} = \\\\int_{U(d)} U^{\\\\otimes t}\\\\otimes (U^{*})^{\\\\otimes t}dU Observe that the space linearly spanned by the matrices U^{\\\\otimes r}\\\\otimes (U^{*})^{\\\\otimes s}dU over all choices of U is identical to the restriction U \\\\in X and r + s = t This observation leads to a conclusion about the duality between unitary designs and unitary codes. Using the permutation maps it is possible to verify directly that a set of unitary matrices forms a t-design. One direct result of this is that for any finite X \\\\subseteq U(d) \\\\frac{1}{X^2} \\\\sum_{U,V \\\\in X}tr(U*V)^{2t} \\\\geq \\\\int_{U(d)}tr(U*V)^{2t}dU With equality if and only if X is a t-design. 1 and 2-designs have been examined in some detail and absolute bounds for the dimension of X, X, have been derived. Bounds for unitary designs Define Hom(U(d),t,t) as the set of functions homogeneous of degree t in U and homogeneous of degree t in U^{*}, then if for every f \\\\in Hom(U(d),t,t): \\\\frac{1}{X} \\\\sum_{U \\\\in X} f(U) = \\\\int_{U(d)}f(U) dU then X is a unitary t-design. We further define the inner product for functions f and g on U(d) as the average value of \\\\bar{f}g as: \\\\langle f,g\\\\rangle := \\\\int_{U(d)}\\\\bar{f(U)}g(U) dX and \\\\langle f,g\\\\rangle_X as the average value of \\\\bar{f}g over any finite subset X \\\\subset U(d). it follows that X is a unitary t-design iff \\\\langle 1,f\\\\rangle_X = \\\\langle 1,f\\\\rangle \\\\quad\\\\forall f. From the above it is demonstrable that if X is a t-design then X \\\\geq dim(Hom(U(d),\\\\left\\\\lceil\\\\tfrac{t}2\\\\right\\\\rceil,\\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\tfrac{t}2\\\\right\\\\rfloor)) is an absolute bound for the design. This imposes an upper bound on the size of a unitary design. This bound is absolute meaning it depends only on the strength of the design or the degree of the code, and not the distances in the subset, X. \\\\---- A unitary code is a finite subset of the unitary group in which a few inner product values occur between elements. Specifically, a unitary code is defined as a finite subset X \\\\subset U(d) if for all U eq M in X tr(U^*M)^2 takes only distinct values. It follows that X \\\\leq dim(Hom(U(d),s,s)) and if U and M are orthogonal: X \\\\leq dim(Hom(U(d),s,s-1)) ==Notes== Category:Quantum mechanics Category:Quantum information science Category:Information theory Category:Quantum information theory ","title":"Quantum t-design"},{"id":"20210884","text":"KAGH-FM (104.9 FM, \\"Today's Country 104.9\\") is a radio station licensed to serve Crossett, Arkansas, United States.

Its Armenian population was forcefully evicted and deported by Soviet special forces during Operation Ring in 1991 in one of the most brutal operations of the war. The fact that the population of Martunashen was able to successfully flee is often attributed to the actions of Simon Achikgyozyan of the Arabo Detachment. Achikgyozyan died on 30 April 1991, defending the town by concentrating the fire from oncoming tanks against himself while the townspeople fled through the forests to safety.

A member of the third century gens Anicia and a novus homo, Faustus was appointed the Legatus Augusti pro praetore (or imperial governor) of the province of Numidia by the emperor Septimius Severus, a position he held from AD 197 ‚Äì 201.

Olmstead began his career with the Black Hawks in 1949. In December 1950, he was traded to the Montreal Canadiens via Detroit. Olmstead had his best statistical years playing for Montreal, leading the league in assists in 1954‚Äì55 with 48, and setting a league record for assists with 56 the following season. Olmstead was claimed in an Intra-League Draft by Toronto Maple Leafs in 1958, and played there until his retirement in 1962. In the 1967‚Äì68 season, Olmstead served as coach of the expansion Oakland Seals. Olmstead played in the Stanley Cup final in 11 of his 14 seasons in the NHL, winning it five times. He won it four times with Montreal, in 1953, 1956, 1957, 1958, and once with Toronto, in 1962, which was his last season. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1985. ==Early life== Olmstead was born in Sceptre, Saskatchewan, a small village with a population of less than 200, in southwestern Saskatchewan. In 1944, at the age of 18, he moved to Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, to play junior hockey. In his first year, Olmstead and the Moose Jaw Canucks challenged for the Memorial Cup, after finishing the playoffs with a 15‚Äì1 record. They were unsuccessful in the series against the St. Michael's Majors. Olmstead had 10 goals and eight assists in the 17 playoff games he played. He played another season in Moose Jaw, before being assigned to the Kansas City Pla-Mors of the United States Hockey League (USHL) by the Chicago Black Hawks. ==Playing career== Chicago Black Hawks Olmstead played three full seasons for Kansas City, and part of another, later in 1950, for the Milwaukee Sea Gulls. In the 1946‚Äì47 season, Olmstead joined the Pla-Mors, finishing the season with 42 points in 60 games. In 1948‚Äì49, the Canadiens, who had originally sponsored him and owned his rights, traded him to the Chicago Black Hawks. The same season, Olmstead made his NHL debut, called up after scoring 33 goals and 44 assists, for 77 points, in 52 games with the Pla-Mors. He played nine games for the Black Hawks and collected two assists. Olmstead played the entire following season for the Black Hawks, appearing in 70 games and scoring 20 goals. Olmstead split the 1950‚Äì51 season between four teams, playing for all but one of them. He began the season playing for the Black Hawks franchise, playing 15 games in the NHL and 12 in the USHL, for the Milwaukee Sea Gulls. On December 2, 1950, Olmstead, with Vic Stasiuk, was traded to the Detroit Red Wings, in exchange for Lee Fogolin and Steve Black. On December 19, 1950, 17 days after the trade to Detroit, he was traded again, without ever suiting up for the Red Wings, to Montreal, for Leo Gravelle. Olmstead would never leave the NHL until his retirement in 1962, playing 39 games that season on a line with Maurice Richard and Elmer Lach, scoring 38 points. Olmstead also appeared in 11 playoff games, collecting six points, as the Canadiens lost the best-of-seven Stanley Cup finals to the Toronto Maple Leafs in five games. Montreal Canadiens Olmstead and the Canadiens appeared in the Stanley Cup finals again in the 1951‚Äì52 season, losing to the Detroit Red Wings; after recording 35 points in 69 regular season games, Olmstead was limited to an assist in 11 playoff games. In his third season with the Canadiens, Olmstead won the Stanley Cup for the first time. Earning 45 points in 69 games, he was named to the Second All-Star Team. On the last game of the season, Olmstead bodychecked Gordie Howe, stopping him from tying Maurice Richard's record of 50 goals in a season. Olmstead played all the 70 games in the next two seasons, scoring 52 and 58 points in the 1953‚Äì54 and 1954‚Äì55 seasons, respectively. The Canadiens lost to the Red Wings once more in the Stanley Cup finals, in both seasons. In the 1954‚Äì55 season, Olmstead led the league in assists, with 48, as Montreal lost another Stanley Cup Final to Detroit. The 1955‚Äì56 season saw the start of Montreal's five consecutive Stanley Cup championships. In that season, Olmstead played on a line with Jean B√©liveau and Bernie \\"Boom Boom\\" Geoffrion. He set a record for assists, with 56, and also scored eight points in game, recording four goals and four assists, tying Rocket Richard's record. This record would be broken in 1976 by Darryl Sittler, who scored six goals and four assists, for ten points. As well as winning the Stanley Cup, Olmstead was again named to the Second All-Star Team. Olmstead won two more Stanley Cups in the 1956‚Äì57 and 1957‚Äì58 seasons. After the conclusion of the 1957‚Äì58 seasons, doctors informed him that he had no strength left in his knees, and that he should contemplate retirement. As a result of this prognosis, the Canadiens left Olmstead unprotected in the Intra-League Draft, and he was claimed by Billy Reay, the head coach of the Canadiens' chief rival, the Toronto Maple Leafs. Toronto Maple Leafs Early in the 1958‚Äì59 season, Punch Imlach, the assistant general manager of the Leafs, fired Reay, installed himself as head coach, and appointed Olmstead as the playing assistant coach. This meant that while Imlach coached the team during games, Olmstead was in charge of the practices; however, Olmstead only lasted three months as assistant coach, resigning to devote more time to improving his play. The same season, the Leafs went on a long winning streak in order to qualify for the playoffs, but they lost to the Canadiens in the finals. After losing in the Finals the next season, and falling short of the Finals the next season, Olmstead won his fifth and final Stanley Cup in 1962, missing two months of the season with a broken shoulder, and being limited to only four out of the 12 playoff games. ==Retirement== Following his fifth Stanley Cup win, with Toronto, the New York Rangers claimed Olmstead in the Intra-League Draft on June 4, 1962. This came as a surprise to Olmstead, who refused to report to the team. The Canadiens offered to acquire him from the Rangers, within a month; Olmstead demanded an immediate trade. Since no deal came, he retired at the age of 35. During his 14-year NHL career, Olmstead scored 181 goals and 421 assists, for 602 points; in the playoffs, he collected 59 points, in 115 games. In his 14 seasons, Olmstead appeared in the Stanley Cup final 11 times. He won five times, four of them with the Montreal Canadiens, and once with the Toronto Maple Leafs. After retiring from playing, Olmstead attempted coaching. In the 1965‚Äì66 season, Olmstead coached the Vancouver Canucks, of the WHL; he finished with a 33‚Äì35‚Äì4 record, for a .486 winning percentage. In the 1967‚Äì68 season, Olmstead coached the expansion Oakland Seals, in the NHL. Olmstead did not last the full season, stepping aside after 64 games, having only won 11 games, with a .297 winning percentage. ==Legacy== Known as \\"Dirty Bertie\\" because of his physical playing style, Olmstead was a power forward, making hard hits and winning battles in the corners. He was not a very good skater, and thus he had to compromise with his bodychecking. Olmstead was not regularly involved in fights, but in the ones he participated, the majority were started with his hits. Olmstead was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1985. Olmstead, with his wife Nora, visited the town of Okotoks, Alberta on August 13, 2005, with the Stanley Cup. He had previously declined to spend a day with it, believing that it was being given to much older winners only because of the lockout. Olmstead also noted, at the end of the day, that he was happy to have the Stanley Cup again. Olmstead died at his home in High River, Alberta on November 16, 2015, due to complications from a stroke. ==Career statistics== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:60em;\\" - e0e0e0;\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - e0e0e0;\\" !

Timoleon (foaled in either 1813 or 1814, depending on source*), was a good American Thoroughbred racehorse and was later an important sire. ==Background== A chestnut horse whose only marking was a small white star and standing 15 hands 3 inches high, Timoleon was bred by Benjamin Jones in Greensfield County, Virginia. He was described as \\"a red sorrel, with a star in his forehead, and no other mark. His limbs are clean and hoofs firm and deep. He is very stout and of great length and remarkable for the proximity of his hips to the point of his shoulder. The bridge of his nose, though bony, is too large for elegance; and his ears, when pricked, are too near a horizontal position agreeable to the notion of beauty; but a better moth, nostril, trottle or eye can't be found on any animal of the species...His form, his appearance, nay, everything about him, evince that he is genuine.\\" He was by one of America's greatest foundation stallions and a National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame inductee, Sir Archy. Timoleon's dam was the Saltram mare (A24) (1801) by the imported British stallion, Saltram, from the Wildair mare (1795) by Syme's Wildair. In 1800, when Saltram was 20 years old he was imported to Virginia, then the heart of Thoroughbred breeding in the United States, by the Virginian \\"gentleman,\\" William Lightfoot. Through this pedigree Timoleon combined the blood of the three Thoroughbred sirelines: Eclipse, Herod and Matchem. ==Racing record== At three, Timoleon was purchased by William Wynn of Petersburg, Virginia who seems to have regretted his purchase because Timoleon was rapidly sold on to Robert R. Johnson. Wynn then went through an immediate change of heart. Ten days after selling the horse, he offered to buy him back for a thousand dollars more than his selling price, saying he was, \\"...superior to any race horse that ever turned a gravel on any race course in the United States\\".Bloodlines bio Retrieved 2010-10-2 Of his racing career at age three, it is known that he won the colt purse at Petersburg in straight heats, covering the mile in 1:47 and 1:48, distancing the field in the second heat. Earlier that same day, he had won a half mile match against a Potomac colt. Later that same year, he lost the Post Stake at Petersburg to Reality, winning the first heat in 3:46 before losing the next two \\"for want of strength in the rider.\\" Timoleon was the \\"Pride of Virginia.\\" But racing so long ago, the actual statistics on his career on the track are hard to trace. It seems he might have started 15 times and that he won 13 of those starts, which were over the then-usual distances of three or four miles. It also seems he might have won all fifteen if he'd been entered in better form.Baseball Magazine Four of his wins were \\"walk-overs.\\" In his day if a horse like Timoleon was scheduled to compete but no horse could be found to challenge him, then he (or she) would be allowed to canter the course, winning the purse and the race. It is certain he defeated some of the best horses of his time. He defeated the two best daughters of Sir Archy: Reality and Lady Lightfoot, who were both highly regarded. The only horses that ever beat him were the aforementioned Reality and the highly regarded mare Transport. His final race took place in February 1818. He'd suffered with equine distemper (also called Strangles) a week before, was still entered, but had to be pulled up with respiratory problems, his second and last defeat. ==Stud record== Timoleon then stood briefly at stud at the farm of Johnson and Wynn's stables in North Carolina. In 1819 he was sold to Colonel David Dancy who took him first to General Hunter's plantation in Madison County, Alabama, and then, in 1829, to Nashville, Tennessee and one year later, to Charles City County, Virginia. He stood there for $50, compared to the $75 stud fee for Leviathan, then the most expensive stallion standing in America. Timoleon proved to be a good sire, even if only by producing Boston who sired the outstanding sire Lexington. He also sired: * Sally Walker, his best filly, was considered one of the best in her day * Washington who defeated the great Henry * Hotspur, a notable four- mile horse He died in 1836, at the age of 23 years. ==Sire line tree== *TimoleonSir ArchyByerley Turk LineHerod Sire Line **Washington **Marquis **Sir John Falstaff **JacksonJackson Pedigree **BostonBoston ***Arrow ***Wade Hampton ***Arlington ***Cost Johnson ***Ringgold ****Woodford ****Ringmaster ****Tipperary *****Aaron Pennington *****Calvin ***Commodore ****Gen.

It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. The film is also notable for featuring extensive documentary footage of the life of penguins on Antarctica almost thirty years before another documentary film, March of the Penguins (2005) focused on the same subject. ==Overview== The film is a study of the differences and similarities between human and animal behaviour. The first part of the movie focuses on the behaviour of various animal species. The second half is about the behaviour of humans, often intercutting with footage of animal behaviour. In the original Dutch version writer Anton Koolhaas, who also wrote the script, provided the voice- over. Haanstra had already shown interest in human and animal behaviour in his previous films, like Zoo (1961). Ape and Super-Ape analyzed these similarities on a much larger scale. In preparation for this documentary Haanstra and his camera crew traveled across the world for three years. They filmed animals and people in many different continents (Africa and Antarctica get extensive attention), while the well known Dutch ethnologist Gerard Baerendts was consulted for scientific advice. Haanstra would later make two other documentaries about animals: Nationale parken... noodzaak (1978) and Chimps onder elkaar (1984). ==References *, posted by the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision * Category:1972 films Category:1972 documentary films Category:Dutch films Category:Dutch-language films Category:Dutch documentary films Category:Documentary films about nature Category:Films shot in South Africa Category:Films set in Antarctica Category:Documentary films about Africa Category:Documentary films about Antarctica Category:Films about apes Category:Films about penguins Category:Films set in zoos Category:Biographical documentary films Category:Anthropology documentary films Category:Films directed by Bert Haanstra ","title":"Ape and Super-Ape"},{"id":"20211151","text":"Mio Nishimaki (born July 17, 1987) is a female freestyle wrestler from Japan.

In Graz he attained a doctorate in 1872, and then he studied for some time under Gustav Robert Kirchhoff and Leo K√∂nigsberger in Heidelberg. Afterwards he worked in Vienna under Josef Stefan at the Physical Institute, where he finished the habilitation and became a private lecturer in 1873.

The pair initially intended for the film to be a drama, but in the end they made a documentary when some people close to Malcolm X refused to talk to them.

The coalition was publicly headed by celebrity singer Anita Bryant, who claimed the ordinance discriminated against her right to teach her children Biblical morality. It was a well-organized campaign that initiated a bitter political fight between gay activists and Christian fundamentalists. When the repeal of the ordinance went to a vote, it attracted the largest response of any special election in Dade County's history, passing by 70%.The gay rights ordinance re- enacted by Dade County commissioners in 1998; it survived a repeal attempt by the Christian Coalition in 2003. (Days Without Sunshine: Anita Bryant's Anti- Gay Crusade , Stonewall Library and Archives. Retrieved on October 23, 2010.) In response to this vote, a group of gay and lesbian community members formed Pride South Florida, now known as Pride Fort Lauderdale, an organization whose mission was to fight for the rights of the gay and lesbian community in South Florida. Save Our Children was the first organized opposition to the gay rights movement, whose beginnings were traced to the Stonewall riots in 1969. The defeat of the ordinance encouraged groups in other cities to attempt to overturn similar laws. In the next year voters in St. Paul, Minnesota; Wichita, Kansas; and Eugene, Oregon overturned ordinances in those cities, sharing many of the same campaign strategies that were used in Miami. Save Our Children was also involved in Seattle, Washington, where they were unsuccessful, and heavily influenced Proposition 6‚Äîa proposed state law in California that would have made the firing of openly gay public school employees mandatory‚Äîthat was rejected by California voters in 1978. Historians have since connected the success of Save Our Children with the organization of conservative Christian participation in political processes. Although \\"occasional antigay appeals from the right\\" existed prior to the campaign, \\"the new right struck pure gold in Anita Bryant. A mother, celebrity singer, former Miss America ... the chirpy Bryant was the ideal model for its antigay crusade.\\" Within two years the Reverend Jerry Falwell developed a coalition of conservative religious groups named the Moral Majority that influenced the Republican Party to incorporate a social agenda in national politics. Homosexuality, the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), abortion, and pornography were among the issues most central to the Moral Majority's priorities until it folded in 1989. For many gay people, the surprise at the outcome of all the campaigns in 1977 and 1978 instilled a new determination and consolidated activism and communities in many cities where the gay community had not been politically active. Despite its success, Save Our Children brought widespread opposition and boycotts towards Bryant by the LGBT community and its supporters in the entertainment industry, tarnishing her reputation and ending her career as an entertainer. ==Background== On January 18, 1977, the Dade County Commission approved a law that would outlaw discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in employment, housing, and public services.\\"Bias Against Homosexuals is Outlawed in Miami\\", The New York Times (January 19, 1977), p. 14. Commissioner Ruth Shack proposed the bill on December 7, 1976 at the request of a gay lobbying organization, named the Dade County Coalition for the Humanistic Rights of Gays, that was less than a year old. The group was headed by three gay activists: Jack Campbell, an owner of 40 gay bathhouses across the United States, political and gay activist Bob Basker, and Bob Kunst, a local publicist and enthusiast of the Human Potential Movement. Homosexuality in Miami The general attitude about homosexuality in Miami mirrored many other cities across the country. Although gay nightlife in the city had enjoyed the same boisterous existence as other forms of entertainment in the 1930s, by the 1950s, the city government worked to shut down as many gay bars as possible and enacted laws making homosexuality and cross-dressing illegal.Fejes, p. 62‚Äì63. From 1956 to 1966, the Johns Committee of the Florida Legislature actively sought to root out homosexuals in state employment and in public universities across the state, publishing the inflammatory \\"Purple Pamphlet,\\" which described homosexuals in Florida. In the 1960s, The Miami Herald ran several stories implying the life of area homosexuals as synonymous with pimps and child molesters, and CBS aired a documentary entitled \\"The Homosexuals\\" in 1967, warning viewers that young boys were in danger from predatory men.Fejes, p. 64. The public image of homosexuals changed with liberalized social attitudes of the late 1960s. In 1969, the Stonewall riots occurred in New York City, marking the start of the gay rights movement. Although gay life in Miami was intensely closeted, and bars were subject to frequent raids, Christ Metropolitan Community Church‚Äîa congregation for gay and lesbian Christians in Miami‚Äîwas founded in 1970 as a religious outlet, attracting hundreds of parishioners. The 1972 Democratic National Convention was held in Miami, featuring, for the first time, a public speech about the rights of gay men and lesbians by openly gay San Francisco political activist Jim Foster. Jack Campbell opened the Miami branch of Club Baths in 1974. When it was raided, he made sure that all charges against those arrested were dropped, filed a lawsuit against the Miami Police Department prohibiting further harassment, and received a formal apology from the police.Fejes, p. 66. Even the depiction of gay men and lesbians in the local newspaper had changed to that of a silent, oppressed minority. By 1977, Miami was one of nearly 40 cities in the U.S. that had passed ordinances outlawing discrimination against gay men and lesbians. Reaction to the ordinance When the news of the ordinance proposal was reported in December 1976, a small ripple of protest spread from local churches. Northwest Baptist Church announced it from the pulpit. The news worried one of the church members named Anita Bryant, who was a 36-year-old singer/celebrity.Matthews, Tom, Fuller, Tony, and Camp, Holly (June 6, 1977). \\"Battle Over Gay Rights\\", Newsweek, p. 16‚Äì26. Bryant began her career as a local child star on a television show in Oklahoma City and on Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts. Her young life was marked by frequent moves; her parents divorced each other twice, and she often lived in poverty conditions, but she became a born again Christian at eight years old, and counted her faith and her participation at church as the stabilizing influences in her life. As a child, she asked God to make her a star. She was, by her own admission, remarkably driven and ambitious.Kelley, Ken (May 1978). \\"Playboy Interview: Anita Bryant\\", Playboy, p. 73‚Äì96, 232‚Äì250. In her older teens she became a beauty pageant contestant, winning Miss Oklahoma and second runner-up as Miss America.Peterson, p. 17‚Äì20. In 1960, she married a Miami disc jockey named Bob Green and became a professional singer, finding some success with three gold records featuring popular, patriotic, and Gospel standards. She performed with the Bob Hope Christmas tour, entertaining troops serving overseas, and sang at President Lyndon Johnson's funeral in 1973. Since 1969 she had been employed regionally by the Florida Citrus Commission endorsing Florida orange juice in television commercials. She also advertised for Coca-Cola, Tupperware, Kraft Foods and Holiday Inn. Bryant's talent agent was married to Ruth Shack; Bryant had contributed $1,000 to her campaign.Clendinen, p. 296. Initially Bryant kept her concerns low-key, despite her pastor's pleadings to become involved. She wrote a letter to the county commission and called Ruth Shack, expressing her concerns.Bryant (1977), p. 15‚Äì18. Her most significant objection to the ordinance was that it would allow homosexuals to work in parochial schools; all four of Bryant's children attended a local private Christian school.Bryant (1992), p. 65‚Äì66. She admitted she was largely ignorant of any specific dangers homosexuals presented, but when she was sent graphic images of homosexual acts, and shown photos of child pornography by a local police sergeant visiting her church, she was horrified.Bryant gave a candid interview to Playboy magazine, printed in May 1978 where she admitted that she knew of homosexuals in show business, but was unaware of the \\"nitty gritty\\" of their sexual behavior until her husband described them to her. She professed being most astonished that they ate each other's sperm, and equated the act with the immorality of destroying the Seed of Life. Bryant also claimed never to have heard of Alfred Kinsey's study that estimated one out of five males had had some sexual contact with another male; or any information about homosexual behavior in animals. The interviewer, Ken Kelley, wrote a companion piece to the interview, stating that she was impossible to \\"pigeonhole\\" due to her deliberate enigmatic persona: \\"She is a confection of contradictions: pristine nun and gamy tease. Old pro who's paid her dues and wide-eyed waif who's still seeking the jackpot. Guilt-wracked sinner who's terrified of hell and perfervid white knight who's determined to lead mankind on a forced march into paradise. Independent spirit, cowering wife. Chaplain one minute, warden the next. She is a demonstrably intelligent woman who stays steadfastly ignorant.\\" For months Bryant called Kelley just to talk, even though she knew she would not be portrayed favorably in the magazine. Kelley and a few others concluded that Bryant was simply very lonely. (Young, p. 39.) Bryant credited her inspiration later to her 9-year-old daughter suggesting God could assist with her cause; then she decided to take a more public role. At the time of the commission's vote in January, the boardroom was crowded with people who held some kind of interest in the issue. Busloads of churchgoers arrived from as far away as Homestead and picketed outside; there was no corresponding organized show of support for the ordinance.Fejes, p. 80. Inside the boardroom, supporters and opposers took the entire allotted time to speak. Bryant reflected most of those opposing the law, telling the Dade County Commission, \\"The ordinance condones immorality and discriminates against my children's rights to grow up in a healthy, decent community\\". The few members of the Dade County Coalition for the Humanistic Rights of Gays who were present were stunned, as was Ruth Shack, at the number and force of the hundreds of protesters who filled the commission room, and held placards and pickets outside. The ordinance passed by a 5-3 vote. ==Dade County ordinance 77-4== After the ordinance passed, over thirty conservative political professionals and ministers from various faiths met in Bryant and Green's home to discuss a plan to raise publicity and attempt to get at least 10,000 signatures on a petition to force the issue to be decided by a county voter referendum. They approved the name \\"Save Our Children, Inc.\\", and voted Bryant their president, Bob Green treasurer and a man named Robert Brake‚Äîa devout Catholic with a record of civil rights participation, but increasingly concerned with the liberalization of Miami city politics‚Äîits secretary.Fejes, pp. 76, 94. With the assistance of a Republican-affiliated advertising executive named Mike Thompson, the coalition eschewed subtlety. They held a press conference where Bryant held a pamphlet about homosexuality she claimed was being distributed at area high schools (a statement she later retractedYoung, p. 46.), and said Dade County homosexuals \\"are trying to recruit our children into homosexuality\\".Clendinen, p. 299. Far exceeding the required number of signatures, the coalition delivered more than 64,000 signatures within six weeks demanding a referendum vote, which the commission set for June 7, 1977. Strategy Mike Thompson discovered in a poll taken in March 1977 that women in Dade County opposed repealing the measure two to one; they saw their gay friends as relatively harmless. Save Our Children's strategy, therefore, worked to prove that homosexuals were amoral, promiscuous, and defiant of traditional gender roles, and that they were a specific danger to children.Clendinen, p. 303. Bryant took this strategy as a crusade, delivering speeches that intoned that Dade County's passing of the ordinance \\"guts the law on the side of the unrighteous. If homosexuals are allowed to change the law in their favor, why not prostitutes, thieves, or murderers?\\"Kondracke, Morton (1980). \\"Anita Bryant Is Mad About Gays\\", The New Republic, p. 13‚Äì14. She specifically connected homosexuals with child molesters, saying \\"Some of the stories I could tell you of child recruitment and child abuse by homosexuals would turn your stomach.\\" Bryant resented the media depiction of her as hateful, saying that her inspiration came \\"out of love‚Äînot only love for God's commandment and His word, but love for my children and yours. Yes, and even love for all sinners‚Äîeven homosexuals.\\"Fejes, p. 95. The Save Our Children campaign produced a local television commercial showing the \\"wholesome entertainment\\" of the Orange Bowl Parade (which Bryant hosted), contrasting that with highly sexualized images of the San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade, including men in leather harnesses kissing each other, dancing drag queens, and topless women. The commercial's announcer accused Miami's gay community of trying to turn Miami into the \\"hotbed of homosexuality\\" that San Francisco had become. Full-page newspaper ads were run in The Miami Herald, showing collections of headlines announcing teachers having sex with their students, children in prostitution rings, and homosexuals involved with youth organizations, followed by the question \\"Are all homosexuals nice? ... There is no 'human right' to corrupt our children.\\"Fejes, p. 137. Although Miami was not the first community to overturn a sexual orientation civil rights law, the Save Our Children campaign became a national political cause. Bryant became the focus of the campaign, as noted by her husband that she was the \\"first person with a name\\" to become vocal about homosexuality; gay activists agreed, saying that other cities \\"haven't had a major personality come out and create a witch hunt. People have lost sight of the issue; the controversy has become personality oriented\\".Clarke, Jay (March 27, 1977). \\"Gay Rights Fight Shaping Up in Miami\\", The Washington Post, p. A4. In opposition to her, Bob Kunst, who had experience as the publicist of the local municipal soccer team, the Miami Toros, was a familiar name to the local press. Kunst, however, remained determined to act as an individual, often taking opportunities to give his views to the press that were not condoned by the Dade County Coalition on the Humanistic Rights of Gays.Fejes p. 81, He took the view that it was the sexually enlightened stance to pass the ordinance, and those who opposed it were uptight, including, near the end of the campaign, Florida Governor Reubin Askew. He gave interviews addressing sexual liberation for gay and straight people, in which he freely spoke about oral and anal sex. Outside help Campaign material was distributed around the country, reflecting the personal role Anita Bryant played in the campaign. Homosexuals in Miami were not well- connected or experienced enough to combat the coalition led by Bryant, so they invited two political organizers to the city: Ethan Geto from New York City and Jim Foster from San Francisco, both of whom were gay. Foster and Geto faced battles not only with the Save Our Children campaign, but the disjointed and often closeted gay community in Miami. When organizations outside of Florida promoted boycotting Florida orange juice, Jack Campbell disagreed, worried that an economic backlash in the state would work against local gay men and lesbians.Clendinen, p. 301. Ruth Shack saw the issue simply, as one of civil rights; Geto and Foster agreed. Bob Kunst soon broke away from the campaign to promote the orange juice boycott, and his views were often printed in the newspapers to Geto's alarm. Save Our Children also received help from outside the area. North Carolina senator Jesse Helms offered his staff and funding from the Congressional Club, and wrote in his column that he was proud of Bryant: \\"I have pledged my full support to her ... She is fighting for decency and morality in America‚Äîand that makes her, in my book, an all- American lady\\". Pastor Jerry Falwell from Lynchburg, Virginia lent his support during visits and with the appearance of B. Larry Coy, who served as a marriage counselor to Bryant and Green. Coy and Green took over management of Bryant's ministries.Bryant later accused Coy of working with Green to take over her ministries and control her completely, saying they formed a \\"devil's triangle\\" to form a \\"satanically self-righteous conspiracy\\" to deprive her of all control, including that of her own conscience. Bryant tried to fire him, to no avail. (Jahr, Cliff [December 1980]. \\"Anita Bryant's Startling Reversal\\", Ladies Home Journal, p. 62‚Äì68) Two months before the referendum vote, Bob Green, speaking for Bryant, vowed to lead her cause in all cities in the United States that protected sexual orientation from discrimination, saying that gay activists waged a \\"disguised attack on God\\", and Bryant would \\"lead such a crusade to stop it as this country has not seen before\\".Singer Pledges Anti-Gay Drive Nationwide\\", The Washington Post (March 28, 1977), p. D12. As information was distributed against the referendum, as much literature was spread expressing local dissatisfaction with Bryant. T-shirts and campaign buttons were produced, showing \\"Anita Bryant Sucks Oranges\\" and \\"Squeeze a fruit for Anita\\".Fejes, p. 110. Media According to Florida Atlantic University Communications professor Fred Fejes, mainstream newspapers and magazines in the 1970s were hesitant to cover the issues of homosexuality or Christian fundamentalism in detail. Media prided themselves on objective reporting without Biblical judgment and at the same time, reporting was a homophobic profession that suppressed openly gay reporters and rarely addressed topics involving homosexuality.Fejes, p. 101‚Äì107. As a result, during the 1970s fundamentalist Christians began to develop broadcasting over radio and television in the forms of The 700 Club run by Pat Robertson, PTL Club hosted by Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, and Jerry Falwell's Old Time Gospel Hour. These shows originated as praise and worship-oriented, but slowly incorporated political themes interspersed with messages of Christian faith. Bryant's appearances on the 700 Club and the PTL Club netted the Save Our Children campaign $25,000 in donations, and assured her a position as a national spokesperson for traditional Christian values. However, when addressing a secular audience, Bryant was not as successful. During debates with Kunst and Shack she rarely made points that went beyond Bible quotes, and prayed when pressed to provide statistics on homosexuals as child molesters. At another appearance, she broke into \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\\" to take up time after she had read a pre-written statement. As California was experiencing a drought, Bryant connected it to their tolerance of liberals and homosexuals, and suggested that other morality laws should be enforced, such as those against adultery and cohabitation out of wedlock. Mike Thompson and Robert Brake soon restricted her to primarily religious shows.Fejes, p. 122.Clendinen, p. 306‚Äì307. At the same time, the gay community promoted their causes using specialty magazines and newspapers. The Advocate, a bi-weekly magazine, dedicated every issue starting in April 1977 to raising awareness of the battle taking place in Miami. It was run by David Goodstein, a friend of Jim Foster's who had worked with Foster to create the first gay Democratic club in the U.S. in the Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club. Goodstein warned that the fight would not end in Miami if the gay community lost, as did the local gay-focus newspapers of Boston's Gay Community News and San Francisco's Bay Area Reporter. Goodstein also suggested Bryant's primary motivation in her actions was furthering her career, or the beginning of \\"an organized conspiracy to turn (gays) into America's scapegoats\\".Clendinen, p. 300. Bryant's star power and her extreme views were highlighted in national news stories. Mainstream news outlets such as The New York Times, Associated Press and Washington Post reported weekly updates on campaign progress, with smaller local newspapers across the country weighing in their editorial opinions on which side should prevail. Bryant appeared on Good Morning America and The Phil Donahue Show. Her tone and accusations united gay men and lesbians in cities all over the U.S. In the weeks before the vote, almost $55,000 was raised outside of Florida to oppose Save Our Children. Foreshadowing the effectiveness of the Save Our Children campaign, on April 13, 1977, the Florida Legislature voted not to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), to the astonishment of those anticipating the vote. The connection between the ERA and ordinance 77-4 was obvious to many. Florida Senator Dempsey Barron vocally opposed passing the ERA, fearing it would legalize same-sex marriages, force people to use unisex bathrooms, and that it would harm laws meant to protect families.McPherson, Myra (April 14, 1977). \\"Florida Senate Rejects Equal Rights Amendment\\", The Washington Post, p. A1. National Organization for Women founder and ERA proponent Betty Friedan expressed her disdain, saying \\"suddenly you have this red herring in Anita Bryant. Suddenly you have this wave of anti-gay hysteria and then that was preempting the air waves behind the scenes\\".Fejes, p. 112. Washington D.C. mayor Marion Barry, Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley, President Jimmy Carter all expressed support for the ordinance. In The Miami Herald, 51 members of Dutch Parliament, ministers, and civil rights advocates from the Netherlands ran a full-page ad stating \\"We, from the land of Anne Frank, know where prejudices and discrimination can lead to\\", advising the voters of Miami-Dade to uphold the ordinance to protect the rights of homosexuals.Fejes, p. 125‚Äì126. California Assemblyman Willie Brown and San Francisco sheriff Richard Hongisto campaigned respectively for Miami's black community and law enforcement. Hongisto returned to California saying that Save Our Children made an issue of the existence of San Francisco when Thompson referred to the city as \\"a cesspool of perversion gone rampant\\" and Bob Green expressed doubt that saving San Francisco was possible. Reverend Jerry Falwell spoke at a rally as the vote neared, telling the audience, \\"I want to tell you we are dealing with a vile and vicious and vulgar gang. They'd kill you as quick as look at you.\\"Fejes, p. 134. Community attitudes Foster and Geto set the public tone of the campaign battling Save Our Children and were determined not to \\"get down in the gutter with them\\", refusing to run an ad showing Bryant in a revealing outfit she had worn while performing in 1971, nor run commercials to point out that child molesters were primarily heterosexual. However, they also encountered difficulty when local newspapers refused to run ads that were designed to appeal to Miami's sizable Jewish community, equating Bryant's rhetoric with the same language that many Miami citizens faced during the Holocaust.Clendinen, p. 305. Twenty-eight of Miami's 34 rabbis agreed with Bryant and her campaign‚Äìthe president of the Miami Beach B'nai B'rith served as an officer of the Save Our Children coalition.Young, p. 38. Miami's Cuban community came together as never before for the campaign, taking the opportunity to register thousands of voters who had never taken part in politics in the city. Bryant actively campaigned to the Cuban community, telling them at a rally, \\"You came here to get away from one sin ... and it breaks my heart that if Miami becomes another Sodom and Gomorrah you may have to leave here, too.\\"Paterson, Bill (June 6, 1977). \\"Fear Intense on Both Sides of Gay Rights Vote Tuesday\\", The Washington Post, p. A2. A Cuban social worker suggested the cause was representative of an older generation of Cuban emigres, worried that their children were being lost in the depravity of Miami.Rich, Ruby, Arguelles, Lourdes (Autumn 1985). \\"Homosexuality, Homophobia, and Revolution: Notes toward an Understanding of the Cuban Lesbian and Gay Male Experience, Part II\\", Signs, 11 (1) p. 120-136. Miami's archbishop wrote a letter against the gay rights ordinance, and ordered it to be read aloud in all Catholic churches. The response from Miami's black community was more conflicted. The Miami Times, a widely respected black newspaper, called Bryant's tactics \\"pure bullshit\\" and urged local blacks not to vote for anything that would discriminate against anyone. However, black audiences reacted angrily during an appearance featuring Bryant and another with Kunst and white ministers from the Metropolitan Community Church.Fejes, p. 131‚Äì132. Due to the intensely closeted nature of Miami's gay community at that time, many voters who were not swayed by Bryant's rhetoric were persuaded instead by her campaign's point that the law was unnecessary; they were unable to see the problem of discrimination. Unlike blacks or Cubans, gay men and lesbians were able to find jobs, although they faced dismissal upon their supervisors learning of their sexual orientation. In order to see a complaint through, they would have to remain out, and many lived in constant fear of exposure.Fejes, p. 133. Since the advent of second wave feminism earlier in the decade, many lesbians in the U.S. were unable to see themselves as part of the same community with gay men.Faderman, p. 199‚Äì200. Accusations from Save Our Children were almost all directed at the behavior of men. As a result, much of the response by gay men was angry and many lesbians took issue with the misogynistic tone gay men used.Fejes, p. 136. However, with Bryant representing a common adversary, for the first time in years, gay men and lesbians united to work together on the campaign.Van Gelder, Lindsy (September, 1977). \\"Anita Bryant on the March, Ms., p. 75‚Äì78, 100‚Äì103. Election results The vote results in a special June election were overwhelming. It was the largest turnout in any special election in the history of Dade County. Voters supported repealing the gay rights ordinance by a margin of more than two to one. Bryant danced a jig when the response was announced, and told reporters \\"All America and all the world will hear what the people have said, and with God's continued help, we will prevail in our fight to repeal similar laws throughout the nation which attempt to legitimize a life style that is both perverse and dangerous\\".Ayres, B. Drummond, \\"Miami Votes 2 to 1 to Repeal Law Barring Bias Against Homosexuals\\", The New York Times, p. 23. National Gay Task Force (NGTF) co-director Jean O'Leary said that the result was \\"all the evidence anyone could need of the extent and virulence of prejudice against lesbians and gay men in our society\\". ==Response== In New York City, Bella Abzug, who had introduced the first gay civil rights bill in U.S. Congress in 1974, was awoken at 2 am by people in the street chanting her name. \\"It was hard not to feel sad for this crowd\\", Abzug said of the several hundred people below her window. She was optimistic, telling them the defeat would develop a maturity and determination in gay activism.Clendinen, p. 310. About the same time that evening, about 3,000 gay men and lesbians spontaneously gathered in what had become the largest gay neighborhood in the United States‚ÄîCastro Street in San Francisco‚Äîfurious at the loss in Dade County. The crowd marched around the Castro District, chanting \\"We Are Your Children!\\" pulling people out of gay bars to cheers.Sharpe, Ivan (June 8, 1977). \\"Angry Gays March Through S.F.\\", The San Francisco Examiner, p. 1. Local gay activist and future supervisor Harvey Milk led marchers through a course through the city, careful not to stop for too long lest rioting began. He addressed the crowd with a bullhorn: \\"This is the power of the gay community. Anita's going to create a national gay force\\".Shilts, p. 158. The day after the vote, Jean O'Leary and NGTF co- director Bruce Voeller said Bryant was doing \\"an enormous favor\\" for the gay community by focusing national media attention on discrimination against them.O'Leary, Jean, Voeller, Bruce, (June 7, 1977). \\"Anita Bryant's Crusade\\", The New York Times, p. 35. Several weeks later at the San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade, 250,000 people attended, becoming the largest attendance at any gay event in U.S. history to that point. The largest group of the parade held large placards of Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Idi Amin, a burning cross, and Anita Bryant. Other cities also saw greater participation in Gay Pride events. People marching in New York's Gay Pride observance shouted \\"No more Miamis\\". Thousands of people attended events in Seattle, Boston, Cleveland, and Atlanta. Kansas City observed its first Gay Pride demonstration with 30 people.Fejes, p. 153. The largest gay newspaper in Australia used the Dade County vote as a warning advising gay men and lesbians there to \\"Get off Your Butts\\". More than 300 people held a vigil at the American embassy in the Netherlands, accusing the U.S. government of failing to protect their citizens' human rights. Four thousand marchers in Spain were dispersed by rubber bullets. Gay activists in Paris and London also warned that similar challenges could occur in their cities.Fejes, p. 154. In The New York Times, conservative columnist William Safire wrote that Miami's gay activists had been justifiably defeated: \\"In the eyes of the vast majority, homosexuality is an abnormality, a mental illness, even‚Äîto use an old-fashioned word‚Äîa sin. Homosexuality is not the 'alternative lifestyle' the gay activists profess; it may be tolerable, even acceptable‚Äîbut not approvable.\\"Safire, William (June 9, 1977). \\"Now Ease Up, Anita\\", The New York Times, p. 21. Safire, however, tempered the column (titled \\"Now Ease Up, Anita\\") cautioning against Bryant's promised nationwide crusade designed to lead to further repeal of homosexuals' \\"legitimate civil rights\\". A Connecticut-based charity for unprivileged children named Save the Children filed an injunction in July 1977 against the Miami coalition to prevent them from using the name, and Bryant from using it as a title for a book she was writing; Save the Children lost donations due to the confusion between the names.\\"Anti-Homosexual Group Barred From Use of Name\\", The New York Times (July 16, 1977) p. 6. Briefly, the coalition was known as \\"Protect the Children\\" and focused completely on moral legislation against militant homosexuality, pornography, and images of sex and violence on television. It was renamed to Anita Bryant Ministries. Violence Two weeks after the Dade County vote, a gardener who worked for the City of San Francisco named Robert Hillsborough was stabbed 15 times in his face and chest while his attackers chanted \\"Faggot\\" at him. Hillsborough's mother and San Francisco mayor George Moscone blamed Bryant's rhetoric for his death and 200,000 San Francisco residents joined a memorial demonstration for him. Mrs. Hillsborough brought a $5 million civil suit against Anita Bryant claiming Hillsborough's attackers said \\"Here's one for Anita\\".Clendinen, p. 319 She said, \\"I didn't think much about Anita Bryant's campaign at first. Now that my son's murder has happened, I think about the Bryant campaign a lot. Anyone who wants to carry on this kind of thing must be sick. My son's blood is on her hands.\\"Shilts, p. 163‚Äì164. Bryant, Green, Mike Thompson and Save Our Children were dismissed from the suit in November 1977.\\"Anita Bryant Is Dropped As Defendant in Lawsuit\\", The New York Times, November 18, 1977. p. 18. Several suicides were connected to the campaign, including a Cuban gay activist in Miami named Ovidio \\"Herbie\\" Ramos, who was stunned at the vehemence against homosexuals. He and several other Cuban gay activists participated in a radio call-in show to hear people say homosexuals should be deported, forced into concentration camps, or executed. Ramos shot himself a few days later after telling a friend, \\"I didn't know they hated us so much\\".Young, p. 53‚Äì54. Another Cuban gay activist named Manolo Gomez was fired from his job and severely beaten, after which he decided to leave Miami. Gay activists in New Orleans tried to discourage Bryant's performance with the New Orleans Pops orchestra by connecting local suicides to her campaign. Bryant responded to violence saying, \\"It made me sad and shocked me that anyone would think I had anything to do with it, but my conscience is clear. I can't be responsible for how people react to what happened in Dade County. My stand was not taken out of homophobia, but of love for them.\\" Economic retaliation The economic response to the vote was swift and decisive. Bryant worked only twice during 1977, and lost most of her paid appearances after that. She had recently finished an album named There's Nothing Like the Love Between a Man and a Woman; record companies chose to not distribute it. Singer Sewing Machines canceled negotiations for a television variety show. She was replaced after 10 years of hosting the Orange Bowl Parade by Rita Moreno, who was older and who had recently performed in a gay-themed film, The Ritz.Fejes, p. 167. Bryant and Green held a press conference and claimed Bryant was being blacklisted, and that a national conspiracy was underway by the nation's homosexuals to deprive her of her livelihood.Hally, Larry (August 1, 2007). \\"Anita Bryant's Rise and Fall Was Captured During Visits\\", Richmond Times-Dispatch, p. 1. Time magazine called the charge \\"unlikely\\", and network executives denied gay pressure was behind their decision.The Gaycott Turns Ugly, Time, November 21, 1977. Retrieved on November 18, 2008. Bryant's claim of being blacklisted brought a tide of condemnation against the perceived pressure by gay organizations. Three major newspapers supported Bryant's right to free speech. Years later, she admitted that some of the statements made about her cancellations were exaggerated for effect, but that the tactic worked against her, as more organizations and companies canceled her performances.Bryant (1992), p. 66. Bryant became the butt of jokes on television shows and film, even by former colleague Bob Hope.Fejes, p. 166. Everywhere she went in the days after the vote she was met with noisy protests: Norfolk, Virginia‚Äîwhere demonstrators interrupted her presentation so forcefully she began crying‚ÄîChicago, and dozens of other cities. The Ku Klux Klan appeared at one of Bryant's appearances in Huntington, West Virginia claiming they were there to protect her.Fejes, p. 159. She attracted the largest gay demonstration in Canadian history when she appeared at a Toronto religious performance. Although she performed and spoke only at revivals and other religious shows, audiences were often less than half the expected number, and many would leave when she came on stage.Fejes, p. 169‚Äì169. In Houston Bryant was invited to perform for the Texas State Bar Association two weeks after the Dade County vote. With no cohesive political community, a few gay organizers invited people to protest her appearance at the Hyatt Regency. An organizer estimated for police that 500 people might participate, but guessed because no gay community had responded to a cause before; police prepared for that number.Fisher, Binnie (June 25, 2004). \\"Houston's Stonewall Took Place June 16, 1977\\", The Houston Voice, p. 3. However, thousands of people swarmed around the hotel chanting loudly enough to drown Bryant's performance; a conservative estimate of the participants' numbers was 2,000. The audience inside could not hear Bryant, and at one point attorneys working with the American Civil Liberties Union walked out and joined the protesters. One of the organizers said that he had never seen so many gay people in one place before, and then made a speech thanking Bryant: \\"If God in his infinite wisdom had not created Anita Bryant, we would have had to invent her\\". He claimed the protest had the same result in Houston as the Stonewall riots. The Florida Citrus Commission reiterated its commitment to Bryant by stating that it \\"wholeheartedly support(ed)\\" her right to free speech, praising her \\"courageous leadership on a moral issue that it is tearing up religious and other organizations which have become involved\\". The commission received thousands of letters both supporting Bryant's stance and condemning the commission; at one point the U.S. Postal Service installed bomb detection equipment for the mail collected for delivery to the Florida Citrus Commission.Florida Citrus Commission, p. 297‚Äì298. The publicity director for the Florida Department of Citrus told a reporter from the Associated Press, \\"The whole Anita thing is a mess. No matter what we decide, we're only going to lose. I wish she would just resign.\\"\\"Bryant: Still 'Effective?' \\", The Washington Post (June 20, 1977), p. B1. Although in 1979 the commission extended their $100,000 annual contract with Bryant, they did not renew it in 1980.Florida Citrus Commission, p. 312. ==Other locations== In the weeks after the Dade County vote, Fort Lauderdale, Gainesville, and Palm Beach, Florida, and Austin, Texas, all rejected ordinances to outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development overturned its own rules they had set earlier in the year to allow unmarried and same-sex couples federally financed housing.Fejes, p. 155‚Äì156. Newsweek reported that a county government employee who had worked in her position for 15 years had been fired.Steele, Richard, (June 20, 1977). \\"A 'No' to the Gays\\", Newsweek, p. 27. An openly gay aide to future U.S. senator Paula Hawkins had also been dismissed. Despite the success of the Dade County campaign, activists worked quietly in liberal towns of Aspen, Colorado, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, Iowa City, Iowa, Wichita, Kansas, and the very liberal Eugene, Oregon to pass gay rights ordinances. Minneapolis‚ÄìSt. Paul Only three weeks before the voter referendum in Dade County, a state gay rights law to protect homosexuals from discrimination in employment, public services, and housing in Minnesota was defeated. The loss was due in large part to the efforts of the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, and once more, caught gay activists completely by surprise. The Twin Cities' gay community was much more active than Miami's; both Minneapolis and St. Paul had passed gay rights laws three years before. State senator Allan Spear‚Äîthe first openly gay man to be elected to public office in the U.S.‚Äîserved in St. Paul. Spear called it a \\"victory for bigots\\" on the senate floor, then went into his office and cried.Clendinen, p. 316‚Äì317. A group of guerrilla activists struck Archbishop John Roach a week after the vote by throwing a chocolate cream pie at him as he spoke to receive the National Brotherhood Award from the National Conference of Christians and Jews. Following the pie attack on the archbishop, two of Allan Spear's colleagues invited Anita Bryant to come to St. Paul to overturn their three-year-old gay rights ordinance, and announced Save Our Children would be opening a branch there. Local activists did not think much of their chances; a local gay political group invited gays and lesbians in Miami to live in Minneapolis‚ÄîSt. Paul.Clendinen, p. 318. In an act representing Bryant's diminished national public profile, in October 1977 Bryant and her husband were in Des Moines, Iowa, discussing an upcoming concert at a press conference when Thom Higgins, an activist affiliated with organizers in Minneapolis, walked up to her in front of cameras and mashed a strawberry rhubarb pie in her face. Bryant was stunned and bowed her head as she and Green held hands and prayed for Higgins. She quickly quipped \\"At least it's a fruit pie.\\" An image of her covered with the pastry appeared on the front page of The New York Times the next day.Clendinen, p. 328.\\"Notes on People,\\" The New York Times (October 15, 1977) p. 1. In December 1977, however, a petition drive was organized by Temple Baptist Church to put St. Paul's ordinance to a citywide vote. Volunteers endured below freezing temperatures to collect more than 7,000 signatures; their leader, Richard Angwin, pastor of Temple Baptist reasoned, \\"I don't want to live in a community that gives respect to homosexuals.\\"Clendinen, p. 324. Angwin used the same strategy as the Miami campaign, tapping the resources of Bryant, Green, and their pastor in Miami. Jerry Falwell held a rally where Bryant was advertised to appear, but Green replaced her at the last minute. At the rally Angwin told the audience \\"Homosexuality is a murderous, horrendous, twisted act. It is a sin and a powerful, addictive lust.\\"Clendinen, p. 327.Fejes, pp. 172‚Äì173. Gay activists in St. Paul also borrowed from Miami, taking Jack Campbell's donor list and some strategies. However, similar to Miami, many gays and lesbians in St. Paul were hesitant to come out and could not make a solid case for discrimination; most of the activists were from Minneapolis. Gay activists were also split in strategy, much like in Miami. A more mainstream group named the St. Paul Citizens for Human Rights (SPCHR) opted to treat the issue as one of civil and human rights. A more radical group of gays named the Target City Coalition‚Äîthose who had arranged the pieing of the archbishop‚Äîsaw the issue as one of sexual liberation and grabbed the most media attention by highlighting some of the more flamboyant parts of the gay community. The Advocate wrote that they were \\"the most stoned-out, off-the- wall, bona-fide crackpots yet to appear in the gay rights cause.\\"Fejes, p. 170‚Äì171. The Target City Coalition invited Bob Kunst to St. Paul, where he spoke of sexual liberation and the need to reach out to gay youth. Allan Spear, supportive ministers, and other members of SPCHR went on local television to debate the civil rights issue. Reverend Angwin stumped Spear and his cohorts by showing them an advertisement placed by the Target City Coalition in a local gay paper appealing to gay teenagers, that offered them \\"free prostate rubs.\\" St. Paul's special election day was April 25, 1978. Again, more than the usual number of voters appeared for a special election, who again, overturned the city's gay rights ordinance by more than two to one. Eugene, Oregon The ordinance that had recently passed in Eugene was met with a different strategy of opposition. Eugene was a college town so liberal the Grateful Dead spent their summers there. A housewife named Lynne Greene rejected the Biblical rhetoric offered by Bryant and instead argued that since gays already had the protection they needed under the law further legislation was unnecessary. Since homosexuality was a chosen lifestyle, they reasoned, homosexuals were not a minority and needed no protection. Acknowledging the rights of gays would lead the law to give them rights to marry, and adopt children.Clendinen, p. 323.Fejes, p. 175. Although gay rights advocates worked differently in Eugene, registering many new voters and seeing lesbians significantly working the campaign for the first time, their opposition worked steadily by canvassing neighborhoods. Most of their volunteers were members of conservative churches, and the message was similar to recent campaigns: \\"Keep it straight. Our children come first,\\" but the Eugene campaign lacked the sensational aspect as those in Miami and St. Paul.Fejes, p. 176‚Äì177. Once more in nearly a two to one margin, the gay rights ordinance was defeated in Eugene. A poll taken after the vote showed that liberal voters who were not gay simply declined to show up and vote, and those who opposed the ordinance were much more motivated.Fejes, p. 177. Wichita, Kansas Anita Bryant lent her support to the effort in Wichita, which was led by a minister named Ron Adrian. They used a similar strategy, printing a full-page ad in The Wichita Eagle with newspaper clippings connecting gays to child molestation. They raised approximately $50,000 and used the network of churches, local media, and a highly organized grassroots voter registration and mobilization drive. Campaign literature focused on the aspect gay visibility, and the dangers of gays as role models for children: \\"There is a real danger that homosexual teachers, social workers or counselors, simply by public acknowledgment of their lifestyles, can encourage sexual deviation in children.\\" Voting Against Gay Rights, Time, May 22, 1978. Retrieved November 17, 2008. In comparison, the very small and closeted gay community raised only $6,000; the National Gay Task Force was so pessimistic they offered no assistance at all. Bryant attended a rally stating the law would give homosexuals \\"special rights ... and next you will have thieves, prostitutes and people who have relations with St. Bernards asking for the same rights\\". The Wichita ordinance was defeated by a five to one margin leaving Ron Adrian ecstatic.Fejes, p. 174‚Äì175. Seattle, Washington Seattle in 1977 was a liberal city that had passed a gay rights ordinance in 1973, and whose mayor had just declared a Gay Pride Week for June. When a police officer named David Estes learned of the mayor's gesture, he decided to take action. Estes was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and regarded gay men as \\"mentally disturbed\\" according to his religious opinion.Fejes, p. 188. Estes designed a ballot measure named Initiative Thirteen that would overturn the existing gay rights ordinance, but also allowed the mere accusation of homosexuality to be the basis for dismissal from a job or eviction from a residence. Also included in the proposed law was the prospect of shifting the responsibility of enforcing Initiative Thirteen to a city department already overtaxed with investigating claims of bias against blacks and women. Estes' organization attracted a $3,000 donation from Anita Bryant, and her pastor traveled to Seattle to give advice on Estes' campaign. However, where Estes planned to use the network of conservative churches in the city, many members were discouraged from working with him because he was a Mormon. The tone of the advertising for the campaign was more dire than in Miami; ads claimed homosexuals were responsible for half the murders and suicides in major cities and half the cases of syphilis. Perhaps the most significant factor of the campaign was Estes' co-chair, a police officer named Dennis Falk. Two months before election day, Falk shot and killed a suspect who turned out to be a black, mentally retarded, young boy. The black community was furious with Falk, and transferred their anger to Initiative Thirteen.Fejes, p. 189‚Äì190. The tone of the Seattle campaign against Initiative Thirteen was different from those in Miami and St. Paul; it focused consistently on privacy and civil rights. Instead of educating the public about different subcultures in the gay community, they printed effective posters showing an eye peeping through a keyhole and a family living in a fishbowl.Marcus, p. 217. High-profile liberal figures, labor unions, and other large organizations including the Church Council of Greater Seattle opposed Initiative Thirteen.Fejes, p. 199‚Äì200. David Estes did not have the enthusiasm and momentum modeled by Bryant and other communities though his campaign used many of their tactics. On election day, Initiative Thirteen was rejected by 63%.Fejes, p. 210. California A day after the Dade County repeal, State Assemblyman Art Agnos, who represented portions of San Francisco with a very high population of gays and lesbians, decided not to submit a gay civil rights bill to the state legislature, reasoning that it no longer had any support.Shilts (1982), p. 160. California state senator John Briggs, from Fullerton was in the crowd with Anita Bryant the night she and Save Our Children won the Dade County vote.Shilts (1982), p. 154. Greatly impressed by the voter turnout, Briggs had designs to win the race for governor of California for 1978. When he returned from Miami, since there was no gay rights law to overturn, he proposed a law to forbid employing openly gay public school teachers and other workers. The bill, Proposition 6‚Äînicknamed the Briggs Initiative‚Äîwas written so broadly that it also allowed the dismissal of any public school employee for supporting gay rights including voting against Proposition 6, regardless of their sexual orientation. He stated, \\"What I am after is to remove those homosexual teachers who through word, thought or deed want to be a public homosexual, to entice young impressionable children into their lifestyle\\".Fejes, p. 183. Briggs announced the proposition on the steps of San Francisco City Hall, after notifying several local gay organizations of his intentions. The city had experienced an influx of so many gay people in the past ten years that they counted as a quarter of its voting population.Clendinen, p. 365. Gay activists, newly alarmed at the threat to their rights, confronted Vice President Walter Mondale at a political rally in San Francisco two weeks after the announcement of Proposition 6. Mondale ran with Jimmy Carter in 1976 on a platform highlighting human rights as their first priority, and he was there to address the subject pertaining to Latin America. When gay activists interrupted him and demanded he address their issues, he quickly left without a response, and San Francisco Democratic organizers and liberal politicians were furious at the gay activists.Shilts (1982), p. 161. Briggs named his organization California Defend Our Children (CDOC) to avoid legal problems with the Connecticut charity, and used the same strategies as Save Our Children: collages of newspaper headlines about child molesters, and because a proposition was on the ballot regarding the death penalty in California, CDOC campaign literature urged voters to \\"act now to help protect your family from vicious killers and defend your children from homosexual teachers\\".Clendinen, p. 381. Briggs placed minister Lou Sheldon in charge of CDOC. A significant difference between the community components in Miami and California was that both Los Angeles and San Francisco had very active and visible gay communities. Founder of Metropolitan Community Church Reverend Troy Perry, who began his career as a charismatic preacher in the Church of God of Prophecy but was rejected for being gay, went on a 16-day fast to raise $100,000 and succeeded.Clendinen, p. 368. Hollywood stars Bette Midler, Lily Tomlin, and Richard Pryor came out in force for the cause, raising another $100,000.Fejes, p. 185. In January 1978 Harvey Milk took office as a supervisor of San Francisco, and the first openly gay man to be elected to office in California. Briggs campaigned for the measure throughout the state, and held a series of public and televised debates with Milk who was very well received by the media, quick to quip and give print-friendly comments. He often made the front page in newspapers in San Francisco with the outrageous things he said. Milk spoke to 350,000 participants of 1978's San Francisco Gay Freedom Day; similar numbers were seen in Los Angeles.Jacobs, John (June 26, 1978). \\"An Ecumenical Alliance on the Serious Side of 'Gay' \\", The San Francisco Examiner, p. 3. The strategies of gay activists were once again split. David Goodstein and other professional gay men paid an advertising agency to outline their message, which focused on the threat to privacy and the rights of teachers. In The Advocate, Goodstein urged gays not to live up to stereotypes and let the professionals try to win.Fejes, p. 197. However, grassroots efforts by longtime activists such as Morris Kight, who went on a walk across the state to promote voting down the Briggs Initiative, were also effective. Women were highly visible in the campaign, raising about the same amount of money as men. However, when California law was revealed to state that anyone who gave more than $50 to the campaign would have to release his or her name, most of the donations came in at $49, including one by Rock Hudson.Clendinen, p. 385. Due to the broad nature of the law, as it would have allowed the firing of public school employees for the way they voted or spoke their opinions in favor of gay rights, conservative Republican politicians spoke out against it. Primarily, former governor Ronald Reagan voiced his opinion, saying \\"Prop. 6 is not needed to protect our children. We have that legal protection now. It could be very costly to implement and has the potential for causing undue harm to people.\\"Clendinen, p. 387. Reagan's statement turned public opinion against the proposition almost overnight. Gay activists were not optimistic in light of the record of voter turnout against them in the previous year, but they were overwhelmed to learn that on election day more than a million voters turned out to strike down the proposition.Clendinen, p. 389. ==Effects on Bryant== Bryant and Bob Green were divorced in May 1979, in a dispute made public through newspapers. Bryant moved to Alabama and gave a candid interview to Ladies Home Journal in 1980 where she told the details of her marriage during the campaign. She claimed she had been \\"married for the wrong reasons\\" and that she and Green had fought regularly, often considering divorce. Green became her manager and she claimed exhaustion due to being booked for every event available, making $700,000 in 1976 ( dollars). She had checked herself into a Christian psychiatric facility in 1973, and regularly saw psychiatrists and marriage counselors. Her anxiety manifested itself in chest pains, tremors, difficulty swallowing food, and a bout with 24-hour paralysis during a trip to Israel with the Falwell family. Bryant revealed she had received severe criticism from Christians following her divorce. One Canadian pastor expressed doubt to her that she had \\"ever met the Lord\\", to her humiliation.Jahr, Cliff (December 1980). \\"Anita Bryant's Startling Reversal\\", Ladies Home Journal, p. 62‚Äì68. As a result of the backlash she received from Christians, Bryant had softened her stances on gay rights: \\"The church needs to be more loving, unconditionally, and willing to see these people as human beings, to minister to them and try to understand. If I had it to do over, I'd do it again, but not in the same way,\\" and feminism: \\"The church needs to wake up and find some way to cope with divorce and women's problems that are based on Biblical principles. I believe in the long run God will vindicate me. I've about given up on the fundamentalists, who have become so legalistic and letter-bound to the Bible.\\" Bryant's career did not recover. She attempted to stage comebacks in Eureka Springs, Arkansas in 1992, Branson, Missouri in 1994 (\\"People who come to my performances are hungry for the truth.

Retrieved on April 13, 2012.) ==Significance== Moral Majority Fundraising card used by Bryant and Save Our Children; their strategies offered a basis for the Moral Majority, who claimed to be saving America from immorality and Communism in the 1980s. The Save Our Children campaign was an intensely focused effort by conservative forces, many of whom received inspiration from previous controversies in the 1970s. Not since the Scopes Trial about the legality of teaching evolution in public schools in 1925 had religious organizations made earnest attempts to influence politics on such a wide scale.Georgianna, pp. iii, 11‚Äì17. Fred Fejes credits the Save Our Children campaign as a significant factor in the rise of conservative Christian activism, noting \\"This was the beginning of the culture wars\\". Ruth Shack points to the connection between the rise of the New Right and the Save Our Children campaign: \\"Back in 1977, there was no organized religious right per se. Anita Bryant was a pioneer.\\"Rothaus, Steve (June 9, 2007). Gay rights debate rages on 30 years after Miami-Dade challenge, The Miami Herald, p. 1. In the late 1970s the Reverend Jerry Falwell moved from presiding over the megachurch Thomas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg, Virginia and hosting the Old Time Gospel Hour, to being involved in politics. Falwell took credit for defeating the Dade County gay rights ordinance and the failure of the ERA in Florida. He developed a campaign called Clean Up America in 1977 that was a fundraising vehicle for his television show. Falwell sent letters asking for donations, which included questionnaires asking \\"Do you approve of known practicing homosexuals teaching in public schools?\\" that he promised would be sent to politicians; he distributed information about how to put together political groups to influence elections and lawmakers.FitzGerald, Frances, (May 18, 1981). \\"A Reporter at Large: A Disciplined, Charging Army\\", The New Yorker. Retrieved November 10, 2008. In 1979 Falwell spearheaded a coalition of religious groups that included Catholics, fundamentalist Protestants, Mormons, and Orthodox Jews that he called the Moral Majority, which developed a branch dedicated to political action. Falwell declared in 1965 that he had no business in politics,Georgianna, p. 23. but justified his involvement and the inevitable mix of religion and government with evidence that the social problems of abortion, pornography, sexual immorality, and drugs were bringing the United States to a dangerous precipice where Communism would prevail over Christianity.Falwell, pp. 365, 383. Falwell claimed that the grassroots efforts of the Moral Majority‚Äîregistering millions of voters, informing the public, and using the media‚Äîhad been a significant factor in the election of President Ronald Reagan.Falwell, p. 390. By 1982 they had a budget of $1 million and millions of volunteers.Falwell, p. 389. Around the same time, gay men were being stricken with AIDS, desperate for money for research and services. Spokesmen for the Moral Majority connected it to God's will, asserting the general public needed protection from \\"the gay plague\\", and warned, \\"If homosexuals are not stopped they will infect the entire nation and America will be destroyed.\\"Shilts (1986), p. 322. Gay activism Just as the Save Our Children campaign was a motivational force for conservative Christians, it was also one for gay and lesbian politics. Fejes writes, \\"While the Stonewall riots of 1969 may have marked the beginning of the modern lesbian and gay movement, the campaigns of 1977 and 1978 marked the emergence of a national politically self-conscious lesbian and gay community\\".Fejes, p. 214. The birth of a political life for gays and lesbians gave opportunities for national networking as Anita Bryant and those who followed her acted as a virtual lightning rod, attracting a collective anger. Thirty years after the campaign, the Stonewall Library & Archives sponsored an exhibition of the events surrounding the Save Our Children campaign and displayed it at the Broward County Public Library. According to the curator of the exhibit, Bryant is considered \\"the best thing to happen to the gay rights movement. She and her cohorts were so over the top that it just completely galvanized the gay rights movement\\".Tanasychuk, John (June 4, 2007). \\"Exhibit Marks 30th Anniversary of How Anita Bryant Fought‚Äîand Helped‚ÄîGay Rights\\", The South Florida Sun-Sentinel, p. 1. San Francisco author Armistead Maupin was writing his installments of individual stories in a column for the San Francisco Chronicle titled Tales of the City in 1977. He remembered, \\"I know what the battle did for me: It forced me to confront my own residual self-loathing and stare it down once and for all by coming out.\\"Maupin, Armistead (November 12, 2002). \\"Gods & Monsters\\", The Advocate, p. 92. Maupin used the next installment of Tales to have one of his gay characters come out to his parents who, by remarkable coincidence, Maupin had previously established as Florida citrus growers. Political activism in American gay communities was transformed by the arrival of AIDS in the early 1980s. When gay men tried in several desperate measures to follow established political channels to bring attention to a disease that afflicted the most cast out members of society only to meet silence from the government, some used direct action tactics. AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), formed by Larry Kramer and others in 1987, was a response not only to government forces that downplayed or ignored the seriousness of AIDS in the United States, but also to a timid gay community who were not militant enough. Their first act was to march on Wall Street in New York City to protest the high price of AZT and the lack of other drugs to address HIV. They blocked morning rush hour traffic, a civil disobedience action in which several protesters were arrested, and the fledgling organization received national news coverage for their demonstration. ACT UP inspired the establishment of direct action groups Queer Nation, the Pink Panthers and the Lesbian Avengers, that concentrated on gay and lesbian rights and protection. While Save Our Children may have been a temporary setback for the gay community in Florida, LGBT activists in Florida would go on to win numerous victories in the future, from the re-enactment of the non- discrimination ordinance in Miami-Dade County, to the enactment of such ordinances elsewhere throughout the state, to the legalization of gay adoption to marriage equality. ==See also== * SAVE (SAVE Dade) * LGBT rights in Florida * Briggs Initiative * Children's interests (rhetoric) * Washington House Bill 2661 * Karen (pejorative) * Helen Lovejoy defence ==NotesCitationsBibliography== * Bryant, Anita (1977).

The film features four horror stories set within the small town of Oldfield, Tennessee, each related by an elderly local historian (Price) to a local journalist (Tyrrell) who reported on the execution of his serial killer niece. Developed by Burr, C. Courtney Joyner, and Darin Scott, all former film students, From a Whisper to a Scream was largely shot on location in Dalton, Georgia. The film was given a U.S. theatrical release in the fall of 1987 under the alternate title The Offspring. == Plot == In the small Tennessee town of Oldfield, historian Julian White relates four horror stories to local journalist, Beth Chandler, who has just attended the public execution of Julian's niece, Katherine, a serial killer. The stories are connected to the past and present of Oldfield, which, according to Julian, is an inherent epicenter for pure evil. White's narration serves as a wraparound story for four otherwise unconnected segments set during different periods in history. The first of the stories, set in contemporary times, involves awkward and lonely grocer Stanley Burnside, who takes care of his codependent ailing sister, Eileen. Stanley attempts to date Grace, his younger, glamorous boss. She agrees to a dinner date, but rebukes Stanley's sexual advances after, after which Stanley strangles her to death. Grace's murder goes unsolved, but prior to her burial, Stanley breaks into the mortuary and has sex with her corpse. Nine months later, Stanley murders Eileen in a fit of rage. That same night, a mutant zombies offspring‚Äîthe product of Stanley's sexual violation of Grace's corpse‚Äîbreaks into the house and terrorizes Stanley, eventually killing him. The second story, set in the 1950s, follows Jesse Hardwick, who is shot and injured by ruthless gangsters over a gambling debt. He flees into the swamp, where he is saved by Felder Evans, an elder voodoo practitioner who nurses him back to health. In Felder's cabin, Jesse finds newspaper clippings that suggest Felder was an escaped slave in the late-1800s. Believing Felder has the secret to immortality, Jesse pleads that Felder make him immortal too. When Felder's ritual fails, the men get into a violent fight, ending in Felder incapacitating Jesse. Felder reveals that he already fed Jesse the life-giving elixir when he first saved him, which has given Jesse another 70 years of life. Angered by Jesse's betrayal, Felder dismembers and burns him, though this does not kill Jesse. Later, Jesse's mutilated body is found on a country road. Doctors manage to piece his disarticulated body parts back together, but are unable to explain how he is alive. The third story, set in 1933, follows Amarrillis Caulfield, a young woman who falls in love with Steven, a glass- eating carnival sideshow performer. Steven's relationship with Amarrallis is met with the ire of the controlling, cruel snakewoman who owns the carnival and manipulates the performers with voodoo. The snakewoman curses Steven, making the sharp objects he ingests emerge from his skin when he touches Amaralliss. Steven flees with Amarrallis, but, under the snakewoman's curse, all of the sharp objects he has ingested over the years burst out of his body, killing him. Later, Amarrillis, now under the snakewoman's control, is put on display in the carnival as a \\"human pincushion.\\" In the fourth segment, set during the American Civil War, Union solder Sgt. Gallen and his men encounter a group of disfigured children living alone in an isolated farmhouse. The children are powerful and tactical, taking the soldiers hostage. Gallen manages to escape by killing one of the children, Amanda, only to find the others outside using one of his men's dismembered torsos as a pi√±ata. He is recaptured, and comes to learn the children are all orphans of Confederate soldiers, avenging their parents. The children bring Gallen outside, where they burn him alive. After relaying the final story, Julian is confronted by Beth, who reveals she corresponded via letter with Katherine while she was in prison. In her letters, Katherine claimed Julian, who raised her from childhood, \\"poisoned her mind.\\" Avenging Katherine, Beth stabs Julian in the throat with a switchblade, killing him. == Cast  Production ==  Development  From a Whisper to a Scream was developed by Jeff Burr, C. Courtney Joyner, Mike Malone, and Darin Scott, all former film students and friends who met one another while attended the University of Southern California. Burr devised the idea of a \\"haunted Southern town\\" in which various horror stories would take place. The four each wrote screenplays for short films that would be relayed within the frame story, with the fictional town of Oldfield being the common denominator. Each of the stories was written with certain taboos being central to the plot, such as necrophilia, and children committing murder.  Casting  Director Jeff Burr, whose only prior film was the American Civil War drama Divided We Fall, had limited experience in Hollywood, and met much of the cast (Rosalind Cash, Clu Galager, Terry Kiser) through friends, rather than through a traditional casting process. In order to secure Vincent Price for the role of Julian White in the frame story, Burr went in person to Price's house with a bottle of wine (aware that Price was a wine connoisseur) and gave him the script in person. Burr would later recall, > We came bearing gifts, and wouldn't you know ... he opened the door himself > when we knocked! It was a flurry of \\"Gee, Mr. Price, we're fans of your work > ...\\" and \\"we wrote this script,\\" and he actually invited us inside. He had > every reason to ignore us, and even if it was on a polite level, he could > have said, \\"Okay boys, contact my agent,\\" but he was just so gracious. He > invited us in, sat and talked with us for about 15 minutes, took the script, > and that's how it all started. Price‚Äîwho at that point in his career was reluctant to do more horror movies‚Äîlater expressed regret at taking the role in a letter to German actor and puppeteer Gerd J. Pohl, claiming his agent had misrepresented the film.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091671/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv IMBD trivia Offspring Nevertheless, Burr recalls Price as \\"professional, gracious, and accommodating\\", praising his performance and his professionalism on set, despite Burr's suspicion that From a Whisper to a Scream was \\"the lowest budget film [Price] ever made as a professional\\". The film became Price's last horror role (though he would later play a villain in the zombie-themed action/comedy Dead Heat).  Filming  From a Whisper to a Scream was filmed between 1985 and 1986. During the shooting stage Vincent Price's scenes for the framing story were the last to be filmed. In fact, seeing footage from the finished segments helped convince the actor to take the role. ==Release== The film was written and shot under the title From a Whisper to a Scream, but its American distributor, Moviestore Entertainment, released it theatrically under the alternate title The Offspring. Critical response Michael Price of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram gave the film a three out of ten-star rating, noting that the film's veteran actors \\"make stale baloney seem palatable,\\" and that the film bears \\"no evidence of good or bad directorial style.\\" L. Kent Wolgamott of the Lincoln Journal Star wrote that \\"a couple of the segments are good,\\" but added that some of the sequences are \\"pretty bloody and hard to believe.\\" The Los Angeles Timess Michael Wilmington gave the film a favorable review, noting: \\"There's a mood throughout of foul things squirming up to the light. Writer-director Jeff Burr and co-writers Courtney Joyner and Darin Scott show a welcome reverence for the past of movie horror.\\" The Baltimore Suns Lou Cedrone alternately panned the film, deeming it \\"bad movie making\\" and adding that the most remarkable thing about it is that \\"it's been given an ad campaign.\\" Home media However, when it was released on DVD it was released under its original title.

When the factory where Raju works is closed due to a labour problem and he is depressed, Radha gives him 1000 which she had earned and saved by making toys. She advises him to use this money as seed capital and commence his own toy business. Raju assents, and in a short time, becomes rich. Anand, a former colleague of Raju, is jobless and approaches Raju for work. Raju appoints him in his concern and over a period of time, Anand and Radha fall in love. Raju, who is very possessive of his sister, gets angry with Anand as he feels betrayed. However, knowing how intensely Radha loves Anand, he arranges their wedding. After the marriage, Anand, along with his aunt and cousin, move into Raju's house. Raju marries Malathy, a doctor, on Radha's suggestion. All of them continue to live under the same roof and several misunderstandings arise. Anand's aunt uses every opportunity to widen the rift between Malathy and Radha and Radha and Anand. Unable to witness Radha's troubles, Raju moves out of the house with his wife. Through Radha, Anand's aunt serves a legal notice to Raju, demanding a share in the property for Radha. Malathy files a counter petition and the property is attached by the court, pending resolution. Unable to see Radha's sufferings, Raju withdraws the case. Still the families do not unite. Radha delivers a girl and Malathy delivers a boy. After her child's birth, Malathy goes abroad for further studies, leaving the child with Raju. Unable to cope with the separation from his sister and to have peace of mind, Raju goes on a pilgrimage for several months. He returns on Diwali day and goes to meet Radha, but is denied entry by Anand's aunt. While going back, he saves a little girl from getting burnt by firecrackers and in the process, loses his eyesight. He is hospitalised and Radha rushes to the hospital to see her brother. Raju learns that the girl he saved is none other than his niece. Unable to cope with his inability to see them, he dies; Radha too dies holding his hand. == Cast == *Sivaji Ganesan as Rajasekharan \\"Raju\\" *Gemini Ganesan as Anand *Savitri Ganesan as Radha ;Supporting actors *K.

Kottakara, a Malayalam film producer and story writer, wrote a story about the everlasting relationship between a brother and sister, with the intention of making it a film. He approached A. Bhimsingh, a director who gained a reputation for making successful family drama films, and narrated the story to him. After listening to the story, Bhimsingh agreed to make it as the film that would become Pasamalar. Sivaji Ganesan and Savitri, who previously acted in many film as lovers, were cast as the siblings, making this the first film where they did so. The film was produced by K. Mohan under the banner of Rajamani Pictures. Along with him, M. R.Santhanam was a co- producer. Aaroor Dass wrote the dialogues. Few scenes were shot at Sivaji's home in T. Nagar. One day, the climax with the highly emotional dialogue, \\"Kai Veesamma Kai Veesu\\" was being canned, during the break, Sivaji didn't even have lunch as he want to starve the whole day to get the perfect emotion and diction for the scene. == Themes == According to Soorian Kasi Pandian, author of the 1996 book India, That Is, Sidd, Pasamalar means \\"Flower of Love\\". The term \\"Pasa\\" refers to brotherly love which involves sacrifices for his loved sister. == Soundtrack == The music was composed by Viswanathan‚ÄìRamamoorthy. \\"Vaarayen Thozhi Vaarayo\\" attained popularity, and has been played at many Tamil weddings. It was composed in Abheri, a carnatic raga. The song provided major breakthrough for its playback singer LR Eeswari. {  style=\\"font-size:95%;\\" ! No. !! Song !! Singers !! Lyrics !!

The film was a commercial success, running for over 26 weeks, thereby becoming a silver jubilee film.  Critical reception  M. Suganth of Times of India noted: \\"Pasa Malar is actually not a feel-bad movie. Yes, it is melancholic but it also restores your faith in human relationships, not just the brother-sister bond which is the crux of this tale, and its unflinching pursuit of pathos only feels audacious now\\". Sify called it the \\"most memorable film on sister sentiments\\". Tamil magazine Ananda Vikatan called it a milestone film and mentioned that though films may come and go, this one would stay forever in the hearts of those who had a chance to see it.  Awards  The film won National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil ‚Äì Certificate of Merit for the Second Best Feature Film in 1962.  Home media  Pasamalar was released in DVD by Raj Video Vision in 2015. It was also included alongside various Sivaji-starrers in a compilation DVD Yettavathu Ulaga Athisayam Sivaji (Sivaji Ganesan: Eighth Wonder of the World), which was released in May 2012. == Remakes == Pasamalar has been remade in number of languages, including Sinhala (as Suhada Sohoyuro in 1963). The first Hindi remake, Rakhi (1962) was directed by Bhimsingh, the director of the original. It was again remade in Hindi in 1986 as Aisa Pyaar Kahan. It was remade in Telugu as Rakta Sambandham (1962) with Savitri reprising her role, and in Kannada as Vathsalya (1965). == Legacy == The film became a trendsetter and inspired similar films of brother-sister relationships like Mullum Malarum (1978). In July 2007, S. R. Ashok Kumar of The Hindu asked eight Tamil film directors to list their all-time favourite Tamil films; four of them ‚Äì K. Balachander, Balu Mahendra, Mani Ratnam, K. S. Ravikumar ‚Äì named Pasamalar as one of the favourite films in Tamil. K. S. Ravikumar said \\"As a kid I saw 'Pasamalar' and cried. As an adult, each time I have seen it I was moved to tears. That is the power of the script and the performance of lead players\\". Playback singer Asha Bhosle noted that Pasamalar was the first Tamil film she had watched. Samy remarked that his directorial Kangaroo (2015) was a \\"modern day Pasamalar\\". Actor Sivakumar stated, \\"You can't reproduce movies like Parasakthi, Pasamalar, Devadas, Veerapandiya Kattabomman or Ratha Kanneer [...] By remaking such films, you are lowering yourself, while it enhances the original artists' image\\". == In popular culture == Footage of Paasa Malar is featured in the 2011 Tamil film Velayudham. Footage of the song \\"Malarnthu Malaratha\\" is featured in the opening scene of Jigarthanda (2014). Pasamalar has been parodied and referenced many times. The dialogue from this film \\"En Kannaye Unkitta Oppadaikaren, Adhula ennikume Anandakanneera naan pakkanum, Manjal Kungumamthoda Nee Needoozhi Vazhavendum\\" (I am giving my sister to you, she should always shed happy tears, you should live long with prosperity) became one of the famous dialogues in the film.Paasamalar (DVD): clip from 1.28.44 to 1.29.03 The dialogue appears in the song \\"Sakkarakattikku\\" from Mella Thirandhathu Kadhavu (1986) in which a small boy utters imagining the marriage of Radha.The dialogues in this movie also taken in \\"Yenga annan\\" song in Namma Veetu Pillai. In a comedy scene from Magudam (1993), Senthil utters the dialogue in a lighter vein to his sister. Goundamani who has married his sister is irritated that the lady is blackish in colour and she doesn't deserve these words. In Thai Poranthachu (2000), Vivek sings \\"Malargalai Pol Thangai\\" in a lighter vein after hearing the sob story of his tenant.Thai Porandaachu In Aasaiyil Oru Kaditham (1999), Vivek sings the same song after hearing that the lady sweeper is married.Aasaiyil Oru Kaditham DVD In Thangam (2008), Sathyaraj sings the same song to his sister just like Sivaji's character from the film.Thangam DVD In Thoranai (2009), when Paravai Muniyamma and Mayilsamy fall down unconscious reminiscent of the film's climax, Santhanam jokingly remarks that as if there are the brother-sister pair from Pasamalar.Thoranai DVD The following year, Sivaji and Savithri acted as lead pair in a film called Ellam Unakkaga. The film became a failure as the audience couldn't digest Sivaji and Savitri as lovers after seeing them as siblings. == Re-release == A digitally restored version of Pasamalar was released on 15 August 2013, during India's Independence Day. The digital conversion was done by Prasad EFX, Chennai. M. Suganth of The Times of India rated it 5 out of 5, saying \\"The restoration, cinemascope and audio conversion are pretty good while the trimming (by veteran editor Lenin, Bhimsingh's son) manages to retain the continuity to a large extent.\\" == References  Bibliography == * * == External links == * Category:1961 drama films Category:1960s Tamil-language films Category:1961 films Category:Indian black- and-white films Category:Films directed by A.

The Royal Papuan Constabulary, initially established by the Australian colonial administration as part of setting up Papua in the late 19th century, and the New Guinea Police Force which covered the former German New Guinea and British New Guinea also set up by Australia, initially during World War I and formalized as part of the League of Nations mandate of 1920. The constabulary played a significant role resisting the Japanese occupation of New Guinea during World War II. For example, the Lae War Cemetery holds the names of 13 police officers (panel 8) who died during the war. The two colonial territories were gradually amalgamated during and after World War II leading to the merger of the two forces. The structure was retained after Papua New Guinea gained independence in 1975, although the name shifted from Royal Papua and New Guinea Constabulary to the present name with the removal of the \\"and\\" in 1972. ==Special language== The RPNGC is known for the historic use of Police Motu, a lingua franca pidgin variant of the Motu language. During the colonial period, personnel needed to effectively administer the colony were scarce, so the colonial government recruited constables from the various Papua New Guinean peoples and nearby islands such as Fiji and the Solomon Islands. These recruits may have spoken any of about 700‚Äì800 different indigenous languages. To aid in communication, a common language was needed and the Police Motu pidgin arose. The language was widely used not just by police but also by colonial administrators. It was renamed Hiri Motu in the 1970s, due to the connotations of the word \\"police\\" and became one of the official languages of Papua New Guinea. ==Organization== September, 1943 ‚Äî Battle of Kaiapit ‚Äî \\"Yarawa\\" (left) of the Royal Papuan Constabulary is congratulated for single-handedly capturing a Japanese sergeant by Brigadier I. N. Dougherty (center) and WO2 L. P. Seale of ANGAU (right) The RPNGC is part of the Law and Justice Sector of the government of Papua New Guinea. It is headquartered in Konedobu, a suburb of Port Moresby, the capital city, in the National Capital District. As of 2008, the Police Commissioner is Gari Baki, with several Deputy Commissioners having responsibility for organizational functions and regions. The RPNGC has been aided in the past by various Australian initiatives, including supplying police forces and providing hundreds of millions of Australian dollars in assistance with budget, equipment and staffing. This aid is governed under the 1989 Treaty on Development Cooperation and has been carried out in several 5 year phases. For example, in phase II of the aid project, Australia budgeted A$80 million to deploy 53 full-time officers and materiel support. Phase III of the same program saw a proposal for an Enhanced Cooperation Programme with over 200 officers dispatched to aid in operations in 2004. However, after the PNG Supreme Court ruled the officers were not immune from prosecution, they were withdrawn amid diplomatic wrangling. The RPNGC makes use of Community Auxiliary Police, volunteer forces that aid in policing rural communities. ==Challenges== Papua New Guinea does not have a tradition of strong local police authorities. The RPNGC has around 4800 constables charged with enforcing the law in a country of seven million people. The RPNGC faces obstacles in trying to gain the cooperation of PNG communities, which frequently prefer to deal with criminals by themselves. The Constabulary also faces resource constraints (including shortages of such basic supplies as gasoline and stationery) and difficulties with internal discipline. Consequently, police are spread fairly thin, with correspondingly slow response times. While the Constabulary has a code of ethics, the Human Rights Watch has noted difficulties such as reports of beatings and rape by officers, citizens alleging they feel less safe when police are around, female victims being asked for sex when reporting crimes, and general corruption. Amnesty International in a February 1, 2006 letter to then Minister for Internal Security, Bire Kimisopa and then Commissioner of Police, Sam Inguba, claimed to have documented \\"extensive evidence of members of the RPNGC subjecting women and girls in custody to rape and other forms of cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment\\", as well as requests for sexual favors from female victims before investigating crimes, and suggested additional recruitment of female police officers as a way to address the issue. However, despite the internal issues, the RPNGC has been involved in giving aid to other countries and organizations in the region. For example, aid has been given to the Solomon Islands as part of the RAMSI since July 2003. == P.N.G ‚Äì Australian- Policing Partnership == The Australian government made a commitment to the PNG Government to deploy 50 Australian Federal Police to Port Moresby and Lae by the end of 2013 as part of Phase 4 of the Expanded Police Partnership. The aim of the expanded policing partnership is to improves the law enforcement capabilities of the RPNGC across key areas including: * public safety * station management and supervision * community liaison and engagement * traffic operations * criminal investigations * sexual offences. While on duty, the Australian police officers wear their AFP uniforms which include the mission logo wok wantaim (working together). Their vehicles also prominently display the mission logo. ==Crime statistics== Credible national crime statistics are not published by the RPNGC. For the first time, UNDP published a national homicide rate of 13.0/100,000 in the 2013 Human Development Report, but the origin of this figure is unknown. ==References * official site of the constabulary * historical images * Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary Police Legacy Web Page * The Royal Papua and New Guinea Constabulary a Pictorial History Web Page 1885‚Äì1975 Category:Law enforcement in Papua New Guinea Category:Commissioners of the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary ","title":"Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary"},{"id":"20211577","text":"is a real-time strategy video game developed by Genki.

It has been misattributed to many celebrated people, notably Albert Einstein. By extrapolation, it is suggested that a person may harness this unused potential and increase intelligence. Changes in grey and white matter following new experiences and learning have been shown, but it has not yet been proven what the changes are. The popular notion that large parts of the brain remain unused, and could subsequently be \\"activated\\", rests in folklore and not science. Though specific mechanisms regarding brain function remain to be fully described‚Äîe.g. memory, consciousness‚Äîthe physiology of brain mapping suggests that all areas of the brain have a function and that they are used nearly all the time. ==Origin== A likely origin for the \\"ten percent myth\\" is the reserve energy theories of Harvard psychologists William James and Boris Sidis who, in the 1890s, tested the theory in the accelerated raising of child prodigy William Sidis. Thereafter, James told lecture audiences that people only meet a fraction of their full mental potential, which is considered a plausible claim. The concept gained currency by circulating within the self-help movement of the 1920s; for example, the book Mind Myths: Exploring Popular Assumptions About the Mind and Brain includes a chapter on the ten percent myth that shows a self-help advertisement from the 1929 World Almanac with the line \\"There is NO LIMIT to what the human brain can accomplish. Scientists and psychologists tell us we use only about TEN PERCENT of our brain power.\\" This became a particular \\"pet idea\\" of science fiction writer and editor John W. Campbell, who wrote in a 1932 short story that \\"no man in all history ever used even half of the thinking part of his brain\\". Campbell followed up on this notion in a note to another story published five years later: \\"The total capacity of the mind, even at present, is to all intents and purposes, infinite. Could the full equipment be hooked into a functioning unit, the resulting intelligence should be able to conquer a world without much difficulty\\": Campbell, John W. (August 1937), \\"The Story Behind the Story\\", Thrilling Wonder Stories (note to the short story \\"The Double Minds\\"). Throughout his career, Campbell had sought grounds for a new \\"scientific psychology\\" and he was instrumental in formulating the brainchild of one of his more imaginative science fiction writers ‚Äî the \\"Dianetics\\" of L. Ron Hubbard. (Nevala-Lee, Ibid, passim.) In 1936, American writer and broadcaster Lowell Thomas popularized the idea‚Äîin a foreword to Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People‚Äîby including the falsely precise percentage: \\"Professor William James of Harvard used to say that the average man develops only ten percent of his latent mental ability\\". In the 1970s, the Bulgarian-born psychologist and educator, Georgi Lozanov proposed the teaching method of suggestopedia believing \\"that we might be using only five to ten percent of our mental capacity\\"..http://lppm.dinus.ac.id/docs/m/Suggestopedia:_How_Does_It_Accelerate_Language_Learning1.pdf The origin of the myth has also been attributed to Wilder Penfield, the U.S.-born neurosurgeon who was the first director of Montreal Neurological Institute of McGill University. According to a related origin story, the ten percent myth most likely arose from a misunderstanding (or misrepresentation) of neurological research in the late 19th century or early 20th century. For example, the functions of many brain regions (especially in the cerebral cortex) are complex enough that the effects of damage are subtle, leading early neurologists to wonder what these regions did. The brain was also discovered to consist mostly of glial cells, which seemed to have very minor functions. James W. Kalat, author of the textbook Biological Psychology, points out that neuroscientists in the 1930s knew about the large number of \\"local\\" neurons in the brain. The misunderstanding of the function of local neurons may have led to the ten percent myth. The myth might have been propagated simply by a truncation of the idea that some use a small percentage of their brains at any given time. In the same article in Scientific American, John Henley, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota states: \\"Evidence would show over a day you use 100 percent of the brain\\". Although parts of the brain have broadly understood functions, many mysteries remain about how brain cells (i.e., neurons and glia) work together to produce complex behaviors and disorders. Perhaps the broadest, most mysterious question is how diverse regions of the brain collaborate to form conscious experiences. So far, there is no evidence that there is one site for consciousness, which leads experts to believe that it is truly a collective neural effort. Therefore, as with James's idea that humans have untapped cognitive potential, it may be that a large number of questions about the brain have not been fully answered. ==Analysis== \\"10% of the brain\\" myth Neurologist Barry Gordon describes the myth as false, adding, \\"we use virtually every part of the brain, and that (most of) the brain is active almost all the time.\\" Neuroscientist Barry Beyerstein sets out six kinds of evidence refuting the ten percent myth: # Studies of brain damage: If 10 percent of the brain is normally used, then damage to other areas should not impair performance. Instead, there is almost no area of the brain that can be damaged without loss of abilities. Even slight damage to small areas of the brain can have profound effects. # Brain scans have shown that no matter what one is doing, all brain areas are always active. Some areas are more active at any one time than others, but barring brain damage, there is no part of the brain that is absolutely not functioning. Technologies such as positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allow the activity of the living brain to be monitored. They reveal that even during sleep, all parts of the brain show some level of activity. Only in the case of serious damage does a brain have \\"silent\\" areas. # The brain is enormously costly to the rest of the body, in terms of oxygen and nutrient consumption. It can require up to 20 percent of the body's energy--more than any other organ--despite making up only 2 percent of the human body weight.Carpenter's Human Neuroanatomy, Ch. 1 If 90 percent of it were unnecessary, there would be a large survival advantage to humans with smaller, more efficient brains. If this were true, the process of natural selection would have eliminated the inefficient brain portions. It is also highly unlikely that a brain with so much redundant matter would have evolved in the first place; given the historical risk of death in childbirth associated with the large brain size (and therefore skull size) of humans,Rosenberg, K.R., \\"The Evolution of Modern Childbirth\\" in American Journal of Physical Anthropology 35, 1992, p. 89‚Äì124. there would be a strong selection pressure against such a large brain size if only 10 percent was actually in use. # Localization of function: Rather than acting as a single mass, the brain has distinct regions for different kinds of information processing. Decades of research have gone into mapping functions onto areas of the brain, and no function-less areas have been found. # Microstructural analysis: In the single-unit recording technique, researchers insert a tiny electrode into the brain to monitor the activity of a single cell. If 90 percent of cells were unused, then this technique would have revealed that. # Synaptic pruning: Brain cells that are not used have a tendency to degenerate. Hence if 90 percent of the brain were inactive, autopsy of normal adult brains would reveal large-scale degeneration. In debunking the ten percent myth, Knowing Neurons editor Gabrielle-Ann Torre writes that using one hundred percent of one's brain would not be desirable either. Such unfettered activity would almost certainly trigger an epileptic seizure. Torre writes that, even at rest, a person likely uses as much of his or her brain as reasonably possible through the default mode network, a widespread brain network that is active and synchronized even in the absence of any cognitive task. Thus, \\"large portions of the brain are never truly dormant, as the 10% myth might otherwise suggest.\\" ==In popular culture== Some proponents of the \\"ten percent of the brain\\" belief have long asserted that the \\"unused\\" ninety percent is capable of exhibiting psychic powers and can be trained to perform psychokinesis and extra-sensory perception. This concept is especially associated with the proposed field of \\"psionics\\" (psychic + electronics), a favorite project of the influential science fiction editor John W. Campbell, Jr in the 1950s and '60s. There is no scientifically verified body of evidence supporting the existence of such powers. Such beliefs remain widespread among New Age proponents to the present day. In 1980, Roger Lewin published an article in Science, \\"Is Your Brain Really Necessary?\\", about studies by John Lorber on cerebral cortex losses. He reports the case of a Sheffield University student who had a measured IQ of 126 and passed a Mathematics Degree but who had hardly any discernible brain matter at all since his cortex was extremely reduced by hydrocephalus. The article led to the broadcast of a Yorkshire Television documentary of the same title, though it was about a different patient who had normal brain mass distributed in an unusual way in a very large skull.The skull had been enlarged by pressure from the hydrocephalus fluid. Her brain was thinly spread, but occupied her entire braincase, and its thickness was such that she had a brain volume of approximately 200 cm3. The woman had been told all her life that she had only 15% of normal brain mass, but those who told her this had not taken the form of her cranium into account. Explanations were proposed for the first student's situation, with reviewers noting that Lorber's scans evidenced that the subject's brain mass was not absent, but compacted into the small space available, possibly compressed to a greater density than regular brain tissue. Several books, films, and short stories have been written closely related to this myth. They include the 1986 film Flight of the Navigator; the novel The Dark Fields and its 2011 film adaptation, Limitless (claiming 20 percent rather than the typical 10 percent); the 1991 film Defending Your Life; the ninth book (White Night) of Jim Butcher's book series The Dresden Files; the sh≈çnen manga Psyren; and the 2014 film Lucy‚Äîall of which operate under the notion that the rest of the brain could be accessed through use of a drug. Lucy in particular depicts a character who gains increasingly godlike abilities once she surpasses 10 percent, though the film suggests that 10 percent represents brain capacity at a particular time rather than permanent usage. The myth was examined on a 27 October 2010 episode of MythBusters. The hosts used magnetoencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan the brain of someone attempting a complicated mental task, and found that over 10%, as much as 35%, was used during the course of their test. The ten percent brain myth occurs frequently in advertisements, and in entertainment media it is often cited as fact. In the season 2 episode of Fetch! With Ruff Ruffman, \\"Ruff's Case of Blues in the Brain\\", they debunked the theory. In Teen Titans Go!, Beast Boy attempts to solve a Find-It puzzle by unlocking more percentage of brain. ==See also== *Educational psychology *List of common misconceptions *Pineal gland, a part of the brain that has attracted pseudoscientific interest *Savant syndrome ==References== Category:Brain Category:Urban legends Category:Pseudoscience ","title":"Ten percent of the brain myth"},{"id":"20211606","text":"Adamkhan is a community in Helmand Province, Afghanistan.

It is a brood parasite that takes over the nests of other bee species. Its primary host is Bombus terrestris (the buff-tailed bumblebee). After its initial classification as Psithyrus vestalis, this bumblebee recently was reclassified into the genus Bombus, subgenus Psithyrus. == Description == The queen is a large bumblebee with a length up to and a wingspan of ; the male is considerably smaller (). The bumblebee is predominantly black, with an orange collar. The third tergite has a border of yellow hairs, and the hairs on the fifth tergite are mostly white. The males are similar to the females, but smaller and with longer antennae. It is similar in appearance to another cuckoo bumblebee, Bombus bohemicus, but is distinguishable by either the length of the antennal segments or dissection and comparison of the genitalia. In Bombus vestalis, the fifth antennal segment will be the same length as the third and fourth together.Vestal Cuckoo Bumblebee - Bombus vestalis NatureSpot A key characteristic of Bombus vestalis is the lack of corbiculae or a pollen basket on the hind legs of the bee. This is evolutionarily relevant because Bombus vestalis does not make its own nests or collect its own resources. With its larger body and poor foraging skills, the female Bombus vestalis are adapted to taking over nests of other species which have already been made and using the workers in these colonies to collect pollen.  Gender  A brood of bees successfully raised by Bombus vestalis is mainly female. This is evolutionarily beneficial since the female is the sex which takes over host species and allows Bombus vestalis to reproduce. In fact, many of the male bees which are hatched in a nest that has been taken over by Bombus vestalis are a result of host workers who were able to successfully lay eggs despite the aggression of the invaders. Although they display haplodiploidy where males are haploid and females are diploid, morphologically, male and female Bombus vestalis are very similar and can be classified with a mosaic gynander. They have similar mandible and body structures, and it is likely that the differences are only derived from chromosomal alterations during development of the embryo. == Taxonomy and phylogeny == Bombus vestalis is part of the family Apidae. Until recently, it used to be identified as Psithryus vestalis. It was then renamed under the genus Bombus and classified as subgenus Psithyrus. The subgenus Psithyrus refers to a variety of cuckoo bumblebees who have no worker caste and reproduce by taking over host colonies and using workers of those colonies to rear their young. They can be confused with the bee Bombus bohemicus since both are found in similar regions and are parasitic in behavior. However, Bombus bohemicus is more intense in color and is a generalist parasite when choosing its host. == Distribution == The bumblebee is common from North Africa in the south to southern Sweden in the north, and from Ireland in the west to northern Iran in the east. It is common throughout England and Wales, but has only been sighted in Scotland since 2009. Using data from the National Biodiversity Network gateway, Bombus vestalis is most prominent in south-east England.Grid map of records for Bombus (Psithyrus) vestalis National Biodiversity Network In Ireland the bee was believed to be all but extinct in the 20th century with the last recorded sighting in 1926 in Carlow. However, in 2014 a population was rediscovered in the walled garden at Saint Enda's Park in Rathfarnham. == Ecology == Bombus vestalis is a cuckoo bumblebee; it does not construct any nest of its own, but usurps the nest of Bombus terrestris, kills the host queen, and forces the host workers to raise its offspring. The male bumblebees often congregate in gardens in the suburbs. The queen emerges early in the spring; the males emerge later, in late May to early June. Its food sources are flowering plants such as clover (males especially often visit white clover), tufted vetch, knapweed, and others. In the spring, the emerging queens frequently fly to flowers such as deadnettles, sallows, blackthorns, and dandelions. == Life cycle == The life cycle of Bombus vestalis is dependent on its host B. terrestris, who begin the growth of their colony in the early spring, slowly building up the nest. The female Bombus vestalis remains hibernated until April, after the host has raised a first generation of workers. At this point, the nest is an ideal size for the female B. vestalis to take over. In taking over the nest, the invaders assert their dominance among the workers bees for the first few days without killing the queen. It takes nearly a month for B. vestalis to fully take over the nest and raise her brood. == Behavior ==  Mating behavior  Male Bombus vestalis have been found to be attracted to floral odors, particularly the polar compounds of Ophrys flowers, which mimic the sex pheromones of virgin females. In short, olfactory cues play an essential role to attract males, for virgin female Bombus vestalis, and their sexually deceptive orchid mimics, O. chestermanii and O. normanii. For these orchid mimics, the males are attracted to their floral cues, which leads to the male attempting to copulate with the orchid labellum, during which the flower is pollinated.  Single host parasitism  Under the subgenus Psithyrus, there are two types of parasitic bees; one type of bee is non-specific when choosing its host and the other (e.g., Bombus vestalis) chooses an exclusive host. These two different behaviors are likely to have developed because of a chemical difference in pheromones. Social parasitic bees are shown to identify their hosts through pheromone trails left by host workers while they are out collecting pollen. By following these natural footprints, a parasitic bee can find the entrance to the hive of its desired host. Experiments show that Bombus vestalis is attracted to a specific combination of both nonpolar and polar pheromones, a combination that is specific to Bombus terrestris. Though the latter can be parasitized by other bees, Bombus vestalis will not take over the nests of any other species. Bombus vestalis can also distinguish the odors of differently aged host workers, thus determining which workers to attack when invading a nest.  Identifying colony size  The success of Bombus vestalis is dependent on the size of the nest which it invades. As soon as a female enters a colony, she is investigated by the workers and often faces attacks from them. Larger colonies will have more workers who are capable of defending the nest. Thus a female Bombus vestalis must weigh its costs parasitizing a nest when the colony is very large. Experiments have been done to reproduce this scenario. However, B. vestalis cannot take over a nest which is too small. During an invasion of a small nest, though successful, too many host workers will die and there will be a shortage of workers to take care of the Bombus vestalis queen and her eggs. Before invading a colony, the female must hence judge the size of the nest, through the frequency and size of workers moving in and out, and the pheromones of these workers before attempting an attack.  Identifying colony age  In experiments with Bombus vestalis and its host Bombus terrestris, an interesting phenomenon has been observed. Any host workers born after the invasion of a female B. vestalis were unharmed despite the takeover of the queen. Similarly, newborn Bombus terrestris were not attacked during the invasion. A female B. vestalis will only target older host worker bees who are a threat to her and her eggs. She is able to identify these workers through the detection of pheromones. The older a worker B. terrestris is, the more pheromones it secretes. Since Bombus vestalis is so perceptive of these odors, she knows which worker bees to kill off so that the brood of eggs is safe and solely her own. The remaining younger Bombus terrestris and those born soon after takeover of the queen are available to help care for the new Bombus vestalis nest.  Mauling  Many parasitic bees use mimicry to introduce themselves into the nests of their hosts. They mimic the odor of the host and oftentimes live in cooperation with the host species when raising their eggs. This is more common in larger colonies. Bombus vestalis is unique in that it has a mauling behavior. With a smaller colony to take over, the female B. vestalis can individually kill off the workers in the B. terrestris nest. When it comes to the queen, she may simply push her off the nest. This behavior is evolutionarily possible because Bombus terrestris nests are not too large and because Bombus vestalis invades early in the season. It will then suppress ovarian development of the remaining workers. ==See also== *List of bumblebee species *Eusociality ==References== Category:Bumblebees Category:Insects described in 1785 ","title":"Bombus vestalis"},{"id":"20211626","text":"Bombus ashtoni is a species of cuckoo bumblebee.

Both queens and males can be melanistic. In western Scotland, the subspecies B. c. swynnertoni is found, with a queen with an almost entirely pale yellow thorax, yellow hairs on terga 1 and 2, and a yellow tail. The male has more black on the thorax, but a lot of yellow on the abdomen. == Ecology == Its main hosts are bumblebees of the subgenus Thoracobombus such as Bombus pascuorum (common carder bee).

It is native to eastern North America.Hatfield, R., et al. 2014. Bombus citrinus. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Downloaded on 04 March 2016. This is a cuckoo bumblebee, one that invades the colonies of other bumblebees, kills the resident queen, and takes control over the population of workers inside. Host bees for this species include the common eastern bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) and the half- black bumblebee (B. vagans). Before the queen invades a nest she forages on various plants, such as asters, thistles, snakeroots, blazing-stars, mountain- mints, and goldenrods. == Phylogeny == Bombus citrinus belongs to the parasitic Bombus subgenus Psithyrus. A previous classification had Psithyrus listed as its own genus, and so this species used to be identified as Psithyrus citrinus. Members of Psithyrus are distinguished from other Bombus based on an abdomen with thick tergites, a long stinger, enlarged mandibles, loss of corbiculae, no worker castes, and a reduction in wax glands and its production; all of these features are associated with being inquiline parasites that replace host queens. Of the other species within this subgenera it is most closely related to Bombus insularis and Bombus variabilis and has sometimes been subgrouped with these as Laboriopsithyrus or Citrinopsithyrus. Psithyrus diverged around 20 million years ago from a clade containing the subgenera of Megabombus, Senexibombus, and Diversobombus. Bombus citrinus is believed to have originated from this line around 2 million years ago in the Eastern Nearctic region. While they have developed specializations toward their specific host species, in a coevolutionary relationship, some of their modifications were likely to have remained broad enough to enable these Psithyrus species to diversify and disperse following a small range of hosts in their time and area. Bombus citrinus may have coevolved with its host species as they emerged within the same time frame and area; around 13 to 5 million years ago for Bombus vagans and around 2 million years ago for Bombus impatiens. == Morphology == Like all cuckoo bumble bees, the outer tibial surface of the hind leg is convex and densely hairy, rather than adapted for pollen transport. Their heads are more teardrop shaped and the thorax is predominantly yellow including the lower sides and sometimes down to segment T4 or 5. Hair on the face is usually black with some yellow hairs, there are usually no black hairs on the thorax and would not form a band between the wing bases. Metastomal hairs are short and even and longer on T5 than the other joints and matte with dense punctures on T6. The wings are slightly opaque ranging from a reddish brown to brownish black and yellowish during pubescence. They are sometimes interspersed with black hairs. The male genitalia contain some of the most distinguishing characteristics when differentiating bumble bee species. The gonostylus are lined with long hairs, hairs on the yellow volsella are much shorter. The penis valve is long and thin and relatively straight compared to other bumble bee species. == Distribution == Map showing the distribution of Bombus citrinus Found in parts of the Northeastern area of North America. Their distribution includes eastern to central parts of Canada, Northeastern U.S states and parts of the mid- western and southeast regions of the U.S. == Biology ==  Chemical ecology  When invading a colony, P. citrinus acquire the host scent as well as transfer it using mauling to camouflage and dominate the colony. Colony recognition cues within a colony have an important function in cooperation and distinguishing between nestmates and non-nestmates, parasites, and robbers. Many species in the subgenus Psithyrus use scent to evade the host colony's recognition cues. Long chain alkanes and alkenes may possibly play a role in the production of Psithyrus‚Äô scent. The Dufour's gland is enlarged in the Psithyrus subgenus and believed to be the source of chemical production for bees in the genus.  Parasitism  Bombus citrinus is an obligate social parasite of the species Bombus impatiens and Bombus vagans . The cuckoo bee locates a host nest by trailing chemical signatures left by host workers. After locating a host nest the cuckoo will revisit to further observe the nest and will proceed to infiltrate if she determines the nest to be suitable for a successful usurping. The female Bombus citrinus may be noticed and attacked at nest entrance by host workers or sneak past by having blended in with the hosts chemical signatures. The Bombus citrinus will then kill the host species' queen, eggs, and larvae. To assert its dominance over the host workers the cuckoo will engage in aggressive mauling behavior. Only a few parasitic bees maul and they do so by rubbing their body against the host workers, grabbing at the hosts dorsal and lateral sides with their mandibles and first pair of legs, and making motions as if to sting. By doing this she further shares chemical signatures with the host and suppresses their ovarian development. Eggs laid by the female Bombus citrinus will be laid and then cared for by the host workers. ==References== Category:Bumblebees Category:Hymenoptera of North America Category:Insects described in 1854 ","title":"Bombus citrinus"},{"id":"20211650","text":"Cƒ±rk…ônd is a village in the municipality of Bƒ±ƒüƒ±r in the Goychay Rayon of Azerbaijan. ==References== Category:Populated places in Goychay District ","title":"Cƒ±rk…ônd"},{"id":"20211656","text":"Jakob Jonilowiczalternative typography: Jakub Jonilowicz, Jack Jonilowicz, Yaacov Yonilovitsch, Yaacov Ionilovich (1908‚Äì1975) was an Israeli cinematographer. \\\\- √úberlebt und unterwegs: J√ºdische Displaced persons im Nachkriegsdeutschland, By Fritz Bauer Institut, Fritz Bauer Institut, Published by Campus Verlag, 1997 - page 128 Jonilowicz was born in Vilna, at that time part of the Russian Empire.

He was also the host of the documentary show Time Warp on Discovery Channel, and directed a number of short films featuring greatly speeded-up or slowed-down time sequences. ==Early life and education== Lieberman earned two bachelor's degrees, in Mathematics and Physics, and two master's degrees, in Mechanical Engineering and Media Arts & Sciences with a focus in Robotics, all from MIT. He took a leave of absence from pursuing a PhD due to the demands of filming. Before his leave, he worked in the MIT Media Lab in Cynthia Breazeal's Personal Robots Group. ==Career== One of Lieberman's main interests is making kinetic sculptures. With Daniel Paluska he built the Absolut Quartet, a music machine which has been exhibited at Ars Electronica in Austria. He has made many technological sculptures, which resulted in him starting his design firm Plebian Design. He also successfully launched art projects on the crowd- funding site Kickstarter. \\"One thing that I don‚Äôt want to do as an artist is inflate the prices of my work to artificially make them more valuable. Often artists do this in order to make a living; so I wanted to figure out another alternative.\\" he said, explaining why he chose Kickstarter for one of his projects. His first Kickstarter project was Moore Pattern, and a second one, Slow Dance was later converted into an ongoing product. Both projects appear to be minimalist, but incorporate a deep understanding of human visual perception. Lieberman is also a musician, playing several instruments as well as singing. His first starring role in a feature film was in the romantic musical comedy 83 Errers. In 2010, Lieberman co-directed a 4-minute music video with Eric Gunther, featuring the indie band OK Go performing their song \\"End Love\\". The video was shot in a continuous take using three cameras, running 18 hours from before sunset to 11am the following day. The footage was condensed using time lapse techniques ranging up to 170,000 times speedup, with some brief slow-motion segments also recorded at 1500 frames per second. The art production is deeply influenced by the relativity of time and of the human bodily perceptions. In his 2011 speech at TEDxCambridge, he exposed his belief that \\"time and space are modes by which we think and are not condition in which we live\\", according to Albert Einstein who also affirmed \\"thought suffer from an optical illusion of consciousness\\", the illusion that it can exist \\"a separate person inside an envinronment\\" while person it can be realized it is pure and undifferentiated energy in motion everywhere, from the time of the Big Bang to the ethernity. The feeling to be alive, the \\"I am\\" is all what remains, without the possibility to know its content, form and structure, and definitely what we are. ==Plebian Design== Plebian Design is Lieberman's design firm, which has done projects like Quartet and Patterned by Nature, which is a sculptural ribbon wide and in length. ==Wonder Machines== After the success of a Kickstarter project, Lieberman decided to offer his artwork Slow Dance as an ongoing product through his new company, Wonder Machines. The modestly-priced artwork is a simple, minimalist wooden frame incorporating stroboscopic LED lighting and a vibrating electromagnetic coil, which can animate a small item such as a feather or a flower in apparent slow motion. ==See also== * Wen-Ying Tsai ‚Äî another kinetic sculptor who has used stroboscopic effects ==References *Official Time Warp website *Lieberman's Personal Website *Biographical info on Time Warp website *Scientific slowdown: Warp-speed photography *WGBH-TV web-only interview with Jeff Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni Category:American roboticists ","title":"Jeff Lieberman (artist engineer)"},{"id":"20211810","text":"Natalia Oreiro 2001 (Czech republic) is a kind of compilation that is issued specially for fans of the Czech Republic.

(USSVI) was created by a group of men from the United States Submarine Veterans of World War II. They shared a belief in the need of an organization open to all United States Navy submariners, from the very beginning of the Submarine Service to the present and into the future - not limited to just those who served so ably in World War II. They wanted to ensure their shipmates who were killed in action on submarines would never be forgotten. ==Purpose== Nearly 4,000 submariners have sacrificed their lives on the altar of American freedoms. It is the primary mission of USSVI to perpetuate their memory through memorials and \\"tolling the boats\\" memorial services. Per the USSVI Constitution Article III the Purpose/Creed consists of three sections: Creed Section 1: To perpetuate the memory of our shipmates who gave their lives in the pursuit of their duties while serving their country. That their dedication, deeds, and supreme sacrifice be a constant source of motivation toward greater accomplishments. Pledge loyalty and patriotism to the United States of America and its Constitution. Camaraderie Section 2: In addition to perpetuating the memory of departed shipmates, USSVI provides a way for all Submariners to gather for mutual benefit and enjoyment. The common heritage as Submariners is strengthened by camaraderie. USSVI supports a strong United States Submarine Force. Perpetual remembrance Section 3: The organization engages in various projects and deeds that bring about the perpetual remembrance of those shipmates who have given the supreme sacrifice. USSVI also endeavors to educate all third parties it comes in contact with about the services United States submariners performed and how the sacrifices of lost shipmates made possible the freedom and lifestyle Americans enjoy today. ==History== United States Submarine Veterans of World War II Prior to the founding of the United States Submarine Veterans, Inc. (USSVI), there existed another U.S. submarine veterans association, the United States Submarine Veterans of World War II which still exists today. Founded in July 1955, membership in this organization is limited to submarine crews and relief crews who were on active duty from December 1, 1941 through September 1, 1945. As this organization grew, so did the development and deployment of American submarines across the globe, and it became apparent to many that there was a need and a strong desire for a new organization to include submariners of all eras. Formation of USSVI In the American Airlines Lounge at Dallas Love Field in Texas. Seated are, left to right, Phyllis Lockwood, Joe Negri, Ron Smith, and Charlie Cook. Fueled by a desire to form a new association, and inspired by the tragic loss of the USS Thresher (SSN-593) on April 10, 1963, a meeting was set for October 12, 1963. Led by Dominic ‚ÄòJoe‚Äô Negri and others, the Charter Meeting of USSVI was held in Orange, New Jersey, with 16 representatives present. The Creed and National Bylaws were established at this inaugural meeting. Officers were appointed to serve in an acting capacity until regular elections could be held in the summer of 1964. Robert Link was appointed President; Ken Walkington, Vice-President; Joe Burges, Secretary; and Mike Drucker, Treasurer. Incorporation On May 24, 1964, shipmates Joe Negri, Ken Walkington, and Joe Marion met with New London, Connecticut attorney, L. Patrick Gray, Captain, U.S. Navy (Retired) (who later became the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation), to legally constitute USSVI as a legal, non-profit organization in the State of Connecticut, with a license to operate and conduct business in all 50 states. The organization was officially incorporated and chartered in New London, Connecticut. The signatories were Joe Negri, Ken Walkington, and Joe Marion. Additional USSVI Plank Owners included Warren ‚ÄòEd‚Äô Gannon, Angelo La Pelosa, Robert Link, Tom Rowan, and Hugh Trimble. They selected former United States Submarine Veterans of World War II National Commander Bob Link as their first acting National Commander. Joe Negri was elected the first Connecticut State Commander and Dick Higham was elected the first Base Commander of Connecticut Base #1, which later became Groton Base. This fledgling organization would soon grew to several hundred shipmates scattered throughout Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. First National Convention The first National Convention was held in Atlantic City, New Jersey on June 18‚Äì20, 1964. Acting President, Robert Link of Absecon, New Jersey was host to the delegates at the Traymore Hotel. Nine eastern states were represented by Ed Sena from New York, Dick Higham from Connecticut, Elmo Wittig from New Jersey, Thomas ‚ÄòDoc‚Äô Smith from New Jersey, Herman Schmidt from New Jersey, Art Clarke from Pennsylvania, Joe Negri and Ken Walkington of Connecticut. Commander Charles Carlisle, Commanding officer of USS Tecumseh (SSBN-628), served as guest speaker for the first annual convention. Vice Admiral Charles A. Lockwood was also a guest in attendance. A new slate of National Officers was elected at the first Convention. Joe Negri was elected National Commander; KenWalkington, Vice Commander; Joe Burges, Secretary; and Mike Drucker, Treasurer. National Directors were JoeWebb, Dick Higham, and Joe Marion. National Headquarters The Groton Base started operating immediately and held meetings at the K of C in Groton. The attendance at these meetings was between 60-75 members. Joe Negri was elected the first state commander and Dick Higman was the first Base Commander. About a year later it was determined that they needed their own building and it was voted to sell raffle tickets (1000 tickets at $10 each) for a gold Cadillac to raise the money for the down payment on the present home at 40 School Street in Groton, Connecticut. The base building on School Street became a reality in 1966. Due to the fact that the Groton USSVI/Base was incorporated within the State of Connecticut and they had their own building, it was voted that Groton become the National Headquarters of USSVI. ==Organization== National officers Nationally elected officers of USSVI are: * National Commander (NC) * National Senior Vice-Commander (NSVC) * National Junior Vice-Commander (NJVC) * National Secretary (NS) * National Treasurer (NT) The prerequisite for National Office is that a nominee must be a Regular Member in good standing a minimum of thirty consecutive months. The term of office for all national officers is two years or until a successor is elected. No individual can serve more than two consecutive terms as National Commander. Other than the position of National Commander, there are no restrictions on the number of terms an individual may be elected to any office. Board of Directors The Board of Directors has the control and general management of the affairs and business of the organization. It is composed of the national elected officers, the Regional Directors, the District Commander Of The Year, the District Commanders, the immediate Past National Commander, the President of the Ladies Auxiliary and the Commander of the Holland Club. Regional Directors Regional Directors (SE, NE, Central, and Western) are directly responsible to the National Commander for the conduct of organizational business within their region. They serve as members of the Board of Directors, members of the Scholarship Committee, and perform other such duties as required by the National Constitution and USSVI Bylaws. District Commanders District Commanders serve as non-voting members of the Board of Directors. They assist the Base Commanders within their respective districts in the performance of their duties, to include providing assistance as required to ensure the proper operation of base meetings and events, recruiting and retention. They appoint all district committees, committee chairmen and appointed officers as required to conduct district business. They also approve the base constitution and bylaws, ensuring compliance with national and state laws regulating the operation of the organization within his district (i.e. chartering, maintaining non-profit status). Base Commanders Base Commanders are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their specific base in accordance with their base bylaws. Structure USSVI is organized by regions, districts, and bases throughout the United States. {  border=\\"1\\" - ! Region ! District !

National Library The National Library is located in North Little Rock, Arkansas at the Arkansas Inland Maritime Museum. The library has a complete set of the following magazines: * Polaris magazine (which is currently being scanned for archive) * United States Submarine Veterans of World War II ladies' magazine * American Submariner magazine (of which about 50% has been scanned for archive) ==Membership== USSVI currently has over 12,000 US Submarine qualified members. Regular USSVI Regular membership is restricted to current and former U.S. military personnel, who have been designated \\"Qualified in Submarines\\" by authorized U.S. Navy Command Authority, or are regular members of the U.S. Submarine Veterans of World War II. All are invited to join their shipmates in \\"Subvets\\". More information can be found at the USSVI website. Life Regular and Associate Members may become Life Members by paying the National Life Membership fee established in the organization's bylaws. National Life Members will pay no further national dues, but may be required to pay base dues as per base bylaws. A base may offer a member, who is a National Life Member, Base Life Membership, not to exceed the cost of National Life membership. National Life Membership was inaugurated in 1984 at the National Business Meeting in Groton, Connecticut. Base Life Membership, in 1985, was voted-in at the Boston Base, available with National Life Membership as a prerequisite. Primary and dual When an applicant selects a base to join, that base becomes his \\"primary\\" base. This is done for National voting reasons. National election ballots are distributed according to a member's primary base. A \\"dual\\" member is someone who has also joined other bases as their interests dictate. The member may also vote in local base elections through his \\"dual\\" base(s), but national election voting is always only done through the member's primary base. Associate An Associate Member is a person who is not eligible for regular membership but is closely associated with a Regular Member. Each Associate Member must be sponsored by a Regular Member in good standing and are eligible for Life Membership. Associate Membership is reserved for persons not otherwise eligible for regular membership, but who are related to the Submarine Service by their deeds or actions. All Associate Members must be at least sixteen (16) years of age. This does not preclude any relative of a regular member in good standing from applying for Associate Membership. Auxiliary An Auxiliary to the United States Submarine Veterans Inc. has been established and is known as \\"The Auxiliary of the United States Submarine Veterans, Incorporated\\". Any base may adopt an Auxiliary at their own discretion; however, the adopted USSVI Bylaws must be approved by the District Commander prior to implementation. Membership in the Auxiliary is limited to USSVI or SVWWII member's wives, widows, siblings, parents and children not less than 16 years of age. Holland Club Any Regular Member who has been designated \\"Qualified in Submarines\\" for fifty (50) years or more and who is a member in good standing is eligible to become a member of the \\"Holland Club\\" within the organization. The Holland Club was named after John Philip Holland, an engineer who developed the first submarine to be formally commissioned by the U.S. Navy. Member-at-Large The base or National Membership Chairman may place any member, who chooses, or is assigned to, a base, and who is a National Life Member or whose National annual dues are current, but whose base dues are in arrears, in a category of Member-at-Large. Members-at-Large whose national annual dues are current or who are National Life Members will retain national benefits (i.e. receipt of national magazine and voting on national issues). A Member-at-Large may affiliate with a base at any time by remitting base dues. A Regular base member may transfer to Member-at-Large Status at any time by making a request to his affiliated base or to the National Membership Chair. ==Committees== * Membership * Scholarship * Ways and Means * Long Range Planning * Memorials and Ceremonies * Public Relations and Publicity * Nominations * National Archives * New Base Development * Constitution and Bylaws * Veterans Affairs * Awards * National Convention * Base Commanders Group * Technology * Audit ==Charitable funds== The USSVI Charitable Foundation (USSVCF) is administered by a board of directors made up of non-paid elected and appointed members. Expenses incurred by the Charitable Foundation are minimal and consist of expenses such as postage, certificates, website fees, stationery supplies, and informative brochures. The foundation was approved for tax exemption under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code on December 5, 2000. To facilitate the many activities that may arise, the foundation is split into various dedicated funds. * Brotherhood Funds * Building Fund * General Fund * Memorial Funds * Scholarship Funds * Submarine Library Fund * Submarine Museum Fund ==American Submariner magazine== American Submariner is the quarterly magazine published by USSVI and is a major benefit that all USSVI members receive. The purpose of the magazine is to keep the membership informed of organizational events the latest developments in the U.S. Navy's Submarine force. It also honors tradition, heritage, and service of all submariners, who proudly earned the designation \\"Qualified in Submarines\\", by regularly featuring articles about submarines, their crews, and missions conducted during the eras of World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War, and the First Gulf War. In May 1969, the magazine Submarine National Review came into existence to better establish communications and rapport within the submarine community, with Ken Walkington and Tom Rowan serving as co-editors. It was renamed American Submariner in December 1977. It reverted to Submarine National Review in January 1979 but in July 1991 it was renamed yet again to American Submariner It retained the subtitle of National Submarine Review until 2000. ==Annual National Conventions== * 2019: Austin, Texas *2018: Cruise, Ft.

It was produced by Lions Gate Entertainment. ==Plot== At Ken's bachelor party, a group of men are partying with two stripper sisters named Serena (Taylor Dayne) and Kelly (Jenny McShane). Serena steals one of the men and makes love to him, while a group of men party with her sister Kelly. Kelly accidentally falls onto the stone floor and dies. Another person, her bodyguard, also dies in an accident. Arriving and witnessing the accidental deaths of Kelly and her bodyguard, Serena begins crying and confronts a group of men, who give a weak apology. Two of the men then kidnap Serena and hold her hostage upstairs. A group of men cover their tracks and eliminate the bodies of the two deceased people. A rescuer frees Serena, but he and Serena are kidnapped by their captors. He and Serena are later rescued. Grabbing the two guns in her hands, Serena shoots and murders her kidnappers. The reason the wild party began was to turn the tables on Ken, who had always made others the subject of his pranks. ==Cast== * Mario Van Peebles * Andrew McCarthy * Kevin Dillon * Taylor Dayne * John Stockwell * William McNamara * John Henson * Jerry Stiller * Ben Gazzara == Release == Stag premiered on HBO in June 1997. == Reception == Brendan Kelly of Variety called it \\"an efficient psychological thriller\\" that \\"becomes a tad predictable\\".

Three private rail companies were nationalised nineteen years later. During the Japanese occupation of Burma, Allied prisoners of war were forced to build the Burma Railway. Myanmar Railways has expanded its network somewhat since 1988. ==1877-1896== Rail transport was introduced in Burma in May 1877 (when Lower Burma was a colony of the United Kingdom and part of British India) with the opening of the Rangoon-to-Prome line by the Irrawaddy Valley State Railway. The line, following the Irrawaddy River, was built over a three-year period with labour imported from India (particularly the areas affected by the Bihar famine of 1873‚Äì74). Unusually for a British colonial railway, it was built to 1,000 mm (3 ft 3 3‚ÅÑ8 in) metre gauge. In 1884 the Sittang Valley State Railway, a new company, opened a line along the Sittang River from Rangoon to Toungoo via Pegu. The Irrawaddy line was considered commercially important because it could transport rice from the valley to the main port at Rangoon, and the Sittang line was strategically important because of Toungoo's proximity to the border with Upper Burma (then part of the Ava kingdom). This became evident at the start of the Third Anglo-Burmese War (a year after Sittang line opened) and during the unrest which followed the war. The construction of the two lines cost ¬£1,926,666; the railway was profitable by 1888, returning more than five percent on capital investment. With the annexation of Upper Burma, the railway was extended by from Toungoo to Mandalay (the fallen capital of the Ava kingdom) in 1889. The Mu Valley State Railway was formed after the opening of this section, and construction began on a rail line from Sagaing to Myitkyina connecting Mandalay to Shwebo (1891), Wuntho (1893),Dautremer, Joseph (1913) Burma under British Rule (translated from Dautremer, Joseph (1912) La Birmanie sous le r√©gime britannique: une colonie mod√®le Guilmoto, Paris, ) T.F. Unwin, London, page 205, ; full text pp. 194-213 from the online library eBooksRead.com Katha (1895) and Myitkyina (1898). This railway created a continuous line from Rangoon to Myitkyina through the Kachin Hills, except for a ferry crossing of the Irrawaddy at Sagaing. The Inwa Bridge at Sagaing, Burma's only bridge across the Irrawaddy, opened in 1934 with two decks: one for road traffic and one for trains. ==1896-1945== The Burmese rail network in 1900 In 1896, before the completion of the line to Myitkyina, the rail companies were combined into the publicly owned Burma Railway Company. Between 1898 and 1905, another of railway was built. A branch line from the Rangoon-Pyay railroad connected Bassein in the Irrawaddy delta to Rangoon, and the Mandalay-Hsipaw-Lashio railway ran through the Shan Hills (nearly to the border with China). The latter railway included the Gokteik viaduct, a , viaduct across the Gokteik gorge near Nawnghkio. When it was built, it was the longest such viaduct in the world. (Includes many construction photos) The track rises in a continuous 1:40 gradient, and the viaduct (designed by Alexander Rendel & Sons and built by the Pennsylvania Steel Company) was considered an engineering marvel at the time. The Mandalay- Lashio railway was planned to extend to Kunlong (on the border) and into China's Yunnan province, but the plan was abandoned because of the difficult terrain. In 1907, a line opened connecting Pegu and Moulmein (the capital of British Burma before the Second Anglo-Burmese War). The line ran to Martaban, on the Gulf of Martaban at the mouth of the Salween River, and passengers had to take a ferry to Moulmein. Until the Thanlwin Bridge opened in 2006, it was impossible to travel from Rangoon to Moulmein by rail. The Burma Mines Railway, an 80-kilometre (50-mile) narrow-gauge line from Namyao (on Myanmar Railways' Mandalay-Lashio branch) via Namtu to Bawdwin, was completed in 1908. After the First World War, a line was built between Moulmein and Ye at the northern end of the Mergui Archipelago. Burma's last major rail line, from Thazi on the Rangoon-Mandalay line to Kalaw (a hill station in the southern Shan State) was built between 1914 and 1918. In 1928, the Burma Railway Company was dissolved; the railways were brought directly under government operation and renamed Burma Railways. Around this time, they began to lose money because of competition from road transport. With return on capital declining, Burma Railways became the country's single largest debt item when the financial separation of India and Burma took place in 1937. The company's coal and rolling stock were imported from India or Britain. Siam-Burma Railway The British had long planned to construct a railway line connecting India with Siam (now Thailand) and China. British companies examined the possibility of building a railway from Rangoon to Yunnan to link with a second line from Bangkok to Yunnan, but were unable to obtain financial backing. When the Japanese occupied Thailand and Burma, they decided to build a railway connecting their Southeast Asian territories with Burma (partly to facilitate the movement of troops and supplies for their planned invasion of India). Since Yunnan was in Chinese hands under Chiang Kai-shek, they looked for a southern route to Burma from Thailand and settled on a line from Ban Pong to Thanbyuzayat across the mountains separating the two countries. Since Thanbyuzayat was on the Moulmein-Ye railway line and Ban Pong connected to Bangkok via Kanchanaburi, the line would provide a direct connection (with a ferry from Moulmein to Martaban) between Bangkok and Rangoon. The Japanese built the lines with Allied prisoners of war, and an estimated 15,000 POWs and 150,000 others died during the construction of the railway‚Äîabout 675 deaths per mile. Its construction is depicted in the film, The Bridge on the River Kwai. ==1945 to present== In 1942, The country had of meter-gauge track in 1942, but during World War II the Japanese removed about . By the end of the war, were operational in four isolated sections. During the postwar era, the rail network was rebuilt. By 1961 the network was long, remaining constant until the opening of a line from Kyaukpadaung to Kyini in October 1970. This began an upsurge in construction and track-doubling, and Myanmar Railways operated 11 divisions over of track by 2000. Most routes are single-track, although large portions of the Yangon-Pyay and Yangon-Mandalay routes are double-track. The railway had a total length of in December 2008, including the Yangon-Mandalay line's double-track section.

The paragraph only makes up one of many paragraphs in an essay, and are more mechanical in nature including the introduction and conclusion. The structure is utilized because it is thought to help students who struggle with paragraph structure and is taught in some U.S. middle schools and in early high school classes. ==Requirements== Jane Schaffer paragraphs have some requirements that are as follows: *Must not be written in first person *Every paragraph must be at least five sentences long; however, there can be more as long as the same ratio of two CMs to every CD is kept *Each section (TS, CD, CM, CS) is only one sentence in length *Each section should also avoid past tense and only be written in present tense ==Paragraph Structure== *Topic Sentence (TS) *Concrete Detail (CD) *Commentary (CM) *Commentary (CM) *Closing/Concluding sentence (CS) A basic Schaffer paragraph begins with the topic sentence‚Äîstating with a topic and an opinion, what the paragraph is about, then followed by a concrete detail, two commentary sentences, and a closing sentence. This is called a one-chunk body paragraph and is the most basic Schaffer model. One of the key elements in the Schaffer program is what is called the \\"ratio.\\" Ratio is the amount of Concrete Detail in a paragraph compared to the amount of commentary connected to the CD. In the above paragraph the ratio is 1:2. The actual ratio for response to literature is 1:2+, which means there must be at least two sentences of Commentary for each sentence of Concrete Detail like so: *Topic sentence (TS) *Concrete Detail (CD) *Commentary (CM) *Commentary (CM) *Concrete Detail (CD) *Commentary (CM) *Commentary (CM) *Closing/Concluding sentence (CS) Note that the ratio is still 1:2+ (At least twice as much Commentary as there is Concrete Detail) Topic sentence/statement (TS) This sentence should state the main point of the paragraph and be focused on stating a topic and a connected opinion about the topic :Example 1: Cinderella lives a miserable life. :Example 2: Global warming is a world problem and needs to be stopped. Concrete detail (CD) This sentence is the \\"what\\" is happening. It should be either facts, examples, illustrations, evidence, support, plot references, paraphrases, citations, quotations, plot summary, etc. It should be a concrete detail and should start with 'for example' or a different transition. :Example 1: For example, she does all the cooking, cleaning, and sewing. :Example 2: If it is not stopped, statistics show that the world will be drastically hurt. Commentary (CM) There are one or two commentary sentences in each chunk. They contain no facts, rather, comments from the paragraph written about the fact presented in the CD. This sentence contains analysis, interpretation, character feelings, opinions, inference, insight, reasons, or color commentary. It is important that the commentary explains how the concrete detail helps prove the writer's point (the TS). :Example 1: ::CM1: This shows that she feels taken advantage of by her selfish stepmother and stepsisters. ::CM2: This is important because her horrible life gives her a present, her fairy godmother. :Example 2: ::CM1: Global warming should be man's greatest worry. ::CM2: This is because the Earth can become negatively and drastically affected worldwide. ::CM3 Commentary sentence is an opinion and a reaction.' ' General practice is that commentary sentences often start with a transition such as the following: *This (also) shows that *This is (important) because *In addition *Furthermore, *Therefore, *Also *For example, Concluding sentence / closing sentence (CS) The Concluding Sentence (CS) is the closing sentence that wraps up the TS and sums up the paragraph. It closes up the thoughts and gives insight to the next paragraph. Emotional or connotative words are preferred here usually beginning with \\"As a result\\" or another concluding sentence. :Example 1: As a result, she becomes a princess. :Example 2: Therefore, global warming is top priority and cannot be ignored. ==Critical analysis== In 2000, Wiley examined the Schaffer method as an example of teaching students to write using a prescribed structure. He argued that there is no strategy to extend beyond the formulaic scaffold once the method is mastered. Roybal taught the method to a group of 60 students, and reviewed their success in formulating a main thesis and topic sentences in an essay. He found that 62% of the students successfully created at least two topic sentences that related to the main thesis. However, he did not report any findings about their use of CD, CM, and CS sentences in the structure of the body paragraphs. ==References== * ==External links== *Official Jane Schaffer Writing Program *More details on the Schaffer paragraph Category:Writing Category:Grammar Category:Documents ","title":"Schaffer paragraph"},{"id":"20211927","text":"Astragalus clarianus (orth. var.

McDonough described his character as \\"this really sweet guy next door and then something tragic happens to him and his personality splits in half. You like Dave and you feel for him, but he also creeps the hell out of you.\\" Half-way through the season, just after the death of Nicollette Sheridan's character Edie Britt was filmed, McDonough already knew that his character would last just one season, and though he hinted that Dave might return for a brief arc in subsequent seasons, this never happened. ==History== Season 5 Dave convinces Edie to move back to Wisteria Lane and get her house back from her tenant. After paying the tenant to leave the house, Dave and Edie moved in. Edie announces to the women that she is married and introduces Dave. Outwardly, Dave seems refined and affable, but his darkness is quickly established: in a phone conversation with his psychiatrist, Dr. Samuel Heller, he says his rage is still with him, but there is one unnamed person who needs to worry about it. Karen McCluskey immediately clashes with Dave after she insults Edie, resulting in her cat Toby's disappearance. Toby reappears only after Karen apologizes to Edie. Karen becomes suspicious and investigates Dave. His response is to immediately plant the seed that Karen is old and senile, and causing her a breakdown during her 70th birthday party, which results in Karen being taken to the hospital. Meanwhile, he has purchased another house in the neighborhood so that he could rent it at a reasonable rate to Mike Delfino - who has been living across town since his divorce - and started a band with Mike, Tom Scavo, Orson Hodge, and Carlos Solis. Karen reassumes investigation once she is released from the hospital with the help of her sister, and learns of Dave's regular contact with Dr. Heller. They reveal to him that Dave is in Fairview, and Dr. Heller immediately travels to Wisteria Lane, only to be strangled in the storage room of The White Horse Club, where Dave's band has entered a Battle of the Bands competition. Dave sets a fire that will burn slowly so that he will be onstage when it reaches the crowd, in order to cover the murder. Mike is knocked unconscious, and Dave re-enters the burning building to save him and is hailed a hero. Dave begins to see vivid hallucinations of his wife Lila Dash and their daughter, Paige - the people killed in the crash that broke up Mike and Susan Delfino's marriage, and tells them he will make Mike pay. One night, Edie finds Dave in conversation with his hallucinations, and Dave reveals that he is a widower and struggles with the memory of his wife, and she kicks him out of the house for lying to her. A flashback reveals that Dave married Edie after learning she once lived on Wisteria Lane and never sold the house. Later, Edie decides she does not want to be alone and takes him back. Dave then plans a camping trip with Mike and his girlfriend Katherine Mayfair and tricks Edie into staying home. An encounter with a priest in a liquor store arouses Edie's suspicions, and she hears the name David Dash for the first time. She begins researching Dave's past, learning that it was not only his wife who died in the crash, but also the daughter he had failed to mention, and later discovers that Mike was the driver of the other car. Dave, Mike and Katherine leave for their trip, in which Dave tries to shoot Katherine with a hunting rifle to get revenge on Mike, but Edie texts him just as he pulls the trigger, distracting him and moving his aim. Dave returns home to a confrontation with Edie, who tells him she intends to warn Mike. Dave strangles Edie until she falls to the floor but stops before he kills her. Frightened, Edie flees their home, but is electrocuted after a car accident and dies. Susan checks in on Dave after Edie's death. Still unaware of Dave's true identity, she confides that she was driving the car the night of the crash but that Mike took responsibility because she had left her license in a different handbag. Dave turns his rage to Susan and determines to kill Mike and Susan's son M.J. Delfino in revenge for Susan's killing his wife and daughter. He plans a fishing trip with Susan and M.J. and records a video for Mike, stating that he did not want to kill M.J. but that he had to. Mike accidentally watches the tape before his honeymoon, and phones Susan and reveals Dave's true identity. Meanwhile, the police have since identified the body of Dr. Heller and put all the pieces together. Dave arranges to meet Mike at the intersection where the accident in which his family was killed, so that Mike can hit Dave's car with M.J. and Dave himself inside. However, Dave changes his mind in the last minute after he hallucinates that it is his daughter in the backseat, and tells M.J. to get out of the car. Dave awakens, and the camera zooms in on his face, as he imagines saving his family by telling them to stay home. As the camera zooms out again, Dave is seen in a secure room at Boston Ridgegate Mental Facility. ==Reception== The character of Dave Williams received mixed reviews.

Despite being recorded in April/May 1991, Order from Chaos' debut album, Stillbirth Machine, was finally released in 1992 through Wild Rags, despite the label dropping the band in November 1992. Around the same time, the album was also released by Greek label Decapitated Records (now Unisound Productions). This version, which differs from the Wild Rags in terms of artwork and layout and contains numerous textual errors, is apparently considered a bootleg version by the band. The album was given official re- releases by Osmose Productions in 1998 (including the Crushed Infamy demo) and Nuclear War Now! in 2008 (on both black and clear yellow vinyl). The album has received some critical acclaim; Terrorizer included it in their \\"top 40 death metal albums you must hear\\", at number 40. James Hoare commented, \\"The blasphemous babysteps of Peter Helmkamp, [...] Order from Chaos courted black metal's glass shards of spite and embittered, semi-mystical worldview in an ear when the two genres were defined by their opposition, setting down the foundations for further esoteric and impenetrable coupling.\\".Hoare, James (2010). Terrorizer's Secret History of... Death Metal, \\"The 40 Albums You Must Hear\\", page 95, March 2010. A series of further EPs were recorded and released throughout 1994 on various labels (Jericho Trumpet on Gestapo, Live: Into Distant Fears on Eternal Darkness and Plateau of Invincibility on Shivadarshana), followed by a second full-length, Dawn Bringer, on Shivadarshana, before the band decided to call it quits in 1995. After Shivardashana folded, French label Osmose picked up tracks recorded in 1995 for Order from Chaos' third and final album and released An Ending in Fire in 1998, as well as re-releasing their debut. Pete Helmkamp went on to form death metal act Angelcorpse, as well as writing a book on occultism, entitled The Conqueror Manifesto: Capricornus Teitan. Chuck Keller and Mike Miller went on to form retro black/thrash band Ares Kingdom and blackened death metal act Vulpecula. With interest in Order from Chaos still prevalent in the extreme metal underground, Merciless records released a compilation of demos, 1994 live tracks and rehearsal sessions, entitled Imperium - The Apocalyptic Visions, in July 2005. ==Last known line-up== * Pete Helmkamp (vocals, bass) * Chuck Keller (guitar) * Mike Miller (drums) ==Discography== Demos * Demo I (self-released, January 1988) * Inhumanities (self-released, July 1988) * Rehearsal (self-released, 1988) * Crushed Infamy (Wild Rags, July 1989) * Alienus Sum (self-released, 1992; reissued by Hexateuc Torment, 1994) EPs * Will to Power (EP, Putrefaction / Wild Rags, 1990) * Jericho Trumpet (7\\" EP, Gestapo, 1994) * Live: Into Distant Fears (7\\" EP, Eternal Darkness, 1994) * Plateau of Invincibility (10\\" EP, Shivadarshana, 1994) * Pain Lengthens Time (unreleased EP, 1994; included with the Dawnbringer CD) * And I Saw Eternity (EP, Ground Zero / Shivadarshana, 1996) Full-length LPs * Stillbirth Machine (Wild Rags, 1993; reissued by Osmose, 1998; reissued by Nuclear War Now!, 2008) * Dawn Bringer (Shivadarshana, 1995; reissed by Fifth Division, 2003) * An Ending in Fire (Osmose, 1998; reissued by Nuclear War Now!, 2008) * Imperium - The Apocalyptic Visions (compilation, Merciless, 2005) ==References== Category:American black metal musical groups Category:American death metal musical groups Category:American thrash metal musical groups Category:Heavy metal musical groups from Missouri Category:Musical groups established in 1987 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1995 Category:Musical groups from Kansas City, Missouri ","title":"Order from Chaos"},{"id":"20212017","text":"How Not to Die may refer to: * A 2008 book by Jan Garavaglia * A 2015 book subtitled Discover the Foods Scientifically Proven to Prevent and Reverse Disease by Michael Greger, M.D. ","title":"How Not to Die"},{"id":"20212046","text":"Beni, Nepal may refer to: *Beni, Dhawalagiri, central Nepal *Beni, Sagarmatha, western Nepal ==See also== *Beni (disambiguation) ","title":"Beni, Nepal"},{"id":"20212047","text":"In the 1981 Intertoto Cup no knock-out rounds were contested, and therefore no winner was declared. ==Group stage== The teams were divided into nine groups of four teams each.

The library's main branch is located at 500 Main Street in downtown Hartford. The nine branch locations are named Albany, Barbour, Blue Hills, Camp Field, Dwight, Goodwin, Mark Twain, Park and Ropkins. All branches feature free public access computers and free Wi-Fi. ==History== The Hartford Public Library began in 1774 as the Library Company, started by a group of city leaders. The founding members included Jonathan Brace, Jeremiah Wadsworth, Daniel Wadsworth, George Bull, Elisha Colt, Theodore Dwight, George Goodwin, Chauncey Goodrich and Thomas Y. Seymour. The Library Company was a subscription company and opened with some 700 books. The Library Company changed its name to the Hartford Library Company in 1799 and met in the Grammar School House, once located where the east end of the Municipal Building (Hartford City Hall) is today. Its first librarian was Solomon Porter, a Yale graduate and principal of the Grammar School. In 1838, Hartford resident and the first United States Commissioner of Education Henry Barnard organized lectures and debates for young men and called this association the Hartford Young Men's Institute. They invited Hartford Library Company subscribers to join with them, offering them lifetime memberships. Library company members agreed and brought to the institute their collection numbering over 3,000 volumes. In 1842, Daniel Wadsworth offered the Young Men's Institute a stake in what he hoped would become the cultural center of Hartford. Members accepted and, in 1844, the Young Men's Institute moved into the new Wadsworth Atheneum, eventually sharing space with the fine arts gallery, the Watkinson Library, The Connecticut Historical Society and the Hartford Art School. One of the Institute's most prominent librarians from 1846-1868, essayist Henry M. Bailey wrote in 1850 Thoughts in a Library about the mood there: \\"It is a stormy evening: the rain patters on the roof and beats against the windows. All without is cold and cheerless, all within is pleasant and cheerful...\\" In 1875, the Young Men's Institute hired Caroline Hewins as its head librarian. She was 29 years old. She held the position for 51 years, until her death in 1926. The institute's lecture series was well attended for a number of years. Guest lecturers included Oliver Wendell Holmes, Horace Greeley, Dr. Horace Bushnell, Rev. Henry Ward Beecher, Samuel Clemens, Charles Dudley Warner and Ralph Waldo Emerson. In the late 1870s the popularity of lecture series diminished. The institute noted: ‚ÄúWe have a library, not an institute; its members are, at least half of them, ladies; and the men belonging are old as well as young; being therefore, not alone for the young, not alone for men, and not an institute but a library, it seemed time to call it by its right name.‚Äù In 1878, the private institution changed its name to the Hartford Library Association. By the late 19th century, the people of Hartford recognized the need for a free public library. An agreement was reached between Wadsworth Atheneum regarding property ownership. A request for funds went out to city residents so that the building could be modified with a new library wing added to the back of the original structure. Funds were also needed to pay for the ongoing maintenance of what was to become the new public literary. More than 2,000 people donated money to this project. Hartford native Junius Morgan pledged $100,000 from London; his son, J.P. Morgan, pledged $50,000 from New York; other large donors included Lucy Morgan Goodwin and her sons J.J. Goodwin and the Rev. Francis Goodwin; the Keney brothers; and, Hartford banker Roland Mather. Contributions were made by the employees of Colt's, Sigourney Tool, Case, Lockwood and Brainard Co., Atlantic Screw Works, and many other factories. School children contributed nickels and dimes. Within two years from the start of the campaign, the city raised an amazing $406,000. On September 15, 1892, with the city appropriating tax monies for free library service, the doors of the new public library opened. On the first day, 388 names were registered; by the tenth day, 2,160 names were entered. On May 3, 1893, by a special act of the general assembly, the library's name was formerly changed to the Hartford Public Library. ==Modern era== The library today operates under the original charter granted to the Hartford Young Men's Institute of 1839. The majority of the library's operating cost now comes from the City of Hartford. In 1957, the Hartford Public Library moved from the Wadsworth Atheneum into a new building just two blocks away. Designed by Schutz and Goodwin, the building at 500 Main Street included modern reading and reference rooms. In 1998, to fully meet the needs of the public, the library embarked on an ambitious expansion and renovation at a cost of over $42 million. It was completed in 2007. The 21st century Hartford Public Library and its nine branches are state of the art, fully computerized. ==Library leaders since 1893== Caroline Hewins 1893‚Äì1926 Patricia Berberich Louise Blalock 1994‚Äì2008 Matthew K.

The station received an average of 110,000 passengers daily in 2007. Rotterdam Centraal. Home page . Retrieved November 14, 2008 The current station building, located at Station Square, was officially opened in March 2014.Rotterdam Centraal station reopens with a pointed metal-clad entrance, Alyn Griffiths, 22 March 2014 ==History== Railways in Rotterdam in 1936. Rotterdam's former Centraal Station by architect Sybold van Ravesteyn built 1950‚Äì1957. Before World War II, Rotterdam did not have a central railway station - instead there were four stations in and around the city centre: *Rotterdam Delftsche Poort: for westbound trains towards Schiedam, Den Haag HS and Amsterdam CS and eastbound trains towards Dordrecht *Rotterdam Beurs: towards Dordrecht, connected to Delftsche Poort *Rotterdam Maas: terminus for eastbound trains to Gouda and Utrecht *Rotterdam Hofplein: terminus for the Hofpleinlijn, an alternative line to Den Haag HS, also going to Scheveningen. Delftse Poort station was badly damaged by bombing in the Rotterdam Blitz. The new Centraal station was rebuilt just westwards of the site. Its original building was designed by architect Sybold van Ravesteyn and was completed on 13 March 1957, officially opening on 21 May. Maas station had closed in 1953 and trains from Utrecht were diverted to Centraal station via the new Rotterdam Noord station. However, the Hofpleinlijn (which later became part of RandstadRail) continued to bypass the station. Hofplein station was eventually closed in 2010 after the Hofpleinlijn was redirected through a tunnel and connected to Centraal station for the first time. On 9 February 1968 Princess Beatrix opened the first metro line in the Netherlands at Centraal station. The line connected the station to the south of Rotterdam and is now known as Line D. The first subway station had an island platform with two tracks. On 28 September 2009, a new and more spacious underground station opened right next to the old one, which was immediately demolished. The new station has two island platforms with three tracks. The mainline station nowadays has seven island platforms with thirteen platform tracks. There are three tracks without platform (tracks 2, 5 and 10). In 2007, it was used by approximately 110,000 passengers a day. The 1957 station building was closed in 2007 and demolished the next year - making it the first major post-war railway station in the Netherlands to be taken down to make way for a new one. The new station was completed and opened in 2014. ==New Rotterdam Centraal== A total reconstruction of the station and its surroundings started in 2004 to cope with an increasing number of trains, for example the high-speed train between Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris, and to accommodate for RandstadRail. Furthermore, the existing station, especially the passenger tunnel, also became too small to handle the growing number of passengers. Traveller numbers were projected to be 320,000 per day in 2025. To cope with this increase, a new station was necessary. In June 2004, ProRail, NS and the Municipality of Rotterdam awarded the contract to Team CS, a cooperative between Benthem Crouwel Architekten, MVSA Meyer & Van Schooten Architects, and West 8, for transforming the existing plans into a design for the new Central Station. On 16 May 2006 Mayor Ivo Opstelten revealed a work of Onno Poiesz consisting of the word EXIT, which was mounted behind the windows of the facade. Some of the letters \\"CENTRAAL STATION\\" that stood on the roof of the station until its closing were put in a different order by Peter Hopman and Margien Reuvekamp of Bureau Lakenvelder to read \\"TRAAN LATEN\\" (\\"SHED A TEAR\\"). The final closure of the outdated station took place on 2 September 2007 in the presence of Mayor Opstelten, to allow for the demolition of the station. Between 16 January 2008 and the end of March 2008 the station was completely demolished. Passengers then, for years, had to use amenities housed in a temporary shelter, a smurf- blue building complex on Conrad Street on the northeast corner of the Groothandelsgebouw. The bicycle tunnel served as a temporary passenger tunnel. On 28 November 2012 the six-times-as-large, new passenger tunnel opened, and on 28 August 2013 the renovated bicycle tunnel opened; the so-called biscuits - artworks that had adorned the wings of the former Central Station - are now above the ends of the bicycle tunnel. The full completion of the station was on 13 March 2014, when the station was reopened by King Willem-Alexander.King Willem Alexander opens new Rotterdam Central Station Rotterdam Centraal Station, as the station is now officially called - on the south side, at the explicit request of the citizens of Rotterdam, the name Centraal Station in the lettering that architect Van Ravensteyn had put on the old station, has returned - will obtain the status of world station, as it is on the international high-speed railway towards Belgium. Some modifications to accommodate security screening of Eurostar passengers from the UK are being made and are due to finish in March 2018.http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/infrastructure/single- view/view/rotterdam-centraal-station-to-be-modified-for-eurostar-services.html In addition to the railway station, the old metro station of Rotterdam Centraal with two tracks and an island platform was renewed and extended to accommodate for the light rail connection to The Hague Central Station. The location of the former island platform is now occupied by switches. The tracks of the RandstadRail Metro Line E were connected to the rest of the metro network with a new tunnel at Rotterdam Central Station. The new metro station has three tracks and two island platforms. Track 1 serves metro line E, part of RandstadRail in the direction Den Haag Central Station. Track 2 is for metro line E towards Slinge; additional services between Slinge - Rotterdam Central vv also use track 2 as terminus of metro line D. Track 3 is between the two island platforms; uniquely the doors of the subway open on both sides while halting at this platform. The latter track is used as the starting point of Metro Line D to the Akkers. On 28 September 2009 the new metro station was opened, after it had been closed for two days. The connection for RandstadRail was officially opened on 16 August 2010, a day after it was available for passenger service. On 26 March 2014, one of the 60-year-old trees that had to 'move' to allow for the renovation of the station area was placed on Conrad Street. On 4 February 2020, the Minister of Infrastructure and Water Management, Cora van Nieuwenhuizen, and the UK Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, announced that juxtaposed controls would be established in the station.

The idea of its creation sprang up in the 1930s, especially during the May 5, 1935 parliamentary elections in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. At the Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia in June 1935 held in the city of Split (Dalmatia) it was concluded to form the Front of National Freedom. Also it was concluded that Fascism could be defeated by the joint efforts of proletariat, peasantry, nationally oppressed and all democratic and progressive layers of society. The basis for the Front of the People's Freedom would be the Communist Party of Yugoslavia joined by the trade unions, \\"left wings\\" of the peasant parties, youth, university students, cultural, educational, sports societies, different professional associations and national liberation movements under the auspices of civic parties. The main platform was: #The destruction of the 6 January Regime, #Equal rights of the nations of Yugoslavia, #Preventing the burden of crisis on the back of the People and improving the economic position of broad working masses at the expense of the rich. The Communist Party of Yugoslavia comprehended the People's Front (NF) as a political platform for the approaching of masses with its ideas and as a method of alliance with other opposition parties like civic, republican and democratic bourgeois parties. The Communist Party of Yugoslavia was banned from political life of the country but remained seized with the matter of creating a singular People's Front up to the beginning of World War II. At the conference in Stolice (Serbia) it was concluded that the antifascist movement should be transformed to a United People's Liberation Front of Yugoslavia. Each of the future republics and autonomous provinces had its own People's Liberation Front. ==National front of republics and provinces== {  ! Name of the people's front !

The Programme and the Statute of the National Front of Yugoslavia were passed. Edvard Kardelj gave the main guidelines for the NFY in his seminary which described the NFY as \\"the sole of the Nation, its reflection, its heroic uprising, its greatest majority ‚Äì that it is ‚Äì the Nation itself\\". The NFY was the only organisation to contest the first postwar election, in 1945; opposition parties pulled out after claiming to have experienced severe intimidation. On 29 November, the Communist-dominated parliament formally abolished the monarchy and declared Yugoslavia a republic. From that moment onward, the NFY was effectively the only legally permitted political organisation in the country. At the fourth congress of the NFY it changed its name to the Socialist Alliance of the Working People of Yugoslavia. The congress accepted the proposal of the sixth congress of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia to have the name changed at the fourth congress of the National Front of Yugoslavia, held in Belgrade from February 22 to February 25, 1953. ==Parties and general people's organizations of the NF== *Antifascist Front of Women of Yugoslavia (AF≈Ω) *Croatian Peasant Party *Independent Democratic Party *Landworkers' Party *National Peasant Party *Socialist Party of Yugoslavia *Social-Democratic Party of Yugoslavia *United Alliance of Antifascist Youth of Yugoslavia (USAOJ) *United Trade Union of Workers and Employees (JSRiN) *Yugoslav Republican Democratic Party ==Parties not members of the NF== *Democratic Party *National Radical Party ==References== * Narodni front Jugoslavije, Politiƒçko odeljenje Ministarstva narodne odbrane, Beograd, 1945. * Katarina Spehnjak, Narodni front Jugoslavije (SSRNJ) - razvoj, programsko-teorijske osnove i procesi u dru≈°tvenoj praksi, published in Povijesni prilozi Year 3, No 1, a collection of papers by the Institute of the History of the Workers Movement of Croatia, Zagreb, 1984.

She was from Midhurst, West Sussex, born to poor parents, educated at home, and worked as a washer-woman, brewer, and at other manual labour. In the 1720s she moved to Hampshire in search of work. It was in this preface to the 1762 edition that she expressed outrage at Stephen Duck's portrayal of working-class women, which inspired Poems on Several Occasions. A family that had employed her encouraged Collier to publish her poetry. Collier initially wrote poems for her own amusement, not planning on their publication; she would recite the poems to entertain her listeners, and thus brought attention to her talents. ==Poetry== She read Stephen Duck's The Thresher's Labour (1730) and in response to his apparent disdain for labouring-class women, wrote the 246-line poem for which she is mainly remembered, The Woman's Labour: an Epistle to Mr Stephen Duck. In this piece she catalogues the daily tasks of a working woman, both outside the home and, at the end of the day, within the home as well: ::You sup, and go to Bed without delay, ::And rest yourselves till the ensuing Day; ::While we, alas! but little Sleep can have... (111-113) A second poem was printed with the Epistle to Mr. Duck. The Three Sentences is a paraphrase of the tale of the Darius contest told in 1 Esdras. Laundry (1990) asserts that Collier \\"tends to couple moral reformism with a certain amiable accommodationism, or compliance with the will of fathers\\". Keegan claims this poem \\"suggests yet denies feminist and democratizing class politics. . . . and indeed the poem as a whole ends with a pious expression of the poet's submission to divine will:\\" Collier is an important figure in the self-taught, laboring-class tradition in eighteenth-century poetry, a tradition which also includes Duck, as well as Ann Yearsley and Mary Leapor. Collier, Duck, and similar working-class poets from rural Great Britain were responding in part to the economic upheaval in the countryside, brought about by the enclosures of agricultural land and growing unemployment. Duck's depiction of female labourers as lazy and feckless characters in particular infuriated Collier, during a period when women field labourers often lost out to men in tight employment markets in the countryside. Collier didn't make much money from her poetry and worked as a washer-woman until she was sixty-three. She continued working for seven more years until, in poor health, she retired at age seventy and died two years later in Alton. == Works == *The Woman's Labour: an Epistle to Mr Stephen Duck (1739) *Poems on Several Occasions (1762) *The Poems of Mary Collier (1765) ==References Sources == *Jones, William R. \\"Collier, Mary (1688?‚Äì1762).\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.

Her father was Secretary of the National Liberal Club for twenty years and formerly worked in the Liberal Party publications department. Her mother taught scripture at Hall School, Weybridge. In religion her mother was a Quaker and her father a lapsed Presbyterian. She had one sister. She never married.The Times, 1 May 1997 ==Education== Jean Henderson started her education at Hall School, which has been described as an innovative and experimental establishment. The school was run by her aunt, Eva Gilpin (later Lady Sadler, wife of Sir Michael Sadler, Master of University College, Oxford). In 1949 Henderson co-edited a book about the school called Miss Gilpin and the Hall School: A Record of Adventure and Achievement in Education (Bannisdale Press, London) and in 1988 she published another exploration of the school, A Lasting Spring: Miss Gilpin and the Hall School, Weybridge 1898‚Äì1934 (William Sessions, York). After the Hall School, Henderson went to The Mount School, York, a Quaker establishment, where she was Head Girl. Henderson then went up to Bedford College, London University, where she graduated in modern languages (French, German and Russian). ==Career== On leaving university, Henderson first went to work in journalism, joining the foreign desk of the Westminster Gazette. She then transferred to the Daily News another paper with a Liberal bias. She also edited a magazine for the anti-war Women's International League and acted as part-time secretary to David Low the famous cartoonist. In 1938, after the death of her parents, Henderson changed careers and went in for the law. She was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1940 and called to the Bar in 1943. She then practised as a barrister on the London and Midland Circuits.Who's Who of 475 Liberal Candidates Fighting the 1950 General Election (LPD, 1950) She sat as an independent member of five Industrial Wages Councils and was Head of Chambers, 5 Pump Court Chambers, Temple, from 1970 to 1979. She also sat as a Justice of the Peace at Willesden.The Times, 1 May 1997 ==Politics== Jean Henderson was strongly influenced by her parents. She followed her father's politics and supported the Liberal Party all her life but she was independent and determined enough to choose her own political beliefs and causes. She fought three general elections for the Liberals, all without success. Her first intervention was as prospective parliamentary candidate for St Albans from 1936The Times, 23 April 1936 until 1941 but no election occurred during that period. During World War Two, Henderson lectured on current events to troops under the War Office Scheme for Education and also served as an air raid warden in Hampstead Garden Suburb. In 1941, Henderson was one of the prominent women speakers at a rally in Trafalgar Square, attended by over two thousand people, to protest at the unequal treatment of women in compensation for injuries received in air raids. Under the regulations of the time women received 7 shillings a week less than male civilians for the same injuries even though they faced equal danger in their homes, as targets in industry or working in civil defence. Among the other speakers were Lady Astor, Edith Summerskill and the pianist Harriet Cohen.The Times, 22 September 1941 At the 1945 general election Henderson stood as Liberal candidate for Barnet. This was won by the Labour by 682 votes, and she lost her deposit. In 1950 Henderson switched her attentions to Lincoln, this time with even less success, taking less than 9% of the vote and again losing her deposit. She did not contest a seat at the 1951 general election but she returned to the fray, first by becoming prospective parliamentary candidate for Watford in 1953 but then changing constituencies to fight at Luton in 1955. Again she came third and again she lost her deposit. Henderson tried her hand at local elections too. She contested Hendon Borough Council elections in Garden Suburb Ward in 1949 and 1953 but did not get elected. She was Honorary Secretary of the Women's Liberal Federation from 1941 until 1949 and served on the Executive of the Liberal Candidates' Association. She was President of Hampstead Garden Suburb Ward Liberal Association and a member of the Management Board of the Gladstone Benevolent Fund for Liberal Agents, (1973‚Äì1988). ==Saving Hampstead Garden Suburb== In 1962 the Hampstead Garden Suburb Protection Society was set up with the aim of preserving the essential character and independence of the area in the face possible changes and development when the area was acquired by a private property company. Henderson was elected the first chairman.The Times, 13 January 1962 The membership of the Society grew to around 3,000 and they were able to sponsor a private bill in Parliament to safeguard the future of the suburb.The Times, 20 February 1963 In 1968, Henderson became one of the first directors of the New Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust, which was granted powers to refuse proposed developments in the area which they believed were harmful to its character.The Times, 15 January 1981Mervyn Miller & Alexander Stuart Gray, Hampstead Garden Suburb; Phillimore, 1992 p138ff ==Papers== A substantial collection of Jean Henderson's papers covering her political work during the years 1916‚Äì1993, have been deposited in the LSE Library.

An article in The New York Times in 2008 stated that estimates vary between 3 million and 5 million. It is estimated that four out of five black people in France are of African immigrant origin, with the minority being chiefly of Caribbean ancestry. Some organizations, such as the Representative Council of France's Black Associations (, CRAN), have argued in favor of the introduction of data collection on minority groups but this has been resisted by other organizations and ruling politicians, often on the grounds that collecting such statistics goes against France's secular principles and harks back to Vichy-era identity documents. During the 2007 presidential election, however, Nicolas Sarkozy was polled on the issue and stated that he favoured the collection of data on ethnicity. Part of a parliamentary bill which would have permitted the collection of data for the purpose of measuring discrimination was rejected by the Conseil Constitutionnel in November 2007. == Notable people ==  In French politics   Afro-French or Kanak members of the French Parliament or government from overseas France  There have been dozens of Afro-Caribbean, Kanak, and Afro-French MPs representing overseas electoral districts at the French National Assembly or at the French Senate, and several government members. * Roger Bambuck, Minister of Youth and Sports from 1988 to 1991. * Aim√© C√©saire, mayor of Fort-de-France and deputy from Martinique for the PCF/Martinican Progressive Party. * Jean-Louis d'Anglebermes, Kanak politician from Caledonian Union. * F√©lix √âbou√©, French Guianan-born colonial administrator and Free French leader. * Laura Flessel-Colovic, she became the Sport Minister in 2017. * Serge Letchimy, deputy for Martinique Socialist Party, Letchimy is also of partial Tamil descent. * Gaston Monnerville, politician and lawyer, he was the president of the Senate from 1958 to 1968. * Maurice Ponga, New Caledonian politician who served as Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Overseas constituency from 2009 to 2019. * Christiane Taubira, deputy from French Guiana, was the first black candidate to a French presidential election, in 2002.

Ankuri Mahadev is a Hindu temple located in Mahadeva in the Saptari District of Nepal. The place has Shiva Linga in the main temple, as well as Goddess Parvati and God Hanuman in other temples. The Shiva Linga has a dent of size of fist on the top. It is said that the place was a crematorium long ago and was an isolated place. Some cowherds from nearby villages used to go there. They brought it several times to their home, but the Shiva Ling used to return to its own place. It is also said that whoever tried to take the Shiva Linga their home, misery befell upon them and a member of their family fell sick or died. Later the master of the cowherds heard about these and built a temple for Shiva Linga on the same place. It is a well known site of pilgrimage for Lord Shiva devotees and every year there are big fairs on festivals like Shivaratri and Anant Chaturdashi. It is a holy place to perform sacred yajna.

The ring doesn‚Äôt mean a thing: Molecular data suggests a new taxonomy for two Pacific species of sea hares (Mollusca, Opisthobranchia, Aplysiidae). Pacific Science 67: 283‚Äì294. including the Mediterranean Sea where first seen in 2002 and likely self-established due to increasing temperatures.Vald√©s, Alexander, Crocetta, Yoke≈ü, Giacobbe, Poursanidis, Zenetos, Cervera, Caballer, Galil, and Schembri (2013). The origin and dispersal pathway of the spotted sea hare Aplysia dactylomela (Mollusca: Opisthobranchia) in the Mediterranean Sea. Aquatic Invasions 8(4): 427‚Äì436. Based on genetic evidence, the population from the Indo-Pacific region is now recognized as a separate species, A. argus. This restricts the true A. dactylomela to the Atlantic Ocean region, including the Caribbean and Mediterranean. The appearance of the two species is very similar, although A. argus is more variable in colour and pattern. ==Description== The large black rings are very apparent on this juvenile spotted sea hare Aplysia dactylomela taken out of water The colour of the spotted sea hare is very variable, from pale gray to green, to dark brown. There are almost always large black rings on the mantle. The maximum recorded length is 410 mm.Welch J. J. (2010). \\"The \\"Island Rule\\" and Deep-Sea Gastropods: Re-Examining the Evidence\\". PLoS ONE 5(1): e8776. . ==Habitat== Aplysia dactylomela is commonly found in shallow waters, tide pools and rocky and sandy substrates, they also will be found feeding in beds of sea grass. During the day they will mostly hide under large rocks and in crevices. They usually stay in relatively shallow water, but they have been found as deep as 40 m.Sterrer, Wolfgang. 1986. Marine Fauna and Flora of Bermuda. A Wiley-Interscience Publication. Minimum recorded depth is 0 m. Maximum recorded depth is 3 m. ==Human use== The right giant neuron of Aplysia dactylomela, which is found in the abdominal ganglion, is similar to that of vertebrates, meaning it is ideal for the study of electrophysiology, as well as conditioned-response studies. These neurons have been found to be invaluable in neurological research; the reason for this is that long-lasting effects in neuronal behavior can be detected.Corning, W., J. Dyal. 1973. Invertebrate Learning: Volume 2. New York: Plenum Press. ==Behaviour== The Aplysia dactylomela is capable of swimming and crawling. It accomplishes the former by creating a funnel using the parapodia folded forward and downwards; this action pulls in water. It then pushes the water out from behind the animal by pressing the anterior parts of the parapodia together, thus forward motion is achieved. The sea hare's usual mode of propulsion is crawling; it crawls by lifting the front end of the foot, stretching it forward then placing it on the ground in front, creating an arching pattern; the remainder of the body follows this arching pattern until the tail is reached.http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Aplysia_dactylomela.html == Defense == Like the octopus, the Aplysia dactylomela squirts purple ink if it is disturbed; this ink is an irritant that causes 'altered behaviour' in other invertebrates and fish.Carefoot, T.H, S.C. Pennings, Jean Paul Danko. 1999. A test of novel function(s) for the ink of sea hares. J. Exp. Mar. Bio. Ecol. 234 (2):185. Their leathery skin contains toxins which make this sea hare practically inedible to most predators.http://www.thecephalopodpage.org/MarineInvertebrateZoology/Aplysiadactylomela.html ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Bebbington A.

It was published in 1967. The book's plot centers on a black seventeen-year-old man named Alfred Brooks, a high school dropout living with Aunt Pearl and her three daughters in Harlem, New York City. He begins training at a boxing club as an alternative to drugs and gang membership. The novel follows Alfred as his friend James is arrested after robbing the grocery store where Alfred works, and his confrontations with Major, the leader of the local gang, who is responsible for James' drug addiction. Alfred, through a series of related events, learns that life is about more than fighting and winning; it is about being a contender. ==Plot synopsisCharacters== * Alfred Brooks is a 17-year-old African American male and the protagonist of the novel. He recently dropped out of high school and appears to be indecisive about the direction of his life. Orphaned at a young age, he lives in Harlem with his Aunt Pearl and his three cousins. In the first few chapters, Alfred appears shy and uncertain about his future. After learning that his best friend James has chosen a destructive path, Alfred decides to join Donatelli's Gym and train as an amateur boxer. Throughout the course of the novel, readers see a timid adolescent transcend into a confident, strong character who appears to have found a purpose in life. By the end of the novel, after having won his first two matches, and putting up a good show in his third match, Mr. Donatelli suggests that Alfred retire from boxing because he lacks the \\"killer instinct\\" needed to be a prize-winning fighter, but suggests that Alfred take his newfound strength and determination and apply it to a new endeavor. Alfred does retire after one final match which he loses, but in which he earns everyone's respect, including that of his opponent. Before the novel closes, Alfred has evolved into a mature, selfless adolescent who seems destined to apply what he learned from being a disciplined boxer to having a bright future all the while trying to save his best friend from continuing to be self- destructive. * Aunt Pearl takes in her nephew Alfred after he is orphaned at an early age. She is a devoted, hard-working, and loving woman as evidenced by the many sacrifices she makes not only for her own three children but for Alfred as well. She too has experienced difficulties in life, some of which she divulges to Alfred. Although there are times that her questions seem obtrusive to Alfred, he realizes that she truly has a vested interest in her nephew, and that she does care about his well-being. * Major is the antagonist of the novel. He is described as a \\"devil in disguise\\". Major is responsible for leading Alfred's best friend James down a path of crime, drugs, and alcohol. He lives a life of crime and orchestrated a robbery at the Epsteins' grocery store, Alfred's place of employment. He is the leader of a group that has some other characters in it by the names of Hollis and Sonny. These three team up against Alfred and beat him up in the first chapter. * James is Alfred's best friend and also a high school dropout. While James only appears minimally, we learn a great deal about him from Alfred's thoughts and what others say about him. He is a weak character, as compared to Alfred. After James robs the grocery store Alfred works at, Epstein's, Alfred finds him hiding from the police in their childhood hiding spot in the park. Alfred convinces James that he needs to take responsibility for his recent criminal behavior by entering rehab and accepting his impending future jail sentence. Alfred tells him that no matter what, he will stay by the side of his \\"old\\" friend. * Mr. Donatelli, affectionately called Donatelli by most of the novel's characters, is owner and manager of Donatelli's Gym. He becomes Alfred's savior by hinting at Alfred's potential to become a respected boxer while encouraging his new prot√©g√© to make decisions wisely and to act decisively. Although he comes across as harsh, he is a man who has gained respect as a disciplined trainer who cares about the well being of his students both mentally and physically, in and out of the ring. ==Themes== Themes explored in this novel include issues of socio-economic stance, racism, and fighting for your goals and what you believe in. It also focuses on positive character development and peer pressure. ==Tagline== Before you can be a champion, you have to be a contender.

Due to a non- linear self-interaction, it has a variable effective mass which is an increasing function of the ambient energy density‚Äîas a result, the range of the force mediated by the particle is predicted to be very small in regions of high density (for example on Earth, where it is less than 1mm) but much larger in low-density intergalactic regions: out in the cosmos chameleon models permit a range of up to several thousand parsecs. As a result of this variable mass, the hypothetical fifth force mediated by the chameleon is able to evade current constraints on equivalence principle violation derived from terrestrial experiments even if it couples to matter with a strength equal or greater than that of gravity. Although this property would allow the chameleon to drive the currently observed acceleration of the universe's expansion, it also makes it very difficult to test for experimentally. ==Hypothetical properties== Chameleon particles were proposed in 2003 by Khoury and Weltman. In most theories, chameleons have a mass that scales as some power of the local energy density: m_\\\\text{eff} \\\\sim \\\\rho^\\\\alpha, where \\\\alpha \\\\simeq 1. Chameleons also couple to photons, allowing photons and chameleons to oscillate between each other in the presence of an external magnetic field. Chameleons can be confined in hollow containers because their mass increases rapidly as they penetrate the container wall, causing them to reflect. One strategy to search experimentally for chameleons is to direct photons into a cavity, confining the chameleons produced, and then to switch off the light source. Chameleons would be indicated by the presence of an afterglow as they decay back into photons. ==Experimental searches== A number of experiments have attempted to detect chameleons along with axions. The GammeV experimentGammeV experiment at Fermilab is a search for axions, but has been used to look for chameleons too. It consists of a cylindrical chamber inserted in a 5 T magnetic field. The ends of the chamber are glass windows, allowing light from a laser to enter and afterglow to exit. GammeV set the limited coupling to photons in 2009. CHASE (CHameleon Afterglow SEarch) results published in November 2010, improve the limits on mass by 2 orders of magnitude and 5 orders for photon coupling. A 2014 neutron mirror measurement excluded chameleon field for values of the coupling constant \\\\beta > 5.8 \\\\times 10^8, where the effective potential of the chameleon quanta is written as V_{\\\\text{eff}}=V(\\\\Phi)+e^{\\\\beta \\\\Phi/M'_\\\\text{P}} \\\\rho, \\\\rho being the mass density of the environment, V(\\\\Phi) the chameleon potential and M'_\\\\text{P} the reduced Planck mass.

Her eclectic interests ranged from fly fishing in Kashmir, about which she wrote a book, to running her own wildlife refuge in Victoria. ==Biography== Robin Levett was born Robin Walker, the daughter of Major Geoffrey and his wife Aileen (Whiting) Walker in Sorrento, Victoria. As a girl, she attended the prestigious Hermitage School, from which she was expelled after she tried to burn it down. She later attended Toorak College in Mount Eliza, Victoria, which seemed to suit her better. She excelled, was named head girl and won the top prize in 1943. She subsequently studied at the National Gallery School, where she was awarded a coveted travelling scholarship. Following her graduation, the gifted and hyperactive Australian was unable to use her travelling scholarship because of World War II raging; instead she enlisted with the Navy. Posted to a quiet billeting in Albert Park, Victoria, young Walker resigned. She next signed on with the Women's Auxiliary Service, Burma (Wasbees, the Australian equivalent of the WAVES), which sent her to Rangoon. Following the war, Walker moved to England for a brief time before returning to Australia to work for British Signals Intelligence.Robin Levett, AusLit, the Australian Literature Resource, auslit.edu.au Back in Australia, she married Geoffrey Levett, a successful businessman who produced his own line of frozen vegetables. His new wife went to work in the business, gaining her pilot's licence so she could fly her husband to meetings across the continent.Flying and Other Experiences, Robin Levett, Hudson Publishing, Newstead, Victoria, Australia. Not content with half-measures, the new Mrs Levett gained a commercial pilot's licence, and then learned how to parachute - presumably in case her pilot's skills failed. Subsequently, she flew an air race around Victoria. In the early 1960s the couple found a new avocation. They leased a filly named Never on Sunday. The horse turned out to be a winner, and soon they were breeding racehorses as well as racing them. They took up the Lyndhurst Lodge stud farm in Cranbourne, Victoria, and later also had the Willowmavin stud farm in Kilmore, before finally settling on Willowmavin. The venture was a success. In 1966 the Levetts won the Victoria Derby with their horse Khalifa; in the following year Khalifa won the VRC St Leger. The couple also won the Perth and Brisbane Cups and countless lesser races. Their best finish in the Melbourne Cup was third. The Levetts co-owned the horse Buoyant Bird with former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke.\\"Racing's 'first lady' broke mould\\", The Age (Melbourne), 15 August 2008 Robin Levett served for years on the committee of the famous Kilmore Turf Club, and as president from 1989 to 1994, the only woman ever elected president of a grade one Australian turf club. Despite her consuming involvement in horseracing and breeding she found time to open a wildlife reserve at Willowmavin, where she included rescued animals into everyday life. \\"Guests in the committee room at Flemington would be bemused\\", said the Australian newspaper The Age in its obituary of the racing legend, \\"when she would pull a young wombat from a large shoulder bag and feed it from a bottle.\\" Following the death of her husband Geoffrey Levett in 1990, Robin Levett was forced to close Willowmavin stud farm and its wildlife refuge. She took up writing to fill the void.Books by Robin Levett, Hudson Publishing, Newstead, Victoria, Australia. Her first and most successful book, a novel entitled The Girls, was based on her experience growing up the third of three daughters of a military man. The book twice hit the bestseller lists in Australia, and led to her meeting her publisher - and second husband - Nick Hudson, whom she eventually married at age 77 (he was 70).Nick Hudson's company, Hudson Publishing, published seven of Robin Levett's books. Levett showed the same sure touch in her writing as she did in horsebreeding. Her novella entitled The Rangoon Incident, based loosely on her experiences in Burma, began with this beguiling and macabre sentence: \\"I was at a murder once.\\" The book went on to recount an incident in Rangoon in which a military officer sitting next to Levett in the officers' club was shot in the head and died in Levett's lap, a case of mistaken identity by a jealous husband.\\"First Lady of Racing also a Gifted Author\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, 16 August 2008. \\"I really enjoyed working with her immensely\\", recalled her publisher husband Hudson. \\"This was strange, because we really had very little in common. She had made a career in the racing industry, running two stud farms, owning a string of successful racehorses, becoming president of the Kilmore Turf Club and being named First Lady of Australian Racing, while I had never been near an Australian racetrack and regarded the industry and its adherents with contempt. Anyway, the long and the short of it was that we started living together, first at weekends and then full time.\\"Forebears and Cousins, Nick Hudson, Hudson Newstead. Continuing to write under the Levett name, the racing enthusiast turned out a second book about horseracing called Bloodstock. The Sydney Morning Herald called it the best book ever written about horseracing in Australia. For many years Levett had travelled to Kashmir, initially to fly fish, a hobby she had taken up from her father.One of Levett's favourite locales was London Lakes, a fly fishing lodge in Tasmania. Her other favourite locale was a bit further afield: the mountains of Kashmir, with their trout-filled rivers. Kashmir became one of the loves of her life, not simply the fishing but the people, the customs and the landscape. Recalled her publisher husband: \\"Visiting Kashmir with her made me understand what it's like to be the Duke of Edinburgh, constantly bathing in his wife's glory. Robin has friends at all social levels.\\" \\"One day during our last trip,\\" Hudson recalled of the couple's last journey to Kashmir, \\"we attended a European-style lunch party with the cream of the Kashmiri political elite, including an ex-Chief Minister (the equivalent of a State Premier), and then went on to sit on the floor in the home of a boatman who paddles a shikara on the Dal Lake, being offered traditional Kashmiri hospitality. What did our hosts have in common? They were both personal friends of Robin's.\\"Forebears and Cousins. Nick Hudson, Hudson Newstead. Dal Lake, Kashmir, beloved by Australian author Robin Levett Levett devoted a book to her experiences in Kashmir, which she visited every year since 1972 (including the years of intense civil war), calling it The Shikari. Its twin subjects were an unlikely pairing: the wonders of fly fishing and the horrors of civil war. Critics were enraptured with the work, some calling it Levett's finest. As for Levett, she continued to travel to Kashmir each year, and supported several Kashmiri families. Levett continued to travel abroad and across Australia in her last years, and visited her beloved Kilmore Turf Club at every opportunity. After being named \\"The First Lady of Australian Racing\\" in the 1990s, she was a popular hostess and guest at race-related events. Following Levett's death on 14 August 2008, from pneumonia, there was a send- off at the Kilmore Turf Club in her honour. The Kilmore track now runs a Robin Levett Memorial race in honour of the pilot, parachutist, traveller, writer and naturelover. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * The Shikari: A Personal Account of the Tragedy of Kashmir, Robin Levett, Hudson Publishing, Newstead, Victoria, Australia, 1997, * Alice and Sin, Robin Levett, Hudson Publishing, Newstead, Victoria, Australia, 1998, * Bloodstock, Robin Levett, Hudson Publishing, Newstead, Victoria, Australia, 1999, Category:1925 births Category:2008 deaths Category:20th-century Australian novelists Category:Australian travel writers Category:Australian women novelists Category:People from Victoria (Australia) Category:Australian racehorse owners and breeders Category:Women travel writers Category:20th-century Australian women writers ","title":"Robin Levett"},{"id":"20212959","text":"Magda Bogin is a New York-based writer and literary translator who has produced a body of work that straddles fiction, poetry, opera and non-fiction.

The newspaper had a quarterly print run of 10,000, distributed free around the city of Manchester until August 2010, and runs a regularly updated website. The paper is openly political and critical of local councils and politicians, big business and property developers, privatisation of public space, public bodies and Greater Manchester Police. MULE claims to be committed to social, economic and environmental justice and social change. MULE‚Ä≤s mission is to reach out to a wide-ranging cross-section of society, producing an accessible and tabloid style paper, which aims to address issues the mainstream local media neglect via investigative journalism. It focuses on a number of areas its members consider important, particularly local democracy, corporate power and big business in Manchester, local public bodies and quangos, property developers and regeneration, right-wing extremism and racism (particularly the British National Party and English Defence League), deportation and detention of migrants, community campaigns, and local cultural events. It has been critical of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition and has actively reported on local groups fighting the government's austerity drive and cuts to public services. MULE‚Ä≤s website also provides an online diary (which includes all of Manchester City Council's public meetings) for local groups to post events on. On the website the collective encourage new writers to get involved and for local people to send in their stories. == Origins == The first pilot print issue came out in 2006. The idea for the project was born out of the now closed Basement social centre in Manchester.UK Social Centres Network The founders wrote that 'A spectre now haunts the world: a global commercial media system dominated by a small number of huge corporations. It is a system that works to advance the cause of the global market and promote commercial values, while denigrating journalism and culture not conducive to the immediate bottom line or long-run corporate interests. Ten years ago in the UK, the media was spread across 50 companies. Now its down to four conglomerates. The few major media multinationals have unprecedented power, owning press and television, book publishing, film production, and databases. The British government has recently announced a relaxation of the media rules allowing conglomerates to swallow even more of the industry.'About MULE ‚Äî MULE The original paper was designed as a national paper with local sections for different cities. It was relaunched in 2008 as a local Manchester-focused project. In 2010 the group became incorporated as Mule Media Ltd and is part of the Co-ops UK network. == Contributors == The writers and researchers for MULE have varying levels of journalistic experience, from first-time writers to professional journalists. At present MULE is entirely volunteer-run with no paid staff in the core group of six individuals. The MULE collective however has expressed its desire to pay its core members. MULE provides occasional workshops and media training for new writers and contributors. == Funding == MULE is funded by various foundations and funding bodies, and is trying to diversify its income through individual donations, subscriptions, merchandise and advertising. == Collective editing == MULE is unusual in that it practices a collective editing process. This means that instead of having one editor who makes major decisions alone, the approval of sub-editors and management collective members is required.

It has many other forms in some Italian dialects like chioca, chiochiera, ci√≤cero or sci√≤scio in Neapolitan language. The terms ciociari and Ciociaria have a lexical similarity to the noun ciocia, so many historians thought they have their root word in local footwear's name, so ciociari would mean 'people who wear ciocie'. Dubarry A., Le brigandage en Italie depuis les temps les plus recul√©s jusqu'√† nos jours, Plon & Cie, Paris 1875, pp. 269-286.

In Basilicata, Campania, Calabria, Gargano, Etna, Kosovo and North Macedonia similar footwears are reported as well. In the traditional form, ciocie were made of large soles in leather and straps (strenghe or curiole) with which the leg was tied from the ankle to the knee.

Photo taken in late August. bannock, as made on Orkney, Scotland Hordeum vulgare subsp. hexastichum - MHNT Bere, pronounced \\"bear,\\" is a six-row barley currently cultivated mainly on 5-15 hectares of land in Orkney, Scotland. It is also grown in Shetland, Caithness and on a very small scale by a few crofters on some of the Western Isles, i.e. North Uist, Benbecula, South Uist, Islay and Barra. It is probably Britain's oldest cereal in continuous commercial cultivation. Bere is a landrace adapted to growing on soils of a low pH and to a short growing season with long hours of daylight, as found in the high latitudes of northern Scotland. It is sown in the spring and harvested in the summer. Because of its very rapid growth rate it is sown late but is often the first crop to be harvested. It is known locally as \\"the 90-day barley.\\" ==Etymology== Originally bere or beir or bear was a generic Lowland Scots word for barley of any kind, and was used throughout the country. Now it is used mainly in the north of Scotland.Smout, T.C. (1972) A History of the Scottish People 1560-1830 p114 It often referred to barley of a lower yield, and the phrase \\"bear meal marriage\\" usually meant one that would not bring much wealth with it. Talking of the wide variety of crops in England, and crop rotation, Professor T.C. Smout writes: \\"In Scotland, there is no evidence of such variation possibly because the range of crops was so much smaller ‚Äî often only oats or bear (a primitive form of barley)\\". ==History== Bere is a very old grain that may have been brought to Britain by Vikings in the 8th century or even from an earlier wave of settlement. In its early days it was also called \\"bygge\\" or \\"big,\\" probably originating from bygg, the Old Norse term for barley. It became well-adapted to the far north of Britain as successive generations of farmers grew it, selecting each year's seeds from the best plants of the previous year. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, bere was an important crop in the Highlands and Islands region of Scotland, providing grain for milling and malting and straw for thatching and animal bedding. It was also exported from Orkney and other ports in Scotland to Northern Europe. The advent of higher-yielding barley varieties led to a deep decline in bere growing during the 19th and 20th centuries. It survives in cultivation today thanks to Barony Mills, a 19th- century watermill, which purchases the grain to produce beremeal which is used locally in bread, biscuits, and the traditional beremeal bannock. ==Research== The Agronomy Institute at Orkney College UHI in Scotland has had a research programme on Bere since 2002. The programme is aimed at developing new markets for the crop and developing best practices for growing it more easily and with increased yield. As a result of this research, several new markets (whisky, beer and biscuits) have been developed for Orkney Bere. The crop is also being grown on the island of Islay, for whisky production by Bruichladdich Distillery. Research at the James Hutton Institute has shown that bere is particularly able to grow in alkaline soils with low metal micronutrients. Bere flour has quite high levels of folate. ==Alcoholic beverages== Bere has a long history of use in making alcoholic beverages. Historical accounts from the 15th century onward show that Orkney produced large amounts of malt and beer, most of it probably from bere. An ancient tradition of making bere-based homebrew survives until this day on the island. During the 19th century, the Campbeltown distilleries used large quantities of bere in making Scotch whisky. In the early 21st century some distillers began experimenting again with bere, and in 2006, the UK's most northern brewery released a bere-based microbrew. ==References External links == * Orkney College UHI Bere Research * The Scotsman article on beremeal bannocks et al. * Orkney Bere Biscuits web site * A Brief History of Barley Foods Category:Barley Category:Biota of Orkney Category:Agriculture in Scotland Category:Food plant cultivars Category:Hordeum Category:Cereals in the United Kingdom ","title":"Bere (grain)"},{"id":"20213268","text":"Jules Thiry (1898-1931) was a Belgian water polo player who competed in the 1924 Summer Olympics.

The awards are in honor of David Brower and his work mentoring emerging environmental leaders.Sarah von Schagen, The Youth Shall Set You Free, October 27, 2006 In addition to a $3,000 cash award and an all expenses paid trip to the San Francisco Bay Area to attend the awards ceremony, winners receive ongoing support and mentoring from Earth Island Institute staff and other environmental leaders. North American activist leaders ages 13 to 22 are eligible to apply. Projects must have a measurable environmental and social impact and have demonstrated significant progress by the application deadline.NEA, Grants and Awards: Brower Youth Awards, The awards ceremony is held each fall in the San Francisco Bay area, most recently at the Herbst Theatre in San Francisco. ==Criteria== Outstanding youth leadership and project impact \\"Outstanding leadership\\" means that the recipient played a major leadership role in creating, organizing and implementing their project or campaign. The juries are looking for the person with the vision, motivation, and leadership skills that made the project or campaign work. Impact is gauged by the extent to which efforts benefited the environment and community in terms of measurable results (e.g. acres of wildlife habitat protected or restored, number of people engaged in social issues because of the project, numbers of children no longer exposed to toxins, etc.), as well as movement-building and raising awareness. Conservation CONSERVATION is work to eliminate or decrease use of natural resources and negative impacts on ecosystems and communities. For example: A campaign that plays a substantial role in organizing a local community to pass a public transportation initiative A project that significantly reduces energy use on a school campus by requiring passive solar design and the use of efficient appliances in all school facilities. \\"Conserve the golden eggs carefully. Preserve the goose or there will be no more golden eggs. If you've already damaged the goose, get going on Restoration.\\" ~ David R. Brower Preservation PRESERVATION is work to protect ecosystems, species, indigenous cultures and other irreplaceable elements of the world's natural heritage. For example: A project that secures protected nesting area for an endangered songbird A campaign that plays a substantial role in blocking development of Native sacred sites via ongoing peaceful civil disobedience (demonstrations, street theater, marches) Restoration RESTORATION is work to re-establish the healthy functioning of ecosystems; parts of ecosystems; and human communities that manage ecosystems. For example: A project that reclaims an abandoned urban lot, creates an organic garden. A campaign that works to eliminate carbon emissions and mitigates the impacts of global warming. ==Selection process== The Brower Youth Award recipients are selected by an independent panel of judges, including activists, educators, journalists, and environmental advocates.

Walton is best known for voicing Rhino the hamster in the 2008 animated film Bolt. ==Early life== Mark Walton was born on October 24, 1968 in Salt Lake City, Utah, the oldest of seven children. Although he is not a professional actor, Walton said in an interview, \\"I liked acting in high school and college. I enjoyed it. I think at some point I decided that if I was really going to be a professional actor that it would take at least everything that I would have emotionally or physically and I knew that I really wanted to pursue art.\\" He graduated from Utah State University in 1998 with a degree in illustration. ==Career== Mark Walton started at Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida as a story and animation intern in 1995. After performing as a show artist for The Hunchback of Notre Dame Musical Discovery Adventure North American Mall Tour in 1996, he transferred to Walt Disney Feature Animation in Burbank, CA. (now known as Walt Disney Animation Studios) in 1997 to work on his first feature, Tarzan as a storyboard artist. While at Disney, from the late 1990s and throughout the 2000s, he did storyboards for The Emperor's New Groove, The Little Matchstick Girl, Home on the Range, Chicken Little, Meet the Robinsons, and Gnomeo and Juliet, as well as storyboarding and developing the unproduced films Wild Life, My Peoples, Rapunzel and Rapunzel Unbraided, Joe Jump, and King of the Elves. Also, while at Disney, he provided the voices for Barry & Bob the Longhorns in Home on the Range (2004), Goosey Loosey for the computer- animated film Chicken Little and its video game (2005), and for Rhino the hamster in Bolt (2008) for which he was nominated for an Annie Award for Voice Acting in a Feature Production, and the short film spin-off Super Rhino.

He was a leading figure in the establishment of a number of lunatic asylums in the colonies of New South Wales and Victoria, and participated in inquests and reviews of asylums throughout the colonies. == Early career == Manning studied at St George's Hospital, London (M.R.C.S., L.S.A., 1860) and the University of St Andrews (M.D., 1862). After joining the navy as a surgeon he saw active service in New Zealand on board . The ship took part in the New Zealand Wars in New Zealand and Manning was present at the savage fighting at Gate Pa, where most of the officers in the naval brigade were either killed or wounded. == Tarban Creek == On a visit to Sydney in 1867 Manning was invited by Henry Parkes to become medical superintendent of the Tarban Creek Lunatic Asylum. Before accepting, Manning went overseas and studied methods of patient care and administration of asylums; on his return to Sydney he submitted a notable report. He was appointed to Tarban Creek on 15 October 1868 and immediately reported on the isolation of patients from their relations in accommodation best described as 'prison-like and gloomy', the inadequate facilities for their gainful employment and recreation and the monotonous diets deficient in both quantity and quality. In January 1869 the asylum's name was changed to the Hospital for the Insane, Gladesville, wherein patients were to receive treatment rather than be confined in a 'cemetery for diseased intellects'. By 1879 radical changes in patient care and accommodation had been made. Gladesville was extended and modernised and an asylum for imbeciles set up in Newcastle and a temporary asylum at Cooma. Manning minimised the use of restraint and provided for patient activities. Manning also established a vineyard at Tarban Creek in 1870. == Inspector General == On 1 July 1876 Manning was appointed Inspector General of the Insane with responsibility for all mental institutions except the Parramatta asylum for criminals. After much agitation by Manning, new hospitals were opened at Callan Park and Goulburn, and additions made to the Darlinghurst reception house. Manning believed that staff should be competent and encouraged in-service training for nurses and attendants. He often criticised the accommodation and low wages. He supported the creation of the Australasian Trained Nurses' Association and in 1899‚Äì1902 was its first president. == Other duties == Manning had become a trustee of Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in 1873 and was a member of the New South Wales branch of the British Medical Association. In 1876, he was elected to the Royal Society of New South Wales and in 1883‚Äì84 was chairman of its medical section. In 1883‚Äì96 he was an examiner and in 1886‚Äì88 the first lecturer in psychological medicine at the University of Sydney. In 1882 he had been appointed to the Board of Health and in 1889‚Äì92 was medical advisor to the government, president of the Board of Health and health and emigration officer for Port Jackson. He was prominent in the proceedings of the second (1889) and third (1892) sessions of the Intercolonial Medical Congress of Australasia. Manning had served on an inquiry into the Hospital for the Insane at New Norfolk, Tasmania, in 1884 and on another at the Bay View Lunatic Asylum in 1894. In 1895 he served on the Royal Commission on the notorious poisoner, George Dean. He agreed with Dr P. S. Jones that the evidence was compatible with attempted suicide and secured Dean's release. == Final years == On 12 February 1898, ill health forced Manning to retire as Inspector General. In February 1899, he was appointed to the Royal Commission on public charities. In 1901 he became a trustee of the National Art Gallery of New South Wales. Unmarried, he died from a stomach ulcer on 18 June 1903 at his rooms in Phillip Street, and at his request was buried in the cemetery at Gladesville Mental Hospital. His grave can still be seen in a grove adjacent to Victoria Road. Some of his papers are in the National Library of Australia.

It serves as a connector between NY 9N and NY 22 in Crown Point and the Lake Champlain Bridge, by which the highway enters Vermont and becomes Vermont Route 17 (VT 17). NY 185, named Bridge Road, passes through Crown Point State Historic Site and runs the entire length of Crown Point, a peninsula protruding into Lake Champlain. NY 185 was assigned on April 4, 2008, as a signed replacement for New York State Route 910L, an unsigned reference route. It is the third signed designation that Bridge Road has carried, preceded by New York State Route 347 (during the early 1930s) and NY 8 (1930s to the 1960s). NY 185 originally connected to the Champlain Bridge on its east end; however, that structure was closed and demolished in late 2009. Its replacement opened to traffic in November 2011. ==Route description== NY 185 heading through rural Crown Point. NY 185 begins at an intersection with NY 9N and NY 22 in Crown Point. The route progresses eastward as a two-lane highway named Bridge Road. Heading away from the western terminus, there is a fork in the road: to the left is NY 185, and to the right is a road to a housing development. Most of NY 185 runs along the lowlands around Lake Champlain, making curves at intersections, and heading on relatively flat elevations. As the highway approaches the lake, it makes a curve to the north. There, it intersects with County Route 48 (Lake Road) and begins to follow the lake shore. The highway passes to the east of the Crown Point State Historic Site and its campground before ascending up the approach to the Lake Champlain Bridge. After making a final curve to the northeast, NY 185 begins to cross Lake Champlain by way of the bridge. The route ends at the Vermont state line at the bridge's midpoint, and the roadway continues into Vermont as VT 17. ==History== The former temporary ferry landing of NY 185 in Crown Point as a ferry approaches. The Champlain Bridge was built in 1929, connecting Crown Point in New York to Chimney Point in Vermont. A short connector highway between the bridge‚Äîwhich connected to VT 17 in Vermont‚Äîand NY 22 in Crown Point, named Bridge Road, was originally designated as NY 347 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. NY 347 became part of an extended NY 8 . NY 8 was truncated south to Hague , eliminating a lengthy overlap with NY 22 and NY 9N. Its former routing along Bridge Road became NY 903, an unsigned reference route. The NY 903 designation was later replaced with NY 910L when a new numbering system for reference routes was adopted by the New York State Department of Transportation, and NY 910L itself was redesignated and signed as NY 185 on April 4, 2008. On October 16, 2009, the Champlain Bridge was closed to traffic due to structural concerns. The bridge was demolished on December 28, 2009, as a result of those concerns, temporarily reducing NY 185 in purpose to a spur route linking NY 9N and NY 22 to Crown Point. Its replacement, the Lake Champlain Bridge, opened to traffic on November 7, 2011. ==Major intersectionsSee also== * ==References 185 Category:Transportation in Essex County, New York ","title":"New York State Route 185"},{"id":"20213547","text":"The Lower Silesian Regional Assembly () is the regional legislature of the Voivodeship of Lower Silesia in Poland.

In 1925 they were absorbed by the Deutsche Reichsbahn as DRG Class 94.0 into their renumbering plan. These engines were bought specifically for the inclines between Pirmasens and Bieberm√ºhle. They could reach a speed of 40 km/h on the level with a 1,510 tonne train load, and 30 km/h on an incline of 2%. Overall, however, they were unable to match the power of locomotives from Prussia or Saxony and were retired by 1926. The locomotive which was formerly no. 307 in the Palatinate Railway (DRG No. 94 002) was disposed of to the Eschweiler Mining Union and employed at the Baesweiler coal mine, where it was given the name of Carl Alexander and the number 3; it remained in service there until 1974. Today it is displayed at the Neustadt/Weinstrasse Railway Museum in Neustadt an der Weinstrasse, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. == See also == * Royal Bavarian State Railways * Palatinate Railway * List of Bavarian locomotives and railbuses * List of Palatine locomotives and railbuses == References == * Category:0-10-0T locomotives T 5 Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1907 Category:Krauss locomotives Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Germany ","title":"Palatine T 5"},{"id":"20213570","text":" USS Wapello (YN-56), later YNT-24, was a United States Navy net tender in commission from 1941 to 1946. Wapello was completed as the commercial tug R. K. Evans in April 1941 by the Gulfport Boiler and Welding Works at Port Arthur, Texas, for the General Motors Corporation of Cleveland, Ohio. Acquired by the U.S. Navy for service as a net tender, renamed USS Wapello, and designated YN-56, she was placed in service on 9 June 1941. On 15 June 1941, Wapello arrived at the Naval Station Key West at Key West, Florida, for conversion and fitting-out. On 26 June 1941, she departed for Cuba in company with fleet tug USS Umpqua (AT-25) and arrived at Guantanamo Bay. Cuba, on 29 June 1941. Escorted by cargo ship USS Vega (AK-17) from Guantanamo Bay to San Diego, California, and by fleet oiler USS Ramapo (AO-12) from the United States West Coast to the Hawaiian Islands, Wapello arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 27 August 1941. Attached to the 14th Naval District, Wapello tended harbor nets through the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. She remained at Pearl Harbor for the duration of hostilities, engaged in unglamorous but vital tasks. She was reclassified as a tug-class net tender, YNT-24, on 7 April 1942. With the end of the war in the Pacific on 15 August 1945, the need for Wapellos services decreased rapidly, and she was declared surplus. Placed out of service at Bremerton, Washington, on 23 October 1946 and struck from the Navy List on 21 November 1946, Wapello was turned over to the War Shipping Administration for disposal on 3 May 1947. She entered commercial service as Anna Coppedge. In succeeding years her name changed several times, to Colorado Point, Creole Firme, Island No. 1, and Gorgona II. At the time of the name change to Island No. 1, she was reflagged as a Panamanian vessel. Her commercial career ended when she was crushed by a merchant ship in a lock of the Panama Canal; she was towed to Miraflores Lake after the accident and sank there. ==References== * *NavSource Online: Service Ship Photo Archive YN-56 / YNt-24 Wapello Category:Net tenders of the United States Navy Category:Tugs of the United States Navy Category:Ships built in Port Arthur, Texas Category:1941 ships Category:World War II auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Ships present during the attack on Pearl Harbor ","title":"USS Wapello (YN-56)"},{"id":"20213586","text":"Boombox (subtitled The Remix Album 2000‚Äì2008) is a remix album by Australian pop singer Kylie Minogue.

Goes to College (retitled The Gertrude Berg Show starting with episode 14) is a 26-episode American sitcom which aired on CBS from October 4, 1961, to April 5, 1962. The series starred Emmy Award-winning actress Gertrude Berg. ==Synopsis== Having previously starred in the long-running radio and television series The Goldbergs, Gertrude Berg returned to episodic television as Sarah Green, a 62-year-old widow who enters college. The character of Sarah Green (very similar to \\"Molly Goldberg\\") had been previously introduced to viewers as \\"Aunt Sarah\\" on Jackie Cooper's Hennesey sitcom on CBS earlier in 1961. English actor Cedric Hardwicke played Professor Crayton, and popular character actress Mary Wickes portrayed landlady Winona Maxfield. Skip Ward was cast as fellow student Joe Caldwell, and Marion Ross appeared in five episodes as Berg's daughter, Susan Green. Aneta Corsaut (the future Helen Crump on The Andy Griffith Show) appeared in 13 episodes as Irma Howell, a professor's wife. Karyn Kupcinet played a young fellow student of Sarah Green. Her role is very small, and she is heard saying very little dialogue. The plot centers around Sarah Green, a widow in her early sixties, who decides to acquire higher education, matriculates in her hometown college and interacts with, among others, her Cambridge University exchange professor (Cedric Hardwicke) and next-door neighbor George Howell Paul Smith, a character analogous to Smith's Roy Norris from Fibber McGee and Molly, complete with a no-nonsense wife (Aneta Corsaut). The series aired during the 9:30 Eastern slot on Wednesdays, under the sponsorship of General Foods, following CBS's Checkmate. Mrs. G. Goes to College aired during the second half of ABC's Hawaiian Eye and NBC's Perry Como's Kraft Music Hall.1961-1962 American network television schedule Nielsen ratings were mediocre. After thirteen episodes, a midseason move from Wednesday to Thursday night, along with a title change designed to emphasize Berg's name, The Gertrude Berg Show, did not improve the Nielsen ratings for the remaining thirteen episodes. CBS abruptly cancelled the series in April 1962 without showing any repeats. Beginning on March 20, 2017, the series is being shown on get TV. From April 2018 the show began to air in the UK on Talking Pictures TV. ==Production notes== Mrs. G. Goes to College was released by Dick Powell's Four Star Television.Four Star Productions The series was produced by Hy Averback, the music was by Herschel Burke Gilbert. Co-star Cedric Hardwicke, in a 1962 TV Guide article that focused on his work in the series, and references him as \\"Sir Cedric,\\" is quoted as commenting, \\"If you're going to work in rubbish, you might as well get paid for it.\\"McNeil, Alex (1996).

When 21, Rheinhold sought success in the United States and became an import and export merchant, living in San Francisco (1874‚Äì1878), where he had the head office for his business, as well as in Hamburg, where he settled in 1879. The next year he married his childhood sweetheart Emma Levy from Cologne; she was to die in 1882, after only one-and-a-half years of marriage.Richter & Schmetzke, p. 90. Emma's death had a huge impact Rheinhold. He sold his successful business and moved to Berlin to study science and philosophy at the Friedrich-Wilhelms University. In 1886, he studied under the sculptors Ernst Herter and Max Kruse, before officially enrolling as a student at the Berlin Academy of Arts (1888‚Äì1892).Singer & Mannheimer, p. 399. He died, aged 47, in Berlin. ==Works== Rheinhold produced a series of notable works within a very short career span. These include: a group of reading monks (Lesende Monche), a tribute to Alfred Nobel (Dynamite in the Service of Mankind), a bust of socialist leader August Bebel and his most famous piece Am Wege (1896) a marble of \\"an unfortunate young woman with a child at her breast\\".Singer & Mannheimer, p. 399. His biggest bronze work was for Dynamit Nobel AG, a statue titled Dynamite in the Service of Man, which included a tall goddess, possibly representing Athena, with a foot over a prostrate man. The statue was melted down for use in the Second World War for armaments. Rheinhold was protective of his Jewish heritage, and was a strong influence in the Deutsch-Israelitischer Gemeindebund (an association of Jewish corporations). He sculpted Die K√§mpfer (\\"The Warriors\\") in protest against burgeoning anti-Semitism.Morgan & Moore His last work, of serpentine deities in a fountain (\\"Brunnengrotte mit zwei Wassergottheiten\\"), was exhibited close to his death in 1900.Schmetzke Today, Rheinhold is probably known for his Affe mit Sch√§del.

In the 19th century, Fields Point Farm, a park, developed as the major recreational area in the city until Roger Williams Park was created in 1871. Visitors came to the Point to visit Colonel Atwell's Clam House, Edgewood Beach, The Washington Park Yacht Club and Kerwin's Beach. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the US Maritime Commission selected Field's Point as a location for a shipyard as part of the Emergency Shipbuilding Program. Much of what had previously been there was sacrificed to wartime necessity. The yard was eventually taken over by the Walsh-Kaiser Company. In the 1950s, Providence started using Fields Point as a landfill, eventually connecting the Point with nearby Starve Goat Island. In the 1960s, entrepreneur, Melvin Berry started \\"bar, marina, swim club, amusement park, bowling alley, drive-in theatre, skating rink and a nightly Hawaiian dance show\\" in Fields Point. Circa the mid to late 1960s, Fields Point was also utilized as an operations base for high speed testing between Westerly and Boston of the Gas turbine Turbo Train, before acting as a train graveyard for the three trainsets after September 1976. In 1973, Johnson & Wales University established a facility in Fields Point, but by 2001, the university leased land to Save The Bay for an educational center. In late 2012 a three-turbine wind farm was installed at Fields Point to provide energy for the waste water treatment plant. ==See also== *Chemical Building, Fields Point Sewage Treatment Plant *Return Sludge Pumping Station, Fields Point Sewage Treatment Plant ==References== Category:Parks in Rhode Island Category:Geography of Providence, Rhode Island Category:Protected areas of Providence County, Rhode Island Category:Tourist attractions in Providence, Rhode Island ","title":"Fields Point"},{"id":"20213776","text":"Chief Wapello; \\"Wa-pel-la the Prince, Musquakee Chief\\", from History of the Indian Tribes of North America. Wapello (1787 ‚Äì March 15, 1842) was a Native American chief of the Meskwaki tribe. ==Early life== Wapello was born in 1787 at Prairie du Chien, Northwest Territory, in what is now the state of Wisconsin. Short and stout in physical stature, with a kindly visage, Wapello entertained friendly relations with white settlers throughout his life. Under pressure to cede territory to the United States, he signed peace treaties with them at Fort Armstrong at Rock Island, Illinois, on September 3, 1822; at Prairie du Chien on July 15, 1830; at Fort Armstrong on September 21, 1832; at Dubuque, Iowa, on September 28, 1836; and at Washington, D.C., on October 21, 1837. During the Black Hawk War, Wapello supported chief Keokuk. In the 1840s, many Fox were forced west to Kansas. ==Settling in Iowa== In 1829, he led his tribe to Muscatine Slough on the west bank of the Mississippi River and later settled in Iowa. The frontier town of Wapello later developed near here. In 1837, he accompanied the renowned chief Keokuk and United States Indian agent General Joseph M. Street on a tour of northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. During this trip, Wapello made an eloquent speech at Boston, Massachusetts, wherein he expressed friendly sentiments towards white settlers and reaffirmed his desire to continue harmonious relations with them. ==Death and legacy== While on a hunting trip near the Skunk River east of Ottumwa, Iowa, Wapello died on March 15, 1842. He was later buried in accordance with his oft- expressed wish that he be laid to rest alongside his good friend General Street, at the site of the government agency in what is now a small park named Chief Wapello's Memorial Park located southeast of Agency, Iowa. *Chief Wapello's portrait was painted by Charles Bird King and a lithograph included with the chief's biography in Thomas McKenney and James Hall's History of the Indian Tribes of North America (1836‚Äì1844, three volumes). *Chief Wapello is currently the official corporate identity of Mid-Continent Airlines. *In Iowa, the city of Wapello and Wapello County are named for him. West of Drakesville, in Davis County, rests Lake Wapello, the enclosing Lake Wapello State Park, and the adjacent former Boy Scout Camp Wapello. *An annual event called Chief Wapello Days is held in Wapello, Iowa. *In Illinois, the town of Hanover, was once named for Wapello and contains the Jo Daviess Conservation Foundation's Wapello Land and Water Reserve. *The USS Wapello (YN-56), a United States Navy net tender in commission from 1941 to 1946, was named for him. *A large, statue of Chief Wapello was installed in his honor atop the Wapello County Courthouse in Ottumwa, Iowa for many decades. The statue and its mounting base received severe damage during a thunderstorm in June 2012, forcing temporary removal. After repair, restoration, and upgrade of the base with stainless steel, the statue was returned to the rooftop on March 13, 2014. ==See Also== Mid-Continent Airlines ==References * (Ship namesake paragraph) Category:1787 births Category:1842 deaths Category:Native American leaders Category:Native Americans of the Black Hawk War Category:People from Wapello County, Iowa Category:People from Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin Category:People of the Northwest Territory Category:18th-century Native Americans ","title":"Wapello (chief)"},{"id":"20213797","text":"Sabratha Stadium is a football stadium in Sabratha, Libya.

==References== * beheaded ","title":"List of people who were beheaded"},{"id":"20213962","text":"A quantum reference frame is a reference frame which is treated quantum theoretically. It, like any reference frame, is an abstract coordinate system which defines physical quantities, such as time, position, momentum, spin, and so on. Because it is treated within the formalism of quantum theory, it has some interesting properties which do not exist in a normal classical reference frame. ==Reference frame in classical mechanics and inertial frame== Consider a simple physics problem: a car is moving such that it covers a distance of 1 mile in every 2 minutes, what is its velocity in metres per second? With some conversion and calculation, one can come up with the answer \\"13.41m/s\\"; on the other hand, one can instead answer \\"0, relative to itself\\". The first answer is correct because it recognises a reference frame is implied in the problem. The second one, albeit pedantic, is also correct because it exploits the fact that there is not a particular reference frame specified by the problem. This simple problem illustrates the importance of a reference frame: a reference frame is quintessential in a clear description of a system, whether it is included implicitly or explicitly. When speaking of a car moving towards east, one is referring to a particular point on the surface of the Earth; moreover, as the Earth is rotating, the car is actually moving towards a changing direction, with respect to the Sun. In fact, this is the best one can do: describing a system in relation to some reference frame. Describing a system with respect to an absolute space does not make much sense because an absolute space, if it exists, is unobservable. Hence, it is impossible to describe the path of the car in the above example with respect to some absolute space. This notion of absolute space troubled a lot of physicists over the centuries, including Newton. Indeed, Newton was fully aware of this stated that all inertial frames are observationally equivalent to each other. Simply put, relative motions of a system of bodies do not depend on the inertial motion of the whole system. An inertial reference frame (or inertial frame in short) is a frame in which all the physical laws hold. For instance, in a rotating reference frame, Newton's laws have to be modified because there is an extra Coriolis force (such frame is an example of non-inertial frame). Here, \\"rotating\\" means \\"rotating with respect to some inertial frame\\". Therefore, although it is true that a reference frame can always be chosen to be any physical system for convenience, any system has to be eventually described by an inertial frame, directly or indirectly. Finally, one may ask how an inertial frame can be found, and the answer lies in the Newton's laws, at least in Newtonian mechanics: the first law guarantees the existence of an inertial frame while the second and third law are used to examine whether a given reference frame is an inertial one or not. It may appear an inertial frame can now be easily found given the Newton's laws as empirical tests are accessible. Quite the contrary; an absolutely inertial frame is not and will most likely never be known. Instead, inertial frame is approximated. As long as the error of the approximation is undetectable by measurements, the approximately inertial frame (or simply \\"effective frame\\") is reasonably close to an absolutely inertial frame. With the effective frame and assuming the physical laws are valid in such frame, descriptions of systems will ends up as good as if the absolutely inertial frame was used. As a digression, the effective frame Astronomers use is a system called \\"International Celestial Reference Frame\\" (ICRF), defined by 212 radio sources and with an accuracy of about 10^{-5} radians. However, it is likely that a better one will be needed when a more accurate approximation is required. Reconsidering the problem at the very beginning, one can certainly find a flaw of ambiguity in it, but it is generally understood that a standard reference frame is implicitly used in the problem. In fact, when a reference frame is classical, whether or not including it in the physical description of a system is irrelevant. One will get the same prediction by treating the reference frame internally or externally. To illustrate the point further, a simple system with a ball bouncing off a wall is used. In this system, the wall can be treated either as an external potential or as a dynamical system interacting with the ball. The former involves putting the external potential in the equations of motions of the ball while the latter treats the position of the wall as a dynamical degree of freedom. Both treatments provide the same prediction, and neither is particularly preferred over the other. However, as it will be discussed below, such freedom of choice cease to exist when the system is quantum mechanical. ==Quantum reference frame== A reference frame can be treated in the formalism of quantum theory, and, in this case, such is referred as a quantum reference frame. Despite different name and treatment, a quantum reference frame still shares much of the notions with a reference frame in classical mechanics. It is associated to some physical system, and it is relational. For example, if a spin-1/2 particle is said to be in the state \\\\left\\\\uparrow z \\\\right\\\\rangle, a reference frame is implied, and it can be understood to be some reference frame with respect to an apparatus in a lab. It is obvious that the description of the particle does not place it in an absolute space, and doing so would make no sense at all because, as mentioned above, absolute space is empirically unobservable. On the other hand, if a magnetic field along y-axis is said to be given, the behaviour of the particle in such field can then be described. In this sense, y and z are just relative directions. They do not and need not have absolute meaning. One can observe that a z direction used in a laboratory in Berlin is generally totally different from a z direction used in a laboratory in Melbourne. Two laboratories trying to establish a single shared reference frame will face important issues involving alignment. The study of this sort of communication and coordination is a major topic in quantum information theory. Just as in this spin-1/2 particle example, quantum reference frames are almost always treated implicitly in the definition of quantum states, and the process of including the reference frame in a quantum state is called quantisation/internalisation of reference frame while the process of excluding the reference frame from a quantum state is called dequantisation/externalisation of reference frame. Unlike the classical case, in which treating a reference internally or externally is purely an aesthetic choice, internalising and externalising a reference frame does make a difference in quantum theory. One final remark may be made on the existence of a quantum reference frame. After all, a reference frame, by definition, has a well-defined position and momentum, while quantum theory, namely uncertainty principle, states that one cannot describe any quantum system with well- defined position and momentum simultaneously, so it seems there is some contradiction between the two. It turns out, an effective frame, in this case a classical one, is used as a reference frame, just as in Newtonian mechanics a nearly inertial frame is used, and physical laws are assumed to be valid in this effective frame. In other words, whether motion in the chosen reference frame is inertial or not is irrelevant. The following treatment of a hydrogen atom motivated by Aharanov and Kaufherr can shed light on the matter. Supposing a hydrogen atom is given in a well-defined state of motion, how can one describe the position of the electron? The answer is not to describe the electron's position relative to the same coordinates in which the atom is in motion, because doing so would violate uncertainty principle, but to describe its position relative to the nucleus. As a result, more can be said about the general case from this: in general, it is permissible, even in quantum theory, to have a system with well-defined position in one reference frame and well- defined motion in some other reference frame. ==Further considerations of quantum reference frame== An example of treatment of reference frames in quantum theory Consider a hydrogen atom. Coulomb potential depends on the distance between the proton and electron only: :::V(r) = \\\\frac{-Ze^2}{r} With this symmetry, the problem is reduced to that of a particle in a central potential: ::: -\\\\frac{1}{2m} abla^2 \\\\psi(\\\\vec{r}) + \\\\frac{-Ze^2}{r} \\\\psi(\\\\vec{r}) = E\\\\psi(\\\\vec{r}) Using separation of variables, the solutions of the equation can be written into radial and angular parts: :::\\\\Phi(r,\\\\theta,\\\\phi) = R_{nl}(r) Y_{lm}(\\\\theta, \\\\phi) where l, m, and n are the orbital angular momentum, magnetic, and energy quantum numbers, respectively. Now consider the Schr√∂dinger equation for the proton and the electron: :::\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}\\\\Psi(x_1,y_1,z_1,x_2,y_2,z_2,t)=-iH\\\\Psi(x_1,y_1,z_1,x_2,y_2,z_2,t) A change of variables to relational and centre-of-mass coordinates yields :::\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Psi(x,y,z,X,Y,Z)}{\\\\partial t} = -i[-\\\\frac{1}{2M} abla_{c.o.m.}^2 -\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\mu} abla_{rel}^2 +V(x,y,z)]\\\\Psi where M is the total mass and \\\\mu is the reduced mass. A final change to spherical coordinates followed by a separation of variables will yield the equation for \\\\Phi(r,\\\\theta,\\\\phi) from above. However, if the change of variables done early is now to be reversed, centre-of-mass needs to be put back into the equation for \\\\Phi(r,\\\\theta,\\\\phi): :::r = \\\\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2 +(y_1-y_2)^2+ (z_1-z_2)^2} :::\\\\theta = \\\\tan^{-1}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2 +(y_1-y_2)^2}}{z_1-z_2} \\\\right) :::\\\\phi=\\\\tan^{-1}\\\\left( \\\\frac{y_1-y_2}{x_1-x_2}\\\\right) :::X=\\\\frac{m_1x_1+m_2x_2}{m_1+m_2} :::Y=\\\\frac{m_1y_1+m_2y_2}{m_1+m_2} :::Z=\\\\frac{m_1z_1+m_2z_2}{m_1+m_2} The importance of this result is that it shows the wavefunction for the compound system is entangled, contrary to one would normally think in a classical stand point. More importantly, it shows the energy of the hydrogen atom is not associated with the electron but also associated with the proton, and the corresponding states is not decomposable into states for electron and proton separately. Superselection rules Superselection rules, in short, are postulated rules forbidding the preparation of quantum states that exhibit coherence between eigenstates of certain observables. It was originally introduced to impose additional restriction to quantum theory beyond those of selection rules. As an example, superselection rules for electric charges disallow the preparation of a coherent superposition of different charge eigenstates. As it turns out, the lack of a reference frame is mathematically equivalent to superselection rules. This is a powerful statement because superselection rules have long been thought to have axiomatic nature, and now its fundamental standing and even its necessity are questioned. Nevertheless, it has been shown that it is, in principle, always possible (though not always easy) to lift all superselection rules on a quantum system. Degradation of a quantum reference frame  During a measurement, whenever the relations between the system and the reference frame used is inquired, there is inevitably a disturbance to both of them, which is known as measurement back action. As this process is repeated, it decreases the accuracy of the measurement outcomes, and such reduction of the usability of a reference frame is referred to as the degradation of a quantum reference frame. A way to gauge the degradation of a reference frame is to quantify the longevity, namely, the number of measurements that can be made against the reference frame until certain error tolerance is exceeded. For example, for a spin-j system, the maximum number of measurements that can be made before the error tolerance, \\\\epsilon, is exceeded is given by n_{max} \\\\simeq \\\\epsilon j^2.

It is codified at . ==History== Public Law 86-272 was enacted in response to outcries from business over the decision held in Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota, . In Northwestern States, the Supreme Court upheld the imposition of a Minnesota tax on an Iowa corporation that solicited orders and maintained a leased office in Minnesota. However, the Court did not make clear whether the maintenance of employees in the state (who solicited orders that were delivered and accepted outside the state) would have been enough to give rise to the state‚Äôs power to impose its tax. Public Law 86-272 addressed that circumstance by acting as a 'stopgap' by restricting a state from collecting income tax on solicited sales within its borders, as long as the orders are filled or shipped outside of the state. ==Provisions of the Act== Personal property Public Law 86-272 protects only solicitation of orders for tangible personal property. Solicitation Protection applies to activities that are limited to: *Solicitation by employees of orders that are approved outside the state and shipped from outside the state. *Solicitation by independent contractors if the sales are shipped from outside the state. Exclusions Public Law 86-272 does not protect a corporation in the state where it is incorporated. Likewise, it does not protect sellers of services or intangibles. In addition, it provides protection only from taxes measured by income. Taxes measured by net worth or gross receipts, or sales and use taxes, are not covered. ==References *Title 15, Chapter 10B, Subchapter I‚Äîcurrent text of the Act from the Legal Information Institute Category:United States federal taxation legislation Category:1959 in law Category:United States federal commerce legislation ","title":"Interstate Income Act of 1959"},{"id":"20213968","text":"The American Quartette was a mixed vocal quartet of the chatauqua circuit in the 1920s, consisting of coloratura soprano Helen Bickerton, contralto Esther Muenstermann, lyric tenor B.

Bagley was an American businessman who lived most of his life in Argentina but was born in 1838 in the state of Maine. Members of the family lived in Durham, Maine and Bangor, Maine. He migrated first to New Orleans, Louisiana where he worked in a dry goods store. In 1861 with the outbreak of the American Civil War he immigrated to Buenos Aires, Argentina where he worked for a commission merchant. He sought to own his enterprise and he found an opportunity. Bitter oranges had been planted as a decorative tree and street vendors had found that they could be sold as a refreshment but Argentines were concerned about disposal of the peel. Many vendors chose to sell on the block in front of the National Palace. A prize was offered for someone who could find a creative way to collect and use the peels. Bagley collected a large quantity of the peels and thru experimenting, created an apertif and herbal flavored triple sec. He then took inspiration from recent American publicity techniques and put up posters with \\"Hesperidina is Coming\\" in prominent locations and in newspapers. A newspaper editor wrote a column speculating on the mysterious product. Bagley then arranged for a cart of his product Hesperidina to have a wheel come of in front of the newspaper. The story of the cart and the product was picked up by the various newspapers and attracted significant attention in restaurants and saloons. It became a highly successful business which obtained the first patent and trademark. Hesperidina is considered the Argentine national liqueur.

In 2007 ASRA was awarded a grant from the Big Lottery Fund which allowed ASRA to employ their first paid coach, purchase boats for beginners, ergometers for schools and a minibus and towing vehicle. ASRA is expanding and hoping to build an extension to the current boathouse which was constructed in 2001. This is due to the huge increase in members due to the success of the \\"Wet Start\\" and \\"Dry Start\\" schemes. ASRA is run by 3 trustees: Bryan Steel, Alan Lawrie and Ian Duncan. They oversee the running of the club and take up roles as Rowing Co-ordinator, Treasurer and Senior Coach respectively. ASRA FP Colin Wallace was the first full-time paid coach and was employed by ASRA from 2007 to 2012. When Colin moved off to Edinburgh to train as a PE teacher, he was replaced by Sportscotland appointee, Jonny Muir, whose daunting remit it is, firstly to encourage more of ASRA's top rowers to follow the GB pathway, secondly to increase participation at all age levels in the club and thirdly to try to cut back the high levels of drop-out in the first years of rowing.

It is known commonly as the indiscriminate cuckoo bumblebee.Hatfield, R., et al. 2014. Bombus insularis. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Downloaded on 08 March 2016.NatureServe. 2015. Bombus insularis. NatureServe Explorer Version 7.1. Accessed 8 March 2016. The female of the species is 1.6 to 1.9 centimeters long and just under a centimeter wide. The head is black with tufts of yellow hairs and the thorax is coated in long pale yellow hairs. The legs are hairy black. The abdomen has is black with yellow along the sides. The male is smaller, about half a centimeter wide at the abdomen. The head has long black hairs with small patches of yellow and the abdomen has strips of yellow and black hairs.Bombus insularis. Mitchell, T. B. 1962. Bees of the Eastern United States. North Carolina Agricultural Experiment Station Technical Bulletin No. 152. Reprinted at Discoverlife.org. This species lives in tundra and taiga, western mountain ranges, and some maritime regions. As in other cuckoo bees, the queen of this species enters the nest of a host species, kills the resident queen, and lives and breeds in the nest tended by the host workers. Host species of this bee include the white-shouldered bumblebee (B. appositus), yellow bumblebee (B. fervidus), yellow-fronted bumblebee (B. flavifrons), Nevada bumblebee (B. nevadensis), and orange-belted bumblebee (B. ternarius). This bee is still common and widespread, though it has declined in some areas and disappeared from a few parts of its historical range. Some of its host species have faced more significant declines. Potential threats include habitat loss, pesticides, pathogens from domesticated pollinators, competition from introduced bees, and climate change. ==References== Category:NatureServe apparently secure species Category:Bumblebees Category:Hymenoptera of North America Category:Insects described in 1861 ","title":"Bombus insularis"},{"id":"20214203","text":"The Swiftcurrent Fire Lookout in Glacier National Park is significant as one of a chain of manned fire lookout posts within the park.

In 1929 he became an assistant to then Reichsbank president Hjalmar Schacht and in 1934 he was seconded to the Reich Ministry of Economics.

Its main hosts are Bombus pratorum, Bombus jonellus, and Bombus monticola. As a cuckoo bumblebee, Bombus sylvestris lays its eggs in another bumblebee's nest. This type of bee leaves their young to the workers of another nest for rearing, allowing cuckoo bumblebees to invest minimal energy and resources in their young while still keeping the survival of their young intact. == Taxonomy and phylogeny == Bombus sylvestris belongs to the order Hymenoptera. Specifically, the species falls under the family Apidae, which further subdivides into the subfamily Apinae, and then the tribe Bombini. == Description and identification == This is a small bumblebee; the queen has a body length of and the male one of . The head is round, and the proboscis is short. Its fur is black with a yellow collar and a white tail. Sometimes the bumblebee can have a few pale hairs on top of its head, its scutellum, and/or on its tergite (abdominal segment). The male is variably melanistic. Those rarely found in northern Scotland have an abdomen that is yellow instead of white.  Cuckoo bee vs. queen/worker bumblebees  The cuckoo bee has many physical differences from ordinary bumblebees. Cuckoo female bees do not have pollen baskets on their rear legs. Most cuckoo bumblebees also do not produce wax from between their abdominal segments, although there is evidence that the Bombus sylvestris bumblebee secretes wax. Since B. sylvestris lacks the ability to excrete wax, it is neither capable of producing eggs cells that enclose their eggs, nor does it have the capacity to create honey pots from which newly emerged broods may feed upon.L√ºckemeyer A (2009) The role of chemical communication in the reproductive biology of bumblebees and cuckoo bumblebees. Dissertation, University of Ulm. However, this serves well in the defense of cuckoo bees, as there are no weak points between the abdominal segments of the cuckoo bee for other bees to pierce through using their stingers. Moreover, cuckoo bumblees are slightly less hairy, have shorter tongues, have more pointed abdomens, and contain much sturdier bodies than normal bees. == Distribution and habitat == The forest cuckoo bumblebee can be found throughout most of Europe from the northern half of the Iberian Peninsula to southern Italy, from Greece in the south to beyond the Arctic Circle in the north, and from Ireland in the west to the easternmost part of Russia. They are found throughout Britain, but are absent in sections of eastern Scotland, the Scilly Isles, and Shetland.Benton, Ted (2006). \\"Chapter 9: The British Species\\". Bumblees. London, UK: HarperCollins Publishers. pp. 423-425. Most Bombus sylvestris can be found in post- industrial, mineral extraction sites and spoil heaps, gardens, parks, woodlands, and deciduous forests, which is why they get their nickname of the forest cuckoo bumblebee. == Diet == The Forest cuckoo bee (Bombus sylvestris) can be found foraging on white deadnettler, globe thistle, white clover, buttercup, sallow, bramble, lavender, and viper's bugloss, along with other specimens. == Colony cycle == Females will come out of hibernation a few weeks after its host species comes out of hibernation. The target host species is almost always Bombus pratorum, seen in studies by Hoffer in 1889 and Kupper & Schwammberger in 1995.K√ºpper G, Schwammberger KH (1995) Social parasitism in bumble bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae): observations of Psithyrus sylvestris in Bombus pratorum nests. Apidologie 26:245‚Äì254 The female selects her host nest by assessing the stage of development within that nest. Since bumblebee workers are solely responsible for rearing the imposter brood, the female cuckoo bee must select her host nest very carefully. Usually, the female cuckoo bee searches for a nest that has a few worker bees present, most likely because it shows that the nest can take care of her young. However, she must also ensure that there are not too many worker bees in case she is detected, attacked, and possibly killed along with her eggs.Sramkova A, Ayasse M (2009) Chemical ecology involved in invasion success of the cuckoo bumblebee Psithyrus vestalis and in survival of workers of its host Bombus terrestris. Chemoecology 19:55‚Äì62 Hence, B. sylvestris is faced with the duty to find an optimal nest under a time restriction. If the nest she enters is well developed, then there is a chance that the worker bees will attack the parasitic B. sylvestris and kill her. However, if the target nest is too underdeveloped, then the female Forest cuckoo bee will be unable to rear a large brood.Nash DR, Boomsma JJ (2008) Communication between hosts and social parasites.

Oxford University Press, USA, pp 55‚Äì79 Once she does find her target host nest, she sneaks into the nest to take over the colony. == Behavior == Since cuckoo bumblebees do not need to supply resources to their young, they do not tend to forage as aggressively or industriously as worker and queen bumblebees. Before entering a nest, cuckoo bumblebees bees tend to behave similar to male bumblebees‚Äîdrinking nectar until full and then resting until hungry again.Kreuter K, Bunk E, Luckemeyer A, Twele R, Francke W, Ayasse M. How the social parasitic bumblebee Bombus bohemicus sneaks into power of reproduction. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, March 2012, Volume 66. Issue 3. pp 475‚Äì486.  Nest acquisition  Cuckoo female bumblebees usually use their smell to locate a nest. They tend to infiltrate the nest and sting the existing queen to death before laying their eggs. However, the female cuckoo bee may sneak into the nest, hide in for a couple of days to ensure she smells like the nest, and then lay her eggs without detection.Zimma BO, Ayasse M, Teng√∂ J, Ibarra F, Schulz C, Francke W (2003) Do social parasitic bumblebees use chemical weapons? J Comp Physiol 189:769‚Äì775 As a parasitic relationship, this does not bode well for the nest because the cuckoo larvae impostors steal resources from the nest and energy from the worker bees, while contributing nothing to the nest.Zimma BO, Ayasse M, Teng√∂ J, Ibarra F, Francke W (2004) The role of semiochemicals in the reproductive biology of parasitic bumblebees. Mitt dtsch Ges allg angew Ent 14:195‚Äì198  Pollen collection  The Bombus sylvestris cuckoo female bee cannot collect pollen for her nest because it lacks corbicula, which are pollen baskets found on bumblebees on the hind legs. However, the Forest cuckoo bee does eat pollen like regular social bumblebees because the pollen helps in ovary maturation in fertilized females.  Worker rearing  Bombus sylvestris females are incapable of rearing any worker bees. The cuckoo bee only lays females identical to herself. Moreover, these offspring are unable to complete worker bee tasks that social bumblebees undertake normally, such as producing wax cells and gathering pollen. == Interventionism of parasitic relationship == Human intervention is not needed, and is not condoned. B. sylvestris has evolved naturally alongside its target species, such as B. pratorum and B. jonellus., and presents the natural order of their existence. An alternative method to help bees is to ensure the bees have rich environments and habitats. == Ecological summary == Since it is a cuckoo bumblebee, Bombus sylvestris does not construct its own nest; rather, it usurps the nests of other bumblebees. Its major host is Bombus pratorum, but Bombus jonellus and Bombus monticola are also visited. When patrolling for young queens with which to mate, the males fly in circuits about 1 m above ground, marking objects with their pheromones to attract the queens. The bumblebee often visits thistles and bramble. The queen also feeds on flowers such as sallow, deadnettles, dandelion, bay, horse chestnut, lavender, and others. The males, on the contrary, visits clovers, green alkanets, hound's-tongues, knapweeds, and many others. == References == Category:Bumblebees Category:Insects described in 1832 Category:Hymenoptera of Europe Category:Insects of the Arctic ","title":"Bombus sylvestris"},{"id":"20214332","text":"Bombus variabilis is a critically endangered species of cuckoo bumblebee.

The station was situated in between Alresford and Great Bentley. It was closed due to its close proximity to the much busier station at Great Bentley, just half a mile down the track. ==History== In 1859 the Tendring Hundred Railway Company was formed to extend the line from Hythe to Wivenhoe which opened on 8 May 1863 for both passenger and goods services from Colchester. By the time the Wivenhoe extension opened the line was operated by the GER Great Eastern Railway who bought the line from the Tendring Hunded Railway in 1883. Thorington station was opened as part of the Tendring Hundred Extension Railway on 8 January 1866. Initially the station was served by a single track but the line was doubled between Great Bentley and Thorpe-le-Soken by the Great Eastern Railway in 1891. The Wivenhoe to Great Bentley section was doubled in 1898.Great Eastern Railway Society Journal 111 page 24 S Jenkins Operation of the station passed to the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923. In 1948 the station became part of the Eastern Region of British Railways.

Revenge's chaotic black metal sound represents a direct continuation of Read's previous band's direction. Although sometimes referred to as War Metal the band has never referred to themselves as War Metal and has always called themselves Black Metal, Chaotic Black Metal or Black Death Metal. They have released six full-length albums to date. The band's lyrics explore among other things various militant themes of anti religion, anti humanity, self ascension and the collapse and rebuilding of mankind. ==Biography== Following the demise of Canadian war metal band Conqueror, James Read formed Revenge in 2000 in Edmonton, Alberta, with the help of fellow scene veterans Ryan F√∂rster (of Conqueror, Blasphemy and Domini Inferi) and Vermin (of Sacramentary Abolishment and Axis of Advance).Revenge biography @ Rockdetector Utilising the session musicians Attacker and Dehumanizer, the band recorded the Attack.Blood.Revenge 10\\" EP. The EP, which featured a cover of Bathory's \\"War\\", was released through Dark Horizon Records in 2001. The same year, Read joined French band Arkhon Infaustus for European touring, whilst also contributing session drums for fellow Canadians Axis of Advance. In June 2002, Revenge was joined by Pete Helmkamp, of Order from Chaos and Angelcorpse notoriety, on bass and backing vocals. The band signed to the French label Osmose, who released Revenge's first full-length album, Triumph.Genocide.Antichrist, in 2003. Revenge also contributed the track \\"Deathless Will\\" to a split 7\\" single with Arkhon Infaustus, also released through Osmose. Two further albums emerged through Osmose, in 2004 and 2008 respectively, in much the same vein as previous Revenge and Conqueror releases.

Thomas Catesby Paget from 1712 to 1714, and subsequently with the courtesy title Lord Paget, was an English writer and politician, who sat in the House of Commons from 1715 to 1727 and served in the household of King George II. ==Early life== Paget was born in 1689, the son of Hon. Henry Paget, later Earl of Uxbridge, and his wife Mary Catesby, daughter of Thomas Catesby of Whiston, Northamptonshire. He was admitted at Clare College, Cambridge on 20 April 1705 and matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford on 19 April 1707 aged 18. His father was much concerned in 1710 to obtain Paget's release when he was taken prisoner by French forces during the War of the Spanish Succession, as he tried to make his way in southern Germany to Italy. ==Political career== At the 1715 general election, Paget was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Staffordshire. In 1719 he was appointed Gentleman of the Bedchamber to George, Prince of Wales. He was returned without contest again as MP for Staffordshire in 1722. At the 1727 general election he chose to stand for Middlesex as a Whig, but was defeated. He never stood for parliament again but was promoted to Lord of the bedchamber to King George II in 1727. In 1736, he resigned his post at court on grounds of ill-health. ==Literary works== Paget composed pieces in verse and prose - according to Horace Walpole ‚Äòin the intervals of bad weather in hunting seasons‚Äô. His verse has been described as exhibiting a \\"tough cynicism\\". Walpole said his works included much good sense but not much poetry. They included: *An Essay on Human Life, London (1734); a close imitation of Alexander Pope. It was printed in a supplement to the Works of Pope in 1757. *An Epistle to Mr. Pope, in Anti- heroics, London, 1737. *Some Reflections upon the Administration of Government (anon.), London, 1740.

House and the team go to his home to figure out what might be causing his seizures. Cameron takes charge of the case as she had treated the patient in the past and she and the team figure out ways to treat him at his home. However, with Cameron's feelings for people who are sick, she does not end up giving the man the best diagnosis possible, leaving House and his team simple tools to diagnose with. The patient's condition worsens and it becomes difficult to treat him at his home, therefore House and the team plan to get the man into the hospital for surgery without causing any problems. Cameron and Chase attempt to work through issues in their relationship. House deals with an annoying ostensible bug bite itch he cannot seem to scratch, with Wilson making his own analogies about the problem. House finally diagnoses lead poisoning from bullet fragments from a seven-year-old shooting that stayed in his system. House removes the bullet fragments, curing the patient of his seizures but the patient remains agoraphobic. House accuses him of cowardice. The scene cuts to Taub and his wife making up, and Chase and Cameron smiling after getting through their issues. House realizes Wilson is right about his \\"itch\\" and takes his motorcycle to Cuddy's home, while the patient attempts to overcome his agoraphobia, and take flowers to his girlfriend's grave. Just as House is about to knock on Cuddy's door, he hesitates, looking at her through the window for a long time. Then he turns around and walks away as the video and music fade away.

Wrist piercings are a type of surface piercing. They carry a high rate of rejection and migration,The Point #33 A Statistical Look at Surface Bars unless they are properly measured and placed. The piercings may be rejected if they are not installed properly; due to the location of the piercings they are easy to irritate, and regularly catch onto clothing or other objects. People with wrist piercings are advised to put on short sleeved t-shirts, singlets so as to prevent the surface barbell from catching onto the threads of the clothing. Also, wrist piercings can only be done with a special tool (to hook the other side of the surface barbell upside) and thus, it is of high difficulty for it to be home-made. Piercers would also advise that, after getting a wrist piercing, the person is to soak and moisten the wound with mild salted solution so as to disinfect the area, preventing bacteria from entering the unclotted wound. The span of a wrist piercing ranges approximately from as short as 2 weeks to 6 or 7 months. ==Wrist Piercing Jewelry== As with all surface piercings, wrist piercings require special jewelry to minimize the risk of piercing migration and rejection. Both surface bars and barbells with bars made from flexible material, such as tygon or Teflon, are commonly used as both short and long term jewelry in wrist piercings. More appropriate is titanium, which is less likely to irritate surrounding skin due to its lack of nickel. A quality piercing is done in two steps with different bars: one with long rises used at time of piercing to allow for initial swelling, and a second bar with shorter rises and balls a few millimeters from skin to be inserted months later once healing has taken place.

In the MLB, he played all or part of five seasons, between 1978 and 1984, for the Chicago White Sox and Texas Rangers. He is the only manager ever to win league championships in all three major Triple-A leagues (International League, American Association and Pacific Coast League). ==Playing career== Early career Foley played college baseball at the University of Kentucky, and in 1974 he played collegiate summer baseball with the Falmouth Commodores of the Cape Cod Baseball League. In 1975, the Chicago White Sox drafted Foley in the 17th round of the 1975 MLB draft. He was originally assigned to the Class-A Appleton Foxes, but was promoted to the Double-A Knoxville Sox after just six games. He batted .293 at Knoxville in 51 games, and in 1976 he opened the season there again. Foley's statistics declined somewhat in 1976, with his batting average dropping to .251 in his first full professional season. In 1977, Foley split the season between Appleton (48 games), Knoxville (66 games), and the Triple-A Iowa Oaks (10 games). Across all three levels, he batted .282 with 10 home runs. In 1978, he played the whole season at Iowa, batting .275.Marv Foley page at The Baseball Cube Major league career White Sox =1978= After the Triple-A season ended, Foley was given his first taste of major league action. He made his debut on September 11, 1978, against the Minnesota Twins. He pinch-hit for starting catcher Mike Colbern in the ninth inning, grounding out against pitcher Mike Marshall. He played in a total of 11 games that season, batting .353 in 34 at bats. =1979= Foley started the 1979 season with the White Sox, splitting time as their primary catcher with Bill Nahorodny. On May 27, the White Sox purchased Milt May from the Detroit Tigers, and Foley, who was batting .235, was sent down to Iowa. He returned to the White Sox in September, finishing the season with a .247 average, 2 home runs, and 10 RBI. =1980= Foley started the season with the White Sox in 1980, but again struggled at the plate, batting just .181 through July 3. He was demoted to the minors, splitting the next two months between Iowa and the Double-A Glens Falls White Sox. For the third season in a row, he returned to the majors in September, and by the end of the season he had brought his average up to .212, and had set new career highs with 4 home runs and 15 RBI. =1981‚Äì83= In 1981, Foley opened the season in the minor leagues for the first time in three seasons. He spent the full season with the White Sox' new Triple-A affiliate, the Edmonton Trappers, where he batted .296 and a professional best of 11 home runs. In 1982, Foley was back in the majors, but as the White Sox' third- string catcher behind Carlton Fisk and Marc Hill. He appeared in 27 games, with 36 at bats, in which he batted .111 with one RBI. In 1983, it was back to Triple-A, again with a new White Sox affiliate, the Denver Bears. This time, he had what would be his best batting average in a full Triple-A season at .319, and he hit double digits in home runs with 10. However, after the season ended, he was allowed to become a minor league free agent. Rangers A month later, Foley signed a contract with the Texas Rangers. In 1984, Foley played a full season in the majors for the second time, splitting time at catcher with Donnie Scott and Ned Yost. On the last day of the season, in the first game of a doubleheader against the California Angels, he made the final out of Mike Witt's perfect game. Pinch-hitting for Curtis Wilkerson, he grounded out to second to end the game. It turned out to be his last at bat in the major leagues. While he batted .217 in 1984, he established personal major-league bests with 6 home runs and 19 RBI. After the season, he was released by the Rangers. Back in the minors Foley signed on with the Detroit Tigers shortly after his release, but never played for them at any level. Instead, he wound up back with the White Sox. He split the next two seasons between Double-A and Triple-A in their organization before his playing career ended following the 1986 season at age 32. ==Post-playing career== White Sox organization During his final two seasons in the minors, Foley served as a player-coach. In 1987, he was named manager of the Peninsula White Sox, and in 1988 he was promoted to the High-A Tampa White Sox. That season, he was named Florida State League Manager of the Year after leading Tampa into the playoffs, where they lost in the first round. In 1989, Foley was again promoted, this time to Triple-A, with yet another new White Sox' affiliate, the Vancouver Canadians of the Pacific Coast League. This time, he led the team to the league championship, defeating the Albuquerque Dukes in the finals. Foley managed the next season at Vancouver as well, but after starting the 1991 season with a 24‚Äì39 record, he was replaced by Moe Drabowsky on May 15. Cubs organization Prior to the 1992 season, Foley was hired by the Chicago Cubs to manage their Double-A affiliate, the Charlotte Knights. He managed the team into the playoffs, but lost in the first round. In 1993, he was moved up to the Triple-A Iowa Cubs of the American Association. After finishing the season in first place with an 85‚Äì59 record, the I-Cubs won the league championship over the Nashville Sounds‚Äîyet another new Triple-A affiliate of the White Sox.1993 American Association page at minors.baseball- reference.com In 1994, Foley returned to the majors, serving as the Cubs' bullpen coach. Orioles organization Following the 1994 season, Foley moved on to the Baltimore Orioles organization, and once again was managing in the minor leagues. He started out the 1995 season with the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings of the International League, and the team made the playoffs in each of Foley's first three seasons as manager. In 1997, Foley would achieve what no other minor league manager has achieved before or since when the Red Wings won the International League championship, winning in the finals over the Columbus Clippers. The win gave Foley championships in all three major Triple-A leagues. To date, he is the only manager to do so, and since the American Association ceased to exist after the 1997 season, he may remain so indefinitely. Foley managed the Red Wings again in 1998, but the team finished in fourth place, out of the playoffs. In 1999, Foley had his second stint as a coach in the majors, coaching at first base for the Orioles. He returned to manage Rochester in 2000, this time finishing fifth, before spending a season as the Orioles' roving minor league catching instructor. Rockies organization After being let go by the Orioles, Foley spent a season in the independent leagues, managing the Newark Bears of the Atlantic League in 2002, guiding the team to the league championship. He was hired by the Colorado Rockies to manage their Double-A team, the Tulsa Drillers, prior to the 2003 season. After one season in Tulsa, he managed the next two seasons for the Triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox. Since 2006, Foley has served as the Rockies' minor league catching coordinator. ==ReferencesSources== *Pura Pelota (Venezuelan Winter League) : Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:American expatriate baseball players in Canada Category:Appleton Foxes players Category:Baltimore Orioles coaches Category:Baseball coaches from Kentucky Category:Baseball players from Kentucky Category:Birmingham Barons players Category:Buffalo Bisons (minor league) players Category:Chicago Cubs coaches Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:Colorado Springs Sky Sox managers Category:Denver Bears players Category:Edmonton Trappers players Category:Falmouth Commodores players Category:Fort Myers Sun Sox players Category:Glens Falls White Sox players Category:Iowa Cubs managers Category:Iowa Oaks players Category:Kentucky Wildcats baseball players Category:Knoxville Sox players Category:Major League Baseball bullpen coaches Category:Major League Baseball catchers Category:Major League Baseball first base coaches Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:People from Stanford, Kentucky Category:Rochester Red Wings managers Category:Texas Rangers players Category:Tigres de Aragua players Category:University of Kentucky alumni ","title":"Marv Foley"},{"id":"20214633","text":"Almire Gandonni√®re (3 August 1814, Lou√© ‚Äì 25 October 1863, San Francisco)The date is given in Qu√©rard, Joseph Marie.

Metal balls were released from twelve little doors into brass bowls on the lower beams to signal the hours. The rafters on the top level originally supported a small roof, now gone. Dar al-Magana () is a building in Fes, Morocco, built by the Marinid Sultan Abu Inan Faris which houses a weight-powered water clock. It is located opposite the Bou Inania Madrasa on Tala'a Kebira street and was created to serve that madrasa and its mosque, which was also built by Abu Inan around the same time. According to the historical chronicler al-Jazna'i, the clock was completed on 6 May 1357 (14 Djumada al-awwal, 758 AH). The designer of the clock was a muwaqqit named Abu al-Hassan ibn Ali Ahmed el-Tlemsani. The clock may have followed similar principles as that of an earlier water clock built for the Dar al-Muwaqqit of the Qarawiyyin Mosque by Sultan Abu Said in 1317. The building is also sometimes referred to as the \\"House of Maimonides\\" due to a popular legend which claims that the house was once the residence of the famous Jewish philosopher Maimonides. == Description == The restored facade of the Dar al-Magana today (with the bowls missing) The clock consists of 12 windows and platforms carrying brass bowls. The motion of the clock was presumably maintained by a kind of small cart which ran from left to right behind the twelve doors. At one end, the cart was attached to a rope with a hanging weight; at the other end to a rope with a weight that floated on the surface of a water reservoir that was drained at a regular pace. Each hour one of the doors opened; at the same time a metal ball was dropped into one of the twelve brass bowls. The rafters sticking out of the building above the doors (similar to the rafters of the Bou Inania Madrasa) supported a small roof to shield the doors and bowls.Tazi, Rajae, \\"L‚Äôhorloge Hydraulique Bouanania, une √©nigme enfin per√ßue par des sp√©cialistes du patrimoine\\" in Jeunes Du Maroc, Portail des Jeunes, December 16, 2004 The facade of the building is decorated with carved stucco around the windows and by sculpted arabesque and epigraphic motifs on the wooden rafters and corbels. == State of preservation == The clock has been defunct for generations and a lack of documentation and collective memory about its exact functioning has impeded efforts to repair it. The bowls have been removed since 2004 with the aim of repairing or reconstructing its mechanism, though the project, managed by ADER-Fes (a foundation for the restoration of monuments in Fes), has been unsuccessful in this regard so far. The structure and facade of the house itself was also restored in the early 2000s. ==See also== *Clock of Ridwan al-Saati *Elephant clock of al-Jazari *Dar al-Muwaqqit ==NotesReferencesFurther reading== *Ricard P. 1924. \\"L'Horloge de la M√©dersa Bou-Anania de F√®s\\" in: Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© de G√©ographie d'Alger et de l'Afrique du Nord, vol. 25: pp. 248‚Äì254. *D.J. de Solla Price, \\"Mechanical Waterclocks of the 14th Century in Fez, Morocco\\" in: Proceedings of the Tenth International Congress of the History of Science (Ithaca, N.Y, 1962).

It is known in the United Kingdom by its original title or in translation as Lunch on the Grass. A satire on contemporary science and politics, it revolves around a prominent biologist and politician who wants to replace sex with artificial insemination, but begins to reconsider when a picnic he organizes is interrupted by the forces of nature. The film brings up issues of modernity, human reproduction, youth and European integration. It ridicules rationalist idealism and celebrates a type of materialism it associates with classical mythology and ancient Greek philosophy. The title is taken from the painting Le D√©jeuner sur l'herbe by √âdouard Manet. The female lead in Picnic on the Grass was the first major role for Rouvel, who due to an unusual contract would not appear in another film until 1963. Filming took place around Renoir's childhood home in Provence, and inspiration came from the impressionist paintings of his father, Pierre-Auguste Renoir. The filming technique was influenced by live television and involved multiple cameras and direct audio recording. The press reviews were generally positive and described the film as charming and beautiful. Negative response came from the political left, where critics disapproved of the film's treatment of progress and depiction of a European superstate; the subject of European unification was topical and sensitive due to the creation of the European Economic Community in 1957. In spite of the generally good reviews, the film was a commercial failure, and has attracted little attention from general audiences over the years. Some modern critics have seen its implicit critiques of technocracy and dogged rationalism as both prophetic and of increasing relevance to today's world. ==Plot== The famous French biologist √âtienne Alexis is the frontrunner in the upcoming election for the first President of Europe. He advocates mandatory artificial insemination in order to improve humanity and make it worthy of modern science. He is newly engaged to his German cousin Marie-Charlotte and has invited her to a picnic near his mansion in Provence. N√©nette, a farmer's daughter, is disappointed with men after a failed relationship, but still wants children and applies to be a test subject for √âtienne's insemination project. She ends up hired as his chambermaid and accompanies the picnic with the other servants. Present at the picnic are several cousins of the engaged couple--stiff, rationally minded people who profess belief in scientific progress. They have invited journalists to document the picnic event, which they want to present as a symbol for the new unified Europe. The picnic takes place next to the ruins of a temple of Diana, the goddess who the ancient Romans believed presided over childbirth. Nearby is also a group of young campers. N√©nette is worried when she spots the goatherd Gaspard; she knows that when he plays his flute, strange things tend to happen. Gaspard plays and suddenly a strong wind blows away the picnic chairs and tables. As everybody takes cover, √âtienne and N√©nette are separated from the rest. When the wind subsides, the two are invited to sit down with the campers, to whom √âtienne explains how he hopes to eliminate passion. Meanwhile, a Bacchanalia breaks out among the picnic guests not far away. Leaving the campers to look for Marie-Charlotte, √âtienne ends up seeing N√©nette swimming nude, and becomes visibly affected; when N√©nette emerges from the water and joins him, Gaspard's flute is heard playing again, and the two run off into the high reeds together. After returning, they see the cousins and servants leaving in cars. They choose to not approach them, and instead rejoin the campers, who offer to let them stay the night in their camp. The next morning, √âtienne says he wants to escape from the world for a while, so he and N√©nette go to stay at N√©nette's father Nino's house. √âtienne begins to reconsider the relationship between humans and the natural world. The cousins eventually discover his whereabouts and arrive at the house, where they convince N√©nette to leave. Realizing she is gone, √âtienne becomes agitated and goes to look for her, running into Gaspard, the goatherd, who recommends that he kneel before his goat and ask for help. After doing so, √âtienne turns ecstatic and shouts \\"Down with science!\\" before being forcibly restrained by his cousins. √âtienne goes back to his old life, but on the day of his wedding he discovers N√©nette, happily pregnant with his child, working in a hotel kitchen. He abruptly brings her instead of Marie-Charlotte to the waiting crowd. He will launch his presidential campaign with a speech about science and nature, and he intends to marry N√©nette. ==Cast== Cast adapted from A Companion to Jean Renoir and the British Film Institute. * Paul Meurisse as Professor √âtienne Alexis * Catherine Rouvel as N√©nette * Fernand Sardou as Nino, N√©nette's father * Jacqueline Morane as Titine, N√©nette's elder sister * Jean-Pierre Granval as Ritou, Titine's husband * Ingrid Nordine as Marie- Charlotte * Charles Blavette as Gaspard, the old goatherd * Paulette Dubost as Mlle Forestier, the telephonist ==Themes== Modernity and nature Diana by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1867 The themes of Picnic on the Grass revolve around modern issues such as artificial insemination, the pharmaceutical industry and the mass media. Jean Renoir's biographer Pascal M√©rigeau writes that the film \\"deals with disturbingly serious subjects using a farcical tone\\". The film historian Jean Douchet writes that the film should be taken seriously, but describes its story as an invitation to not do so. Renoir satirizes a modernity he does not think highly of, and uses story and tone to suggest to the viewer that it is not very important. The central conflict is built on several dichotomies: between the Apollonian and Dionysian, the technocratic Northern Europe and underdeveloped Mediterranean region, and the rationalist idealism of Postchristianity and materialist philosophy of ancient Greece. The film ridicules the idealist notion of progress and celebrates the Dionysian world. It portrays an empty spirituality produced by a bureaucratic utilitarianism, and thereby seeks to justify the celebration of a material world imbued with spirit. When √âtienne converses with a Christian priest, the two are shown to have disagreements, but to simultaneously understand each other well; this is because both still belong to the idealist side in the film's conflict. According to Douchet, the film sets up a scenario where harmonious equilibrium is achieved when science abandons idealism and submits to a materialist view of nature. This happens when √âtienne marries N√©nette, who is pregnant with their naturally conceived child. √âtienne is an intellectual who lives in a theoretical world. This makes him similar to the main characters in two earlier works by Renoir: the play Orvet (1955) and the television film The Doctor's Horrible Experiment (1959). √âtienne's eugenic ideology combines rationalism and moralism in a way that gives Darwinism an active role in concord with individualism. Human reproduction and evolution become tied to √âtienne's notions of self-sufficiency and to ideas about social responsibility. N√©nette is comfortable with her human physicality, but is also driven by self-sufficiency in her wish to have her own child through artificial insemination. She is emancipated and mobile, and it is her actions that twice bring her to √âtienne. Another‚Äîmilitaristic‚Äîtype of women's emancipation is represented by Marie-Charlotte. Allied against Western rationalism are the gods Pan and Diana. Pan is evoked through the flute- playing goatherd, and Diana presides over chastity and childbirth, which in this classical mythological context are aspects of female independence. Youth and experience Portrait of Jean Renoir by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1910 Renoir had spent years of his childhood and adolescence in the area where Picnic on the Grass was filmed. He had recently begun to write a book about his father, the painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir, which made him reminisce about his early life. According to M√©rigeau, the film sees Renoir return to the perspective he had as a young boy and adolescent, from where he confronts the troubling questions of the contemporary world. Renoir's reconnection to his younger self is paralleled in the mode of storytelling, which is reminiscent of the silent cinema in which he began his filmmaking career in the 1920s; M√©rigeau writes that the film thereby creates a paradox, since it was made using new techniques from television. Another parallel to Renoir's earlier experiences is how the portrayal of eroticism is similar to that of his 1936 film Partie de campagne. The filmmaker Shirley Clarke said that Picnic on the Grass \\"could only have been made by someone of 6 or 60\\". European integration The historian Hugo Frey groups Picnic on the Grass with a number of French comedies that deal with a \\"modernist invasion\\". These include the films of Jacques Tati, Mr. Freedom (1968), directed by William Klein, and The Holes (1974), directed by Pierre Tchernia. Renoir's film stands out in the group because it targets the nascent European Union rather than the United States. The vision of a European superstate was conceived as the logical continuation of the European Economic Community (EEC), created in 1957 by the Treaty of Rome. The film's depiction of a French and German elite couple follows a convention where European integration is understood as something that particularly concerns France and Germany, or France and Germanic-speaking Europe overall. The way √âtienne speaks to journalists, with technical and obscure terminology, envisions a future political elite as the only people who will comprehend the European project. ==Production== Development After working in Hollywood in the 1940s, Renoir had re-established himself in European cinema following the international success of The River (1951). During the 1950s, he developed a more detached and depoliticized approach to filmmaking than before. Simultaneously, he became a more prominent celebrity in France due to television appearances and an increased appreciation for his films from the 1930s. His work became more oriented toward personal subjects. The title of Picnic on the Grass is taken from the painting Le D√©jeuner sur l'herbe (1863) by √âdouard Manet. Renoir wrote seven versions of the screenplay. He made the film through his own production company, Compagnie Jean Renoir; it was the last time he did so, as annoyances about logistics during the production made him decide to never produce his own films again. Financial backing was provided by Path√© and the UCIF, to whom Renoir also offered 50% of his earnings from La Grande Illusion (1937) as a reimbursement guarantee, to a limit of 10 million francs. Pre-production Catherine Rouvel‚Äîwhose real last name was Rouveyre‚Äîhad her first major role in Picnic on the Grass. Renoir had met her in 1958, shortly after her 19th birthday, during a tribute to Robert J. Flaherty at the Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise. She had accompanied her husband Georges Rouveyre, whose friend Claude Beylie, a film critic, introduced her to Renoir. A few weeks earlier, she had enrolled at the drama school Centre d'art dramatique de la rue Blanche, and that same winter, Renoir contacted her for a reading and an informal screen test. Later, when the casting process for Picnic on the Grass formally began, she was not the only candidate for the role of N√©n√©tte; Renoir auditioned Mich√®le Mercier the same day, and also considered giving the part to the dancer Ludmilla Tch√©rina, whom he had directed in a ballet. Renoir told Rouveyre in April 1959 that the role was hers; soon thereafter, he suggested that she should change her name to Rouvel. For the male lead, Renoir first considered Pierre Blanchar, a man in his mid 60s, before giving the role to the 20-years-younger Paul Meurisse; Renoir had previously worked with Meurisse in a production of Julius Caesar and the two were good friends. In the role of the goatherd Gaspard he cast Charles Blavette, who had played the title role in Renoir's film Toni (1935). Renoir rehearsed with the actors for a week before adding technicians to the rehearsals. After this, the director, designer, camera operator and assistant scouted the filming locations. The rehearsals then resumed, with markers chalked on the floor of the rehearsal room corresponding to the filming locations' topography. Working with markers was something Renoir abandoned after Picnic on the Grass, because he thought it was better if the actors could discover the surroundings more freely. Filming and post-production The old farmhouse at Les Collettes was a filming location. The property was acquired by the city of Cagnes-sur-Mer in 1959 and turned into the Mus√©e Renoir. Filming took place from 6 to 30 July 1959 at Studio Franc≈ìur in Paris, and in Cagnes-sur-Mer and La Gaude in Alpes-Maritimes. Picnic on the Grass borrows visual traits from French impressionist painting, in particular that of Pierre-Auguste Renoir. This is reflected in the choices of filming locations; Jean Renoir called the film \\"something of a homage to the olive- trees under which my father worked so much\\". A major location was the property Les Collettes in Cagnes-sur-Mer, which Renoir the elder had bought in 1907, and which had been the home of Jean Renoir for a part of his childhood and adolescence. Renoir the elder had spent significant time in the town La Gaude where a part of the film was shot, and several of his paintings feature the nearby river Le Coup, which also appears in the film. Another stylistic choice came from the director's desire to follow impulses on location and encourage improvisation; Renoir said he wanted to make a \\"sort of filmed poem\\" written in one sitting. After the rehearsals, he gave very little instruction to the actors. He used a rapid working method influenced by live television, a technique he had first used in his recent television film The Doctor's Horrible Experiment, which he called an \\"experimental film\\". He also took advantage of the cinematographer's experience from making newsreel footage, with six cameras placed around a scene to cover all useful angles and shots. In addition to saving time and money, the aim was to retain the uninterrupted, intensive acting of a long take and still be able to make cuts within the scene. This method made it possible to record most of the dialogue directly, without problems of continuity due to surrounding sounds such as that from airplanes. Up to twelve microphones were present and only around 20 phrases had to be dubbed in post-production. Several key crew members were reused from The Doctor's Horrible Experiment. They included the cinematographer Georges Leclerc and the editor Ren√©e Lichtig, both of whom would work with Renoir again on his next film, The Elusive Corporal, which became his final feature film, although the multiple-camera technique was abandoned after Picnic on the Grass. The original music for Picnic on the Grass was composed by Joseph Kosma, who first collaborated with Renoir in 1936 and had provided music for several of his best known films. The score includes a melody the goatherd plays in high pitch on his flute during the wind scene, an upbeat piece played on clarinet in jazz style, and a melody played on flute with harp glissandos during a lyrical passage. ==Release== Path√© released Picnic on the Grass theatrically in France on 11 November 1959. In the United Kingdom it was released by Mondial Films in April 1960 under the title Lunch on the Grass. It was released in the United States as Picnic on the Grass on 12 October 1960 by Kingsley-International Pictures. For the French home-media market, it was first released on VHS in 1990 by Fil √† film and on DVD in 2003 by StudioCanal vid√©o. The DVD, which was re-released in 2008, includes a 30-minute documentary directed by Pierre-Fran√ßois Glaymann. The film was released on DVD in the United Kingdom in 2007 by Optimum Releasing, as part of a box set with other Renoir films. The DVD uses the original French title, Le D√©jeuner Sur L'Herbe. ==Reception== Contemporary critical response French film critics generally gave Picnic on the Grass a positive reception, characterized by respect for Renoir. They highlighted the film's connection to impressionism and described it as charming. Rouvel's face was on the cover of the December 1959 issue of Cahiers du cin√©ma, and the magazine called the film \\"the most beautiful of a month rich in masterpieces\\". The review by √âric Rohmer stressed the technical novelty of the film, released in \\"the year of the 'New Wave'\\", which Renoir had influenced profoundly. With its detached and intentionally naive style, Rohmer described it as \\"avant-garde popular theater\\" in the vein of Mr Puntila and his Man Matti. For Rohmer, the satire against science should be understood through Renoir's role as an artist, not philosopher or moralist, and not as a rejection of practical science. As for politics, he defended the artist's right to look at the problems of the world without being politically engaged. Picnic on the Grass made 13th place on Cahiers du cin√©ma's composite list of the best films of 1959. Pierre Braunberger, Jean-Luc Godard, Jacques Rivette, Rohmer and Fran√ßois Truffaut were among the Cahiers critics who named it to year-end top ten lists. Jean Renoir in 1959 Renoir had supported the French Communist Party (PCF) in the 1930s, but Picnic on the Grass received negative reviews from critics with communist sympathies. It was released at a time when the PCF idealized progress and its members were enthusiastic about the Soviet space program. Samuel Lachize of L'Humanit√© considered the film flawed on a technical level, and criticized its lack of a clear choice between scientific progress and the rejection of it. He dismissed the philosophical content, which he took as a pseudo-Rousseauesque message about going back to nature. The Doctor's Horrible Experiment received a similar treatment from communist critics. Left-wing critics also criticized Picnic on the Grass for its evident acceptance of a European superstate, which was taken as an approval of the EEC, opposed by the left at the time. Furthermore, upsetting for the left, the reservations √âtienne appears to have developed toward the end of the film were interpreted as support for Charles de Gaulle's (\\"Europe of fatherlands\\"). In the 1970s, the film critic Raymond Durgnat related the response to the left's own struggle to oppose the EEC without turning to patriotism. Durgnat wrote that it was \\"perhaps not too unkind to suggest that my left-wing colleagues were making their 'lost leader' a scapegoat for the very real difficulties of the left itself‚Äîor should one say the lefts themselves?\\" Gideon Bachmann wrote in Film Quarterly that many American critics gave Picnic on the Grass a \\"silly treatment\\", because they did not understand it through its director as a person. He used Hollis Alpert of the Saturday Review as a positive counterexample. Alpert called it \\"a nonsensically unconventional movie\\" where viewers \\"would be better off not trying to make sense or logic out of it, but simply allowing M. Renoir to have his day in the fields\\". Bachmann wrote that the film is reminiscent of Tati's films, both in message and how the message is conveyed through colors. He contrasted the seeming simplicity with the serious content, and the impressionism with the surreal elements. He called it \\"almost facile in impact but lasting in the perturbations it causes\\". Retrospective critical response Picnic on the Grass has received little attention from general audiences over time, but it has been embraced by individual critics. In 2006, Luc Arbona of Les Inrockuptibles called it an \\"extraordinary pamphlet\\" portraying \\"the peddlers of progress\\" who \\"only care about security, asepticity and uniformity\\". Arbona called the satire \\"abundant and exhilirating\\" and the film \\"brilliantly prophetic\\", because by the time of his writing, Arbona wrote, \\"these progress-obsessed, these ad-agency apostles who have nothing but the politically correct to say, have seized power and are leading the dance.\\" The New Yorker's Richard Brody wrote about the film in conjunction with Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Taking its message as a rejection of modern technology, he compared it favorably to Steven Soderbergh's Contagion, which shows science and the government triumphant in a crisis of natural origin. Brody made a point of separating art and politics: \\"Looking to filmmakers for practical advice in the teeth of trouble is usually as pointless as turning to politicians for visions of beauty.\\" Time Out called it \\"one of Renoir's most ravishing, and simultaneously most irritating films\\", because the \\"sumptuous photography\\" repeatedly \\"collapses into cold argument\\". Box office Picnic on the Grass had 757,024 admissions in France, and was a commercial failure. Renoir addressed this in a letter to the producer Ginette Doynel a few weeks after the Paris premiere. He wrote that the failure had given him a distaste for film and television work in general; from now on, he would instead focus on his teaching position at the University of California, Berkeley, his plays, and his book about his father. Picnic on the Grass later had a significant theatrical run in the United States, which delighted him. ==Legacy== Rouvel signed an unusual contract which had the practical effect of giving Renoir the power to approve all her engagements for the next three years. Renoir decided to keep her away from the film industry and only accepted offers of theater roles. He rejected roles for her in The Green Mare and a film by G√©rard Oury. Rouvel returned to film acting in Claude Chabrol's Bluebeard, released in January 1963. The film Le Bonheur (1965), directed by Agn√®s Varda, pays tribute to Picnic on the Grass by including a passage which plays on a television screen. The film scholar Nancy Pogel argues in her book on Woody Allen that Allen's A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy (1982) is indebted to Picnic on the Grass. ==See also== * The Farm at Les Collettes, Cagnes * France‚ÄìGermany relations * Pan in popular culture * Physis and techne * Reproduction and pregnancy in speculative fiction ==References== Original quotations Notes Sources : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : ==External links== * * Category:1959 films Category:French-language films Category:Films directed by Jean Renoir Category:1959 romantic comedy films Category:1950s satirical films Category:Artificial insemination Category:French romantic comedy films Category:French films Category:French satirical films Category:Films based on Greco-Roman mythology Category:Eugenics in fiction Category:Films shot in Paris Category:1959 comedy films ","title":"Picnic on the Grass"},{"id":"20214764","text":"The Traffic Criminal Justice Unit is an Operational Command Unit of the London Metropolitan Police, separate from the Traffic Operational Command Unit. The unit deals with all Met traffic prosecutions involving summonses. It also processes all fixed-penalty notices and penalty notices for disorder and runs safety-camera enforcement with the London Safety Camera Partnership. ==History== In 2002 the Traffic Criminal Justice Unit was created. Primarily dealing with the processing of fixed penalties at that time, it has since developed into a fully functioning traffic prosecutions and collision investigation unit. The unit‚Äôs current primary role is to provide a criminal justice function for all MPS (Metropolitan Police Service) traffic prosecutions involving summonses and investigating collisions, carrying out the work previously done by Borough traffic process units. ==Role== There are six units within the TCJU. Traffic criminal justice Provides a Criminal Justice Unit function, which is the investigation of traffic collisions, arranging for witnesses of all Met traffic prosecutions to attend trials. When the evidence is collected and reviewed they then arrange for the summons to be issued. Regional Criminal Justice Units and Serious Casework Unit Responsible for over 100,000 traffic prosecutions each year and the investigation of fatal and serious personal injury collisions. The Serious Casework Unit also investigates police collisions. Parking and driver liability fixed penalty notices Process all MPS fixed penalty notices for a broad range of traffic offences, such as obstruction, vehicle defects, speeding, no insurance and using a mobile phone whilst driving. Penalty Notices for Disorder Process all MPS penalty notices for disorder; these cover offences such as ‚Äòdrunk and disorderly‚Äô, minor criminal damage and more serious offences such as ‚Äòcausing harassment, alarm or distress‚Äô. Safety Camera enforcement Responsible for all stages of the operation of speed cameras and red light cameras from deployment to prosecution. About 360,00 offences are processed each year with most of those being dealt with by fixed penalties, although recently the LCSP has offered Safety Awareness Courses as an alternative to more minor offenders. Warrant Unit Following the non- appearance of defendants at court, arrest warrants are sometimes issued for the defendant to be brought before the court. This information is circulated to all Met officers by the warrant team. They also maintain a database of all persons disqualified from driving by the courts. ==References== Traffic Criminal Justice Unit ","title":"Metropolitan Police Traffic Criminal Justice Unit"},{"id":"20214770","text":"Lathaniel Alanzo Rowe-Turner (born 12 November 1989) is an English semi- professional footballer who plays as a defender for club Tamworth. ==Career== Leicester City Born in Leicester, Leicestershire, Rowe-Turner started his career in the Leicester City academy.

Nixon appointed four individuals to the Supreme Court of the United States in just over five and a half years. In 1969 President Richard Nixon nominated Warren E. Burger to be the new Chief Justice of the United States after the retirement of Earl Warren. Burger was quickly confirmed. However, when in the same year, he nominated Clement Haynsworth for a vacancy created by the resignation of Abe Fortas, controversy ensued. Haynsworth was rejected by the United States Senate. In 1970 Nixon nominated G. Harrold Carswell, who also was rejected by the Senate. Nixon then nominated Harry Blackmun, who was confirmed. Nixon was shortly afterward faced with two new vacancies on the high bench due to the retirements of John Marshall Harlan and Hugo Black in 1971. In spite of the rejections of Haynesworth and Carswell, Nixon announced that he would nominate Hershel Friday and Mildred Lillie to the high bench. Neither was well regarded. Friday was a former member of the American Bar Association House of Delegates; Lillie was then a little-known judge on an intermediate state appellate court in California. After the ABA reported both Friday and Lillie as \\"unqualified\\", Nixon nominated Lewis Powell and William H. Rehnquist for the vacancies instead, and both were confirmed. At the appellate level, Nixon formally nominated one person, Charles A. Bane, for a federal appellate judgeship who was never confirmed. Nixon withdrew Bane's nomination on October 22, 1969 after controversies involving a tax case and allegations of anti-semitism. Nixon wound up filling that seat with another nominee. Nixon also considered other appeals court nominees whom he never wound up nominating. ==List of failed appellate nominees== *United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit **Illinois seat - Charles A. Bane (judgeship later filled by Nixon nominee John Paul Stevens) (Stevens later was appointed by President Gerald Ford to the Supreme Court of the United States) ==Others who were considered for nomination== During Nixon's second term, his administration considered appointing then-Deputy Solicitor General Jewel Lafontant to an unspecified federal appeals court judgeship (likely on the Seventh Circuit in her home city of Chicago). Lafontant would have been the first African-American woman to serve on a federal appeals court. However, the American Bar Association's Committee on Federal Judiciary rated Lafontant as \\"unqualified,\\" even though she held a J.D. degree from the University of Chicago Law School and had worked in government since 1969.

AMP opposed anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs), chemical warfare, biological warfare and multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), which contained multiple warheads on a single missile cone, thereby evading SALT limitations. Revenues from the sale of items imprinted with the sunflower logo supported AMP's Invest in Peace fund; the fund supported congressmen who advocated for withdrawal from Vietnam and who opposed ABMs and MIRVs. AMP sought to demonstrate a link between U.S. war policy and oil interests, and pushed for investigation into U.S. oil leases off the coast of Vietnam. In 1971, co-chairmen Barbara Avedon and Dorothy B. Jones testified before the U.S. House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee in opposition to the military budget. AMP advocated for a U.S. Department of Peace that would examine nonmilitary alternatives to conflict resolution.Schuman, Frederick L. Why a Department of Peace.

The proposed department would train citizens for public service, invest in anti-poverty programs abroad, and assume management of certain agencies such as the Agency for International Development, the Peace Corps, the International Agricultural Development Service of the Department of Agriculture, and others. Schuman argued that the Department of State‚Äôs mission was to advance U.S. national interests, not to plan for peace, and ‚Äú[p]eople get what they plan for...‚Äù Schuman, 1969, p.27.

The campaign's purpose was to pressure the manufacturers into ending their participation in the war industry by threatening to boycott their consumer products if they did not. According to a 1972 article analyzing the campaign, it was not effective because too few messages reached the target companies, and the targets were so numerous ‚Äúthat no one target was strongly affected by the campaign.‚Äù Krieger, 1971.

A Venustus is attested in the year 362, as a member of a senatorial delegation to Antioch to the emperor Julian,Ammianus Marcellinus, xxiii.1.4. who on this occasion nominated this Venustus as vicarius Hispaniarum (362-363). In 370, together with Vettius Agorius Praetextatus and Minervius, he comprised a senatorial legation to the Emperor Valentinian I, asking him not to torture those senators involved in trials.Ammianus Marcellinus, xxviii.1.24-25. According to a long-standing reconstruction by Otto Seeck, the two previous officers were the same person, who is to be identified with Venustus, the father of Virius Nicomachus Flavianus and grandfather of Nicomachus Flavianus the younger, and maybe another nephew called Venustus. This Venustus was, therefore, related to the orator Quintus Aurelius Symmachus (also father-in-law of Flavianus the younger), since he was brother-in-law of Lucius Avianus Symmachus, father of Aurelius. However, recently this interpretation has been questioned. The most-widely accepted reconstruction is that the Venustus corrector Apuliae et Calabriae and the vicarius Hispaniarum are two different persons; the first, Volusius Venustus, would be a member of the Ragonii, belonging to the generation between Lucius Ragonius Venustus consul in 240 and the Lucius Ragonius Venustus who performed a taurobolium in 390; the second, Venustus, might have been Nicomachus' father. == References  Bibliography == * Marcella Chelotti, Vincenza Morizio, Marina Silvestrini, Francesco Grelle, Mario Pani, Le epigrafi romane di Canosa, Edipuglia, 1990, , pp. 21‚Äì23. * Rita Lizzi Testa, Senatori, popolo, papi: il governo di Roma al tempo dei Valentiniani, Edipuglia, 2004, , p. 268\\\\.

Women, who learn late in her life, to enjoy an independent life, ready to claim, what belongs to them. It is the story of women in common, not trying to be bigger than life itself but on the contrary, reflect the daily life of women working and struggling to achieve something better than what life has led them. Stories of women, torn from life itself. Stories of homes in the conflict, of lies, of fiery passions and above all of that unfortunate habit of human beings: infidelity.

Brown founded, in 1962, the American Institute for Free Labor Development along with former Communist Party of America member Jay Lovestone. == Early life == Born in the Bronx, New York City, in 1911, he became a boxer before he joined a trade union, where he clashed with the Teamsters. He studied at New York University and at the Columbia University.The Most Dangerous Man, Time, 17 March 1952. During the latter half of the 1930s, Brown was an organizer for the Automobile Workers Union. In 1940 Brown began to organize for the American Federation of Labor on a national level, and by 1942 Brown had become a labor representative to the War Production Board. As a lieutenant of the US Army, he was charged in 1944 by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in works concerning the preparation of the invasion of Sicily and then concerning the landing in the south in Provence. == Cold War == He arrived in Paris in November 1945 and organized anticommunist unions. He supported in particular the creation of the French Force ouvri√®re (FO) union, which he subsidized by Andr√© Bergeron and L√©on Jouhaux in 1947, and the Italian Confederation of Workers' Trade Unions (CISL), created in 1950. Until 1986, Brown was present at every annual congresses in FO. The AFL-CIO's Free Trade Union Committee subsidized FO Roger Faligot and R√©mi Kauffer, Eminences grises, Fayard, 1992.Georges Walter, Souvenirs curieux d‚Äôune esp√®ce de Hongrois, Taillandier, 2008.Fr√©d√©ric Charpier, La CIA en France. 60 ans d'ing√©rence dans les affaires fran√ßaises, Seuil, 2008, p. 40-43. See also Les belles aventures de la CIA en France , 8 January 2008, Bakchich. and other anticommunist unions in Europe. In 1949, alongside Jay Lovestone, he supported the spin-off of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU). The ICFTU included the AFL-CIO, the British Trades Union Congress, the FO, the Italian Confederation of Workers' Trade Unions, and the Spanish Uni√≥n General de Trabajadores. Thereafter, the WFTU represented the Eastern Bloc, and the ICFTU represented the so-called \\"free world\\". As a friend of W. Averell Harriman, who was in charge of the Marshall Plan, Brown easily diverted funds from the Marshall Plan to support anticommunist organizations.Harry Kelber, ¬´ AFL-CIO‚Äôs Dark Past ¬ª, 22 November 2004, on laboreducator.org On June 26, 1950, Brown was part of the American delegation at the founding meeting of the Congress for Cultural Freedom in Berlin. By 1952, his activities were already well known, and he was the subject of an article by Time magazine, \\"The Most Dangerous Man.\\" According to Time, he was charged of the mission by the AFL Free Trade Union Committee. Brown gave financial support to anticommunist movements that broke the 1947 strikes in Italy and France. He also helped organize the anticommunist coalition of free trade unions in Greece and the Mediterranean Port Committee, which wrested control of French, Italian, and Greek ports from the communists. In Marseille, he gave his support to Pierre Ferri-Pisani, a former municipal counsellor. Established in France, he headed the international relations of the AFL-CIO from his offices at 10, rue de la Paix, in Paris. From 1951 to 1954, the CIA division, headed by Thomas Braden, provided $1 million a year to Brown and Lovestone ($1,600,000 in 1954). In 1952, he was in Helsinki to support the trade unionists who had decided to vote to quit the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) of mainly-communist unions. He also participated in Chile in the CIA's efforts to destabilize the country during Salvador Allende's presidency. In 1984, he organized the demonstrations that accompanied Mikhail Gorbachev's worldwide meetings. In the 1980s, the election of the Socialist Party candidate Fran√ßois Mitterrand to the presidency in 1981 made the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) foundation subsidize, alongside the AFL-CIO, the right-wing National Inter-University Union (UNI). Brown believed, \\"France... is threatened by the Communist apparatus.... It is a clear and present danger if the present is thought of as 10 years from now.\\"Loose Cannon: The National Endowment for Democracy, Cato Institute. ==Later life== Brown started suffering from serious health problems in 1986. He was decorated by US President Ronald Reagan in 1988 of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and he died the following year. == References  External links== * Photography of Irving Brown and commentaries * AFL and AFL-CIO International Affairs Department, Irving Brown papers at the University of Maryland Libraries Category:1920 births Category:1989 deaths Category:American trade unionists Category:CIA activities in Russia and Europe Category:American Federation of Labor people Category:AFL‚ÄìCIO people Category:Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients Category:Leaders of American trade unions Category:American anti- communists Category:People from the Bronx Category:Activists from New York (state) ","title":"Irving Brown"},{"id":"20214978","text":"The Tucson Mavericks were a minor league professional ice hockey team in the Central Hockey League from 1975 to 1976.

The company's accounting practices and subsequent bankruptcy became a scandal involving a number of its executives and those working at AOL. ==Business model and early success== The company's business model was to charge vendors and purchasers a flat monthly fee for use of the site and to take a commission on sales. The business logic was that online purchasing would save hotels money by speeding up the purchasing process for towels, linens, soap and other basic goods. The company went public on the NASDAQ exchange in September 1999 and its stock price doubled in the first day of trading. In 1999 and 2000 the company entered marketing agreements with large Internet companies and business service providers like AOL and Office Depot. At its height, the company had 1,000 employees and a market capitalization of more than $4 billion. ==Problems and bankruptcy== The company was never profitable. Despite heavily-discounted subscription fees and low margins, customers often found that buying goods online was more expensive and less convenient than traditional wholesale purchasing. The company attracted over 140,000 mostly small and medium-sized vendors by making strategic \\"preferred\\" deals. Many of these deals involved PurchasePro giving away stock or its partners providing free services, which generated losses for both sides. PurchasePro's stock value began to fall quickly in April, 2001 after it announced that it would fall short of its revenue predictions. Investors began to question the company's accounting practices and the truthfulness of its prior financial claims. Founder and CEO Charles Johnson was forced to resign by PurchasePro's board of directors in May, 2001. The company filed for bankruptcy in September, 2002, and PurchasePro's assets were sold for $2.5 million in January, 2003. ==Legal problems and founder's fraud conviction== In November 2008 a US court found the company had conspired with AOL executives to overstate revenue from software licenses that AOL sold for PurchasePro. The companies inflated the license-sales figures by not reporting that most of these sales were made in exchange for commitments to buy products from the licensees, which hid the fact that only a small fraction of customers ever paid for these licenses. PurchasePro also backdated and forged contracts to meet revenue projections. These accounting deceptions fooled investors into believing PurchasePro had met its sales projections and bolstered its stock price. Overall, revenues were overstated by 37% in the first quarter of 2001. AOL and a number of its executives reached settlements, including payment of a $210 million fine, to avoid criminal and civil prosecution. Johnson and other PurchasePro executives were charged with stock fraud. Johnson's first prosecution ended in a mistrial after his attorneys resigned upon discovering that Johnson was forging email messages to introduce false evidence in his favor. His second trial ended in November, 2008 with a conviction for stock fraud and obstruction of justice and a sentence of 8 years in prison. ==References== Category:Defunct companies based in Nevada Category:Companies based in Las Vegas Category:Corporate scandals Category:Corporate crime Category:Companies that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2002 Category:Accounting scandals Category:Fraud in the United States Category:1997 establishments in Nevada ","title":"PurchasePro"},{"id":"20215023","text":"Najat A√¢tabou (; born 1960) is a Moroccan singer, songwriter and composer.World Music Expo website http://www.womex.com/virtual/succes_theater_talent/najat_aatbouMSN Music artist biography http://music.msn.com/music/artist-biography/najat-aatabou/ Her song \\"Hadi Kedba Bayna\\" was sampled by the Chemical Brothers in their 2005 song \\"Galvanize\\". == Early life == Najat A√¢tabou was born on 9 May 1960 into a lower-class family, with five brothers and four sisters. She dreamed of becoming a lawyer, but her life would take a different direction. Singing was her favourite thing to do and she would walk to school every morning singing songs. When she reached the age of thirteen, she would sneak out of her bedroom window and sing at local weddings and school parties for money. At one of these parties, a guest recorded her voice with a tape recorder. The tape was sold illegally throughout Morocco and the song \\"J'en ai marre\\" (\\"I've had enough of it\\") became especially popular. Her family soon found out about her singing and did not accept her choice of vocation.MSN Music artist biography http://music.msn.com/music/artist-biography/najat-aatabou/ Her brothers threatened to kill her if she continued. She was afraid and decided to run away from home. She fled to the local music shop, that being her first choice because \\"they played music there\\", as she later said.

According to turn-of-the-twentieth- century research by Norman Isham, the back part of the stone house was built around 1639 by Henry Bull, a Quaker leader and one of the original settlers of Portsmouth and Newport. Bull served as a colonial militia officer and jail keeper. The original Newport jail may have been part of the house. Henry Bull died at the house in 1694 and was the last survivor of the original founders of Rhode Island. Large modifications were made to the house in later decades.

It is the most popular alcoholic drink in Ghana, and goes by many names inlucing apio, ogoglo, ogogoro (Ogog') , VC10, Kill Me Quick, Efie Nipa, Kele, Kumepreko, Anferewoase, Apiatiti, Home Boy, Nana Drobo, One Touch among others. Ghanaian moonshine is referred to as akpeteshie. ==History and origins== Before the advent of European colonization of what is today Ghana, the Anlo brewed a local spirit also known as \\"kp√≥tomenui,\\" meaning \\"something hidden in a coconut mat fence.\\" With British colonization of what became known as the Gold Coast, such local brewing was outlawed in the early 1930s. According to a 1996 interview with S.S. Dotse about his life under British colonial rule: \\"Our contention was that the drink the white man brought is the same as ours. The white men's contention was that ours was too strong...Before the white men came we were using akpeteshie. But when they came they banned it, probably because they wanted to make sales on their own liquor. And so we were calling it kp√≥tomenui. When you had a visitor whom you knew very well, then you ordered that kp√≥tomenui be brought. This is akpeteshie, but it was never referred to by name.\\" The name \\"akpeteshie\\" was given to the drink with its prohibition: the word comes from the Ga language (ape te shie, the act of hiding) spoken in greater Accra and means they are hiding, referring to the secretive way in which non-European inhabitants were forced to consume the beverage. Despite being outlawed, Illicit spirits remained commonplace, with reports that even schoolboys were able to easily obtain akpeteshie through the 1930s. Demand for akpeteshie and the profits to be made from its sale was enough to encourage the spread of sugar cane cultivation in the Anlo region of Ghana. Distillation was legalized with decolonization and Ghanaian independence. The first factory was established in the Volta Region, taking advantage of the area's supply of sugar cane plantations. ==Brewing== Akpeteshie is distilled from palm wine or sugarcane juice. This sweetened liquid or wine is first fermented in a large barrels, sometimes with the help of yeast. After this first stage of fermentation, fires are built under the barrels in order to bring the liquid to a boil and pass the resulting vapor through a copper pipe within cooling barrels, where it condenses and drips into sieved jars. The boiled juice then undergoes a distillation. The resulting spirit is between 40 and 50% alcohol by volume. ==Packaging and consumption== Akpeteshie is not professionally bottled or sealed, but instead poured into unlabeled used bottles. The spirit can be bought wholesale from a brewer or by the glass at boutiques and bars. Although not professionally advertised, the drink is very popular. This is partially due to its price, which is lower than that of other professionally bottled or imported drinks. Its relative cheapness makes it a drink associated more with the poor, but even those who can afford better quality are said to consume the spirit in secret. The potency of the liquor heavily affects the bodily senses, providing a feeling likened to that of a knockout punch. Practiced drinkers can be seen acknowledging receipt by blowing out air or pounding their chest. ==Health== Medical practitioners have been critical of the drink's high concentration of alcohol, particularly the damage it can cause the liver and the risk of alcoholism. Methanol poisoning incident 66 people in Rivers State died over a few weeks that started in April 2015 due to methanol contaminated ogogoro. ==References== Category:Ghanaian cuisine Category:Distilled drinks Category:Forestry in Ghana Category:Non-timber forest products Category:Ghanaian distilled drinks ","title":"Akpeteshie"},{"id":"20215188","text":"Sir John James Skehel, (born 27 February 1941) is a British virologist and Emeritus scientist at the Francis Crick Institute in London.

McMillan was in Illinois in 1846, and volunteered for service during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. By June 20 he was a sergeant in the 4th Illinois Infantry Regiment, and was discharged on October 13. Afterwards in 1848, McMillan enlisted as a private in the 3rd Battalion of the Louisiana Infantry on April 29, and he was discharged on July 13. After hostilities ended, McMillan moved to Indiana, where he engaged in various businesses all over the state. ==Civil War service== When the American Civil War began in 1861, McMillan chose to follow the Union cause. The 21st Indiana Infantry was raised in Indianapolis, and McMillan was appointed its colonel on July 24. The regiment participated in Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler's Union occupation of New Orleans in early 1862. His regiment then helped to successfully defend Baton Rouge on August 5 from attacks by Confederate forces commanded by Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge. In this fight McMillan had 126 men that were either killed or wounded, and he was himself wounded in his left arm and chest. After the action at Baton Rouge, McMillan's regiment was posted at Berwick Bay, near the end of the Atchafalaya River, until February 1863. At that time the 21st Indiana converted to the 1st Indiana Heavy Artillery. McMillan had been promoted to brigadier general on November 29 of the previous year, and with this rank McMillan held brigade and at times divisional command in the XIX Corps from March 1863 to May 1864. He then participated in the Red River Campaign in the spring of 1864, fighting notably in the Battle of Mansfield on April 8, as well as partaking in the Battle of Monett's Ferry on April 23. During the Battle of Mansfield at De Soto Parish, Louisiana, McMillan and the rest of the 1st Division were able to provide a steady line to rally on for the near-panicking Union retreat. Brevet Maj. Gen. James McMillan (left, seated) and his staff in 1865 That July, the XIX Corps was sent east to the Valley of Virginia, ordered to join Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan's Army of the Shenandoah that was assembling there. During that campaign, McMillan and his division fought in the Battle of Winchester on September 19, where he was wounded when a shell fragment hit him in the head. On October 19, McMillan fought with distinction during the Battle of Cedar Creek, where he again arranged his men to rally fleeing Union soldiers, providing a place to regroup for the coming rout of Lt. Gen. Jubal A. Early's Confederate forces. After the campaign in the Valley, McMillan was ordered to lead a \\"provisional\\" or temporary division in March 1865, with his headquarters in Grafton, West Virginia, until the end of the war that April. McMillan was appointed a brevet major general on March 5 for his war service, and resigned from the Union Army on May 15. ==Postbellum== After resigning, McMillan relocated to Kansas. In 1875, he moved to Washington, D.C., to begin serving as a member of the Pension Bureau review board, a post he held until 1903.

He attended primary school in GlƒÉvile and entered the Bucharest Central Seminary in 1933. Official biography At the age of 15, Anania, while a student at the Seminary, joined the local organization of the Cross Brotherhood (FrƒÉ»õia de Cruce), part of the Iron Guard, being introduced to it by an older student.Fragmente de jurnal: Tinere≈£ea verzuie a lui Anania , Evenimentul Zilei, October 25, 2008 However, he claimed that within the Cross Brotherhood at the Seminary, politics was not discussed and the group was not anti-Semitic, like the rest of the Iron Guard.\\"Ziua Patriarhului\\" , Ziua, September 12, 2007 Anania graduated the Seminary in 1941. That year, he spent three weeks under arrest, being accused of participating at the funeral of a member of the Iron Guard. In 1942, he was tonsured a monk at the Antim Monastery,\\"IPS Daniel si IPS Bartolomeu, in finala\\", Evenimentul Zilei, September 12, 2007 graduating from Bucharest's Mihai Viteazul High School the following year. In 1944, Hierodeacon Bartolomeu began studying Medicine and at the Cluj Conservatory, but he was expelled after organizing a student strike against the new communist government of Petru Groza. Afterwards, he continued his studies at the Theology Faculty of the University of Bucharest and the Theological Academies of Cluj and Sibiu, receiving his degree in the latter city in 1948. Communist era Anania, accused of being associated with the Iron Guard, was arrested by the Communist authorities in 1958 and incarcerated at the Aiud prison.\\"Bartolomeu Anania ar putea candida la func≈£ia de Patriarh\\", BBC Romanian, September 5, 2007 Another political prisoner at Aiud, Grigore Caraza, accused Anania of having actively participated in the 're-education' of prisoners, a charge categorically denied by Anania. In August 1964, he was freed and only a few months later, in February 1965, he was sent by the communist regime to become an Archimandrite of the Romanian Orthodox Church in the United States and Canada, also editing a religious newspaper called Credin»õa (\\"The Faith\\").La inchisoarea Aiud, legionarul Anania se ocupa cu \\"reeducarea\\" comunista a camarazilor sai , Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ, February 4, 2006 The short time between his release from prison and the time when he was sent to the United States has been seen as a sign that he had links to the Romanian Securitate. This idea has been supported by Ion Mihai Pacepa, who argued in a 1992 book that Archimandrite Bartolomeu was an agent of the External Intelligence department of the Securitate who was sent to the United States to divide the Romanian community.Ion Mihai Pacepa, Red Horizons: Chronicles of a Communist Spy Chief, 1987. , p. 284 According to the latest results of the archive investigations, Metropolitan Bartolomeu Anania did not collaborate with the Securitate, \\"neither in detention, nor in freedom; neither in the country, nor abroad; neither with commitment, nor without commitment; neither with conspiracy, nor with names own, \\"as he himself stated during his life. His statements were confirmed by the documentary Ioana Diaconescu (CNSAS researcher) Bartolomeu Anania.

From 1976 to 1982, he was head of the Church's Biblical and Missionary Institute; afterward, he retreated to VƒÉratec Monastery, where he began retranslating Bible using as source for Old Testament the Septuagint (since the 1930s, the Romanian Orthodox Church Bible uses as its reference text the Masoretic Text). After the 1989 Revolution On January 21, 1993 he was chosen Archbishop of Vad, Feleac and Cluj. Following a controversial decision of the Holy Synod, in 2006, the archdiocese was elevated to the rank of metropolis, making Archbishop Bartolomeu the first Metropolitan of Cluj, Alba, Cri»ôana and Maramure»ô.\\"Leul Ardealului\\", Mitropolit, Evenimentul Zilei, March 26, 2006 In 1999, after the Church's failed attempt to convince politicians to endorse a proposal to give Senatorial seats to the Orthodox Church Synod's members, Archbishop Bartolomeu made two public requests. The first one was that the Church be able to select parliamentary candidates and then have priests urge parishioners during sermons to vote for them, while the second request repeated the proposal of making the 27-member Synod members of the Senate, arguing that the state was never really separated from the church. A law to this effect was drafted but never brought up for discussion in parliament.Lavinia Stan, Lucian Turcescu, \\"The Romanian Orthodox Church and Post-Communist Democratisation\\", in Europe-Asia Studies, Vol. 52, No. 8 (Dec., 2000), pp. 1472 Nevertheless, after the 2000 elections, he reconsidered the involvement of clergymen in politics. In 2004, he made a proposal, which was approved by the Synod, not to allow priests to run in elections, giving an ultimatum to priests currently involved in politics to choose between the priesthood and politics.\\"Eastern Europe: Orthodox Church Still Wields Political Clout\\", RFE/RL, February 19, 2004 In 2007, he was a candidate for the office of Patriarch, but he lost to Daniel Ciobotea, who received from the Church Electoral College 95 votes, against 66 for Bartolomeu.Biserica Ortodoxa Romana si-a ales Intaistatatorul - Patriarhul Daniel , Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ, September 13, 2007 Following unsuccessful treatment in Vienna in early 2011, Anania died in Cluj-Napoca of heart failure and aortic valve stenosis at age 89.

Elena Nicolae, \\"Drumul lui Bartolomeu spre Ve≈ünicie\\" (\\"Bartolomeu's Funeral\\"), AdevƒÉrul, February 4, 2011 ==Opinions== Metropolitan Bartolomeu was known as a conservative voice within the church. Politically, he asserted that he had always been attracted by the right wing. Voicing disagreement with the Western world, he argued that it is built exclusively on politics and economics, lacking any trace of spirituality, culture or religion. Following the repeal of Article 200 (regarding homosexuality), he decried the Westernization of Romania, claiming that \\"Europe asks us to accept sex, homosexuality, vices, drugs, abortions and genetic engineering, including cloning\\". He also condemned the way in which television stations \\"manipulate\\" viewers and use violent programs to \\"poison the souls of Romanians\\", arguing that such programs are harming people's personalities and make them unable to tell good from evil.\\"Romanian Orthodox church leader condemns television for \\"poisoning souls\\"\\", IHT (AP), August 15, 2007 In 2002, he was among a group of intellectuals who voiced their opposition to the building of a vampire theme park called Dracula Park, claiming that vampires are not a part of Romanian mythology (which instead has other monsters, like Muma PƒÉdurii and zgrip≈£uroaica).[\\"Oamenii de cultura ardeleni au protestat impotriva infiintarii Dracula Park\\"], AdevƒÉrul, April 4, 2002 While he supported the neutrality of the Church in politics, in 2007 he did join seven other high-ranking Orthodox clerics in signing an appeal against the decision of the parliament to begin impeachment proceedings against President Traian BƒÉsescu, calling the procedure \\"immoral politics\\". Regarding ecumenism, Bartolomeu argued that unifying all Christians within one Church is a far-fetched goal.\\"Biserica OrtodoxƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ √Æ≈üi alege noul Patriarh\\", BBC, September 11, 2007 Bartolomeu Anania, as Metropolitan, joined the dispute over the biometric passports, signing in 2009 a public statement (together with all the bishops of his metropolitan see), in which he claimed that the usage of biometric chips in passports is offensive to the Romanian people, whom, he claims, are therefore treated as a potential gang of criminals.

The Corps was forming in Corinth, Mississippi, when it was made the II Corps, Army of the Mississippi. It contained two divisions; the first one was under Jones Withers and the second was under Daniel Ruggles. The II Corps numbered 22,000 men, making it the largest in the Confederate Army, and was placed under command of Braxton Bragg. At its first battle (Shiloh), the Corps initially drove Benjamin Prentiss's Union division from their camps. But when Prentiss, Wallace and their divisions dug in at the Hornet's Nest, Bragg assaulted the position from all sides for hours without dislodging them. Suffering heavily, the Second Corps was completely disorganized by the time they forced Prentiss out and was held in reserve for the rest of the battle, briefly fighting on the second day. With many line officers killed or wounded, the Corps took months to refit. Fighting in the Corinth Campaign, the Corps was later re- organized for its next operation in September 1862, the invasion of Kentucky. ==Service and reorganization== The II Corps after Corinth was again reorganized with two divisions, the first under Patton Anderson and the second under Simon Buckner. The Corps was now led by William Hardee, and Braxton Bragg was promoted to army command. The Corps was only lightly engaged at Perryville, however, and the entire Army wasn't even present. The Corps and the entire Army were re-organized again. John Breckinridge and his division, who had fought at Shiloh but were absent at Perryville, were now attached. Numbering 11,000 men, his division boosted the strength of the corps by 40%. Anderson's division was dispersed between Buckner and the I Corps, but to replace him was a division from Kirby Smith's Army under John Mcown. Buckner was sent to Knoxville, but his division was then placed under the brilliant commander Patrick Cleburne. The Corps all in all numbered approximately 25,000 men; McCown's division had 5,000, Breckinridge had 11,000 and Cleburne had 9,000. ==Stones River and middle Tennessee== After the reorganization in the fall of 1862, the Army of Tennessee was ready for action, as was the Second Corps. This action took place at Murfreesboro, in the Battle of Stones River. The battle began when William Rosecrans and his Army of the Cumberland marched south from Nashville against Bragg at Murfreesboro. Bragg ordered an assault on the Union right flank, where George Thomas and Alexander McCook's corps were stationed. In a pre-dawn assault similar to Shiloh, Hardee's Corps was the spearhead when McCown's division attacked at 5:30 am. His attack, as well as Cleburne's, threw the entire Union force in flight, pushing both corps back over a mile. Weary and exhausted, they stopped as Polk and his Corps were to finish the job. Leonidas Polk mismanaged his assaults, and all Confederate gains by the II Corps were squandered and not exploited. Eventually, it fell to the II Corps to do the work again, and they eventually drove Sheridan's division, who kept Polk stopped all afternoon. The battle otherwise was a Confederate success so far, mainly due to Hardee and the II corps. The next two days decided the final outcome. Rather than following up on victory, Braxton Bragg waited a day, then on January 2 attacked Rosecrans with the reserve of the army, Breckinridge's division from the II corps. Breckinridge was ordered to assault the Union left, Thomas Crittenden's Corps over open ground and a river. Breckinridge, Hardee, Cleburne and the other officers protested, but Bragg didn't listen. Breckinridge drove the first Union division at the river in a suicidal charge, but was bloodied once he attacked the main line. Bragg retreated the next day, with the II Corps as the rear guard. ==Chickamauga-Chattanooga== The Corps was reorganized yet again after Stones River. Alexander Stewart and his division of 6,000 were attached to the II Corps, but Breckinridge and his division were sent to help the Siege of Vicksburg. The Confederate Army was idle for the next few months, until Breckinridge returned. When he did, due to arguments with Bragg, Hardee and McCown were relieved and the Corps was again reorganized. Daniel Harvey Hill was sent from the Army of Northern Virginia to take command, who proved to be one of the best commanders of that Corps. The Corps was re-organized with divisions under Stewart, Cleburne and Breckinridge, all in all 20,000 men. McCown's old division was now placed under St. John Liddell, and moved to the reserve Corps under William H.T. Walker. After campaigning for a few months in Tennessee, Bragg was driven out to Chattanooga, and then lost that city. In north Georgia, however, he re-formed for a counterstrike. Troops from Mississippi came under Walker and Forrest, soldiers from east Tennessee under Buckner, troops from Georgia, Kentucky, east Tennessee and Mississippi under Burshod Johnson and troops from Virginia under James Longstreet. The army was again re-organized; Hill lost Stewart's division, which was sent to Buckner's Corps, but he still had Cleburne and Breckinridge. The corps was heavily engaged at Chickamauga, assaulting the Union left. After the Confederates broke through on the left, the II Corps did the same on the right, securing the Confederate victory. The Corps suffered heavily in the battle however, and was exhausted. Hill, as well as many other officers, wished to pursue the broken enemy, but Bragg declined and in turn relieved Hill, Polk, Wallker, Forrest and other officers from command. At Chattanooga, the Corps was re- organized. Breckinridge took command of the Corps with his old division under William B. Bate, Cleburne's division though, the pride of the II Corps, was transferred to the I Corps. Buckner's division from his old Corps was sent to the II only to be transferred up to Knoxville with James Longstreet. Thomas Hindman's division was transferred to the II from the I, and lastly, on a brighter note, Stewart and his division were returned to the II from Buckner's old corps. All in all between Bate, Stewart, Buckner and Hindman, the Corps numbered close to 28,000 men. Once Buckner left it was down to 23,000 men. At the battle itself, the II Corps was stationed in the center on Missionary Ridge as well as Orchard Knob in a salient. When Orchard Knob was taken, the Union force under George Thomas attacked the center and broke the II Corps, sending them fleeing in confusion. But with light casualties on both sides, the battle didn't inflict much damage, other than damaging Confederate morale. ==Atlanta== The Corps was reorganized again in December when Joseph Johnston took command from the incompetent Braxton Bragg. Although he had nothing to be blamed for at Chattanooga, John Breckinridge was relieved of command and replaced by John Bell Hood; who had come from the east with Longstreet's Corps. The corps was the same as it was at Chattanooga, except that Bate and his division were traded in for Carter Stevenson's division of the I corps. By that time, none of the units originally in the II were still in it. The corps fought in all the engagements of the campaign, and at Reasca and New Hope Church they played key roles. At Kennesaw Mountain, its soldiers disobeyed orders to attack the flanking columns of John Schofield's Army of the Ohio and drove them back in a decisive manner. Once Hood took command of the Army, there was another reorganization. Stewart took command, but was transferred to the III Corps, then Stevenson took command, then Cheatham, then Stewart again, then Hindman, and finally Stephen D. Lee. All of these changes took place within a time span of three months. The Corps was heavily engaged at Atlanta and at Ezra Church, where they suffered heavy losses. ==Invasion of Tennessee== After Atlanta fell to William T. Sherman, Hood went north with his army, but made a few changes. In the II corps, easterner S.D. Lee was still in command, but his division commanders were different. Stevenson was at his usual post, but H.D. Clayton took over Stewart's division, the latter taking command of the III corps. Hindman was relieved and in his place was a newly exchanged former prison-of-war, Edward Johnson, an easterner. The Corps marched north into Tennessee, but missed the bloodbath at Franklin, and cost Hood the battle. Like d'Erlon's I Corps at Ligny and Quatre Bras in the Waterloo campaign, the Corps never advanced on Schofield's rear by seizing his line of retreat on the Cumberland. Thus, for the first time in its history, the II Corps cost their commander the battle. At Nashville, however, the Corps took the center when they were assaulted by an old nemesis, George Thomas. They were pushed back, and the II corps then was transferred to the right flank. The starving Confederates fled without much defense, and cost Hood another battle. ==Final glory== After Nashville in the early spring of 1865, the Confederate Army was discouraged; there was no hope for the cause. Hood resigned, and the Army went to Joseph Johnston again. The corps was re- organized again, with Stevenson, Clayton and Stovall in command of the divisions, and Johnson had been captured once again. The remnants of the Army were transferred to stop Sherman in the Carolinas. In this campaign the corps was commanded by D. H. Hill again. At Bentonville, the Confederates were to assault an isolated Union force under Slocum, and the II Corps was to lead the spearhead in a flank attack. The attack drove the Union troops for miles, and they cheered \\"Nashville\\" and routed two divisions. Hill's leadership led Confederate arms to success, but due to Lee's surrender, the II Corps did as well with the small Army of Tennessee. ==Assessment== Like the corps in the Army of Northern Virginia, the II Corps of the Army of Tennessee proved to be an excellent formation. Its commanders were mixed and often changed. All in all, at Chickamauga the corps reached its best point, but was still great in Atlanta and Bentonville, as well as Stones River. The debate of which commander was best is still in debate, but generally Hood, Hill and Hardee are considered the corps' best.

This emission trading scheme (ETS) creates a carbon market where emitters can buy and sell emission credits. From this scheme, China can limit emissions, but allow economic freedom for emitters to reduce emissions or purchase emission allowances from other emitters. China is currently the largest emitter of greenhouse gases (GHG) and many major Chinese cities have severe air pollution. If fully implemented, China would be the largest market in carbon trading. The scheme eventually plans to limit emissions from six of China's top carbon dioxide emitting industries, including coal-fired power plants. China was able to gain experience in drafting and implementation of an ETS plan from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), where China was part of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). From this experience with carbon markets, and lengthy discussions with the next largest carbon market, the European Union (EU), as well as analysis of small scale pilot markets in major Chinese cities and provinces, China's national ETS will be the largest of its kind and will help China achieve its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) from the Paris Agreement. == Plan specifics == China promised in the Conference of Parties to reduce their carbon intensity per unit of GDP by 60-65% by 2030. To achieve this, they decided to use market-based mechanisms. They developed the Clean Development Mechanism, which consists in a ‚Äúbottom up‚Äù architecture. China has learned from the European Union, whose carbon trading market is currently twice as big, along with California in the United States, to implement mechanisms such as cap and trade. The idea is to create an international market through exchanges where allowances are traded and carbon emissions get monitored and reported. In the 2010s the nation implemented seven pilot carbon markets in various zones that thrive on production of cement, electricity, heat, petroleum and oil extraction. These zones are: Beijing, Chongqing, Guangdong, Hubei, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Tianjin, which represent 25% of China's total GDP. These stationary activities are known for being the most polluting and the largest emitters of GHG. Since the pilot plan started, it is estimated that 40.24 million metric tons of carbon dioxide has been traded. These pilot zones proved the cap and trade efficiency. Cap refers to a permitted amount of emissions, if the industry exceed said limitation, it would require an allowance. Allowances can be traded, auctioned or even given away for free, depending on the case. Through cap and trade, it is believed that both competitiveness and possibly carbon leakage will be reduced. Each cap and allowance was assigned to the cities according to their purpose, production rates, or ability to pass along the costs of carbon along the consumer chain. The caps of greenhouse gas emissions vary from 30-350 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year when the price for carbon varies from $1.4-$13.00 US dollars per ton of carbon dioxide. There also are 2 types of allowances: new entry vs. governmental. The new entry allowances are for those who are in need for growth and are freely distributed, whereas the governmental allowance is a fixed, stable fraction that must be sold or auctioned. There are also conditions that each zone must uphold, mainly regarding monitoring, reporting and verification. Each zone has their own mechanism of doing so, but they all face the same kind of penalties if failing to do so. These penalties include: a reduction of free allowances, a threat to publicizing said status in order to create social pressure, a 2-year restricted access to special funds for energy research and if an excess of emission were to take place, the zone's government or company would have to pay 3 times the original allowance price. == Difficulties == There are challenges to China achieving these goals. The country will have to ensure that there will not be any overlap with already existing policies on prevention, reduction and consumption of pollutants. The country will also have to strictly monitor and enforce the scheme, and make sure that there is end to end transparency. There will also need to be special attention to carbon leakage and on price volatility. Since the pilot cities began this project, the price of carbon and caps has fluctuated. The government will also need to make sure that there is an efficient trade and exchange of allowances on the spot market. There will also need to be an plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to achieve their Paris agreement. On the other hand, policy makers face a struggle to allocate allowances. For the free allowance, they need to think about whom to give them to. for the auctioned ones, they need to think about the type of auction that is most convenient, and for the combined ones, all of the above. == Influences == Prior to the conception and design of China's national carbon trading scheme, carbon emission trading (CET) had never been done in China. With no CET experience to draw from, in late 2011 the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) approved two provinces and five cities of varying degrees of economic development as pilots. In the Notice on Launching Pilots for Emissions Trading System (ETS), the NDRC approved Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Chongqing, Hubei, Guangdong, and Shenzhen as ETS pilots. Shenzhen was the first pilot to launch, on June 18, 2013, and was soon followed by the other designated pilots, which all completed their first compliance period by June 2015. All of the pilots with compliance data had compliance rates of over 96%, with Shanghai having the highest compliance rate at 100% and Tianjin having the lowest compliance rate at 96.5%. In order to aid the design of implementation details in China's national carbon trading scheme, each of the pilots was given the freedom to decide values for trading scheme parameters such as allowance allocation, coverage of sectors, and punishment mechanisms. They also vary in their approach to transactions, issues with price uncertainty, and managing risk. To assess the success of one pilot's trading scheme versus another, market performance was considered. The pilots' approach to allowance allocation were largely based on historical emissions for most sectors except the power sector, which was allocated an allowance based on benchmarks and production. Guangdong was the only pilot to implement auctioning allowances for its power sector. Additionally, all pilots except Hubei allowed allowance rollover into the next compliance period. To standardize monitoring, reporting, and verification of carbon data, the NDRC issued monitoring and reporting regulations. Enterprises were required to monitor and report their emissions, which was compared to a report from a third-party verification agency. Discrepancies in the reports above a threshold would require a re- verification. For most pilots, this threshold was set at a difference of 10% or 100 thousand tons. Funding required for verification was supplied by the local government rather than the enterprise, in order to reduce the compliance burden. Five of the pilot programs allowed individuals to participate in carbon trading while two only allowed enterprises to do so. Transaction formats varied slightly but were all in spot markets with no carbon futures. In all pilots, enterprises needed to pay the cost of trading, which was a two- way charging scheme. In order to ensure stability in the carbon market, each pilot set a price limit based on the closing price of carbon in the previous compliance period, as well as limits on maximum allowance holdings for enterprises. Each pilot implemented varying degrees of fines for faking carbon data or withholding data. Shenzhen was the only pilot to implement a variable fine, setting it as three times the market clearing price times the excess emissions. Other pilot programs charged a flat fee. All pilots deducted the excess emissions from the next period's allowance for the enterprise in question. From the pilot program's inception to May 2015, 20.27 MtCO2e had been traded for a total value of 720 million CNY. The carbon price for Shenzhen and Guangdong were the greatest, ranging from 60 to 80 CNY. The price fluctuated more in Shenzhen and Tianjin when compared to other pilots, especially near the compliance period deadline and near the beginning of new periods. The transitive behavior of the carbon market is a result more so of trading entities' understanding of policy and the timing of carbon data acquisition rather than market demand. From the pilot program data, China should improve on the designs of the pilot programs in order to achieve a stable and stimulated national carbon market. == Economic analysis == The scheme set the initial carbon allowances to 3‚Äì5 billion tonnes per year. Comparing this to the EU-ETS scheme, it is almost twice as much as the EU allowance. By the time of July 2016, EU-ETS is the world's largest carbon trading system, with a carbon market of two billion tonnes per year. the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) announced that eight sectors would be included in this market, these eight sectors are petrochemicals, chemicals, building materials, steel, ferrous metals, paper-making, power- generation and aviation. The companies that participate in this market are compulsory to use more designated amount of energy. The current number is 10,000 tonnes of standard coal equivalent of energy per year. According to seven pilot cities (7 trial carbon market in China) average price, the launch price would be set to be around 5 dollars per ton, which would generate a revenue of $0.17 to $1.16 billion in the first trading year. The expected carbon trading volume would increase to 7‚Äì58 billion dollars per year after 2020 since more market would be introduced to the carbon trading system. The first auction for vintage 2016 allowances happened in Guangdong on September 21. This was held by the China Emission Exchange of Guangdong. The settlement price was $1.48 per ton, exceeding the set floor price (reserve) of $1.40 per ton for the 500,000 tonnes auctioned. In the future, China's carbon trading allowance would expect to be increase to 3‚Äì5 billion tonnes of CO2, which would bring a revenue of around 60‚Äì400 CNY. ==See also== * Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), United Nations * Personal carbon trading * Politics of global warming ==References * Clean Development Mechanism in China Category:Emissions trading Category:Climate change programs Category:Carbon finance Category:Energy in China Category:Environmental policy in China ","title":"Chinese national carbon trading scheme"},{"id":"20215555","text":"Astragalus didymocarpus is a species of milkvetch known by the common names Dwarf white milkvetch and Two-seeded milkvetch.

It originally aired on November 10, 2008. ==Plot== In the bar, Barney is unimpressed with the women there, not seeing anyone attractive. Ted points out a group of women in the corner who they agree are hot, but Barney states they are simply experiencing the \\"cheerleader effect\\": as a group, they look hot, but seen individually, each one is unattractive. As he concludes this observation, Barney receives a call, in which he is told he is going to be a father. He panics, not wanting to have kids, and prays to God for help when he receives news that the woman is not actually pregnant. He is so happy he dances down the street to Marshall's office, where he announces he is going to create a holiday for childless men like him, called \\"Not a Father's Day\\". He produces some merchandise, including T-shirts, mugs and cards, and the holiday gains a large following. Marshall and Lily notice babies everywhere, and have a discussion about having children. Lily tries to point out possible problems, but Marshall is too caught up in how cute babies are. They decide to have a baby, but are soon interrupted by Robin, who is living with them while she looks for a job and apartment. They ask her to stay at Ted's while they have a romantic evening, and she reluctantly agrees. Marshall is told by his boss that he needs to be at a conference that night, and so cannot spend the night with Lily. After telling her about this, Lily begins to think seriously about having kids, and starts to panic. She asks Ted and Robin over to her apartment to help her decide, with Ted supporting the idea to have a baby, and Robin opposing the idea. Lily says that Marshall only focuses on the positive, while she sees problems they might have after speaking with other new parents. Robin says that although Ted does not have children, he often lectures the rest of the group and tells bad jokes like a father would. Ted replies that Robin is afraid of babies, not wanting to hold them and letting them sniff her like a dog. Lily gets drunk and after seeing their neighbor's baby's sock, she decides to have a baby, and runs out while Ted and Robin are arguing. As Marshall prepares for his conference, he finds a drunk Lily in his office, ready to make a baby. She quickly causes trouble, pulling out Marshall's files and throwing up in his trash bin and dancing around and stripping in the background of his presentation. While trying to find Lily, Ted and Robin continue to argue over kids, with Robin pointing out all the problems they cause, while Lily illustrates them until Marshall puts her in a cab to get her to fall asleep and takes her home. They go to the bar, and encounter Barney's group, proudly celebrating the fact they are childless. When Robin goes to look for Lily in the bathroom, Ted answers her phone, and Marshall tells him he has Lily. While putting her phone back, Ted finds the baby's sock in Robin's bag. While she denies it at first, Robin eventually admits that she took the sock, saying she is confused at the moment, having no place to live. Ted invites her to move in with him while she looks for a place, and she accepts. Barney tells Ted and Robin how proud he is of the holiday he created, but Ted tells him it is a day for losers and he himself is experiencing the cheerleader effect, and individually, the guys are all geeks and weirdos, and are not childless by choice. They leave Barney in the bar with this revelation, where he finds the sock, and sees how cute it is. The next morning, Lily tells Marshall she sees now that he is ready for a baby, as he took care of her so well. Marshall says he is not ready to balance work and children, so they decide to wait a bit longer. As the episode ends, Barney is seen at the karaoke bar, tearfully singing \\"Cat's in the Cradle\\" while holding the sock. ==Production== The episode had the title \\"Jeremy's Sock\\" but was changed to \\"Not a Father's Day\\". ==Critical response== Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode 8.5 out of 10.

The Mahanoy and Broad Mountain Railroad, predecessor of the Reading Company opened the Mahanoy Plane on July 16, 1861. The Plane traversed Broad Mountain between the boroughs of Mahanoy Plane and Frackville. With a pitch of 28 degrees at its steepest point, the plane rose over a distance of . A engine could hoist a three car trip, equivalent to 200 tons in three minutes. After a fire in 1886, new engines were installed. These were supposedly the most powerful engines in the world, later surpassed only by the engines operating the locks on the Panama Canal. Approximately 800 to 900 railroad cars passed over the plane every twenty-four hours. The Mahanoy Plane ceased operation on February 27, 1932, due to the decline of Anthracite and the much easier route through the Mahanoy Tunnel. Foundations are all that remain and there are currently no plans of historical preservation or restoration.

A view of the south pole of the Moon showing where reflectance and temperature data indicate the possible presence of surface water ice. The lunar south pole is of special interest to scientists because of the occurrence of water ice in permanently shadowed areas around it. The lunar south pole region features craters that are unique in that the near-constant sunlight does not reach their interior. Such craters are cold traps that contain a fossil record of hydrogen, water ice, and other volatiles dating from the early Solar System. In contrast, the lunar north pole region exhibits a much lower quantity of similarly sheltered craters. ==Geography== Lunar south polar region as imaged by Diviner. The lunar south pole is located on the center of the polar Antarctic Circle (80¬∞S to 90¬∞S).Lunar South Pole. NASA. 2017. Accessed on 16 July 2019.The Lunar Arctic Circle. Xefer. October 10, 2011. The lunar south pole has shifted 5 degrees from its original position billions of years ago. This shift has changed the rotational axis of the Moon, allowing sunlight to reach previously shadowed areas, but the south pole still features some completely shadowed areas. The axis spin is 88.5 degrees from the plane of the elliptic. On the contrary, the pole also contains areas with permanent exposure to sunlight. The south pole region features many craters and basins such as the South Pole‚ÄìAitken basin, which appears to be one of the most fundamental features of the Moon, and mountains, such as Epsilon Peak at 9.050 km, taller than any mountain found on Earth.Lunar South Pole. (2017). Fossweb.com. Retrieved 29 March 2017. The south pole temperature averages at approximately . Craters The rotational axis of the Moon lies within Shackleton Crater. Notable craters nearest to the lunar south pole include De Gerlache, Sverdrup, Shoemaker, Faustini, Haworth, Nobile, and Cabeus. ==Discoveries== Degree of the slopes found near the south pole of the Moon Illumination The lunar south pole features a region with crater rims exposed to near constant solar illumination, yet the interior of the craters are permanently shaded from sunlight. The area's illumination was studied using high resolution digital models produced from data by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. The lunar surface can also reflect solar wind as energetic neutral atoms. On average, 16% of these atoms have been protons that varies based on location. These atoms have created an integral flux of backscattered hydrogen atoms due to the reflected amount of plasma that exists on the surface of the Moon. They also reveal the line boundary and the magnetic dynamics within the regions of these neutral atoms on the Moon' surface.Vorburger, A. (2015). \\"Imaging the South Pole‚ÄìAitken basin in backscattered neutral hydrogen atoms.\\" Planetary And Space Science, 115, 57‚Äì63. Cold traps Cold traps are some of the important places on the lunar south pole region in terms of possible water ice and other volatile deposits. Cold traps can contain water and ice that were originally from comets, meteorites and solar wind-induced iron reduction. From experiments and sample readings, scientists were able to confirm that cold traps do contain ice. Hydroxyl has also been found in these cold traps. The discovery of these two compounds has led to the funding of missions focusing primarily on the lunar poles using global scale infrared detection. The ice stays in these traps because of the thermal behavior of the Moon that are controlled by thermophysical properties such as scattered sunlight, thermal re-radiation, internal heat and light given off by the Earth. Magnetic surface There are areas of the Moon where the crust is magnetized. This is known as a magnetic anomaly due to the remnants of metal iron that was emplaced by the impactor that formed the South Pole‚ÄìAitken basin (SPA basin). However, the concentration of iron that is thought to be in the basin was not present in the mappings, as they could be too deep in the Moon's crust for the mappings to detect. Or the magnetic anomaly is caused by another factor that does not involve metallic properties. The findings were proven inadequate due to the inconsistencies between the maps that were used, and also, they were not able to detect the magnitude of the magnetic fluctuations at the Moon's surface. ==Exploration== Missions Lunar south polar region map (>80¬∞S). Orbiters from several countries have explored the region around the lunar south pole. Extensive studies were conducted by the Lunar Orbiters, Clementine, Lunar Prospector, Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, Kaguya, and Chandrayaan-1, that discovered the presence of lunar water. NASA's LCROSS mission found a significant amount of water in Cabeus. NASA's LCROSS mission deliberately crashed into the floor of Cabeus and from samples found that it contained nearly 5% water.[(2017).

This mission will help scientists see if the lunar south pole region has enough sustainable resources to sustain a permanent crewed station. The LRO carries the Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment, which is investigating the radiation and thermophysical properties of the south pole surface. It can detect reflected solar radiation and internal infrared emissions. The LRO Diviner is able to detect where water ice could be trapped on the surface.

Role in the future exploration and observations The lunar south pole region is deemed as a compelling spot for future exploration missions and suitable for a lunar outpost. The permanently shadowed places on the Moon could contain ice and other minerals, which would be vital resources for future explorers. The mountain peaks near the pole are illuminated for large periods of time and could be used to provide solar energy to an outpost. With an outpost on the Moon scientists will be able to analyze water and other volatile samples dating back to the formation of the Solar System.

Before Longjiang-2, no space observatory had been able to observe astronomical radio waves in this frequency because interference waves from equipment on Earth. The lunar south pole has mountains and basins that are not facing Earth and would be an ideal place to receive such astronomical radio signals from a ground radio observatory.

The show was hosted each year by a leading star of BBC TV and featured specially made short seasonal editions (typically about 10 minutes long) of the previous year's most popular BBC sitcoms and light entertainment programs. Most of the variety segments no longer exist in accordance with the BBC's policy of wiping at the time, prevalent into the late 1970s. From 1969 to 1973, ITV countered with its own annual Christmas variety show, All Star Comedy Carnival, while the BBC itself resurrected the format in 1982 with a special titled The Funny Side of Christmas. Since its original run, Christmas Night with the Stars has been revived twice, with Fry and Laurie in 1994, and with Michael Parkinson in 2003. In 2005, the show was voted 24th in Channel 4's 100 Greatest Christmas Moments. ==Some featured television programmes== * All Gas and Gaiters * Bachelor Father * Beggar my Neighbour * Dad's Army * Dixon of Dock Green * Faces of Jim * Hugh and I * Marriage Lines * Not in Front of the Children * Oh, Brother! * On the Buses * Steptoe and Son * Sykes and a... * The Likely Lads * The Liver Birds * The Rag Trade * The Two Ronnies * Till Death Us Do Part ==Chronological listing of episodes== 1958 Christmas Night with the Stars Broadcast on Thursday 25 December 1958.

Later, for six years, he served as senior chair of theology at the University of Dillingen, where he disputed with Protestants and worked with the Bishop of Augsburg to establish a Catholic academic stronghold. In May 1555 he was sent to London to take part in the late stages of the persecutions that led to the executions of the Oxford Martyrs, and was more generally involved in Reginald Pole's efforts to solidify England's return to Catholicism under Mary I. He served as theology professor at the University of Oxford from October 1555 to August 1556, teaching a course on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, with the Regius Professorship of Hebrew being temporarily appropriated to give him a position. He was first theologian of Pope Pius IV at the third convocation of the Council of Trent (1559), but was accused in 1560 by the Inquisition in Valladolid of being influenced by Lutheranism, largely on the basis of having urged approval of Bartolom√© Carranza's Catechism, and comments he made at the Council. During the Council he wrote scripture-based poems that were set to music by the Flemish composer Jacobus de Kerle which reportedly influenced the deliberations of the Council Fathers on sacred music.Patrick Bergin Jr. (2009).

It aired on MBC from March 8 to April 27, 2008 on Saturdays and Sundays at 21:40 for 16 episodes. A romantic dramedy about a 39-year-old housewife who finds love with a top actor after a painful divorce, it was a modest hit on the small screen, with its final episode recording a 19.5% viewership rating. Choi, one of South Korea's most beloved actresses, shocked the nation when she took her own life in October 2008, five months after the TV series ended. ==Plot== Hong Sun-hee (Choi Jin-sil) is a 39-year-old housewife facing extreme financial difficulties due to her husband Ahn Yoo-shik's (Kim Byung-se) mounting debt. One day, Yoo-shik disappears, leaving Sun-hee to take care of the household. She later learns that he has married a rich woman. Now a single divorced mother with a thirteen-year-old daughter, Sun-hee runs into top actor Song Jae-bin (Jung Joon-ho) at a commercial shoot, and he turns out to be none other than her first boyfriend, Jang Dong-chul. Sun-hee was once the prettiest girl in high school, but in the years since she has let herself go and is now a middle-aged, plain-looking housewife, which is why Jae-bin doesn't recognize her at first. Greatly disappointed to find his first love so much changed, the egoistic, self-absorbed actor tries to avoid her. But the famous star is not without problems, either. To maintain his popularity, he deceives people about his age, background, history and even his name. Little wonder he is embarrassed to meet Sun-hee again, who knows all about his past. But Jae-bin's feelings change when Sun-hee moves into his home as a housekeeper and nanny to his nephew Hoon, son of his older brother and manager Dong-hwa (Jung Woong-in) and estranged from the boy's mother, Lee Na-yoon (Byun Jung-soo). At first alternately ignoring and teasing her, Jae-bin finds himself growing jealous when Sun-hee gets along with Dong-hwa, who unlike him, is gentle, kind and mature. Reminiscing about the good old days, Jae-bin recalls how beautiful Sun-hee was when they fell in love with each other 20 years ago. And in the present, he feels happy and relaxed with her, since he can be perfectly honest in front of her as an ordinary man, not as a famous actor who has to put on a show for the public. Thus, Jae-bin falls in love with Sun-hee all over again. He tries to show her in little ways: by having a hairstylist straighten out her unflattering perm into a stylish bob cut, buying her some nice clothes, and even paying for her laser eye surgery so that she'll be able to take off her thick, horn-rimmed glasses. But more than restoring her outer beauty, he also hopes to heal her emotional scars. == Cast== Main characters *Choi Jin-sil as Hong Sun-hee *Jung Joon-ho as Jang Dong-chul/Song Jae-bin *Jung Woong-in as Jang Dong-hwa *Byun Jung-soo as Lee Na-yoon Supporting characters *Kim Byung-se as Ahn Yoo-shik *Han Bo-bae as Ahn Ji-min, Sun- hee's daughter *Kim Hyung-ja as Jung Geum-ja *Kim Chung as Go Jung-sook *Lee Young-ja as Min-joo's mother *Uhm Soo-jung as Ahn Yoo-jung *Ahn Il-kwon as Seo Won-tak *Lee Sang-hoon (credited as Lee Soo-ho) as Soo-ho *Hwang Jung-eum as Sa Ruby *Lee In-sung as Jang Hoon, Dong-hwa's son *Choi Jung-yoon as Kim Min- hee (cameo, ep 16) *Kim Mi-jin ==Production== \\"Ajumma\\" is the Korean word for middle-aged, married women (usually housewives), and they were previously portrayed on the small and big screen as unfashionable, aggressive or hot- tempered, and self-sacrificing. Screenwriter Moon Hee-jung said the heroine she wrote was positive ‚Äì Sun-hee is hardworking, brave and intelligent ‚Äì because \\"the spiritedness of modern ajumma does not just include rebelling against their mothers-in-law. They contain a progressive spirit.\\" Calling the series a \\"trendy ajumma drama,\\" director Lee Tae-gon said that he wanted to portray \\"the romance of people who believe their good days are over.\\" Lead actress Choi Jin-sil was perfect casting, as she was once the darling of Korean popular culture during the late 1980s through the 1990s, but a controversial marriage and divorce forced her into a five-year hiatus from acting, until she made a successful comeback with My Rosy Life in 2005. That role resurrected her career; she was no longer the girl-next-door, but had reinvented her image into someone more approachable ‚Äì an ajumma. At the drama press conference, Choi said, \\"As an actress, it may be natural to want a role that is glamorous and pretty, but I'm more comfortable with acting as an ordinary person. Reality is an important factor in dramas, and so I wanted to portray the life of a real person. I am an ajumma myself. I think Korean ajumma are fearless. They are not afraid of anything. Although the character goes through emotional downfalls, she doesn't give up. I think it is courage that defines ajumma.\\" In a December 2009 interview, actor Jung Joon-ho admitted that it was Choi Jin-sil who convinced him to take the role. He had initially passed on the role, but Choi personally went to one of his filming locations and told him that she wanted to collaborate with him in this drama. Touched by her sincerity, Jung accepted the offer. And when the first episode received ratings much lower than what both stars had expected, Choi comforted Jung, telling him not to lose hope, saying they would start from the bottom and work their way up. (After several episodes, the ratings did increase.) Jung said that Choi had a positive influence on the production, and working with her on this series left him the deepest and most unforgettable memories in his acting career. ==Reception== Last Scandal recorded fairly successful ratings in the 19 percent range. Fans coined a new term: \\"jumderella syndrome,\\" a portmanteau of the words ajumma and Cinderella, describing the onscreen fantasy that an ajumma can still be Cinderella and live happily ever after with her Prince Charming. Despite some criticism of Sun-hee's unrealistic transformation from a dowdy housewife, the ratings reflected that the story of an ajumma having a second chance at romance found resonance among viewers, especially middle-aged women. Because of the series' success, a second season was planned with Choi and Jung reprising their roles, which would have begun filming in November 2008. However, Choi committed suicide on October 2, 2008. While accepting his award for Top Excellence in Acting at the MBC Drama Awards ceremony in December 2008, Jung Joon-ho spoke in a melancholy tone as he expressed his heartfelt thanks to the production crew. He dedicated his award to the late Choi Jin-sil, saying he really wished he could see the smile on her face. Choi posthumously received the Best Contribution Award, which Jung accepted on her behalf and presented to her family during a tribute to her in January 2009. Netizens have commented that the drama series shares some similarities to Choi's life, in that she was also mistreated by her ex- husband Cho Sung-min, which led to their divorce. But in real life, there was no \\"prince charming\\" to come and save her. In a figurative sense, this series was the \\"last scandal\\" or the last drama of Choi's life. ==Awards and nominations== {  - ! Year !! Award !! Category !! Recipient !!

These are large family of neurotransmitter which are Na+ concentration dependent. They are found in various regions of the brain in different cell types, such as neurons and astrocytes. These transporters are primarily responsible for the regulation of extracellular GABA concentration during basal and synaptic activity. They are responsible for creating a GABA gradient which is determined by the membrane potential, and the concentration of Na+ and Cl‚àí. They are also present on the plasma membrane of neurons and glia which help define their function of regulation of GABA concentration as they act as the receptors that facilitate recycling of GABA in the extracellular space. GABA transporters are a common target for anticonvulsant drugs against seizure disorders such as epilepsy. == Types == Molecular phylogenetic analysis of the SLC6 neurotransmitter transporter family in Homo sapiens The GABA transporter group consists of six different transporters: * GABA transporter type 1 (GAT1; SLC6A1) * GABA transporter type 2 (GAT2; SLC6A13) * GABA transporter type 3 (GAT3; SLC6A11) * Betaine transporter (BGT1; SLC6A12) * A8/CT1 * A6/TauT GAT1 and GAT3 are the major GABA transporters in the brain and spinal cord, expressed by both neurons and some astrocytes. GAT2 and BGT1 are also expressed in the brain, but at low levels and mostly in the meninges. GAT2 also transports taurine, while BGT1 transports betaine. These two transporters are predominantly expressed in the liver, but are also found in the kidneys and, as mentioned above, in the meninges. == Function == The cartoon depicts a GABAergic synapse in adult rat brain where GABA is released exocytotically and acts upon specific post- synaptic receptors. The signal is terminated by removal of GABA from the synaptic cleft by transport of GABA back into the nerve terminal by the plasma membrane GABA transporter (GAT) 1. GABA transporters in the plasma membrane help in regulating the concentration of GABA in the extracellular matrix by reabsorbing the transmitter and clearing the synapse. They transiently bind to GABA in the extracellular matrix and translocate the transmitter in the cytoplasm. The GABA transmitters are not broken down but are cleared via GABA transporters through re-absorption from the synaptic cleft. There is only a 20% loss of the transmitters during each re-absorption while nearly 80% is recycled. The plasma membrane GABA transporters maintain an extracellular GABA concentration in the vicinity of the synapse to control the activity of the GABA receptors. The GABAergic synaptic transmission controls the generation of membrane potential rhythmic changes as the transporters are dependent on Na+ and Cl‚àí ions moving in and out of the across the membrane which are determinants of membrane potential. These changes rely on the precise timing of GABA receptors activation which in turn are dependent upon the release and clearance of GABA in the extracellular space. This reuptake of neurotransmitters plays a significant role in the overall process of synaptic transmission. The GABA transporter is an active system, electrogenic, a voltage-dependent which relies on the inward electrochemical gradient of Na+ ions instead of ATP. It also has low micromolecular affinity to GABA with a Michaelis-Menten constant of 2.5 ŒºM, and requires the presence of Cl- ions in the extracellular matrix. The GABA transporter help creates an equilibrium of GABA and will work in the reverse direction if needed to maintain the baseline concentration of GABA in the system. == Structure == The structure of Sl6 family transporters share 20-25% sequence similarity with LeuTA providing an evolutionary relationship between the transporter and the leucine transporter protein. Because of the similarity, the LeuTa protein provides a very close template model for the studying the transporters in greater detail. The GABA transporter exists in two different conformations. The transporters have general structure of 12 alpha helices with both end - N Terminus and C-terminus in the cytoplasm with glycosylation sequence in the transmembrane helices. They also exhibit ligand gated ion channel properties as well as substrate dependent properties of leak current. The amino acid sequence ranges from 599 (GAT1) to 700 for glycine transporters. == Role in epilepsy == Secondary structure and surface representation of LeuTAa. Topology of Aquifex aeolicus LeuTAa. The transporter is composed of 12 trans-membrane regions with cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal domains. TM1 and TM6 are oriented antiparallel to one another and have breaks in their helical structure approximately halfway across the membrane bilayer. The transporter has two extracellular Œ≤-strands (green arrows), four extracellular and two intracellular helices GABA creates an inhibitory tone in the cerebral cortex to counterbalance the neuronal excitability. An imbalance between the excitability and inhibition often lead to seizures. To help with epilepsy disorder, anticonvulsant drugs are designed which specifically attack the GABA system. These drugs often attack the transporters blocking their activity, which affects the neuronal excitability. Anticonvulsants such as Tiagabine attack the GABA transporters inhibiting the uptake of GABA neurotransmitter. In patients with temporal lobe seizures, there is a decrease in GABA release because of the impairment of transporters. Drugs such as Vigabatrin cause reversals in GABA transporters that increase the concentration of GABA in the synapse which helps in inhibiting the neuronal excitability. == References == Category:Neurotransmitter transporters Category:GABA ","title":"GABA transporter"},{"id":"20216290","text":"Steeple Rock, Wellington Harbour Steeple Rock is the largest rock of Barrett Reef at the west of the entrance to Wellington Harbour, rising above sea level.

Courtney was built in 1912 by Jackson and Sharp, Boat builders of Wilmington, Delaware, as Warren J. Courtney, a wooden-hulled steam fishing vessel of the \\"Menhaden Fisherman\\" design. The U.S. Navy acquired her from the C. E. Davis Packing Company of Reedville, Virginia, on 28 May 1917 for World War I service. She was designated SP-375, but before she could be put into commission as USS Warren J. Courtney the Navy shortened her compound name to the surname only under the terms of General order No. 314 promulgated on 28 July 1917. She thus was commissioned at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard at Portsmouth, Virginia, on 10 August 1917, as USS Courtney (SP-375). Intended for service as a convoy escort and patrol craft for \\"distant service,\\" Courtney was fitted out and then sailed for France. She convoyed and escorted transports and supply ships, operating out of Brest, France, as a unit of the Patrol Force, until operational difficulties ‚Äì unseaworthiness ‚Äì resulted in the restriction of the \\"Menhaden Fisherman\\" trawlers to minesweeping and coastal duties. Thus, Courtney operated as a minesweeper for the rest of her career and through the end of World War I on 11 November 1918. Courtney departed Brest for the United States with minesweeper and other vessels on 27 April 1919. Although weather conditions appeared favorable, a storm developed shortly after their departure. The ships headed back toward Brest, but in the heavy seas, Courtney and Otis W. Douglas sank on 27 April. Courtney was struck from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. ==References== * * *NavSource Online: Section Patrol Craft Photo Archive Courtney (SP 375) Category:Patrol vessels of the United States Category:World War I patrol vessels of the United States Category:Ships built in Wilmington, Delaware Category:1912 ships Category:Minesweepers of the United States Navy Category:World War I minesweepers of the United States Category:Maritime incidents in 1919 Category:Shipwrecks in the Atlantic Ocean ","title":"USS Courtney (SP-375)"},{"id":"20216350","text":"Van Hoensbroeck (in German: Hoensbroech) is an aristocratic family with medieval origins in the town of Hoensbroek near Heerlen in Limburg, Netherlands. ==History== Nicolaes Hoen is the first known ancestor of the family; he was killed in the Battle of Baesweiler in 1371.

The halt consisted of a timber platform and corrugated iron shelter. The station closed in December 1964 when services were truncated at Strata Florida, following flood damage to the line at Llanilar. Formal closure was confirmed two months later.

Estimates for the number of Pakistanis living in Italy vary. Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs repeats the Italian government's 2003 figure of 30,500 individuals, while their embassy in Rome speculated to a reporter of Pakistani newspaper Dawn as early as 2002 that the number might have already reached as high as 50,000. Media reports in 2017 gave numbers higher than 130,000 . Most of the workers are of Punjabi background with accounting 72 percent share of migrants in 2016 and 76 percent in 2017.https://www.dawn.com/news/1375925 ==Migration== Most Pakistani migrants came in Italy in form of illegal immigration and are employed in the north of Italy, around Milan; they earn roughly US$700 per month in wages. Even those who entered the country illegally obtain minimum wage jobs and employment permission fairly easily, due to labour shortages in Italy caused by the ageing population and shrinking workforce. A big number of Pakistani tourists overstays their visas. The sheer number of applicants for new passports has placed a severe strain on the Pakistani embassy. A long queue stretches outside the door all week long, with an average of sixty applications per day and a peak of 120 on Mondays. Typically, one must have some proof of citizenship, such as an identity card, in order to obtain a new passport; applicants lacking any such proof must undergo interviews in which embassy officials quiz them on basic facts about Pakistan to determine if they are actually citizens of the country. In one case, a young applicant who claimed to be from Swat did not even know the name of the WƒÅli of Swat, but the embassy issued him a new passport anyway on the strength of his uncle's assurances that the youth was indeed a Pakistani citizen. The Pakistani ambassador to Italy often interviews the applicants personally and renders immediate decisions; however, other staff members of the embassy, even typists and drivers, have had to help in processing the flood of applications. Pakistanis initially praised the services of the embassy, comparing them favourably to Pakistani embassies in other countries where it was common for the staff to demand bribes. However, the high workload caused increasing backlogs, which by 2007 meant that 20,000 Pakistani migrants lost the chance to regularise their status and obtain work permits; migrants described the embassy's attitude as \\"unreasonable\\" and even threatened to set themselves on fire in protest. ==Cultural integration== The settlement of Pakistanis to Italy has produced cultural tensions. Pakistanis living in Sarezzo, a town in the Province of Brescia, are believed to have carried out Italy's first honour killing in June 2007; a man and two of his brothers-in-law were sentenced to thirty years in prison for the killing of the man's 20-year-old daughter, who was living with her boyfriend, an Italian man, and had refused an arranged marriage. They had slit her throat and buried her body in their back garden. A monthly Urdu-language magazine called Azad (which means \\"free\\" in Urdu) has been launched. It aims to bridge the two cultures by helping Pakistani immigrants who either cannot speak Italian or have limited interaction with the locals. It also helps Pakistanis to learn about Italy and its culture. According to media commentator Ejaz Ahmad, himself a Pakistani with two decades of residence in Italy, roughly 10,000 Pakistani migrants have purchased homes in Italy, which he analyses as a signal of their intention to remain in the country. ==Services to Italy== Pakistani physicist and Nobel Laureate, Abdus Salam The Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) was founded in 1964 by Pakistani scientist and Nobel Laureate Abdus Salam.

It was released in Australia on 4 November 2008. ==Plot summary== While at the annual Rangers' Gathering, series protagonist Will is informed by Ranger Commandant Crowley that Ranger Halt will not be able to attend the Gathering as he is investigating things in Hibernia, a country to the west of Araluen. The Outsiders, a mysterious religious cult, is gaining followers and stealing gold and jewels. Halt is watching the group, who are acting in Selsey, a small Araluen village. The cult demands gold to build an altar to their god to protect the village and tries to set the village's boats on fire to persuade them into donating more gold. Halt stops their plan and also discovers that the golden altar is a fake. Rather than being solid gold, it is wooden and gold-plated; the cult has been keeping the gold for themselves. When Halt captures the Outsiders' Selsey leader, he becomes puzzled; the leader recognises him though Halt is sure they have never met. Back at the Ranger's Gathering, Crowley asks Will to take care of three apprentices for a while and tells Will that he is being moved to Redmont Fief to share half the Ranger duties there with Halt. Redmont Fief is where Will grew up, and where his girlfriend, the diplomat Alyss, and Halt's wife Pauline also live. Will rides to the fief, where he is greeted by a feast made by his childhood friend and cook, Jenny. Halt arrives back in Redmont and tells of what he has seen. Halt reveals the secret of his past; he is the identical twin brother of the King of Clonmel, Ferris. Halt was born first, meaning he was the heir to the throne. He fled Clonmel and joined the Ranger Corps after Ferris repeatedly tried to kill him to obtain the crown for himself. Halt believes the Outsiders leader recognised him as he thought he was Ferris. Crowley assigns Will, Halt, and the knight Horace to investigate the matter in Clonmel. The group investigates the Outsiders in Clonmel and works on destroying their influence in Clonmel. When King Ferris tells them he made a deal with the Outsiders, he is knocked out by Horace, and Halt takes the king's place. The Outsiders' leader, Tennyson, is angry, and challenges Horace to duel his two bodyguards. Horace accepts. Meanwhile, Will is investigating a camp, and he sees that Tennyson has recruited three foreign assassins. He tells Horace and Halt this, and Halt is expecting treachery from Tennyson. The duel proceeds, with Horace barely winning against the chain and mace used by the first bodyguard. Horace is then drugged by the assassins, causing him to be unable to unable to focus on objects. Will shoots the second Genovesan in the arm, after which he manages to accuse Tennyson. Tennyson escapes, though not before killing King Ferris. Halt is pronounced the new king, though abdicates the throne to his nephew, Sean, who he believes will be a worthy king. Halt, Will and Horace follow Tennyson's trail to Picta. ==References * The Kings of Clonmel at Random House Australia * The King of Clonmel at Random House NZ Category:Ranger's Apprentice books Category:2008 Australian novels ","title":"The Kings of Clonmel"},{"id":"20216429","text":"Fabes la granxa (Asturian, beans of La Granja, a town in Spain) are a type of white runner bean cultivated in the autonomous community of Asturias.

Shortly after the discovery of nuclear fission in December 1938/January 1939, the Uranverein, i.e., the German nuclear energy project, had an initial start in April before being formed a second time under the Heereswaffenamt (HWA, Army Ordnance Office) in September 1939. Beyerle soon brought his industrial expertise to the project for the development of an ultracentrifuge for the enrichment of uranium-235, in collaboration with Paul Harteck, director of the Physical Chemistry Department at the University of Hamburg, and his colleague Wilhelm Groth. Construction began in the autumn of 1941, and it was done under the auspices of an Heereswaffenamt contract let by Kurt Diebner, director of the Kernforschungsrat (Nuclear Research Council), under General Carl Heinrich Becker of the HWA. Konrad Beyerle was in charge of centrifuge development at Ansch√ºtz in Kiel. In 1943, enrichment to 5% was achieved, however, technical difficulties and the war hindered large-scale production. In July 1944, the Ansch√ºtz company was struck during an Allied air raid, and the exact part of the plant that was working on centrifuges was destroyed. Beyerle moved his effort south and merged with Hartick‚Äôs group in Freiburg and Kandern, the locations to which the Institute of Physical Chemistry had moved in hopes of avoiding Allied air raids. Avoiding the air raids only lasted until September 1944.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Groth.Wilhelm Groth Stand der Arbeiten zur Herstellung einer Ultrazentrifuge G-82 (14 December 1941)Walker, 1993, 33, 82, 148, and 177.

Owing to their formation at such an early date, they are considered to be one of the earliest grindcore bands. Their discography is extensive, consisting of many CDs, LPs, and split singles with bands such as Extreme Noise Terror, Agathocles and Cripple Bastards. Through these releases they gained a reputation as a cult band and many bands have cited Patareni as being one of their primary influence, which prompted the release of A Tribute to the Patareni by Roots Records and F'K'O\\" in 1994. In 2009, Terrorizer listed Patareni's Back to the Roots as one of its top 20 essential European grindcore albums. James Hoare, writing for Terrorizer, said, \\"Much beloved by Anal Cunt's Seth Putnam, who felt moved enough to write to them back in the day, Croatia's Patareni were the band for whom the word 'raw' was coined. Hugely influential, some grindcore historians even argue they were the first. Either way, 'Back to the Roots' is a feats of strangely melodic crust and urgent stabs of grind like the twelve-second 'Sajkunda'.\\"Hoare, James. Terrorizer #180, \\"Vinyl Countdown: Essential Albums - Europe\\", p.54. Patareni guitarist Davor played also for Hladno Pivo, one of the most popular rock bands in Croatia and other countries of the former Yugoslavia. Patareni drummer Poda played also for 1980s Serbian noise/grind/punk bands D.D.T and Fear of Dog, and various international hard core bands such as the Belgium crust punk band Visions of War, Olho de Gato from Holland, Migra Violenta from Argentina, and MDC (Millions of Dead Cops) from the United States of America. Two members of Slovenian groups Extreme Smoke and PureH also occasionally played in Patareni in early 1990s. Former member Giulio the Bastard, of Italian grindcore band Cripple Bastards, has also sung for Patareni. ==Discography== Albums and EPs * Deadland Massacre - 7\\" * Untalented after all these seconds - 7\\" * From Here To Eternity - Live In New Pingvinovo - 7\\" * Demo #1,26-6-86 - 10\\" * Odavde nas nitko nemre sterat - CD * Good Bye, The Legends - 7\\" * Worth mentioning - 7\\" * I Wonder Who The Real Cannibals Are / There Can Be Only One - 10\\" * Empathy with them - it's a mockery - LP * Stop the war and bring the noiz - 7\\" * Za osobne potrebe odjebi - LP * Bob dylan is dead - 7\\" * Mi smo zapu≈°teni deƒçki - 12\\" * Obrade - tribute LP * Veƒç 15 godina fax se ne zavr≈°ava - promo 7\\" * The hammer inside - CD * Corrosion of humanity - 7\\" * Never healed - CD * Nezadovoljstvo je energija - CD * Tko ne pamti iznova pro≈æivljava - CD * Debilana sessions - CD Split albums * Patareni / Atta ‚Äì Deadland massacre 7\\" * Patareni / U.B.R. - Back from the dead 7\\" * Patareni / Stres D.A. - Made in Balkan 7\\" * Patareni / Anal Cunt - Good-bye the legends 7\\" * Patareni / T.M.P. - Debilana sessions 7\\" * Patareni / Extreme Noise Terror - The split noiz ep 7\\" (considered bootleg by the members of Extreme Noise Terror) * Patareni / Debilana - Mi smo djeca debilane 10\\" * Patareni / Anal Cunt - I.R.C. or no reply 7\\" * Patareni / Cripple Bastards 7\\" * Patareni / Agathocles 7\\" * Patareni / Crucifix 7\\" * Patareni / Cripple Bastards 10\\" * Patareni / U.B.R.

He sat as Member of Parliament for Dublin City and was known as the \\"Irish Wilkes\\" because of his radical views.Thomas p.111 ==Early life== The Lucas family were established in Ireland when Colonel Benjamin Lucas, Charles' great-uncle, was granted lands in County Clare following the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in the early 1650s. Charles Lucas was the younger son of Benjamin Lucas of Ballingaddy, County Clare. Benjamin Lucas died about 1727, leaving ¬£937 to his family, of which Charles was to receive ¬£80.Will of Benjamin Lucas of Ballingaddy, probated 1728, Prerogative Will Book 1726-28, National Archives of Ireland, 10/2/3, folios 309a-b. Having served the usual apprenticeship as an apothecary, Lucas was admitted to the Guild of St. Mary Magdalene. ==Apothecary== For many years Lucas kept a shop in Charles Street, Dublin. He married his first wife Anne Blundell in 1734.Index to Dublin Grant Books and Wills, 1, page 1,030. In conducting his business Lucas was struck with certain abuses connected with the sale of drugs, and in 1735 published A Short Scheme for Preventing Frauds and Abuses in Pharmacy, humbly offered to the Consideration of the Legislature. His pamphlet was resented by his fellow-apothecaries, but was the cause of an act being passed for the inspection of medicines. In 1741 he published his Pharmacomastix, or the Office, Use, and Abuse of Apothecaries Explained, and had the satisfaction of seeing the former act renewed.via DNB:Critical Review of the Liberties of the British Subjects, p.37 ==Political career== In this year Lucas was chosen one of the representatives of his corporation on the Common Council of the City of Dublin. He soon came to the conclusion that the board of Aldermen had illegally usurped many of the powers belonging of right to the entire corporation. Aided by James La Touche, a prominent merchant of the city, he secured the appointment of a committee, with Latouche as chairman, to inspect the charters and records of the city. The Aldermen strenuously resisted reform, and in 1743 he published A Remonstrance against certain Infringements on the Rights and Liberties of the Commons and Citizens of Dublin, arguing that the right of electing Aldermen lay with the entire corporation. His argument was disputed by Recorder Stannard, and in the following year Lucas published his closely reasoned and temperate Divelina Libera: an Apology for the Civil Rights and Liberties of the Commons and Citizens of Dublin. During the year the controversy continued with unabated zeal on both sides (see The Proceedings of the Sheriffs and Commons, &c.;, Dublin, 1744, and A Message from the Sheriffs and Commons to the Lord Mayor and Aldermen... protesting against the Election of George Ribton, Dublin, 26 Sept. 1744). By Lucas's effortsvia DNB:A Brief State of the Case of the Commons and Citizens of Dublin a fund was raised by voluntary subscription, and a suit commenced on 7 November 1744 against the Aldermen in the court of king's bench. But after a hearing of two days, permission was refused by the judge to lodge an information, and the victorious Aldermen struck out the names of Lucas and his supporters from the following triennial return of the Common Council. On 25 December 1747 Lucas presented a printed statement of the case, entitled The Complaints of Dublin, to the Lord- Lieutenant of Ireland, the Earl of Harrington, but Harrington declined to move in the business. When in August 1748 a vacancy occurred in the parliamentary representation of the city of Dublin, Lucas offered himself as a candidate. Alderman Sir Samuel Cooke and James La Touche also came forward, and although the views of Lucas and Latouche were practically identical, neither would withdraw. To advance his candidature, Lucas in 1748-9 published twenty political addresses to his fellow-citizens, explaining his views on the constitution, reflecting severely on the corruption prevailing in the House of Commons, and advocating the principles expounded by William Molyneux in favour of parliamentary independence. He rejected the claim that Ireland was a conquered colony dependent on the government and parliament of Great Britain. He continued \\"...it must now be confessed that there was no general rebellion in Ireland, since the first British invasion, that was not raised or fomented by the oppression, instigation, evil influence or connivance of the English.\\" These addresses and a certain paper called The Censor, or Citizen's Journal, offended not only the court party, but also the friends of La Touche, whose character was roughly handled by Lucas, especially in his fourteenth address. In counter addresses and pamphlets Lucas was stigmatised as a needy adventurer, a man of no family, and a political firebrand.via DNB:The Tickler, edited by Paul Hiffernan While the election was still pending, the death of Alderman Nathaniel Pearson in May 1749 caused a second vacancy in the representation, and Lucas and La Touche became partly reconciled in opposing Cooke and the second aldermanic candidate, Charles Burton. Shortly afterwards, the corporation having resolved to farm the revenues of the city to a certain Alderman, Lucas denounced the affair as a job, and the council in which the resolution had been passed as packed. The corporation voted the charge false and malicious, and refused to hear Lucas in his defence. The censure was confirmed at a subsequent meeting, and a vote of thanks passed to the author of a pamphlet entitled Lucas Detected, conjectured to have been Edmund Burke, at that time a student at Trinity College.via DNB: Richard Robert Madden, History of Irish Periodical Literaturevia DNB: James Prior, Life of Burke, i. 33 But an appeal by Lucas to the corporation secured fifteen votes out of the twenty-five in his favour. About the same time he printed, with a translation and notes, The Great Charter of the City of Dublin. The lords justices refused (15 May 1749) his request to transmit it to the king, with a \\"Dedication to his Majesty.\\" But on the return of Lord Harrington, Lucas waited on him at the castle on 8 October, and gave him a copy, together with a collection of his political addresses. Lucas was favourably impressed with his reception. Two days later (5 October), however, he attended a levee, and was peremptorily required to leave the castle. Next day he published the story in a newspaper, \\"with thanks to his excellency for the honour he did him,\\" and on the day following, 7 October, issued An Address to his Excellency... with a Preface to the Free and Independent Citizens of Dublin, commenting on his treatment. The date of the parliamentary election was approaching, and the government resolved to prevent Lucas from proceeding to the poll. When Parliament assembled on 10 October, the lord-lieutenant in his speech from the throne animadverted on certain bold attempts to create jealousies between the two kingdoms. The reference to Lucas was unmistakable, and the commons, on a motion of Sir Richard Cox, ordered Lucas and his printer to appear at the bar of the house. Esdall, Lucas's publisher, absconded; but the copy of his publications presented to the lord-lieutenant was put in evidence against him. The feeling of the house ran strongly against him, although the people of Dublin were hotly in his favour. Being ordered to withdraw, a series of resolutions was passed declaring him to be an enemy to his country, calling upon the attorney-general to prosecute him for his offence, and ordering his immediate imprisonment in Newgate.via DNB:Commons' Journals, v. 14 Esdall's wife, Anne, was called in her husband's absence to be questioned by the Irish house of commons about Lucas' writings. ==Physician== His first intention was to submit quietly to his punishment; but finding that he was to be treated with scant decency, he escaped to the Isle of Man, and thence to London. After his flight he was presented by the grand juries of the county and city of Dublin as a common libeller. A proclamation was issued by the lord-lieutenant, at the request of the House of Commons, for his apprehension, and an engraver who advertised a mezzotint of him, as \\"an exile for his country, who seeking for liberty lost it,\\" was committed to prison by order of the House of Commons. Finally, at the Christmas assembly of the Dublin Corporation, he was disfranchised. Meanwhile, Cooke and Latouche had been elected to represent Dublin in parliament. After a short residence in London, Lucas proceeded to the continent for the purpose of studying medicine. At Paris he studied under Petit, and after visiting Rheims proceeded to Leyden, where he graduated M.D. on 20 December 1752. The title of his thesis was De Gangrena et Sphacelo, written in Latin. –ù–µ then visited Spa, Aachen, and other baths for the purpose of investigating the composition of their mineral waters. He returned to England in 1753, proceeding to Bath, and after a series of elaborate experiments conducted in public he went to London, where he established himself in practice. In 1756 he published An Essay on Waters. In three Parts: (i) of Simple Waters, (ii) of Cold Medicated Waters, (iii) of Natural Baths. This treatise, reviewed by Dr. Johnson,James Boswell, Life of Dr. Johnson, ed. Hill, i. 311 gave great offence to the faculty at Bath,via DNB:Recueil d'observations des effets des Eaux Minerales de Spa ... par J. P. de Limbourg, Li√®ge, 1765 and having occasion to visit that place in 1757 he became involved in an acrimonious controversy with the heads of the profession there owing to their refusal to consult with him.via DNB:Letters of Dr. Lucca and Dr. Oliver, London, 1757 But the book obtained for him considerable reputation, and enabled him, it is improbably said,via DNB:A Vindication of the Corporation of the City of Dublin, Dublin, 1766, p. 13 to make an annual income of ¬£3,000 by his profession. On 25 June 1759 he was admitted a licentiate of the College of Physicians of London, and he established a successful practice in London.William Munk, The Roll of the Royal College of Physicians of London, 2, Second Edition, London 1878, page 224; A Vindication of the Corporations of the City of Dublin respecting... Dr Charles Lucas, Dublin [1766?], page 13. ==Return to Ireland== In view of the general election at the accession of George III, Lucas published in November 1760 a pamphlet entitled Seasonable Advice to the Electors... of Ireland in general, to those of Dublin in particular. In the same month he determined to offer himself as a candidate for the city of Dublin, notwithstanding the consequent loss of his practice in London. After assuring himself that the electors of Dublin \\"were warmed with the same sentiments in which he left them,\\"via DNB:Charlemont MSS. i. 265,269via DNB:Bedford Correspondence, ii. 427 he obtained a personal interview with the king in order to petition for pardon, and being favourably received was enabled to return to Dublin, 15 March 1761, on a nolle prosequi. His return was the occasion of great popular rejoicing; the order for his disfranchisement was annulled at the midsummer assembly of the corporation; and in July the degree of Doctor of Physic was conferred upon him by Trinity College, Dublin. During the election Lucas's colleague, Colonel Dunn, withdrew his candidature in order to insure Lucas's return, which was strongly opposed by the aldermanic party.via DNB:The Free Electors' Address to Colonel Dunn, with his Answervia DNB:, An Address to the Free Electors of Dublin, May 1761 After a thirteen days' poll he and Recorder Grattan, father of Henry Grattan, were elected, and he continued to represent Dublin City till his death in 1771. In parliament Lucas does not appear to have shone as an orator; but by assiduously bringing every question of importance before the public, he had the merit of reviving \\"that constitutional connection which ought to subsist between the constituents and their representative.\\"via DNB:Address of the Guild of Merchants, 13 January 1766 On the first day of the session, 22 October 1761, he obtained leave to bring in the heads of a bill for shortening the duration of parliaments, which he presented to the house on 28 October; but on a motion to have it transmitted to England it was defeated by a majority of sixty-five. Shortly afterwards he presented the heads of two new bills for securing the freedom of parliament.via DNB:, Historical Register, i. 352-4 In 1763 the Freeman's Journal, a biweekly newspaper, was started by three Dublin merchants under the management of Henry Brooke (1703?-1783). Lucas contributed to it from its commencement, sometimes anonymously,via DNB: see a long article in the form of an address to Lord Halifax, 8 October 1763 but generally under the signature of \\"A Citizen\\" or \\"Civis.\\" Small as were its literary merits, the paper enjoyed at first great popularity, owing to the gratuitous contributions of Lucas and its strenuous assertion of Irish Protestant privileges.via DNB:, Hist. of Irish Periodical Literature In 1766 Lucas unsuccessfully opposed a bill to prevent the exportation of grain, on the ground that certain alterations made in it by the English privy council were detrimental to the rights of the Irish parliament. He justified his conduct in An Address to the Lord Mayor and Citizens of Dublin, and replied to further censurevia DNB:see An Antidote to Dr. Lucas's Address in A Second Address to the Lord Mayor. Several guilds, and among them the Guild of Merchants, presented addresses of thanks to him, and it was even proposed to grant him a salary of ¬£365 a year out of the city treasury as a public acknowledgment of his services in parliament. The proposal was rejected by the Aldermen, and its rejection led to a renewal of the old quarrel between them and the commons, and to fresh manifestations of public sympathy with Lucas.via DNB:Proceedings of the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, 17 Jan. 1766via DNB:A Vindication of the Corporation... respecting... Charles Lucas, Dublin, 1766via DNB:A Letter to Charles Lucas, M.D. Dublin, 1766via DNB:,A Third Address to the Lord Mayor, Dublin, 1766 In 1768 Lucas strongly opposed the scheme for the augmentation of the army, on the ground partly that he favoured the establishment of a national militia, but chiefly because in his opinion, \\"Standing parliaments and standing armies have ever proved the most dangerous enemies to civil liberty.\\"via DNB:, An Address to the Lord Mayor... relating to the intended Augmentation of the Military Force, Dublin, 1768 In this year he caused considerable sensation by trying to institute a parliamentary inquiry into the case of a soldier whom he regarded as the victim of military discipline. His efforts in parliament proving unsuccessful, he published a pamphlet entitled A Mirror for Courts-Martial: in which the Complaints, Trial, Sentence, and Punishment of David Blakeney are examined. It is probably to his conduct on this occasion that Lord Townshend referred in a letter to the Marquess of Granby, \\"Here is a Doctor Lucas, the Wilkes of Ireland, who has been playing the devil here and poisoning all the soldiery with his harangues and writings; but I have treated this nonsensical demagogue as he deserves, with his mob at his heels.\\"via DNB:Rutland MSS. ii. 303via DNB:Charlemont MSS. i. 254 Lord Townshend's protest against the right of the Irish House of Commons to originate money bills, and his sudden prorogation of parliament in December 1769 drew from Lucas early in 1770 a pamphlet entitled The Rights and Privileges of Parliament asserted upon constitutional Principles. It was announced in the newspapers that an answer, \\"published by authority,\\" entitled The Usage of holding Parliaments and of preparing Bills of Supply in Ireland, stated from Record, would shortly appear. The book appeared on the day announced, but was instantly suppressed. A copy, however, came into Lucas's possession, and finding that it told more against than for the government he immediately republished it, with a sarcastic introduction and commentary. From his earliest years Lucas had been a martyr to hereditary gout, which rendered him a complete cripple, and latterly obliged him to be carried to the House of Commons. Nevertheless, says an eye-witness, \\"the gravity and uncommon neatness of his dress, his grey, venerable locks, blending with a pale but interesting countenance, in which an air of beauty was still visible, altogether excited attention, and I never saw a stranger come into the house without asking who he was.\\"via DNB:Dublin Penny Journal, i. 369 He died at his residence in Henry Street, Dublin, on Monday 4 November 1771. His remains were honoured with a public funeral of imposing solemnity. He was interred in the family burial- ground in St. Michan's churchyard. Lucas‚Äôs son Henry and other relatives were in attendance at his funeral, as were his friends Lord Charlemont, Flood and Adderley. The mourners also included officers and many hundred brethren of the guilds and the Lord Mayor with representatives of the Corporation and the Vice-Provost and scholars of Trinity College.via DNB:Freeman's Journal, 9 November There are several engraved portraits of Lucas, but the best is a mezzotint from a half-length by Sir Joshua Reynolds in the National Gallery of Ireland. ==Notes== *Note: citations prefixed with \\"via DNB\\" were copied from the DNB article and have not been independently verified. ==References== * * Thomas, Peter D.G.

Bailey House is a large freestanding limestone mansion located at 10 St Nicholas Place at West 150th Street in the Sugar Hill area of Harlem, Manhattan, New York City. The house was built from 1886 to 1888 and was designed by architect Samuel Burrage Reed in the Romanesque Revival style for circus impresario James Anthony Bailey of the Barnum & Bailey Circus. When it was constructed there were few other buildings in the area, and as a result, sitting as it does on an escarpment, the Bailey Mansion had a clear view to the east of the Long Island Sound. Among the house's numerous design features are numerous unique stained glass mosaic windows, designed and fabricated by Henry Belcher (https://publicdomainreview.org/collections/catalogue-from-belcher-mosaic- glass-co-1886/). The interior is richly paneled in hand-carved timber. The exterior features Flemish-style gables and a corner tower. In 1951, the house was purchased by Marguerite Blake, who ran a funeral home from it until her retirement. In late 2008, she brought the house to market, seeking to sell it for $10 million.

The two hemispheres' geography differ in elevation by 1 to 3 km. The average thickness of the Martian crust is 45 km, with 32 km in the northern lowlands region, and 58 km in the southern highlands. The boundary between the two regions is quite complex in places. One distinctive type of topography is called fretted terrain.Greeley, R. and J. Guest. 1987. Geological map of the eastern equatorial region of Mars, scale 1:15,000,000. U. S. Geol. Ser. Misc. Invest. Map I-802-B, Reston, Virginia It contains mesas, knobs, and flat-floored valleys having walls about a mile high. Around many of the mesas and knobs are lobate debris aprons that have been shown to be rock glaciers.Plaut, J. et al. 2008. Radar Evidence for Ice in Lobate Debris Aprons in the Mid-Northern Latitudes of Mars. Lunar and Planetary Science XXXIX. 2290.pdfCarr, M. 2006. The Surface of Mars. Cambridge University Press. Many large valleys formed by the lava erupted from the volcanoes of Mars cut through the dichotomy. The Martian dichotomy boundary includes the regions called Deuteronilus Mensae, Protonilus Mensae, and Nilosyrtis Mensae. All three regions have been studied extensively because they contain landforms believed to have been produced by the movement of ice or paleoshorelines questioned as formed by volcanic erosion. The northern lowlands comprise about one-third of the surface of Mars and are relatively flat, with as many impact craters as the southern hemisphere. The other two-thirds of the Martian surface are the highlands of the southern hemisphere. The difference in elevation between the hemispheres is dramatic. Three major hypotheses have been proposed for the origin of the crustal dichotomy: endogenic (by mantle processes), single impact, or multiple impact. Both impact-related hypotheses involve processes that could have occurred before the end of the primordial bombardment, implying that the crustal dichotomy has its origins early in the history of Mars. ==Geography== STL 3D model of Mars with 20√ó elevation exaggeration showing the Martian dichotomy Single Impact Hypothesis A single mega-impact would produce a very large, circular depression in the crust. The proposed depression has been named the Borealis Basin. However, most estimations of the shape of the lowlands area produce a shape that in places dramatically deviates from the circular shape. Additional processes could create those deviations from circularity. Also if the proposed Borealis basin is a depression created by an impact, it would be the largest impact crater known in the Solar System. An object that large could have hit Mars sometime during the process of the Solar System accretion. It is expected that an impact of such magnitude would have produced an ejecta blanket that should be found in areas around the lowland and generate enough heat to form volcanoes. However, if the impact occurred around 4.5 Ga (billion years ago), erosion could explain the absence of the ejecta blanket but could not explain the absence of volcanoes. Also, the mega- impact could have scattered a large portion of the debris into outer space and across the southern hemisphere. Geologic evidence of the debris would provide very convincing support for this hypothesis. A 2008 study provided additional research towards the single giant impact theory in the northern hemisphere. In the past tracing of the impact boundaries was complicated by the presence of the Tharsis volcanic rise. The Tharsis volcanic rise buried part of the proposed dichotomy boundary under 30 km of basalt. The researchers at MIT and Jet Propulsion Lab at CIT have been able to use gravity and topography of Mars to constrain the location of the dichotomy beneath the Tharsis rise, thus creating an elliptical model of the dichotomy boundary. The elliptical shape of the Borealis Basin brought to the Northern Single Impact Hypothesis as a re-edition of the original theory published in 1984. However, this hypothesis has been countered by a new hypothesis of a giant impact to the South Pole of Mars with a Moon-sized object that melted the southern hemisphere of Mars, triggered the magnetic field of the planet, and formed the dichotomy upon cooling of the magma ocean. The discovery of twelve volcanic alignments lends evidence to this new hypothesis. Endogenic Origin Hypothesis It is believed that plate tectonic processes could have been active on Mars early in the planet's history. Large-scale redistribution of lithospheric crustal material is known to be caused by plate tectonic processes on Earth. Even though it is still not entirely clear how mantle processes affect plate tectonics on Earth, mantle convection is believed to be involved as cells or plumes. Since endogenic processes of Earth have yet to be completely understood, studying of similar processes on Mars is very difficult. The dichotomy could be created at the time of the creation of the Martian core. The roughly circular shape of the lowland could then be attributed to plume- like first-order overturn which could occur in the process of rapid core formation. There is evidence for internally driven tectonic events in the vicinity of the lowland area that clearly occurred at the end of the early bombardment phase. A 2005 study suggests that degree-1 mantle convection could have created the dichotomy. Degree-1 mantle convection is a convective process in which one hemisphere is dominated by an upwelling, while the other hemisphere is downwelling. Some of the evidence is the abundance of extensive fracturing and igneous activity of late Noachian to early Hesperian age. A counter argument to the endogenic hypothesis is the possibility of those tectonic events occurring in the Borealis Basin due to the post-impact weakening of the crust. In order to further support the endogenic origin hypothesis geologic evidence of faulting and flexing of the crust prior to the end of the primordial bombardment is needed. However, the lack of plate tectonics on Mars weakens this hypothesis. Multiple Impact Hypothesis The multiple impact hypothesis is supported by correlation of segments of the dichotomy with the rims of several large impact basins. But there are large parts of the Borealis Basin outside the rims of those impact basins. If the Martian lowlands were formed by the multiple basins then their inner ejecta and rims should stand above upland elevations. The rims and ejecta blankets of the lowland impact craters are still much below the upland areas. There are also areas in the lowlands that are outside any of the impact basins, these areas must be overlain by multiple ejecta blankets and should stand at elevations similar to the original planetary surface. That clearly is not the case either. One approach explaining the absence of ejecta blankets infers that no ejecta was ever present. Absence of ejecta could be caused by a large impactor scattering the ejecta into outer space. Another approach proposed the formation of the dichotomy by cooling at depth and crustal loading by later volcanism. The multiple-impact hypothesis is also statistically unfavorable, it is unlikely that multiple impacts basins occur and overlap primarily in the northern hemisphere. ==Atmosphere== The atmosphere of Mars varies significantly between Northern and Southern hemispheres, for reasons related and unrelated to the geographic dichotomy. Dust storms More visibly, dust storms originate in the Southern hemisphere far more often than in the North. High Northern dust content tends to occur after exceptional Southern storms escalate into global dust storms.Barlow, N. Mars: An Introduction to its Interior, Surface, and Atmosphere. Cambridge University Press 2008 As a consequence, opacity (tau) is often higher in the Southern hemisphere. The effect of higher dust content is to increase absorption of sunlight, increasing atmospheric temperature. Precession of the Equinoxes The spin axis of Mars, as with many bodies, precesses over millions of years. At present, the solstices nearly coincide with Mars' aphelion and perihelion. This results in one hemisphere, the Southern, receiving more sunlight in summer and less in winter, and thus more extreme temperatures, than the Northern. When combined with Mars' much higher eccentricity compared to Earth, and far thinner atmosphere in general, Southern winters and summers are wider ranging than on Earth. Hadley circulation and volatiles The Hadley circulation of Mars is offset from symmetry about its equator.De Pateris, I., Lissauer, J. Planetary Sciences Cambridge University Press When combined with the greater seasonal range of the Southern hemisphere (see above), this results in \\"the striking north-south hemispherical asymmetries of the atmospheric and residual ice cap inventories of Mars water\\", \\"as well as the current north-south asymmetry of the seasonal ice cap albedos.\\" The atmosphere of Mars is currently \\"a nonlinear pump of water into the northern hemisphere of Mars.\\" ==Interactive Mars MapSee also== * Deuteronilus Mensae * Fretted terrain * Geography of Mars * Geology of Mars * Glacier * Glaciers on Mars * Lobate debris apron * Nilosyrtis Mensae * Protonilus Mensae * Water on Mars ==References * Google Mars ‚Äì Google Maps Dichotomy ","title":"Martian dichotomy"},{"id":"20216654","text":"Greg Saunders is the first fictional character known as the \\"Vigilante\\" that appeared in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was one of the first DC Comics characters adapted for live-action film, beating Superman by one year. ==Publication history== Created by Mort Weisinger and Mort Meskin, Greg Saunders first appeared in Action Comics #42 (November 1941). He appeared in every issue of Action Comics until #198 (Nov 1954). ==Fictional character biography== The original Vigilante was a western-themed hero who debuted in Action Comics #42 (Nov. 1941): originally named Greg Sanders, the spelling was changed to Greg Saunders in the 1990s. Grandson of a Native American fighter, and the son of a sheriff in Wyoming, Saunders, as a young man, moved east to New York City and became a country singer, radio's \\"Prairie Troubadour\\". Greg returned to his home after his father was killed, bringing to justice the gang of bandits who killed him.Vigilante (1941) at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. from the original on July 19, 2015. The Vigilante, like many heroes of the era, acquired a sidekick to aid him in his crime fighting. Stuff the Chinatown Kid was introduced in Action Comics #45. He assisted the Vigilante when a Japanese spy known as the Head framed Stuff's grandfather for provoking a Tong war. The majority of the Vigilante's solo adventures were against non-powered, costumed criminals. He was an excellent brawler, trick shooter, sharpshooter, horseman and motorcycle rider, and an expert with the lariat. These skills gave him advantage over his adversaries in his adventures, which centered primarily in New York City. The Vigilante fought few foes that could be considered real \\"super-villains\\". His arch-foes were the Dummy, a brilliant weapons inventor and professional killer who resembled a ventriloquist's dummy in both size and facial features, and the Rainbow Man, who committed crimes with a color motif. The Vigilante also encountered the Rattler on several occasions, as well as the Fiddler and the Shade, though the latter two villains are not the same foes that battled the Flash. Other foes included Shakes the Underworld Poet and the Dictionary, a gangster with a heightened vocabulary. The Vigilante was also a member of the Seven Soldiers of Victory (also known as the Law's Legionnaires), one of the earliest super-hero teams (appearing in Leading Comics). In these adventures, his sidekick Stuff never appeared, being replaced by an old, somewhat crotchety man named Billy Gunn. The Vigilante was also one of the few super- hero features to survive the end of the \\"Golden Age\\" of super-hero comics, lasting as a solo feature until Action Comics #198 (1954), when he was permanently replaced by Tommy Tomorrow. The Vigilante was revived in the seventies in the pages of Justice League of America, when the Seven Soldiers of Victory were brought back into active continuity. Like Green Arrow, his Earth-2 counterpart was a lost member of the Seven Soldiers, but he did not participate in the JLA/JSA quest to rescue them. All the members were hurled through time after defeating Nebula Man (except for Wing who was killed). The Silver Age Green Arrow, Black Canary and Johnny Thunder and Thunderbolt saved the Vigilante from a tribe of Native Americans in the Old West who felt that eventually the white men would take over their land. The Earth-1 Vigilante's contact with the League was limited to a two-part story where he aided the JLA against aliens determined to over-pollute the Earth. He remarks in his first appearance in Adventure Comics that the League did help him re-establish his career, even providing him with a new motorcycle. He later teams up with, and saves the life of Superman (his marksmanship allowed him to shoot a silver bullet at the shadow of a werewolf who, being a magical creature, was about to kill the Man of Steel).World's Finest Comics #214 He also received a periodic feature in the pages of Adventure Comics, drawn by both Mike Sekowsky and Gray Morrow, and also in World's Finest Comics. The short-lived series in World's Finest culminated in the Vigilante coming to Gotham City to meet his old partner Stuff, only to find his friend murdered by his old enemy, the Dummy. At the end of this series, The Vigilante rode off with Stuff's son (who had been trained by Richard Dragon).World's Finest #247 (October/November 1977). DC Comics. Vigilante continued to sporadically appear as a superhero in DC Comics, having been established as running a dude ranch in Mesa City (the former home of Western hero Johnny Thunder). Seven Soldiers In Grant Morrison's Seven Soldiers #0, the Vigilante establishes a new Seven Soldiers of Victory to battle the monstrous spider of Miracle Mesa. He is apparently killed alongside the rest of the team,Seven Soldiers #0 (June 2005). DC Comics. only to re-appear as a ghost in Bulleteer #3 (also part of the Seven Soldiers series). He attempts to recruit a new team of seven to further battle the threat of the Sheeda. He claims Bulleteer's actions will allow him to 'rest'. Return In Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen Greg Saunders appears, alive, as the sheriff of Warpath, a town on the Mexican border formerly known for supervillain activity. Olsen's narration notes that Saunders has been dead and came back to life, but does not go into detail. Olsen also notes that Saunders appears younger, though he clearly retains all of his past experience. Saunders and a mysterious version of the hero known as the Guardian beat back a villainous invasion from Mexico.Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen #1 (December 2008). DC Comics. The New 52 In 2011, \\"The New 52\\" rebooted the DC Universe. Vigilante was renamed to Greg Sanders and operated in Opal City during the mid-20th Century. Shade contacted him to help rescue his great-grandson Darnell Caldecotte from Nazi spies.

Film * In 1947, Columbia Pictures released a 15-chapter serial loosely based on the original version of Greg Saunders called The Vigilante, starring Ralph Byrd in the title role. In the serial, this version of the Vigilante is a masked government agent who works undercover as a playboy actor starring in Westerns tasked with investigating rare blood red pearls that disappeared from a foreign country and were possibly smuggled into America. This serial makes Vigilante one of the first DC Comics characters adapted to live-action film, along with Congo Bill, the same year. Batman was adapted into a serial in 1943 and Hop Harrigan in 1946, while Superman was not made until 1948. The Fawcett Comics characters, Captain Marvel and Spy Smasher, which were later bought by DC, had serials in 1941 and 1942 respectively. * Vigilante makes a brief cameo appearance in Justice League: The New Frontier. ==References * Vigilante (Greg Saunders) at the DCU Guide * *Comic Book Profile: Vigilante (Greg Saunders) * Comic Book Profile: Earth-1 Vigilante (Greg Saunders) * Earth-2 Vigilante (Greg Saunders) Index Category:DC Comics titles Category:DC Comics Western characters Category:Fictional cowboys and cowgirls Category:Fictional ghosts Category:Fictional vigilantes Category:Golden Age superheroes Category:Western (genre) comics Category:Comics characters introduced in 1941 Category:Characters created by Mort Weisinger ","title":"Greg Saunders"},{"id":"20216673","text":"Because of the nature of onomatopoeia, there are many words which show a similar pronunciation in the languages of the world.

Chase is a fictional character that appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. Josh Segarra portrayed the character on The CW's live- action TV series Arrow. ==Publication history== Created by writer Marv Wolfman and penciler George P√©rez, Adrian Chase first appeared in New Teen Titans #23 (September 1982) and as the second fictional character to use the Vigilante moniker in New Teen Titans Annual #2 (August 1983). After his initial appearance, the character gained his own ongoing Vigilante series, initially written by Wolfman and later included writers such as Alan Moore and Paul Kupperberg. ==Fictional character biography== Adrian Chase was a New York City district attorney unlike his father Charles Chase. He sought justice his own way as the anti-hero Vigilante after his wife Doris Chase and their children were killed by mobsters.Vigilante (1983) at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. from the original on July 19, 2015. Adrian was initially shown taking pains to make sure he did not kill his enemies (unlike the Punisher from Marvel Comics) and would regularly use non-lethal weaponry to disable his opponents. Throughout the Vigilante series, Chase was tormented over the justice of his actions and the pain brought to others. Chase flirted with abandoning his Vigilante identity after he savagely beat an ex-convict who turned out to be innocent. Eventually, Chase did abandon his Vigilante identity, believing that he could be both more effective and happier as a judge. But during his absence, the Vigilante identity was assumed by two of his friends (fellow judge Alan Wells and then bailiff Dave Winston respectively) without his knowledge. But after Wells killed a police officer and in the wake of Winston's death at Peacemaker's hands, Chase once again assumed the Vigilante role, believing it was the only way to protect his loved ones. However, his experiences with Welles and Winston had damaged his fragile psyche beyond repair, causing him to adopt more vicious tactics in his war on crime. Seeking revenge on Peacemaker, the out of shape Adrian gets beaten in a fight and unmasked on live TV, thereby ending Chase's secret identity and forcing him even further into the Vigilante role. Eventually, Chase became ever more conflicted over the violence he engaged in and the harm he caused to those around him. He also became increasingly mentally unstable‚Äîalternating between bouts of enraged violence, paranoia and terrible remorse for his actions. Near the end, he even resorted to murdering innocent police officers who got in his way. His mounting guilt culminated in Chase contemplating the course of his life and then committing suicide.Vigilante #50 (February 1988). DC Comics. Before his death, he frequently battled Cannon and Saber and Electrocutioner. Adrian makes an appearance in the Day of Judgment limited series, as one of the dead heroes in Purgatory. He and the others run interference, battling the guardians of the realm, so other living heroes can escape with the soul of Hal Jordan. When the crisis concluded with Jordan assuming the Spectre mantle, Jim Corrigan appeared briefly on Earth, stating that the efforts of Chase and other heroes in Purgatory had earned an appeal in the shining city.Day of Judgement #5. DC Comics. It is been revealed recently that Adrian is the brother of Dorian Chase. ==Powers and abilities== As the Vigilante, Adrian Chase is a superb hand-to-hand combatant, a brilliant marksman, and a master of the lariat. He also possessed the ability to heal quickly and regenerate his body from injuries as serious as stabbings or gun shot wounds, although he was capable of dying if the injuries were severe enough. ==In other media== Television Josh Segarra portrayed Adrian Chase's live-action debut on The CW's Arrow as two different depictions. * The character's Earth-1 version was an alias used by Simon Morrison / Prometheus while retaining his comic counterpart's district attorney occupation and marriage to Doris Chase. * The character's Earth-2 doppelg√§nger operates as the Hood in the final season. Oliver Queen looks for Dwarf Star particles on Earth-2 for the Monitor but stumbles upon a crime scene and encounters Adrian and Black Canary (Earth-2), learning that Tommy Merlyn (aka the Dark Archer) has stolen the particles and plans to destroy the Glades. Oliver teams up with Adrian and Black Canary and successfully stops the Dark Archer's plan.

Warren was originally the fishing schooner Hawk, probably built at Marblehead, Massachusetts, and owned by John Twisdon at the time of her appraisal for naval service in the American Revolutionary War by Colonel Jonathan Glover and Edward Fettyplace on 12 October 1775. Hurriedly fitted out as the fourth vessel of the fledgling seagoing force assembled by General George Washington to intercept British supply ships bound for Boston, Massachusetts, Warren was commissioned at Beverly, Massachusetts, late in October 1775. Under the command of Captain Winborn Adams, the armed schooner sailed from Beverly on 31 October 1775, on her maiden voyage under Continental colors. Warren cruised north of Cape Ann, Massachusetts, and captured a small wooden schooner before bagging a Boston- bound supply ship, the schooner Rainbow, around 27 November 1775. Warren continued to cruise north of Cape Ann until she came across the brig Sally on 24 December 1775. Bound from Lisbon, Portugal, to New York City with 153 quarter casks of wine, Sally had been captured by the fifth-rate HMS Niger earlier in the month, placed under a prize crew, and ordered taken to Boston. Warren captured Sally and took her into Marblehead as a \\"Christmas present\\" for General Washington. After returning to port and undergoing repairs into January 1776, Warren was placed under the command of William Burke. She set sail from Boston on 25 March 1776 to intercept a convoy of transports but was frustrated by the weather in her attempt to pick off any strays while sailing in company with the Continental 6-gun schooner Franklin. The schooners then sailed their separate ways, with Warren going to the familiar waters north of Cape Ann. After another rent and recruiting new crewmen, Warren joined schooners Lynch and Lee in an attempt to get to sea on 27 May 1776, but that day they could not slip past the British 28-gun frigate HMS Milford patrolling outside Cape Ann harbor. When Warren did manage to get to sea, she scoured the waters of the bay near Cape Ann but did not score any successes that summer. In June 1776, she tangled with the British troopship Unity, bound for Halifax, Nova Scotia, with Hessian troops embarked, but met with a hot reception from the troopers' carriage guns and musket fire. While Warren was disengaging, some powder stored on her quarterdeck exploded, killing three and wounding seven. Returning to Beverly for repairs, Warren, still under the luckless Burke, put to sea again in late August 1776 to patrol the supply lanes between Nova Scotia and Boston. Before dawn on 26 August 1776, Warren and Lynch encountered the British 28-gun frigate HMS Liverpool patrolling. The two schooners separated to flee, and Liverpool chose to follow Warren. The ensuing engagement was one-sided, and Liverpool had little difficulty forcing Warren to strike her colors before noon. Burke and his crew were transferred to Liverpool, which kept Warren as a tender until 4 September 1776. On that day, Liverpool rendezvoused with Milford off Cape Ann, transferred Warrens guns to Milford, and sent Warren to Halifax. Condemned by a British prize court, Warren subsequently served as a tender to Milford until Warren ran aground in a storm near Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and was destroyed in late December 1776. ==See also== *List of ships captured in the 18th century *Glossary of nautical terms ==References== Category:Schooners of the United States Navy Category:American Revolutionary War ships of the United States Category:Age of Sail naval ships of the United States Category:Ships built in Marblehead, Massachusetts Category:Captured ships Category:1775 ships ","title":"USS Warren (1775)"},{"id":"20216813","text":"There have been many conflicts during Critical Mass events since the founding of the worldwide bicycling advocacy event in 1992. The conflicts have resulted in injuries, property damage, and arrests, and both bicyclists and motorized vehicle drivers have been victims. Critics say that Critical Mass, held primarily in large metropolitan cities, is a deliberate attempt to obstruct automotive traffic and disrupt normal city functions, when individuals taking part refuse to obey traffic laws, while participants variously consider it a celebration of cycling, of cyclists' rights, and a practical re-imagining of urban space. ==Berkeley, California, US== On May 11, 2007, an incident occurred in Berkeley, California, when an elderly motorist stopped at an intersection with dozens of bicycles crossing. Activists claim that the driver shouted, while bicyclists were in the intersection, \\"I'm sick of you people!\\" Police have not determined who had the right-of-way. The driver attempted to drive through the intersection. The motorist and his wife, two witnesses, and the police all claimed that the cyclists threw their bicycles under the vehicle. This was disputed by other witnesses. Critical Mass participants then rocked the vehicle, pounded the hood, and broke the windshield while verbally abusing the elderly couple. Approximately $3,000 worth of damage was done to the bicycles. Berkeley police did not make any arrests in the incident. ==Buffalo, New York, US== On May 30, 2003, in Buffalo, New York, during an incident known locally as \\"Critical Massacre,\\" police stopped two cyclists for \\"failure to yield to an emergency vehicle.\\" Several people were allegedly attacked by police. Nine cyclists were arrested and three were later convicted, including a journalist.http://www.mediastudy.com/articles/av5-27-04.html ==Chicago, Illinois, US== A cyclist at the June 27, 2008 Chicago Critical Mass is arrested for public drinking. Chicago Police Department officers are often seen riding with Critical Mass participants, and squad cars block intersections to provide safe passage to Critical Mass cyclists. However, on August 31, 2007, seven riders were arrested on charges of obstructing traffic and disobeying police, and were held overnight. According to some of those arrested, they were released late at night or early in the morning. On multiple occasions, Critical Mass participants attempted to ride on Lake Shore Drive, a road off limits to cyclists. Police prevented participants riding on Lake Shore Drive, by blocking entrance ramps with squad cars when Critical Mass riders approached the road. ==Honolulu, Hawaii, US== At dusk on March 28, 2008, in Honolulu, Hawaii, police collided with a young woman on a bicycle while trying to stop another bicyclist for traffic infractions. The young woman fell and hit her head on the ground, sustaining injuries requiring hospitalization. While no arrests were made, the police did issue citations and confiscate bicycles.David, Mari-Ela. Police Step Up Patrols at Critical Mass. Hawaii News Now. 26 April 2008. ==Houston, Texas, US== Due to the gradual increase of cyclists participating in Critical Mass, as well as complaints from motorists and concerns for safety, Houston Police Department officers helped direct the October 2013 Critical Mass ride in Houston, Texas by controlling intersections on the bike route. In January 2014, after two months of providing free security and safe passage through heavy intersections, the Houston Police Department began considering options to charge the group for providing security for the event, citing similarities to providing security for funeral processions through the city limits. Some Critical Mass riders have spoken out in protest of paying a fee to utilize extra security and escorting through busy intersections, while many others support paying fees for extra security to keep the ride safe, which has led to increased discussions between the city and group for additional alternatives to the building conflicts. ==London, United Kingdom== Metropolitan Police officers with their cycles awaiting the start of Critical Mass London, April 2006. In London on September 2005, a few weeks after the 7 July 2005 bombings, Metropolitan Police required the organisers to provide a route six days before the event and placed strict restrictions on riders, under threat of arrest. The threat was retracted when politicians and cyclist groups objected. In October 2005, the ride had close to 1,200 participants, significantly more than usual. A long stop in Parliament Square, part of the government's exclusion area in the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, led to a slow and cumbersome ride. One participant sought a declaration from the High Court of England and Wales that police need not be notified about the rides, in a \\"friendly action\\" in which neither side sought damages. The High Court agreed, exempting Critical Mass from notification under Section 11 of the Public Order Act 1986. The ruling was reversed on appeal. In 2008, Friends of the Earth, who supported the legal action, said the case would be appealed to England's highest legal authority, the House of Lords, on the grounds that, after 11 years, Critical Mass is \\"commonly or customarily held.\\" In October 2008, the House of Lords ruled in favour of the Critical Mass participant. During the 2012 Summer Olympics, cyclists were arrested on opening day after police claim they ignored regulations in place during the Olympics. Jenny Jones of the Green Party and the Greater London Assembly has questioned the police actions, calling them \\"out of all proportion to common sense\\"http://greenparty.org.uk/news/2012/07/31/green-party-call-on-the-mayor- to-keep-civil-liberties-at-the-forefront-during-the-olympics/ and \\"tragically unnecessary.\\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/jenny-jones-am/london-olympics- what-is-the-cost_b_1755785.html A Critical Mass website asked riders to be \\"peacefully assertive\\" during the monthly ride, while police claim they asked riders to keep to the south of the River Thames. When the riders got close to the Olympic Park, police began to cordon off the area and arrest riders. In total, 182 people were arrested, of whom 4 were charged, and 178 were bailed pending further inquiries. The action led to 5 of the 182 people arrested being convicted in court. ==Minneapolis, Minnesota, US== On the August 31, 2007, ride in Minneapolis, Minnesota, a confrontation occurred between cyclists and the police. The police presence included undercover officers, three marked squad cars, a state patrol helicopter, and unmarked vehicles. The ride had been linked with weekend protests of the following year's Republican National Convention. After the arrest of a cyclist for \\"riding in a snake-like manner,\\" cyclists began chanting \\"Let him go!\\" and \\"What's the charge?\\" The police called for backup, and dozens of police officers responded, using mace and tasers. Minneapolis police arrested 19 participants, including three minors. The adults were arrested on suspicion of rioting, a gross misdemeanor.Minneapolis Critical Mass Arrestee Support ==Minsk, Belarus== On May 27, 2011, in Minsk, Belarus, police forces aided by special units transported 13 cyclists to the police station for violation of traffic rules and for not following orders to disband. Detained participants were fingerprinted and fined, then released. On April 30, 2016 two cyclists were arrested during a Critical Mass action. As of September 2016, one was released and the other is facing trial. ==New York City, New York, US== Police in New York City have claimed that Critical Mass bicyclists blocking intersections to allow bikes to pass may delay emergency vehicles in the gridlock. 2004 Republican National Convention During the US 2004 Republican National Convention, police arrested 250 riders after the ride caused \\"massive disruptions\\" in the city. Many court cases resulted regarding the legality of the ride, whether police have the right to arrest cyclists and seize bicycles, and whether the event needs a permit. In December 2004, a federal judge dismissed New York City's injunction against Critical Mass as a \\"political event.\\" On March 23, 2005, the city filed a lawsuit seeking to prevent Time's Up!, a direct action environmental group, from promoting or advertising Critical Mass rides. The lawsuit also stated that Time's Up! and the public could not ride or gather at a Critical Mass bike ride, claiming a permit was required. 2008 bicycle rally During a bicycle rally on July 25, 2008, NYPD patrolman Patrick Pogan pushed rider Christopher Long off his bicycle. In a criminal complaint, Pogan wrote that he had ordered Long to stop because he was weaving in and out of traffic, forcing vehicles to swerve or stop, and generally disrupting the normal flow of traffic. In addition, Pogan wrote that he suffered lacerations on his arms because Long steered his bike into him and knocked him down, and when he tried to place Long under arrest, Long began flailing, kicking and screaming, \\"You are pawns in the game!\\" Long spent the next day in police custody on charges of attempted assault, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct. Within days, members of the rally's sponsoring organization Time's Up! posted a video of the incident on YouTube. The video went viral and received over 400,000 hits within five days. Critical Mass activists claimed it supported their claims that the police department has demonstrated a pattern of arresting participants in the rally on false charges. Witnesses also disputed Pogan's account, saying that Long was the one to receive injuries, traffic was stopped for the rally, and that Pogan had simply scanned the group of cyclists to find one he could take down. The union that represents NYPD officers said Pogan was just doing his job to protect the public from a reckless bike rider, and Pogan's father ‚Äî himself a retired NYPD detective ‚Äî defended him, saying \\"You gotta do what you gotta do to make an arrest.\\" The prosecutor's office dismissed the charges against Long. NYPD placed Pogan, who had spent only three weeks as a police officer, on a desk assignment while the city investigated the incident. On December 16, 2008, Pogan appeared in court and pleaded not guilty to felony charges of falsifying business records and filing a false instrument, and misdemeanor charges of third-degree assault, second-degree harassment and making a punishable false written statement. After the indictment, the police department suspended Pogan and, two months later, Pogan resigned as the department prepared to fire him. His attorney said that his defense would center on the department's training procedures and claims that events occurring off-camera needed to be taken into account. On July 8, 2009, it was reported that Long, then a Hoboken, NJ, resident, was suing the New York Police Department for $1.5 million, alleging that Pogan falsified his arrest report in order to legitimize his assault on Long. During his trial in April 2010, Pogan acknowledged that the video looked \\"very extreme.\\" He testified that he had anticipated a collision with Long, since the rider lowered his right shoulder as the officer approached. Jurors found Pogan not guilty of harassment and assault and acquitted him of four of the seven counts of which he had been charged. He was found guilty of filing a criminal complaint that contained false statements concerning the cyclist. Pogan received no jail time but, because he is a convicted felon, he is not eligible to become a New York City police officer in the future. Long said in an interview that he was pleased with the verdict, in part because it would prevent Pogan from becoming a New York City police officer again. ==Porto Alegre, Brazil== On February 25, 2011, an automobile driver deliberately collided with around 20 cyclists that were participating in a Critical Mass event in Rua Jos√© do Patrocinio in Porto Alegre, southern Brazil. Out of approximately 150 people that were taking part in the event, dozens of bicycles were damaged, 15 people were injured and eight were transported to the emergency room. While the driver left the scene of the incident, demonstrators remained on the street, demanding that the driver be found and arrested. The driver was later identified as 47-year-old Ricardo Jos√© Neis. After Neis gave his statement to the police, his attorney, Luis Fernando Coimbra Albino, stated that the Neis was acting in self-defense after several cyclists threatened him and his son and assaulted his car. According to witnesses present at the event, Neis was acting violently behind the bicycles and hit the rear wheels of two different cyclists, and any contact from the cyclists on his car was meant as a sign asking him to slow the vehicle down. Witnesses also reported that Neis had two different transversal roads he could have taken to avoid waiting for the cyclists to proceed. On March 1, 2011, Neis attempted to transfer from a hospital to a psychiatric clinic, but this request was rejected by court officials. He was held in the hospital under police custody, but was later released and indicted under 17 counts of attempted murder.http://www.theurbancountry.com/2011/04/brazil-critical-mass- updateinterview.html One of the most severely injured cyclists, 23-year-old Ricardo Mattes Ambus, was readmitted to the hospital on March 3, 2011, due to an intracranial haematoma. During the following week, between February 28 and March 6, 2011, many protests in support of Critical Mass Porto Alegre were organized in several major cities in South America and around the world. In response, local cyclists organized the World Bike Forum in Porto Alegre to raise awareness of violence in traffic against cyclists. The first Forum took place during the anniversary of the incident. On November 24, 2016, Ricardo Neis was sentenced to 12 years and 9 months in jail for attempted murder and aggravated assault. ==San Francisco, California, US== July 1997 On the night of July 25, 1997, in San Francisco, the ride attracted 5,000 participants, which resulted in congested traffic, confrontations with motorists, and arrests. Interest and tension had been growing for several weeks due to increased rhetoric from then-Mayor Willie Brown regarding cracking down on the event. The local newspapers published a city-approved route after the mayor withdrew his threat to have bicyclists arrested for not obtaining a parade permit. Because of the large turnout, it was difficult if not impossible for cyclists to follow the sanctioned route. Riders instead found themselves engaged in verbal and physical altercations with motorists and police, as well as among themselves. Two officers reported injuries in confrontations with bike riders. Local media reported that \\"about 250\\" bicyclists were arrested, most for disrupting traffic, and a few for being drunk in public, battery, and outstanding warrants. March 2007 On the March 2007 ride in San Francisco, a rider was arrested on felony (later reduced to misdemeanor) charges in San Francisco's Tenderloin neighborhood for denting a limousine using a bicycle lock. The driver told police he got out of his car to talk to two cyclists who allegedly blocked his path. After exchanging words with one of the cyclists, the driver said he grabbed one of the bicycles and tried to pull it out of the way. He then got back into his limo to go around the riders, but before he could move, he said, another cyclist ran into the side of his car, then punched the hood with a U-shaped lock. The cyclist told police he only hit the limousine after the driver gunned his engine. During the incident, one of the limousine's tires was slashed and the driver's keys were stolen. Towards the end of the ride, near the Japan Center and Western Addition neighborhoods, a mother from Redwood City, California, traveling with her two young daughters in the vehicle, tried to drive through the mass of riders. A witness claimed to have observed the driver strike a cyclist and flee before cyclists chased and surrounded her vehicle. The driver denied striking a cyclist and alleged that hundreds of cyclists surrounded her minivan while she and her 11- and 13-year-old daughters were inside, banged on her car, scratched the paint, and threw a bicycle through the rear window of the vehicle, causing $5,300 in damages. http://www.fogcityjournal.com/news_in_brief/bcn_critical_mass_070405.shtml In April 2007, San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom requested that Critical Mass riders police themselves. \\"It does the bicycle-advocacy community no good to have people that are aggressive and dispirit the entire movement,\\" Newsom said. \\"I would encourage the bicycle coalition to say, 'Look, we don't put up with this, enough is enough.' \\" November 2009 In November 2009, Stanley Roberts of KRON 4 News recorded several Critical Mass confrontations between bicyclists and vehicles at Van Ness and O'Farrell Streets. An old Critical Mass website advised riders not to be confrontational and block traffic, but in footage filmed by Roberts, bicyclists engaged in confrontational arguments with motorists and blocked roads to vehicular traffic. August 2015 In August 2015, KQED posted an article on a Critical Mass confrontation between a bicyclist and a female Zipcar driver in the San Francisco Marina District. 39 year old Ian Hespelt was arrested a few days later by the San Francisco Police Department's bicycle patrol at AT&T; Park during the Billy Joel concert. Hespelt was charged with four felonies including assault, vandalism, maliciously throwing a substance at a vehicle and false imprisonment. Hespelt was also wanted in Washington state on a felony drug charge warrant. ==Seattle, Washington, US== June 2006 Two riders were arrested during the June 2006 ride in Seattle, Washington, after a fight with two undercover detectives whom the cyclists confused for gang members. Witnesses disputed the claim made by the sheriff's office that the detectives identified themselves. The King County Sheriff's Office decided not to press felony charges in the case, saying there were too many issues over the circumstances surrounding the allegations. July 2008 On July 25, 2008, Critical Mass prevented a motorist from driving from a curbside parking space into cyclists in Seattle's Critical Mass on East Aloha. The motorist made statements to Seattle police that he drove away, hitting bicycles and riders (one of them an attorney), and told the press that he \\"freaked out and overreacted\\" when bicyclists threatened to tip his vehicle. According to some witnesses, the motorist drove into at least two cyclists and tried to flee. A group of riders caught the vehicle, broke its rear windshield, slashed the tires, and assaulted the motorist when he got out. Damage to the car was estimated at $1,500. The motorist was struck in the back of his head by a bike lock and later hospitalized. Two cyclists were arrested for vandalism to the car. Seattle police did not charge the motorist. ==Vilnius, Lithuania== On July 27, 2007, in Vilnius, Lithuania, police took five participants into custody, including two minors, for not following orders to disband. ==Walnut Creek, California, US== In Walnut Creek, California, on June 20, 2008, a car bumped into the rear wheel of a Critical Mass rider. An argument ensued among the driver and passenger of the car and the cyclist involved, after which the passenger and driver of the car assaulted the cyclist. The police arrived and arrested the passenger and driver of the automobile involved in the assault.http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2008/06/20/18509674.php ==Warsaw, Poland== On June 21, 2002, in Warsaw, Poland, the Critical Mass event was stopped by a cordon of fully armed riot police on Plac Konstytucji (Constitution Square), who demanded their dispersal and detained some of the participants. Other Critical Mass participants responded with a sit-in protest, blocking an important traffic junction, and then tried to evade the blockade by taking different routes to Plac Zamkowy (Castle Square), the Critical Mass rally point.http://www.raster.art.pl/galeria/artysci/rowelucja/rowelucja.htmhttps://web.archive.org/web/20080603011249/http://www.masa.waw.pl/2002/0621.htmlhttp://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/kraj/1,34309,890904.html This event was widely reported by the media and, as a result, the Warsaw municipality decided to legalize future events, rather than escalate the conflict. Beginning in September 2002, Critical Mass events in Warsaw are organized in full cooperation with the police force. Once a year in August, beginning in 2007, a special Critical Mass is organized in cooperation with the city officials to commemorate the Warsaw Uprising. ==Buenos Aires, Argentina== On March 28, 2013, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, a taxi driver ran over a group of Critical Mass riders, injuring 2 cyclists, before fleeing from the scene.http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/sociedad/3-216870-2013-03-29.html ==References== Category:DIY culture Category:Environmentalism Category:History of cycling Category:Protests Category:Cycling events Category:Crime ","title":"Conflicts involving Critical Mass"},{"id":"20216821","text":"The McCarthy Homestead Cabin is a remnant of early settlement in what would become Glacier National Park.

He is a tall pace bowler known for his accuracy and has been compared to former Australian paceman Glenn McGrath. ==Early career== Hazlewood was raised in the small country town of Bendemeer, New South Wales, situated 40 km north of Tamworth. He is the younger son of Trevor and Anne Hazlewood, having an older brother and sister.As a youngster he moved to Sydney in order to play Sydney Grade Cricket for the St George Cricket Club. He would frequently engage with his older brother in fierce backyard cricket matches, and by the age of 12 was already playing for Tamworth against grown men. Hazlewood was selected for New South Wales at the age of 17, making him the youngest paceman to represent the state. His first-class debut was at the Sydney Cricket Ground against the touring New Zealand side in November 2008. Hazlewood also became the youngest to make his One Day International debut for Australia on 22 June 2010. A right arm fast bowler, he has also played for Australia Under-19s and was the youngest member of Australia's squad for the 2008 Under-19 World Cup. ==T20 franchise career== In the 2020 IPL auction, he was bought by the Chennai Super Kings ahead of the 2020 Indian Premier League. ==International career== Hazlewood playing for New South Wales in 2011 He bowled 7 overs on his One Day International debut and picked up one wicket for 41 runs. He made his T20I debut vs West Indies on 13 February 2013 and picked up 1‚Äì36 in 4 overs. He picked career best figures 4‚Äì30 in a T20 vs England. He made his Test match debut for Australia against India at the Brisbane Cricket Ground on 17 December 2014. He took 5 wickets in the first innings, conceding 68 runs. He was a part of the Australian squad for the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup and played a part in their triumph, picking up 4 wickets against Pakistan in the quarter-finals. In November 2015, Hazlewood became the first player to achieve the player of the match award in a day-night Test match ever. In this match against New Zealand, he took the first ever wicket in day-night Test by lbw Martin Guptill. He also took the first five-wicket haul in day-night Test cricket history with the figures of 6 for 70, en route to reaching 50 career wickets in just his 12th Test, faster than Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Mitchell Johnson. In January 2017, Hazlewood recorded an unusual innings in the first ODI against New Zealand. He had a 26-minute long 54-run tenth wicket partnership with Marcus Stoinis without facing a single ball. He was run out at the non-striker's end with Australia falling just seven runs short of a win and he became the first player to be dismissed for a diamond duck in a partnership of over fifty runs. This was Hazlewood's first ODI dismissal, setting the record for the most ODI matches played without being dismissed (33), a record he had overtaken in December 2016 after his 28th ODI. Hazlewood picked up nine wickets in the Champions Trophy that year while topping the ICC ODI bowlers' rankings. In April 2018, he was awarded a national contract by Cricket Australia for the 2018‚Äì19 season. In July 2019, he was named in Australia's squad for the 2019 Ashes series in England. Hazlewood played in 4 of the 5 matches of the series, taking 20 wickets at an average of 21.85. On 16 July 2020, Hazlewood was named in a 26-man preliminary squad of players to begin training ahead of a possible tour to England following the COVID-19 pandemic.

Arthur went to Wagga Wagga Christian Brothers' and later to St. Joseph's College, Hunters Hill where he benefited under Brother Henry, the College's legendary coach of the 1930s. He won the GPS Schools sprint championship in 1942 and was an army sprint champion during his wartime service. He was a gunner in the AIF who saw three years of active service during World War II. ==Club rugby== Tonkin joined the Gordon Club after his discharge and played the first of six matches for New South Wales in 1947. A powerfully built sprinter he added menace to every team in which he played because of his rare acceleration and scoring potential.City of Wagga Sporting Hall of Fame ==Representative rugby career== He missed a place in the Test against New Zealand in 1947 but was selected for that year's epic Wallaby tour and became one of the spearheads of Australia's attack in Britain after champion Manly winger Charlie Eastes broke his leg in an early tour match. Tonkin appeared on the wing in all five Tests of the tour using his blinding acceleration to get around his opposing wingers to score tries against Scotland and Ireland.

Retrieved 19 September 1964. is a consultant who was a Republican California State Assemblyman representing the 42nd district. ==Early life, education, and early political career== Brian Nestande grew up in a political family. His father, Bruce Nestande, was a state legislator and Orange County Supervisor during the 1970s and 1980's. Nestande graduated from Canyon High School in Anaheim in 1982. Nestande earned his Bachelor of Arts in political science from Cal State Fullerton in 1991. Immediately after graduating from college, Nestande obtained a job as Deputy Campaign Manager of the successful congressional campaign of Michael Huffington in Santa Barbara County. In 1994, Nestande managed the successful congressional campaign of then-Palm Springs Mayor Sonny Bono. Nestande went to work in Bono's office as Chief of Staff until Bono's death in early 1998. Bono's widow, Mary Bono Mack, was elected to succeed Sonny, and Nestande served as her chief of staff from 1998 until 2000. In 2000, Nestande built a government affairs consulting business named Nestande and Associates which was headquartered in Palm Desert. He represented a variety of clients working on issues involving alternative energy, health care, telecommunications as well as on other projects and issues in Riverside County. ==California State Assembly== Elections ;2008 In 2008, Nestande ran for the 64th State Assembly district. He defeated businesswoman Kelly McCarty in the Republican primary 68%-32%. He won the general election unopposed. ;2010 In 2010, he won the Republican primary, defeating Jeffrey Lemasters Tahir 76%-24%. He won re-election to a second term defeating Jose Medina 57%-43%. ;2012 After redistricting, he decided to run in the newly redrawn California's 42nd State Assembly district. He won re-election to a third term, defeating Democrat Mark Orozco 55%-45%. Tenure The first bill Nestande introduced in Sacramento was to limit the number of bills a legislator could introduce. Nestande later led a bipartisan coalition that closed a loophole on out-of-state businesses. In January 2011, Nestande criticized a proposal to cut in-home supportive services. He sponsored legislation to aid the Salton Sea restoration. He proposed legislation that would create online education standards, increasing college access to those unable to participate in traditional classroom instruction. In June 2014, Nestande expressed concern about the potential for money in the Governor's budget to be diverted from tech education programs. He has argued that the state government should include unfunded liabilities when making spending decisions. In January 2014, Nestande called for a hearing about the 43 employees with a criminal record hired by Covered California, the California state health exchange administering the Affordable Care Act in that state. In October 2013, he sponsored legislation requiring lawmakers who want legislative health care coverage to enroll through the Covered California exchange, saying \\"If we truly want to understand how the ACA is working and being implemented, there is no better way than to enroll in the exchange along with the people.\\" Committee assignments ;2013 *Budget *Governmental Organization, Vice-chair *Health *Insurance *Revenue and Taxation ==2014 congressional election== Nestande announced in May 2013 that he would challenge first-term Representative Raul Ruiz, D-Palm Desert, to represent California's 36th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives.

Nestande, described by the Press Enterprise as the moderate candidate, received more votes than the conservative Ray Haynes, a former state assemblyman, in the blanket primary. Nestande won 34% of the vote to Haynes' 16%. In September 2014, Roll Call wrote that Nestande \\"has proved to be one of the cycle‚Äôs more disappointing candidates\\" in terms of fundraising, but a campaign spokesperson in October 2014 told the Desert Sun that there was a \\"strong finance plan for the end game.\\" The campaign also stated that opponent Ruiz is receiving financial contributions from outside forces, \\"while more than 90 percent of Nestande's money is from California.\\"http://atr.rollcall.com/house-races-2014-raul-ruiz-california- brian-nestande/ In October 2014, the Press Enterprise offered their endorsement to Nestande who they write is \\"best-suited to protecting taxpayers‚Äô money, tackling the federal government‚Äôs mounting spending and debt and generally keeping government from hampering job growth and interfering in individuals‚Äô personal affairs.\\" ==Personal life== Nestande is the son of politician Bruce Nestande, himself a former California assemblyman and Orange County Supervisor.

As its title indicates, the book is an entrant in the long-running series of stories on the Land of Oz written by L. Frank Baum and various successors.Paul Nathanson, Over the Rainbow: The Wizard of Oz as a Secular Myth of America, Albany, NY, State University of New York Press, 1991.Suzanne Rahn, The Wizard of Oz: Shaping an Imaginary World, New York, Twayne, 1998.Michael O'Neal Riley, Oz and Beyond: The Fantasy World of L. Frank Baum, Lawrence, KS, University Press of Kansas, 1997. ==Authorship== Like his predecessor John R. Neill, Dick Martin was a veteran Oz illustrator who moved into Oz authorship; The Ozmapolitan of Oz is Martin's single sustained work of Oz fiction. He includes Decalcomania, Xenophobia, Yahooism, and Zymolysis in a list of human diseases;Dick Martin, The Ozmapolitan of Oz, Kinderhook, IL, The International Wizard of Oz Club, 1986; p. 45. his \\"Game Preserve\\" is a Parcheesi-like board game laid out in a landscape.The Ozmapolitan of Oz, pp. 52-7. As both author and artist, Martin had control over the total expression of his fiction. Like most Oz authors, he supplied a human protagonist for young readers to identify with; unusually, he made his protagonist a teenager, a fifteen-year-old boy. In his illustrations, Martin made Dorothy Gale appear somewhat older than she is generally portrayed; she looks like she is at least twelve years old. A decade and a half later, Dave Hardenbrook would also offer a teenage protagonist in his 2000 novel The Unknown Witches of Oz; Martin does not go as far as Hardenbrook later would in making his teen hero a romantic interest. ==The term \\"Ozmapolitan\\"== The word \\"Ozmopolitan\\" was first used in 1904, in promotional material created by Baum's publisher Reilly & Britton. The idea was that the Wizard of Oz started an Oz newspaper so titled (a conceit that Martin adopts for his novel). Reilly & Britton issued press releases in this Oz-newspaper form in 1904 and 1905, publicizing Baum's The Marvelous Land of Oz and related projects. It is possible though not certain that Baum himself wrote some of these early \\"Ozmapolitan\\" press releases.Katharine M. Rogers, L. Frank Baum, Creator of Oz: A Biography, New York, St. Martin's Press, 2002; pp. 127, 270 n. 17. The publisher (under its later name Reilly & Lee) issued more \\"Ozmapolitan\\" press releases in the 1920s, to publicize the novels of Ruth Plumly Thompson, and in the 1960s for other products (including Merry Go Round in Oz, with illustrations by Dick Martin). Three decades later, Hungry Tiger Press used the same publicity technique for issues of its Oz-story Magazine. The name has also been employed as the title of a periodical published by the International Wizard of Oz Club, edited and illustrated by Martin. Other fan literature has used the word as well. ==The plot== Septimius Septentrion is three weeks into a job as a printer at the Ozmapolitan in the Emerald City of Oz. A chance meeting with Princess Dorothy leads to a plan to drum up news to promote the sleepy Ozite newspaper. Accompanied by a mifket named Jinx and Dorothy's cat Eureka, \\"Tim\\" and Dorothy embark on a cross- country trip through the Winkie Country. The plan is to meet the Scarecrow at his corncob-shaped residence; but the plan quickly goes awry. The party encounter a fortune-teller and receive cryptic gingerbread-fortune-cookie predictions: Dorothy's is \\"A Fat Chance,\\" Tim's is \\"A Blue Moon,\\" and Jinx's is \\"A Silent Melody.\\" The Expeditioneers, as they call themselves, learn the meanings of these fortunes as they progress through an Art Colony, a Game Preserve, and a long and complex subterranean journey. They encounter strange creatures and phenomena, including a Trade Wind, an out-of-date inventor, and a dragon-like Tyrannicus Terrificus. They rescue a frozen (and therefore silent) water spirit named Melody, a cousin of the rainbow fairy Polychrome. Melody later repays the favor by saving the travelers from the dragon. After a long spell lost in caverns, the group meets up with the Scarecrow and his bosom friend the Tin Woodman, who are sailing in the Scarecrow's new boat, the Blue Moon. They all return to the Emerald City, with abundant material for the Ozmapolitan. In the process, Tim's secret royal background is revealed. (The idea of the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman as boaters derives from \\"The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman,\\" one of the Little Wizard Stories of Oz first published in 1913-14\\\\. King Septimius has six older sisters, reminiscent of the Six Snubnosed Princesses in Sky Island.) At the end of the novel, the Wizard makes an offhanded reference toward returning to ballooning. this is ultimately realized in Eric Shanower's The Giant Garden of Oz. ==The Art Colony== Given the fact that Martin was an artist before he became an author, his treatment of the Art Colony in his novel's Chapter Six, \\"Artistic Interpretations,\\" is noteworthy. Dorothy and her friends have their portraits painted by a family of animated paintbrushes. The portraits are wildly unrealistic and distorted in varying ways -- Jinx gets a cubist portrait -- and the travelers are appalled to discover that they have been magically transformed to resemble their portraits, instead of the other way around. Dorothy's portrait depicts her as \\"a willowy, boneless, wraith-like creature with soulful eyes, gazing off in different directions.\\" Suddenly her physical form possesses the same \\"elongated arms and snaky fingers....\\" Tim becomes \\"a lumpy, bow-legged clown with green skin, purple hair, and mismatched ears.\\" Dorothy proclaims, \\"We're victims of a Modern Art movement.\\" It is only with magical help (obtained from a fat man named Chance) that the sufferers can return to their natural forms. Martin may have been writing mainly to amuse his young readers; but his handling of the subject suggests that he was out of sympathy with much of twentieth-century art. ==Response== In 1987, a year after the appearance of The Ozmapolitan of Oz, Chris Dulabone published his The Colorful Kitten of Oz, in which Eureka is the title character. The book includes an afterword that addresses perceived inconsistencies in Martin's book. ==References * The Ozmapolitan press releases, 1904 and after Category:Oz (franchise) books Category:1986 fantasy novels Category:1986 American novels Category:1986 children's books ","title":"The Ozmapolitan of Oz"},{"id":"20217012","text":"Beijing Commune () is a China-based gallery, mainly featuring emerging artists' exhibitions. ==Commercial Gallery== Beijing Commune, located in the southern side of 798 Art Zone, was developed in 2004 by Leng Lin.

Marcia was a daughter of the Roman Senator Quintus Marcius Barea Sura and Antonia Furnilla. Quintus Marcius Barea Sura was a friend to future Roman Emperor Vespasian. Her younger sister Marcia Furnilla was the second wife of future Roman Emperor Titus. Marcia was a maternal aunt to Furnilla‚Äôs and Titus‚Äô daughter Julia Flavia or Flavia Julia Titi. Marcia‚Äôs paternal uncle was the Roman Senator Quintus Marcius Barea Soranus, while her paternal cousin was the noble woman Marcia Servilia Sorana. Marcia‚Äôs paternal grandfather was Quintus Marcius Barea, who was Suffect Consul in 34 and Proconsul of the Africa Province in 41-43, while her maternal grandfather could have been Aulus Antonius Rufus, a Suffect Consul either in 45.http://dcodriscoll.pbworks.com/Marcius_Barea The family of Marcia was connected to the opponents of Roman Emperor Nero. In 65 after the failure of the Pisonian conspiracy, her family was disfavored by Nero. ==Life== Marcia was born and raised in Rome. During the reign of Roman Emperor Claudius (41-54), Marcia married a Spanish Roman general and senator called Marcus Ulpius Traianus. Traianus originally came from Italica (near modern Seville, Spain) in the Roman Province of Hispania Baetica. After Marcia married Traianus, for a time they lived in Italica.

Trajan became and served as a Roman Emperor from 98 until his death in 117. He married a woman called Pompeia Plotina. Marcia owned clay-bearing estates called the Figlinae Marcianae, which was located in North Italy. When Marcia died, Trajan inherited these estates from his mother.

Found in Golconda mines of Kollur and originally cut in India, the diamond was the adornment in the Trimbakeshwar Shiva Temple, near Nashik, in the state of Maharashtra, India from at least 1500 to 1817. The British East India Company captured the diamond through the Third Anglo-Maratha War and sold it to British jewellers Rundell and Bridge in 1818. Rundell and Bridge recut the diamond in 1818,CCPA 2003: p. 117. after which it made its way into the handle of the 1st Marquess of Westminster's dress sword. The Nassak Diamond was imported into the United States in 1927, and was considered one of the first 24 great diamonds of the world by 1930. American jeweller Harry Winston acquired the Nassak Diamond in 1940 in Paris, France and recut it to its present flawless emerald cut shape. Winston sold the diamond to a New York jewellery firm in 1942. Mrs. William B. Leeds of New York received the gem in 1944 as a sixth anniversary present and wore it in a ring. The Nassak Diamond was last sold at an auction in New York in 1970 to Edward J. Hand, a 48-year-old trucking firm executive from Greenwich, Connecticut. Currently the diamond is held at a private museum in Lebanon, though there are calls for its return and restoration to the Indian temple. ==History== Trimbakeshwar Shiva Temple in Nashik, India The Nassak Diamond originated in the 15th century in India. Although the date of the original cutting is unknown, the original cutting was performed in India and had sacrificed everything to size while giving the diamond a form and appearance similar to that of the Koh-i-Noor diamond. From at least 1500 to 1817, the Nassak Diamond adorned the Shivalinga in the Trimbakeshwar Shiva Temple, near Nashik (Nassak), India on the upper Godavari River. As priests worshiped Shiva, the diamond eventually acquired its name from its long-term proximity to Nashik. In 1817, the British East India Company and the Maratha Empire in India began the Third Anglo-Maratha War. During the Maratha war, the Nassak Diamond disappeared from the Shiva temple. The war ended in 1818 and the British East India Company was left decisively in control of most of India. The Nassak Diamond quickly resurfaced in the possession of Baji Rao II the last independent Indian Peshwa Prince, who handed over the diamond to an English colonel named J. Briggs. In turn, Briggs delivered the diamond to Francis Rawdon-Hastings, the 1st Marquess of Hastings who had conducted the military operations against the Peshwa. Rawdon-Hastings delivered the diamond to the East India Company as part of the spoils of the Maratha war. The East India Company then sent the Nassak Diamond to England, to be sold on the London diamond market in 1818. Vectorized drawings of an 1876 sketch of the Nassak Diamond. At the London diamond market, the Nassak Diamond was presented as an approximately diamond of great purity \\"but of bad form,\\" having a somewhat pear-shape. The diamond further was characterised as a \\"rudely faceted, lustreless mass.\\" Illustrations in Herbert Tillander's book \\"Diamond Cuts in Historic Jewelry ‚Äì 1381 to 1910\\" show it as being a semi-triangular moghal cut with a plateau top, similar looking to the 115-carat Taj-E-Mah Diamond which resides in the Iranian Crown Jewels. Despite its appearance, the diamond was sold for about 3,000 pounds (equivalent today to ¬£) to Rundell and Bridge, a British jewellery firm based in London. Rundell and Bridge held onto the diamond for the next 13 years. During that time, the jewellery firm instructed its diamond cutter \\"to keep as closely as possible to the traces of the Hindu cutter, 'amending his defects, and accommodating the pattern to the exigencies of the subject matter.'\\" The recut by Rundell and Bridge from to resulted of a loss of no more than 10 percent of the original weight of the diamond. In 1831, Rundell and Bridge sold the diamond to the Emanuel Brothers for about 7,200 pounds (today about ¬£). Six years later in 1837, the Emanuel Brothers sold the Nassak Diamond at a public sale to Robert Grosvenor, the 1st Marquess of Westminster. At one point, the Marquess mounted the diamond in the handle of his dress sword. In 1886, the diamond was valued at between 30,000 and 40,000 pounds (today between ¬£ and ¬£), due in part to its vast gain in brilliancy from the re-cut by Rundell and Bridge. ==Mauboussin and the lawsuit== Side view 13a, top view 13b, and bottom view 13c drawings of the Nassak Diamond as it appeared between the Rundell and Bridge recut and the 1940 Winston recut. A US court ruled in 1930 that the shown recut revealed nothing more than \\"a large diamond, cut in an ordinary way.\\" These drawings are from Max Bauer's 1904 book \\"Precious Stones\\". In 1922, George Mauboussin had become the named partner of \\"Mauboussin, Successeur de Noury,\\" a French jewellery house that traced its roots to its founding by M. Rocher in 1827. In March 1927, the Duke of Westminster used US importers Mayers, Osterwald & Muhlfeld to sell the diamond to Parisian jeweller George Mauboussin, who was living in the United States at the time. For the name George Mauboussin, see A Brief History of the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals Mauboussin's importation of the diamond into the United States was tax free, since the diamond was determined to be an artistic antiquity produced more than one hundred years prior to the date of importation. However, E. F. Bendler, an American wholesaler and dealer in diamonds and a rival of Mauboussin, filed a protest that resulted in a lawsuit to determine whether a tax should be imposed on the diamond's entry into the United States. By November 1927, Mauboussin considered selling the diamond to friends of General Primo de Rivera, who planned to give the diamond to the dictator on the occasion of his forthcoming investiture as marshal of Spain. That sale never materialised and the lawsuit continued. The diamond was nearly lost in a theft that occurred in January 1929, when four gunmen robbed the Park Avenue jewellery store where the Nassak Diamond was being kept. However, the thieves missed finding the diamond because it was being stored in a soiled envelope. After the first robbery attempt, Mauboussin's jewellery firm opened a branch in New York City on 1 October 1929, only to be met by the Wall Street Crash of 1929 at the end of October. To compound matters, the same gang of international robbers tried to steal the Nassak Diamond again in May 1930, but once again missed it. Prior to the outcome of the lawsuit, the insured diamond was valued between US$400,000 and $500,000 (allowing for inflation, this would now be $ and $). At the time the lawsuit was pending, imported diamonds that were cut and suitable for use in the manufacture of jewellery, without actually being set as jewellery were subject to an ad valorem tax of 20% its value. However, artistic antiquities produced more than one hundred years prior to the date of importation could be imported into the United States duty-free; that is to say, without having to pay a 20% tax. The final decision of the lawsuit was released on 4 June 1930. In that decision, the court determined that the unset Nassak Diamond was not an artistic antiquity and was suitable for use in manufacture of jewellery. In particular, the court said that the 1930 Nassak Diamond was nothing more than \\"a large diamond, cut in an ordinary way.\\"CCPA 2003: p. 125. As a result, the importer owed an ad valorem tax of 20% of the diamond's value under US Tariff Act of 1922. ==Harry Winston's influence== In 1930, the Nassak Diamond had a somewhat elongated triangle form with rounded corners. The depth of one side of the triangle was thicker than the other.CCPA 2003: p. 122. The diamond was \\"without flaw, unusually brilliant, and so cut as to well display its clear, crystal brilliancy.\\" While on exhibit at the 1933 World's Fair in Chicago, Illinois, the \\"Official guide book of the fair, 1933\\" described the diamond as a flawless, blue- white stone with a reputation of being \\"the finest diamond outside crown jewels collections.\\" In 1940, American jeweller Harry Winston acquired the Nassak Diamond in Paris, France and recut it to its present flawless emerald cut shape. Winston sold the diamond to a New York jewellery firm in 1942. In 1944, Commander William Bateman Leeds, Jr., millionaire son of the inventor of a tin plating process and friend of George Mauboussin, purchased the diamond for his wife, Reflexion Olive Leeds (born Olive Hamilton), and gave it to her in a set ring as a sixth anniversary present. ==Present information== In early 1964, gemologist G. Robert (Bob) Crowningshield evaluated the Nassak Diamond at the Gemological Institute of America gem laboratory to produce a Diamond Grading Report. In that same year, the Nassak Diamond was placed in the hands of J. & S.S. DeYoung, a then 100-year-old estate jewellery house located in New York. The Gemological Institute of America Diamond Grading Report that came with the diamond indicated that it was Internally Flawless. In early April 1970, the diamond was rated one of the thirty great stones of the world and placed on display at Parke-Bernet Galleries in New York City. On 16 April 1970, the diamond was sold at auction for $500,000 (allowing for inflation, this would now be $) to Edward J. Hand, a then 48-year-old trucking firm executive from Greenwich, Connecticut. This was the second highest auction price ever for a diamond at that time, the first being circa $1.1 million for the Taylor-Burton Diamond several years earlier. Six years later, the diamond was placed on display in November 1976 at a charity benefit as a means to attract donors to that benefit. ==Trivia== In December 1982, British Midland Airways purchased a McDonnell Douglas DC-9 aircraft from KLM; two months later, the plane was in the United Kingdom with the name \\"The Nassak Diamond\\". == See also == * Koh-i- Noor * Darya-ye Noor == Notes  References == * ==External link== Category:Blue diamonds Category:Individual diamonds Category:Golconda diamonds ","title":"Nassak Diamond"},{"id":"20217201","text":"Katib al-Wilaya Mosque or Welayat Mosque () is a small historic mosque located along Omar Mukhtar Street in Gaza City in the Zaytun Quarter of the Old City.

Like the previous games in the series, Tropico 3 is a construction and management simulation as well as a political simulation game, with emphasis on city building. As a thematic sequel to Tropico (unlike the pirate-themed sequel, Tropico 2), the game attempts to return to the roots of the series, which puts the player into the shoes of \\"El Presidente\\" ‚Äì a ruler governing over an island banana republic. The OS X version of the game was released on January 26, 2012, by Feral Interactive. Feral Interactive released a redesigned version of Tropico 3 to iPad on December 18, 2018, under the name Tropico, with an iPhone version following on April 30th, 2019. An Android version of the game was released on September 5th, 2019. ==Gameplay== Tourist district including an airport, hotels, a zoo, and others Players begin having seized power of the Caribbean island country of Tropico, where they rule as \\"El Presidente\\". The game has a campaign with 15 different missions with varying objectives. As \\"El Presidente\\", the player's main duties include managing development on the island, by ordering construction of various resources, industry and service buildings, and determining how these buildings operate. The player can also issue several different \\"edicts\\" to influence the island, such as new laws, policies, and diplomatic actions. There are seven different political factions on the island (communists, capitalists, militarists, environmentalists, nationalists, religious faction and intellectuals) each with various demands, such as constructing a specific building and issuing a specific edict. Due to the game's Cold War setting, the player will have to manage relations with both the United States and the USSR, who will provide the player with yearly financial aid. Higher relations with a superpower will mean more aid and the possibility of an alliance, low relations will mean less aid and the danger of invasion by that superpower. Other features include a time line editor that allows you to create your own fictitious historical events or enter real ones, custom avatar, political speeches, wide range of editing and modification functions, mission generator for random map creation, variety of online-functions such as high scores or visiting islands belonging to other players and a Latin soundtrack. The game has a variety of humor elements including running satirical commentary by fictional radio station Tropico News Today, and subtle touches such as liaisons between priests and cabaret girls. The \\"loading\\" and \\"saving\\" screens have quotes from various leaders, politicians, and revolutionaries such as Che Guevara, Fidel Castro, Vladimir Lenin, Karl Marx, John F. Kennedy, Dwight Eisenhower, Augusto Pinochet, Nikita Khrushchev, Leon Trotsky, Mobutu Sese Seko, Todor Zhivkov, Vladimir Putin, Muammar Gaddafi, and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Additions to Tropico *Numerous random world events. *A transport system allowing citizens to travel by cars. *Avatar customization and control. *Election speeches. *Oil production is available as an industry for educated workers. *Same-sex marriages and nuclear testing are available as edicts, with different results and requirements. *New faction: Nationalists, who hate immigration and prefer a dominant Tropican workforce. *A \\"vintage mode\\" for non-rotational 3D visuals. *Gravel roads (roads with a low speed for countryside of the island) *Ability to construct a sculpture of El Presidente (the player's avatar) on the island. ==Development== Tropico 3 was developed by Haemimont Games for both Xbox 360 and PC. Features include a new 3D game engine and a customizable avatar which you can travel across the island, interacting with the environment and population and the use of cars, trucks and limos. Like the original Tropico, the developers preserved the tongue-in- cheek humor of the game, as well as the basic game-play. In Tropico 3, the issues and problems of the island are explained by Juanito the DJ in humorous ways. ==Expansions== In March 2010, the expansion pack Absolute Power was announced, slated for release in Europe in 2010. The expansion received an 8/10 on Game Zone, closing with \\"Absolute Power isn‚Äôt a revolution, instead taking the framework laid out by the original game and building on it with new features and a wacky new campaign. The core mechanics are still the same, and the new campaign might be a turn off to sim fans looking for something more grounded and traditional. However, if you were a fan of Tropico 3 and want another reason to step into the role of El Presidente once more, then this is your chance.\\" Absolute Power was released on PC as an expansion pack, and is included in the Macintosh version of the game. The expansion pack gives the player a wider selection of edicts such as 'Print money', 'Free housing', 'Delete a Faction' and 'Shoot Juanito' (which involves blowing up Juanito's TNT Radio). These new edicts are called 'Megalomania edicts'; for each edict that the player releases they can gain a varying amount of megalomania score that counts at the end of the game. Also there is a new range of buildings, including 'Golden Statue' (in the likeness of 'El Presidente'), 'Garbage dump' and 'Balloon rides'. The Loyalist faction is also introduced; it is composed of the player's most loyal supporters. There is also a second radio DJ named Betty Boom who is head of the resistance movement against El Presidente. ==Editions== Steam Special Edition The \\"Steam Special Edition\\" of Tropico 3 offers two additional maps for the sandbox mode and two additional costumes for the El Presidente avatar editor. The \\"Steam Special Edition\\" is only available through Steam. It was released on October 21, 2009, in North America but was originally listed to be released on the later date of October 25, 2009. The international release was on November 14, 2009. Collector Edition The Collector Edition, for which the content has never been revealed, was available to pre-order only on Amazon sites worldwide; however, on September 30, 2009, Amazon announced this collector edition had been canceled. On September 29, 2010, Kalypso released \\"Tropico 3: Gold Edition\\", which includes Tropico 3, the Absolute Power expansion, and an instruction book. ==Reception== Tropico 3 received generally favorable reviews at Metacritic, with an average of 79/100 on the PC, and 75/100 on the Xbox 360. GameSpot commented that \\"playing a banana republic dictator in Tropico 3 might not be easy, but it certainly is rewarding.\\" GameZone's Dakota Grabowski gave the game a 7 out of 10, stating, \\"Containing a 15-mission campaign, short tutorial, sandbox mode and special challenges, Tropico 3 has enough replay value to keep players at bay for more than a month. If that doesn‚Äôt satisfy the hunger, players are eligible to jump online and download user-created challenges to overcome.

As an inexpensive, compact, and lightweight telephoto, it complements the D40 and D60 entry level digital SLR cameras Nikon brings to market. Photozone noted the newer VR model has a better build quality than the earlier non-VR model. Some reviewers praised its value and optical performance, but criticized its handling, noting a stiff zoom ring, diminutive focus ring, and difficulty switching to manual focus.

She began her career in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century singing coloratura soprano roles. Early on in her career her voice darkened and dropped slightly causing her to focus more within the mezzo-soprano repertoire while still singing some soprano roles.Riemens, A concise biographical dictionary of singers She joined the Metropolitan Opera company in 1907 where she performed regularly in mostly supporting roles until her retirement in 1922. She is best remembered today for portraying the role of the Abbess in the world premiere of Puccini's Suor Angelica in 1918.Steane, Grove Music Online ==Career== Fornia was born in San Francisco, California as Regina Newman on 17 July 1878. Her parents were immigrants from Prussia and her father owned a successful business as a wholesale jeweller. At the age of 12, she attended Adelina Patti's 1890 concert in San Francisco which inspired her to become an opera singer. Her father eventually allowed her to move to New York City in 1898 to pursue her desire.Biography of Rita Fornia at marstonrecords.com While in New York, Fornia studied with Emil Fischer and Sofia Scalchi in New York City and then, under Fischer's advice, moved to Berlin in 1899 to study with Selma Nicklass-Kempner. Kempner, later the teacher of Frieda Hempel, trained her as a coloratura soprano. She made her professional d√©but with the Hamburg State Opera in 1901 as Eudoxie in Hal√©vy's La Juive. Over the next two years she sang mostly coloratura soprano roles in Germany and France, largely with the Hamburg State Opera who offered her a contract. Her other roles in Hamburg included Rosina in The Barber of Seville and the Queen of the Night in The Magic Flute. From the Fall of 1902 through the summer of 1903 she studied with Jean de Reszke in Paris. Reszke was convinced the Fornia was actually a mezzo-soprano and trained her voice accordingly. Under Reszke's recommendation to Henry Savage, Fornia returned to America in August 1903 to join the Savage English Grand Opera Company where she sang both mezzo-soprano and soprano roles until 1906. Her first performance with the company was as Si√©bel in Charles Gounod's Faust at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on 21 September 1903. Her other roles with Savage's company included Musetta in Giacomo Puccini's La boh√®me, Nedda in Pagliacci, Santuzza in Cavalleria rusticana, both Br√ºnnhilde and Sieglinde in The Valkyrie, both Elisabeth and Venus in Wagner's Tannh√§user, and both Leonora and Azucena in Verdi's Il trovatore. In 1907 Heinrich Conried hired Fornia to join the roster at the Metropolitan Opera for the 1907‚Äî1908 season. Her first performance with the company was as the Geisha in Mascagni's Iris on December 6, 1907 where her name was billed as Rita Fornia for the first time. She notably sang with Geraldine Farrar and Enrico Caruso in a performance of Faust for the opening of the new Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1908. Also of interest during this season was her last minute replacement of an ailing Emma Eames as Leonora in Il trovatore in March 1908 which caused a sensation among New York audiences. The New York American reported the following about her performance: > \\"To the amazement of those who had not heard the singer in important parts, > Mme. La Fornia made a pronounced and brilliant hit. Though she had had no > rehearsal, she sang admirably. In the dramatic passages she had power, and > suggested passion. In her florid music, she had taste, charm, and remarkable > facility. Her voice is fresh and of a delightful quality. She acts > intelligently. And she is handsome. Why has the Metropolitan management kept > a singer of Mme. La Fornia‚Äôs caliber in the background all these months?\\" On May 22, 1909 in Manhattan, New York City, Fornia married James P. Labey, a New York art dealer, with whom she enjoyed a happy marriage. The success of this first season led Conried to offer Fornia a lengthy contract and she continued to perform with the company through 1922. She sang in more than 400 performances with the Metropolitan Opera, where she occasionally performed leading roles but more frequently was heard in a wide range of smaller supporting parts. Musicologist and biographer Mary Watkins Cushing said the following about Fornia's career with the company: > \\"In the period of opera which included many of the greatest singers the > Metropolitan has ever known, Madame Fornia did not stand out, although she > was gifted with an excellent and useful voice, artistic stamina, and a > kindly and accommodating disposition. Were she a member of the company > today, she would doubtless be considered a top-flight singer. She was, > during her time, an invaluable asset; the sort of hard-working, uninspired, > but competent artist every company needs‚Ä¶‚Ä¶She was a pleasant, fairly placid > woman, of no great personal distinction either on or off the scene. She was, > in short, not the material of which the so-called stars of the musical world > are made, but she was beyond all doubt a first-rate example of what the > Europeans call a routini√®re.\\" Most notably, Fornia created the parts of Enya in the original 1912 production of Horatio Parker's Mona, Giulia in the original 1915 production of Umberto Giordano's Madame Sans-G√™ne and the Abbess in the original 1918 production of Puccini's Suor Angelica. Her other roles with the company included Amarante in La fille de Madame Angot, Barbarina in Le Nozze di Figaro, Donna Elvira in Don Giovanni, Eleanora in Le Donne Curiose, Eurydice in Monteverdi's Orfeo, Flowermaiden in Parsifal, Frasquita in Carmen, Geltrude in Il maestro di cappella, Gertrud in H√§nsel und Gretel, Giulietta in Les Contes d'Hoffmann, Gutrune in G√∂tterd√§mmerung, Helmwige in Die Walk√ºre, the Innkeeper's Daughter in K√∂nigskinder, Leonora in Il Trovatore, Marianne in Der Rosenkavalier, Marzelline in Fidelio, Nedda in Pagliacci, Pepa in Tiefland, Poussette in Manon, the Priestess in Aida, Rosina in Il Barbiere di Siviglia, Santuzza in Cavalleria Rusticana, the Second Lady in Die Zauberfl√∂te, the Shepherd in Tannh√§user, Siebel in Faust, St√©phano in Rom√©o et Juliette, and Wellgunde in Das Rheingold among others. Her last performance at the Met was in her most celebrated role, Suzuki in Madama Butterfly, on April 7, 1922. According to her friend and colleague, renowned singer Geraldine Farrar, Fornia began experiencing health problems in 1915. Her retirement in 1922 seems likely to have been related to her health as she underwent an operation in New York not too long after her last stage appearance. She died six months after her retirement, during a visit to her sister's home in Paris on October 27, 1922.Mourning card in private hands issued by her widower. The funeral service was held at the Anglican, or Episcopalian, Church of St George in la Rue Auguste-Vacquerie, Paris, on November 2. Her widower survived her by exactly 24 years before his death at the West Side Hospital, New York at the age of 74 on October 26, 1946.The New York Times, issue 27.Oct.1946 ==Recordings== Fornia was among the first generation of musicians to be recorded.

It was first described by Ferdinand Anton Franz Karsch in 1885, and is found in Tanzania and Kenya. ==Description== The king baboon spider is rusty brown to orange in color. They live in the shrublands and grasslands of east Africa, often using vegetation as a protective cover for their burrows. They are one of the few tarantulas that use stridulation as a major defense mechanism in addition to rearing up and striking. They produce the stridulation sound effect by rubbing the femurs of their first and second pairs of legs. They are a slow-growing species, but can reach a leg span of up to . They are burrowing spiders with thick back legs used for digging. They generally hunt beetles, cockroaches, and other spiders, and they will put silk near the entrance to its burrow to detect vibrations of passing prey. ==In captivity== They are popular among collectors, but they tend to be highly defensive, lacking urticating hairs, and are not suitable for beginners. They have very strong venom, though none are known to be deadly to humans. A bite from a smaller spider will cause sharp pain and localized itchiness for five days. Adults can be kept in a converted aquarium if given plenty of ventilation and a substrate at least deep. Younger spiders can be kept in small containers, such as pill tubs and waxworm tubs, but will need deeper containers as they grow. ==See also== * List of Theraphosidae species ==References Category:Fauna of East Africa Category:Monotypic Mygalomorphae genera Category:Spiders of Africa Category:Theraphosidae ","title":"King baboon spider"},{"id":"20217353","text":"Jagdal may refer to: * Jagdal Union, in Bangladesh * Jagdal, variant form of Jadgal ","title":"Jagdal"},{"id":"20217367","text":" The third USS Warren was a sloop-of-war that served in the United States Navy from 1799 to 1801. ==Construction and commissioning== Warren was a copper-sheathed sloop-of-war contracted for at Newburyport, Massachusetts, but actually built by an association of shipbuilders at Salisbury, Massachusetts.Chapelle, p. 145 On 6 July 1799, while she was still under construction, Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Stoddert ordered Master Commandant Timothy Newman to take command of Warren. The ship was fitted out there, into the winter of 1799, and probably was commissioned in either November or December of 1799. ==Voyage to the Caribbean== Assigned the duty of protecting American commerce in Cuban waters against the possible incursions of French warships or privateers during the \\"Quasi War\\" with France, Warren set sail for Havana, Cuba, on 31 December 1799, escorting the schooner Trio. Trio was laden with stores for the American men-of-war on the Havana station. As the ships stood out of Nantasket Roads, near Boston, Massachusetts, Sailing Master Joseph Whitmore, in Warren, penned fervently in his journal, \\"God send us safe to our orders End in our Lawfull (sic) Ways in supporting our Independence.\\" Trio was separated from Warren about 4 January 1800 or 5 January 1800, and Warren proceeded on independently. The passage proved uneventful until the 17 January 1800, when six men came to Master Commandant Newman's cabin door at 18:30 hours, swearing that \\"they would not do Duty and . . . would go aboard the first British Man-of-War they could see.\\" According to Whitmore's journal, one of the men wielded the cook's hatchet and all apparently \\"used other Mutenous (sic) language.\\" As a reward for their behavior, the six were promptly clapped in irons, to stand trial later. At 13:00 hours on 19 January 1800, Warren spoke with the sloop Mary, 18 days out of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and bound for Cuba. Mary needed assistance, and Warren provided her with rigging and the ship's foretopmast stay sail. Three hours later, Warren met the schooner Lucy, 25 days out of Providence, Rhode Island, and took her into the convoy. Warren later passed a hawser to Mary and took her in tow. The three ships remained in company for five days before Warren lost sight of the two merchantmen. ==Caribbean operations== Warren reached Havana early in the afternoon of 29 January 1800. Over ensuing days, she supplied the brig USS Norfolk and assisted the brig Fanny, of Salem, Massachusetts, on 11 February 1800. On the morning of 16 February 1800, Warren got underway in company with Norfolk to escort a convoy of 19 merchantmen out of the coastal waters off Havana. Warren remained at sea until 8 March 1800, when she dropped anchor at Matanzas, Cuba, for upkeep and to take on fresh water. She returned to patrol duties off the coast of Cuba at sunrise on 13 March 1800. After a week at sea, Warren returned to Havana on 20 February 1800 and waited for a fleet of merchantmen to emerge from the harbor and form a convoy. That evening, a dozen ships sailed, and Warren joined them as they emerged from the harbor and gave them routing instructions as they headed for the United States. Warren remained at sea, on patrol, for another week thereafter, and returned to Havana on 28 February 1800. She stood out to sea again on the morning of 2 April 1800 and proceeded to Matanza where she arrived on 5 April 1800. Warren joined man-of-war USS Ganges and a convoy of 22 merchantmen on 21 April 1800 and sailed with them for a time before returning to Havana early in May 1800. Sailing again on 5 May 1800, Warren patrolled off the Cuban coast until she arrived at Havana on 23 May 1800. ==Epidemic== Warren operated locally between Havana and Matanzas until mid- June 1800 and anchored in Havana harbor on the 15 June 1800. On 24 June 1800, the ship's doctor sent Quarter Gunner William Dogget ashore to the hospital at Havana, the man suffering from a fever‚Äîlater determined to be yellow fever. Ominously, Dogget's case signified only the beginning of what would become a terrible ordeal for the sloop-of-war Warren. During Warrens stay at Havana, her crew ‚Äî hitherto \\"in general, healthy, and robust\\" ‚Äî began to have \\"evident symptoms of an increasing universal debility.\\" Warren, departing Havana in company with the frigate USS General Greene and 12 merchantmen, sailed for Veracruz, Mexico, on 26 June 1800. Gunner Dogget, convalescent in the hospital at Havana, was spared seeing the agony of many of his shipmates. For the remainder of June 1800, an average of 15 men per day were incapacitated for performing ship's work. The first fatality occurred shortly before dawn on 30 June 1800, when young Midshipman Jonathan Greenleaf died. Nineteen men, recorded Whitmore, who survived the yellow fever epidemic, were then down with \\"the fever.\\" Thirteen more, including the doctor's mate, died before Warren reached Veracruz on 13 July 1800. Warren sent 20 men ashore there, but four died in the ensuing days. Warren ultimately departed Veracruz on 23 July 1800, having had an average of 20 to 24 sick men ashore in the hospital and 25 on board unfit for duty. Whitmore noted on 25 July 1800 that two dozen men were sick but noted optimistically that there were \\"many mending.\\" Warren headed back to Havana. Two men died on 27 July 1800, three on the 28 July 1800, and one on 1 August 1800. On 2 August 1800 at 10:00 hours, the captain's only son, John Newman, along on the voyage as a midshipman, died. Warren subsequently anchored at Havana on 15 August 1800, dropping her hook at 11:00 hours. Four hours later, Master Commandant Newman succumbed to the illness that had decimated his crew and killed his only son, when he, too, died. His remains were accordingly sent ashore and interred at Havana. Lieutenant Joseph Strout then took command and, soon thereafter, took the ship northward, bound for the United States. Meanwhile, as Warren sailed homeward, Secretary of the Navy Stoddert ordered Captain James Barron to take command of the ship as soon as possible after she arrived, with expressed instructions to \\"relieve the sick; recruit men to fill the deficiency; cleanse, reprovision, rewater, and prepare her for another cruise with the most dispatch.\\" Stoddert later instructed Barron to provide \\"all the protection in your power to the vessels which sail under your convoy, and see that as many as may be practicable to their destined ports.\\" ==Later operations== Warren apparently arrived at Boston in the autumn of 1800. She subsequently fitted out for another cruise and sailed for the West Indies, where she operated, on patrol and escort duties primarily off Saint Martin and Saint Barth√©lemy, near Guadeloupe and Haiti, until the \\"Quasi-War\\" with France ended early in 1801. ==Decommissioning and disposal== Warren returned to the United States to Boston in the spring of 1801 at Boston. Sold in Boston, June 1801 for $19,747 dollars. ==See also== *Glossary of nautical terms *List of sailing frigates of the United States Navy *Naval tactics in the Age of Sail ==NotesReferences== * * Chapelle, Howard I.

The headgate structure diverted water from the Bighorn River to their lands. It was designed by William F. Graves, and construction was carried out by Crow workers. The project was completed in 1904. Today the site is included in Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area. The structure includes a diversion dam extending at an angle into the river to divert water through the headgate into a canal flowing parallel to the river. The headgate structure was built of dressed local limestone, and is wide, allowing a designed flow of of water per second. Five iron gates controlled the flow. The headgate structure is intermittently inundated by water held in the Yellowtail Dam Afterbay reservoir. The Bighorn Ditch was instrumental to the Crow changing from their nomadic lifestyle to a settled, agrarian society. Their initial attempts at farming in the arid climate, beginning in 1885, resulted in failure. The government at last recognized that irrigation of the lands would be required for the people to gain consistent yields from their crops. The 1891 Reno Ditch provided water to 4500 (later 12,500) Crow acres. The Bighorn Ditch allowed the expansion of agriculture and cattle ranching to .

Bundesligas to the Bundesliga. Originally, it was necessary because there were more second division champions than promotion spots available. From 1974 onwards, it involved only two clubs who determined the third possible promotion spot to the Bundesliga. ==Leagues== 1963‚Äì74 When the Bundesliga was formed in 1963, the German Football Association established five regional second divisions below it, the Regionalligas, these being: * Regionalliga S√ºd * Regionalliga S√ºdwest * Regionalliga West * Regionalliga Berlin * Regionalliga Nord Because the boundaries of these five leagues went along historical lines, determined by the boundaries of the five German sub-federations, the playing strength of the leagues was not equal. To determine the two teams to be promoted to the Bundesliga each season, a promotion round was held. The number of teams from each Regionalliga qualified for this event was not equal, for the above-mentioned reason. From 1963, the first two teams in each Regionalliga was qualified for the promotion round, except from Berlin, who would only send the champions. To reduce the number of clubs from nine to eight, a home-and-away decider was played between two of the runners-ups. The origin of the two teams in this altered annually. The eight teams would then play a home-and-away round in two groups of four with the winners qualified for the Bundesliga. Teams from the same Regionalliga would not play in the same group. This system was in place till 1966. From 1967, the groups were expanded to five clubs and all five Regionalligas send their runners-up to the competition. Otherwise, the modus remained unchanged. This system remained in place until 1974, when the Regionalligas were disbanded. 1974‚Äì81 In 1974, the five Regionalligas were replaced by two 2. Bundesligas, those being: * 2. Bundesliga S√ºd * 2. Bundesliga Nord The two league champions would now be directly promoted to the Bundesliga while the two runners-up played a home-and-away round to determine the third promoted team. This system remained in place until the single 2. Bundesliga replaced the two leagues. 1981‚Äì91 With the introduction of the single-division 2. Bundesliga in 1981, a promotion round would have become unnecessary as the top-three teams could have been directly promoted. Instead, only the top two teams achieved direct promotion. The third-placed club had to play the 16th placed club from the Bundesliga in a home-and-away round for the last spot in the first division. This series was played until 1991. With the German reunion in 1991 and the influx of clubs from the former DDR-Oberliga, the promotion round between the two clubs was stopped. In the 1990‚Äì91 season, five clubs were promoted to the Bundesliga, three from the west and two from the east. 1991‚Äì92 As a transition season due to the integration of the East German clubs, only two clubs were promoted from the second to the first division. Also, the 2. Bundesliga was split into two regional groups for this season. 1992‚Äì2008 In this era, the top three teams of the 2. Bundesliga were directly promoted to the Bundesliga. 2008‚Äìpresent From 2009, the promotion series between the 16th-placed Bundesliga club and the third-placed 2. Bundesliga team was reestablished. The Bundesliga follows its own past example and the one set by the English Premier League and the Italian Serie A, where these games are in place too and quite popular. ==Promoted teams== 1963‚Äì74 {  - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#dfdfdf\\" Season First Second Third - align=\\"center\\" 1963‚Äì64Hannover 96Borussia Neunkirchen‚Äî - align=\\"center\\" 1964‚Äì65Bayern MunichBorussia M√∂nchengladbachTasmania Berlin - align=\\"center\\" 1965‚Äì66Fortuna D√ºsseldorfRot-Weiss Essen‚Äî - align=\\"center\\" 1966‚Äì67Alemannia AachenBorussia Neunkirchen (2)‚Äî - align=\\"center\\" 1967‚Äì68Kickers OffenbachHertha BSC‚Äî - align=\\"center\\" 1968‚Äì69Rot-Weiss Essen (2)Rot- Wei√ü Oberhausen‚Äî - align=\\"center\\" 1969‚Äì70Arminia BielefeldKickers Offenbach (2)‚Äî - align=\\"center\\" 1970‚Äì71VfL BochumFortuna D√ºsseldorf (2)‚Äî - align=\\"center\\" 1971‚Äì72Wuppertaler SVKickers Offenbach (3)‚Äî - align=\\"center\\" 1972‚Äì73Rot-Weiss Essen (3)Fortuna K√∂ln‚Äî - align=\\"center\\" 1973‚Äì74Eintracht BraunschweigTennis Borussia Berlin‚Äî } * In 1965, Tasmania Berlin was promoted to replace Hertha BSC in the league, without having qualified for it. 1974‚Äì81 {  - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#dfdfdf\\"  Season  South  North  Third - align=\\"center\\"  1974‚Äì75  Karlsruher SC  Hannover 96 (2)  Bayer Uerdingen - align=\\"center\\"  1975‚Äì76  1.

However, rules governing radio stations are less restrictive than those for television, allowing as many as eight radio stations under common ownership in the largest U.S. media markets. Ownership of television stations with overlapping coverage areas was normally not allowed in the United States prior to 2002, even those that were not duopolies under the present legal definition, by way of being located in separate albeit adjacent markets; this required broadcasters to apply for cross-ownership waivers in some cases to retain full-power stations based in adjacent markets. Non-commercial educational broadcasters, mainly those that were members of the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), were the only licensees allowed to sign-on or acquire a second television station that did not repeat the parent station's signal in the same market where they already owned a station (some of these acquired stations were originally licensed as commercial outlets). On August 5, 1999, the Federal Communications Commission voted 4-1 to allow common ownership of two television stations within a single market by one company, so long as eight unique station owners remain in the market once the duopoly is formed, and the four highest-rated stations (based on local monthly viewership reports for the market) remain under separate ownership. The FCC only requires the severance of an existing duopoly in which a once lower-rated station falls within the ratings criteria that prohibits such ownership over time if an ownership transaction is under review (such as a piecemeal or group sale of stations, or necessary license transfers during an ownership transaction involving the stations' existing owner); a company is required to sell one of the stations in the duopoly to another licensee if it is no longer compliant with one or both provisions. Currently, an entity is permitted to own up to two television stations in the same media market if either the service areas of the stations do not overlap, or at least one of the stations is not rated among the top four rated stations in the media market. There is no limit on the number of Television stations a single entity may own as long as the stations group collectively reaches no more than 39% of U.S. households. Once a duopoly is formed, the acquiring company takes over the operations of its new property. The operations of the two stations are usually consolidated into one facility, depending on the size and age of the facility chosen to house their operations. Since the stations involved in the duopoly are not restricted by FCC law from consolidating their operations, duplicative jobs at one of the stations are often terminated as the consolidation takes effect. News departments are also often consolidated into a singular operation, with anchoring and reporting staffs from the respective stations often being folded into one unit, subject to hiring determinations made by management; anchors and reporters are usually shared between the two stations, though in some cases, certain anchors may be employed to appear only on each station's own newscasts. In some cases (like with WHDH and WLVI in Boston, Massachusetts, when the former's owner Sunbeam Television formed a duopoly with WLVI after purchasing the station from Tribune Broadcasting in 2006), the junior partner's news department is shut down completely, with the senior partner subsequently taking over production of its news content using only their existing staff. In many cases, news programming on a junior partner is structured to avoid direct competition with a senior partner affiliate of either ABC, NBC or CBS (one notable exception involves WTTV and WXIN in Indianapolis, which carry competing morning and evening newscasts as Tribune Broadcasting opted to launch a separate slate of newscasts for WTTV when it became a CBS affiliate in January 2015, rather than shift those seen on sister Fox affiliate WXIN to the station; WXIN and WTTV largely maintain their own anchors, but share a news department and most reporting staff). This situation is uncommon in duopolies involving only Big Three affiliates, as stations affiliated with those networks are more inclined to carry newscasts in overlapping time periods in order to fulfill local programming requirements included in affiliation agreements. Certain syndicated programs are also shared between the stations, in the form of either same-day repeat airings of programs seen on the one which holds primary rights or separated runs of programs that air on each station, although each station maintains separate syndication inventories as well. The junior partner, unless it is affiliated with a major network, may also be used to carry network (and occasionally, first-run syndicated) programs that the senior partner is unable to broadcast because of long-form breaking news or severe weather coverage or a locally produced special airing in a scheduled program's normal timeslot, or in the case of certain non-prime time network programs, because the senior partner chooses not to carry it on its regular schedule to carry other scheduled programming. Although the FCC bars common ownership of any of the four major broadcast networks (ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox), it does not prohibit duopolies involving stations affiliated individually with any two of them, unless both are among the four highest-rated in the market at the time of a sale. As such, several Big Four duopolies exist based on certain market conditions that originally allowed them to be formed under the criteria (such as a company having acquired one of the major network stations as a low-rated affiliate of a smaller network prior to an affiliation switch or the ratings of a non- English station placing among the top four over a Big Four network affiliate). While most duopolies are made up of a senior partner that is affiliated with one of the four major networks and an affiliate of a minor network (such as The CW and MyNetworkTV) or an independent station as the junior partner, those in which both stations are major network affiliates typically involve a Fox station (which serves as the junior partner in all but a few instances) and an ABC, CBS or NBC affiliate, with some limited arrangements where two Big Three affiliates are jointly owned or managed. One of the few markets where two major network duopolies exist in some form is Jacksonville, Florida, where two companies once owned the licenses of the Big Four stations they respectively controlled. In 2000, the Gannett Company, owner of NBC affiliate WTLV, purchased ABC affiliate WJXX, which had struggled in the local ratings since its sign-on in February 1997 (when it took the ABC affiliation from WJKS through a group affiliation deal with the Allbritton Communications Company) due to its status as a relatively new station and issues with signal interference from PBS station WJCT on its Mediacom cable channel slot. The following year, Clear Channel Communications created a legal duopoly involving its existing Fox affiliate WAWS (now WFOX-TV) and WTEV-TV (now WJAX-TV), a UPN affiliate that it had been managing under a local marketing agreement since 1994; WTEV's viewership gradually rose after it became a CBS affiliate in July 2002, putting it in the top four threshold with WAWS, resulting in Newport Television ‚Äì upon purchasing the Clear Channel television group in 2007 ‚Äì restructuring the operation as a virtual duopoly by selling WTEV to shell licensee High Plains Broadcasting (WFOX and WJAX are now respectively owned by the Cox Media Group and Bayshore Television, LLC, but remain under common management though an LMA in which WJAX is the junior partner). The use of digital subchannels has been termed an \\"instant duopoly,\\" because of the ease by which a single digital station can deliver multiple channels of programming from different networks at the same time. One station can carry four or more standard definition digital channels; multiple high definition feeds typically require too large a bitrate size to be carried on different subchannels of the same station simultaneously without loss of image quality. Virtual duopolies Some broadcasting companies have used loopholes to establish duopolies in smaller markets by way of a local marketing agreement, shared services agreement or joint sales agreement; where a station effectively brokers its entire airtime to the owner of another station in the market, which becomes responsible for handling its programming and advertising sales ‚Äì and in effect, operations. These are termed as \\"virtual duopolies\\" as the station's license is held by one company, while its operations are handled by another. Through a 2014 FCC ruling, joint sales agreements in which the senior partner sells a minimum of 15% of the advertising time for its junior partner are counted toward ownership caps. Some larger broadcasting companies have controversially built business models around the practice, by funding the acquisition of stations by what are effectively shill companies or shell corporations; for example, Sinclair Broadcast Group operates the stations of Cunningham Broadcasting and Deerfield Media under LMAs or SSAs. Nearly all of Cunningham's stock is held by trusts in the name of Sinclair's founders and owners, the Smith family. Similarly, Nexstar Media Group funds the purchase of stations by Mission Broadcasting, which forms duopolies with their stations through shared services agreements with a Nexstar station. In some cases, the senior partner may acquire a station's physical assets and intellectual property (such as the station's facilities and programming rights), but spin off the license itself to a shell corporation and enter into an agreement to operate the station, making it the de facto owner, but not the legal owner. Following the purchase, the station's operations and programming are often merged into that of its new parent station. Similarly, a company that acquires an existing legal duopoly that is no longer complies with FCC rules on duopoly ownership may spin off the junior partner station's license to a shell, rather than sell one of the stations to a licensee that would also assume operational responsibilities, allowing the restructured duopoly to remain under common operation through a resulting management agreement. In some cases, the use of an adjacent-market city of license has been used on a secondary station to avoid a limit on the number of stations controlled by the same broadcaster in the same market. Occasionally, those arrangements cross international borders. For instance, radio station WLYK in Cape Vincent, New York in the United States is operated from the Canadian studios of Kingston, Ontario's CIKR-FM, a broadcaster already at the two-station limit in its own market, under an LMA. Broadcasters such as Entravision have often entered into local marketing agreements with Mexican border stations (such as Tecate's XHDTV-TDT for content directed at San Diego). Failing station waivers It is also possible to obtain a \\"failing station waiver,\\" which can exempt a broadcaster from some portion of the existing restrictions on common ownership in order to acquire and operate a station which otherwise would be economically non-viable or would be forced to cease operations. Requests for failing station waivers have historically met with variable reception; in general, a prospective buyer is on the same wavelength with the FCC on failing-station policies if it can demonstrate to the Commission that: * The failing station consistently received less than 4% of all local all-day audience share; * the station is in poor financial condition, normally operating at a loss for at least the previous three years; * the merger will produce public interest benefits, and; * the in-market buyer is the only suitable candidate as a sale to an out-of- market buyer would result in an artificially depressed price. Waivers under these criteria were granted to sell WASV-TV in Asheville to Media General, owner of CBS affiliate WSPA-TV in that market, and KWBA in Tucson to the Journal Broadcast Group, owner of that market's ABC affiliate KGUN-TV. A similar waiver was refused to KNIN-TV in Boise as the station, a CW affiliate at the time the waiver application was filed, appeared to have reasonable prospects of financial break-even without a takeover by Journal-owned ABC affiliate KIVI-TV; that decision was subsequently appealed, with the waiver being granted upon further review (Journal Broadcast Group would eventually be required to sell KNIN in 2014, as the station's financial condition improved enough in its post-2011 existence as a Fox affiliate to make it unsuitable for the E. W. Scripps Company ‚Äì which was in the process of purchasing Journal's broadcasting unit in a deal in which Journal simultaneously merged with Scripps' publishing unit ‚Äì to acquire it under a renewed waiver, in addition to the fact that it could not acquire it legally as the market had fewer than eight unique owners). Low-power TV stations Low-power and Class A television stations are not subject to ownership caps in the United States, as their broadcast signals do not reach as many homes as full-power stations. In areas with high cable television penetration, this distinction is essentially meaningless. LPTV stations were also exempt from digital television transition requirements imposed on full-service broadcasters upon the June 2009 digital conversion. As such, low-power stations can also be formed to create duopolies; for instance, Weigel Broadcasting maintains triopolies in three markets surrounding the southern part of Lake Michigan (Chicago, Illinois; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and South Bend, Indiana) using a combination of full- power and low-power television stations. In Chicago, it maintains one full- power signal (independent station WCIU-TV) and two low-power stations (WWME-CD and WMEU-CA, the flagship stations of the Me-TV digital subchannel network). In Milwaukee, Weigel has two full-power stations (CBS affiliate WDJT-TV and full-power independent station WMLW-TV) and two low-power stations (Me-TV station WBME-CD and Telemundo affiliate WYTU-LD, though the latter station uses a subchannel of WMLW as its main conduit for cable carriage). Weigel also takes advantage of digital subchannel broadcasting heavily and airs This TV in Milwaukee and South Bend, and Bounce TV in Chicago and Milwaukee; the company had also previously executed time share agreements on other subchannels with ethnic broadcasters, and in Milwaukee, a local real estate agency to air programming. A similar situation exists in Lima, Ohio, where Block Communications controls a quadropoly of stations owned by itself (WLIO, a full-powered NBC affiliate which also carries Fox and MyNetworkTV on a digital subchannel) and low-power stations owned by West Central Ohio Broadcasting, Inc. (which owns ABC affiliate WPNM-LP/WOHL-CD, and CBS affiliate WAMS-LP) under an LMA. One of the latter company's heads, Allan J. Block, is the chairman of Block Communications. The group is the sole over-air provider of secular network television programming in the Lima market, though area cable systems also carry out-of-market affiliates from Toledo, Columbus and Dayton. Radio stations As mentioned above, current FCC rules limit the number of radio stations a single entity may own in a certain market. As of May 2020, these are the limitations on radio ownership in a certain market, according to the FCC website: * In a radio market with 45 or more stations, an entity may own up to eight radio stations, no more than five of which may be on the same band (AM or FM). * In a radio market with between 30 and 44 stations, up to seven stations are allowed under common ownership, no more than four of which could be on AM or FM. * In a radio market with between 15 and 29 stations, an entity may own up to six stations, no more than four of which may be on the same band. * In a radio market with 14 or fewer radio stations, an entity may own up to five radio stations, of which no more than three of which may be on the same band, as long as the entity does not own more than half of the stations in that market. Unlike television, there is no limit on the percentage of the population to that an entity may reach. ==Canada== Radio In radio, Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) policy generally allows broadcasters to operate no more than three radio stations in any given market, of which no more than two may be on the same radio band ‚Äî that is, a company may own two AM stations and an FM station, or two FM stations and an AM station, but may not own three AMs or three FMs. However, in major metropolitan markets where a large number of radio stations are already broadcasting, the limit is increased to four stations with a maximum of two on each band. A company may also exceed these limits if it owns stations broadcasting in both English and French; for instance, in the Montreal media market, Bell Media Radio owns six radio stations, of which two operate in French and four in English. Television Officially, CRTC policy mandates that a broadcaster may only own one television station in a particular language in any given market. However, there are two types of exemptions which may be granted: # small markets, in which one or more stations may be in financial jeopardy due to limited advertising revenue; # large markets, in which one or more stations may be in financial jeopardy due to audience fragmentation or the cost of programming rights. The policy does not prevent companies from owning multiple stations in a market provided that the stations broadcast in different languages. In recent years, this has been interpreted as meaning that a single company may own both an English-language station and one or more multicultural stations with some English-language content, which in itself may be considered a form of \\"exemption\\". CBC/Radio-Canada owned-and-operated stations (O&Os;) are also often deployed in pairs in major cities on both television and radio, separated only by language. In addition, the policy is not interpreted as preventing a single company from owning both a \\"commercial\\" general-interest station and an educational station in the same market, even if the latter airs advertising, as with Access in Alberta. Although the small and large market exemptions have a financial criterion in common, there are notable differences between the two. A small market twinstick may involve major network affiliates licensed to the same community, and is not obligated to provide distinct local news programming on the two stations, while in a large market the stations must be licensed to serve different communities or different programming niches, and cannot merge their news programming into a single operation. Small market twinsticks commonly share their branding across both stations, while twinsticks in large markets generally do not. As well, while small market twinsticks generally involve private affiliates, major market twinsticks are virtually always owned-and-operated stations of their associated networks or systems. In a few isolated cases, the CRTC has permitted \\"triple-sticks\\", or triopolies, where a single broadcaster operates three stations in a market. These are only possible under unusual circumstances which are discussed as they arise below. History Twinsticks were first allowed in 1967, as a way to help expand CTV service to smaller markets. In the original twinstick model, the second station was a rebroadcaster of a CTV station in a larger market, to which the small market's existing CBC affiliate would be granted the advertising sales rights. As the company's advertising revenue grew, the CTV transmitter would eventually become an originating station in its own right, and in theory would eventually be sold to another broadcaster. However, in many cases the subsequent sale never happened, as the community's economic growth failed to lend itself to competition between multiple television broadcasters. In other markets where the CRTC had licensed competing broadcasters, such as Northern Ontario, twinstick mergers were subsequently allowed to permit the survival of both television stations after similar economic difficulties were encountered. With the cross-national consolidation of media ownership, nearly all of the original twinstick stations no longer share ownership with their former twin stations. However, the second type of twinstick, involving media consolidation in larger markets, began to arise in the 1990s. Small markets Up until February 2010, twinsticks of this type outside of Quebec involved CTV and CBC Television affiliates. Currently both small-market twinsticks in English Canada consist of Global and CTV affiliates. * Lloydminster ‚Äì CITL and CKSA (Newcap Broadcasting) * Thunder Bay ‚Äì CHFD and CKPR (Dougall Media) Within Quebec, twinsticks consist of TVA and V affiliates: * Gatineau ‚Äì CHOT and CFGS (RNC Media) From 1997 to 2002, CTV directly owned several CBC twinstick stations that it had inherited from Baton Broadcasting (CKNC, CHNB, CJIC and CFCL in Northern Ontario, which were part of the MCTV system, and CKBI and CKOS in Saskatchewan); these were sold to the CBC in 2002. Similarly, until August 2008, Cogeco owned three twinsticks in Quebec: CKTV and CFRS in Saguenay, CKSH and CFKS in Sherbrooke and CKTM and CFKM in Trois-Rivi√®res. These twinsticks were dissolved when Radio-Canada decided to acquire its former affiliates (CKTV, CKSH and CKTM), while the V affiliates (CFRS, CFKS and CFKM) were acquired by Remstar Corporation, the new owner of V (then known as TQS). One \\"triple-stick\\" also exists, in which a single company, T√©l√© Inter-Rives, operates all three licensed stations in Rivi√®re-du-Loup: CKRT, CIMT and CFTF. RNC Media also formerly had an effective \\"triple-stick\\" in the Abitibi-T√©miscamingue region of Quebec, with ownership of CFEM-DT (TVA) and CKRN-DT (Radio-Canada) in the city of Rouyn-Noranda and CFEM-DT (V) in Val-d'Or ‚Äî although technically licensed to separate cities, in actual practice all three stations served both cities through rebroadcast transmitters. As of 2018, however, CKRN is no longer in operation. These unusual situations arise because of the unique circumstances of francophone television stations in Quebec: with virtually no sources for syndicated programming, the stations are effectively constrained to network programming at virtually all times, meaning that despite being owned by a single company, the stations are still able to meet the guiding principles behind the CRTC's policies on media ownership. As noted above, historically, twinstick operations were locally owned. With the cross-national consolidation of media ownership in Canada, however, most twinstick operations are now owned by major media conglomerates. The Thunder Bay Television stations (CHFD/CKPR) are the sole remaining locally owned twinstick anywhere in English Canada. The aforementioned T√©l√© Inter-Rives is similarly unique in Quebec, although Quebecor holds a minority stake in the company. Major markets In the mid-1990s, the CRTC also began to allow private companies operating in large markets to acquire smaller stations. In all such cases, the twinsticks are permitted because a diversity of broadcast voices already exists in the market, and the stations are normally licensed to serve different communities in the metropolitan market or different programming niches. The stations must also be operated independently of each other, although they are permitted to cross-promote each other's programming. They may also air a very limited amount of common programming, although in practice this privilege is rarely used. Currently, Bell Media operates twinsticks in three major markets, using the CTV and CTV Two brands: * Ottawa ‚Äì CJOH and CHRO * Toronto-Barrie ‚Äì CFTO and CKVR * Vancouver-Victoria ‚Äì CIVT and CIVI In addition to these \\"true\\" twinsticks, in some areas, Bell Media has taken a twinstick-type approach with two stations deemed to be in adjacent media markets, but which in practice serve both markets. For example, Bell operates both CTV station CKCO-DT in Kitchener, Ontario and CTV Two station CFPL-DT in London, about away. Both have been carried on the VHF band of basic cable throughout much of southwestern Ontario for several decades. Hence, presumably as a result of this duplicated coverage, their current owner has elected to continue airing distinct programming on both stations (on the other hand, Kitchener is also about 100 km from Toronto; nevertheless both CKCO and Toronto's CFTO operate as CTV stations). Finally, in some markets, Bell Media operates both a local over-the-air CTV station, and a provincial or regional cable channel that broadcasts CTV Two programming. In Alberta, CTV stations CFCN in Calgary and CFRN in Edmonton co-exist with CTV Two Alberta, which is officially licensed as the provincial educational broadcaster and is therefore technically exempt from the CRTC's common ownership policy (prior to September 2011, CTV Two Alberta also operated over-the-air transmitters in Calgary and Edmonton). In the Maritime Provinces, Bell Media operates both the over-the-air CTV Atlantic group of stations and the cable-only CTV Two Atlantic, which have been jointly owned (under various parent companies) since the latter's launch in 1983. Previous examples Canwest operated the CIII/CHCH twinstick in Toronto- Hamilton and the CHAN/CHEK twinstick in Vancouver-Victoria until 2009, under the Global and E! brands. These two sets of twinsticks were separated as a result of E!'s demise in August 2009, with Canwest retaining the Global O&Os; (CIII and CHAN) and selling off the E! stations (CHCH and CHEK). Additionally, Canwest previously owned the now-defunct CHCA in Red Deer, which was available on cable and via rebroadcast transmitters in both Calgary and Edmonton, where Canwest respectively already owned CICT and CITV. This was not considered a true twinstick as CHCA was not based in the larger markets, and did not have permission to solicit local advertising in those markets. It did, however, have simultaneous substitution rights. CHUM Television operated the CITY/CKVR twinstick in Toronto-Barrie and the CKVU/CIVI twinstick in Vancouver-Victoria under the Citytv and A-Channel brands prior to its acquisition by CTVglobemedia in 2006. Following this acquisition, Rogers Media briefly held twinsticks in Vancouver (CKVU and CHNU) and Winnipeg (CHMI and CIIT), formed from its newly acquired Citytv stations and its Omni-branded religious stations; these two sets of twinsticks were dissolved in 2008 following the sales of CHNU and CIIT to S-VOX. Unlike the situation in smaller markets, this type of \\"consolidation\\" twinstick had been increasingly common up to the late 2000s, concurrently with the rise of secondary television systems (such as CH/E! and A-Channel) launched by their parent companies to complement their primary networks or systems (such as Global and Citytv). This trend was partially reversed in 2009 with the demise of E! and the subsequent dissolution of the Global/E! twinsticks. Multiple languages In many major markets, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation operates both CBC Television (English) and Ici Radio-Canada T√©l√© (French) stations, as listed below. Prior to the CBC decommissioning all of its television rebroadcasters in 2012, both networks were available over-the-air in numerous other markets not listed below, but one or both of the transmitters was a rebroadcaster of a station originating in a different city; these were not usually considered true twinsticks. Nevertheless, both networks continue to be available as part of the basic programming tier on all cable and satellite providers nationwide. * Edmonton ‚Äì CBXT and CBXFT * Montreal ‚Äì CBMT and CBFT * Ottawa ‚Äì CBOT and CBOFT * Regina ‚Äì CBKT and CBKFT * Toronto ‚Äì CBLT and CBLFT * Vancouver ‚Äì CBUT and CBUFT * Windsor ‚Äì CBET and CBEFT * Winnipeg ‚Äì CBWT and CBWFT In Toronto, Edmonton and Calgary, Rogers Media's acquisition of the Citytv system put those stations in twinsticks with the multilingual Omni Television stations. In Toronto, Omni Television has its own twinstick, giving the company a nominal \\"triple-stick\\" in that market. The two Omni stations in Toronto each serve different segments of the market's multicultural audience, and thus are also permitted under the language exemption. * Calgary ‚Äì CKAL and CJCO * Edmonton ‚Äì CKEM and CJEO * Toronto ‚Äì CFMT, CJMT and CITY * Vancouver ‚Äì CKVU and CHNM In Montreal, Canwest owned both Global station CKMI and multicultural station CJNT until August 2009, when the latter was sold to Channel Zero. CTV was formerly a part-owner of the francophone V network (formerly TQS) in Quebec, meaning that V's owned-and-operated CFJP in Montreal was a partial twinstick with CTV's CFCF for most of the 2000s. CFCF was, in fact, the original owner of TQS, meaning that the stations were once a true twinstick under the language exemption, although the two stations went through very different sequences of ownership changes after 1995. Bell Media, the owner of CTV, reacquired V in 2020, reuniting CFJP to co-ownership with CFCF. ==Triopolies and quadropolies== NBCUniversal formerly owned three full-power stations in Los Angeles, NBC owned-and-operated station KNBC, Telemundo O&O; KVEA and Spanish language independent station KWHY-TV, before selling KWHY to the Meruelo Group in January 2011. The FCC allows common ownership of three full-power television stations if there are 18 stations that are licensed within the market; as such, Los Angeles and San Francisco are the only two U.S. markets which can legally have a true full-power triopoly, though Sinclair owns a legal triopoly in Salt Lake City with CBS affiliate KUTV, independent station KJZZ-TV, and MyNetworkTV station KMYU. The Federal Communications Commission otherwise only permits common ownership of three full-power television stations within one market if the tertiary station is licensed under a satellite station waiver (the FCC constitutes a full-power station that is licensed as a satellite as the same entity as its parent station, and therefore does not count them toward market ownership caps). A unique instance exists in Austin, Texas, involving the de facto triopoly of NBC affiliate KXAN-TV, CW affiliate KNVA and MyNetworkTV affiliate KBVO, the latter of which signed on in 1991 as a Llano-based satellite of KXAN to serve western portions of the market where reception of that station's UHF signal was impaired by the hilly terrain within the area. Even though KBVO was converted into a separately programmed station in October 2009 (and therefore no longer acts as a KXAN repeater, even by way of a subchannel), the FCC granted Media General permission to acquire its license under an existing satellite waiver during that company's merger with LIN Media in 2014 (without the waiver, Media General/LIN would have been forced to sell either KBVO or KNVA, which would not have been viable in any event, since there are not enough unique full-power station owners in the Austin market to permit a second legal duopoly with an owner of one of the market's three English language major network affiliates and neither would have likely had long-term financial survivability as a standalone station). In addition, the FCC permits common ownership of three television stations if there are low-powered stations that are involved. In 2013, through its acquisition of stations from Newport Television, Nexstar and Mission Broadcasting formed a full-power virtual quadropoly made up of two legal duopolies in Little Rock, Arkansas, consisting of NBC affiliate KARK-TV and MyNetworkTV affiliate KARZ-TV (which Nexstar already owned), and Fox affiliate KLRT-TV and CW affiliate KASN (another existing duopoly that was acquired by Mission). Through the resulting local marketing agreement with Nexstar, the operations of KLRT and KASN were consolidated into KARK/KARZ's facilities; 30 employees were laid off as part of the consolidation. A similar virtual quadropoly in the Mobile, Alabama- Pensacola, Florida market was formed through another acquisition from Newport, this time by Sinclair, consisting of Pensacola-based ABC affiliate WEAR-TV and MyNetworkTV affiliate WFGX (which were both already owned by Sinclair and licensed to the beach community of Fort Walton Beach), and Mobile-based NBC affiliate WPMI and Pensacola-licensed independent station WJTC (owned by Deerfield, and operated by Sinclair under a local marketing agreement). Unlike the quadropoly in Little Rock, Sinclair has not consolidated all four stations into one facility and each duopoly maintains their own studios in different parts of the market (WEAR/WFGX on the Florida side, WPMI/WJTC on the Alabama side). Similarly structured virtual triopolies (many of which are run by Nexstar and Sinclair) also exist in a few markets, in which either an existing owner-operator of a legal duopoly also manages a tertiary station owned by a separate if indirectly related licensee, or owns-operates one station and runs two others that are owned by different licensees. In Canada, at least one community (Rivi√®re-du-Loup, Quebec) has all three of its local French language stations ‚Äì CKRT-DT, CIMT-DT and CFTF-DT ‚Äì under common ownership, however such levels of common ownership are for the most part strongly discouraged by the CRTC unless the stations serve remote communities or separately carry programming in different languages (such as Rogers Media's aforementioned triopoly in Toronto, consisting of the English-language CITY-DT and multicultural stations CFMT-DT and CJMT-DT). In Mexico, media concentration is endemic and it is not uncommon for as many as four stations to be operated by one entity. Televisa owns four Mexico City stations (XEW, XHTV, XHGC and XEQ) while Azteca, Mexico's second-largest broadcaster, owns three (XHIMT, XHDF and XHTVM). These stations, in turn, feed large numbers of full-power affiliates. The largest Mexican network is the Televisa-owned Canal de las Estrellas, which feeds its programming to more than 100 stations nationwide. ==See also== * Trimulcast * Concentration of media ownership ==References== Category:Broadcast law Category:Concentration of media ownership Category:Television terminology Category:United States communications regulation ","title":"Duopoly (broadcasting)"},{"id":"20217514","text":"Ji≈ô√≠ (), the Czech name for George, may refer to: ==Given name== B *Ji≈ô√≠ Anton√≠n Benda *Ji≈ô√≠ Baborovsk√Ω *Ji≈ô√≠ Barta *Ji≈ô√≠ Barto≈°ka *Ji≈ô√≠ Bicek *Ji≈ô√≠ Bobok *Ji≈ô√≠ Bubla *Ji≈ô√≠ Buquoy *Ji≈ô√≠ Bƒõlohl√°vek *Ji≈ô√≠ B≈ôezina C *Ji≈ô√≠ ƒåe≈ôovsk√Ω *Ji≈ô√≠ ƒåunek *Ji≈ô√≠ Crha D *Ji≈ô√≠ Dopita *Ji≈ô√≠ Dru≈æeck√Ω (1745‚Äì1819), Bohemian-born Austrian composer and timpanist *Ji≈ô√≠ Dud√°ƒçek *Ji≈ô√≠ D≈æmura F *Ji≈ô√≠ Fischer G *Ji≈ô√≠ Grossmann *Ji≈ô√≠ Gru≈°a *Ji≈ô√≠ Grygar H *Ji≈ô√≠ Hanke *Ji≈ô√≠ H√°jek *Ji≈ô√≠ H√°la *Ji≈ô√≠ Hled√≠k *Ji≈ô√≠ Holeƒçek *Ji≈ô√≠ Hol√≠k *Ji≈ô√≠ Homola *Ji≈ô√≠ Hor√°k *Ji≈ô√≠ Hrdina *Ji≈ô√≠ H≈ôebec *Ji≈ô√≠ Hudec *Ji≈ô√≠ Hudec (composer) *Ji≈ô√≠ Hudler J *Ji≈ô√≠ Jantovsky *Ji≈ô√≠ Jaro≈°√≠k *Jiri Jelinek (born 1977), Czech dancer *Ji≈ô√≠ Jesl√≠nek (disambiguation) **Ji≈ô√≠ Jesl√≠nek (footballer, born 1962) **Ji≈ô√≠ Jesl√≠nek (footballer, born 1987) *Ji≈ô√≠ Jirmal K *Ji≈ô√≠ Kaufman *Ji≈ô√≠ Kavan *Ji≈ô√≠ Kyli√°n *Ji≈ô√≠ Kladrubsk√Ω *Ji≈ô√≠ Kochta *Ji≈ô√≠ Kol√°≈ô *Ji≈ô√≠ Korn *Ji≈ô√≠ Koubsk√Ω *Ji≈ô√≠ Kristi√°n z Lobkowicz *Ji≈ô√≠ Kr√°l√≠k *Ji≈ô√≠ Kulh√°nek *Ji≈ô√≠ Kyli√°n L *Ji≈ô√≠ L√°bus *Ji≈ô√≠ L√°la *Ji≈ô√≠ L√°tal *Ji≈ô√≠ Lenko *Jiri Lev *Ji≈ô√≠ Lev√Ω *Ji≈ô√≠ Ign√°c L√≠nek (1725‚Äì1791), Bohemian late- Baroque composer *Ji≈ô√≠ Lobkowicz M *Ji≈ôi M√°dl (born 1986), Czech film actor *Ji≈ô√≠ Mahen *Ji≈ô√≠ Malec *Ji≈ô√≠ Malysa (born 1966), Czech race walker *Ji≈ô√≠ Ma≈°ek *Ji≈ô√≠ Ma≈°t√°lka *Ji≈ô√≠ Menzel *Ji≈ô√≠ Mucha *Ji≈ô√≠ Mu≈æ√≠k N *Ji≈ô√≠ Nigrin *Jiri Novotny (disambiguation) **Ji≈ô√≠ Novotn√Ω (footballer) **Ji≈ô√≠ Novotn√Ω (ice hockey) *Ji≈ô√≠ Nov√°k (born 1975), tennis player *Ji≈ô√≠ Tibor Novak (born 1947), Czech-born Australian artist, illustrator, and writer *Ji≈ô√≠ Nƒõmec O *Ji≈ô√≠ Orten P *Ji≈ô√≠ Parma *Ji≈ô√≠ Paroubek *Ji≈ô√≠ Pauer *Ji≈ô√≠ Pelik√°n (disambiguation) **Ji≈ô√≠ Pelik√°n (chess player) **Ji≈ô√≠ Pelik√°n (politician) *Ji≈ô√≠ Petr *Ji≈ô√≠ Pe≈°ek *Ji≈ô√≠ z Podƒõbrad, George of Kun≈°t√°t and Podƒõbrady (1420‚Äì1471), (German: Georg von Podiebrad), was King of Bohemia (1458‚Äì1471) *Ji≈ô√≠ Posp√≠≈°il *Ji≈ô√≠ Poukar *Ji≈ô√≠ Proch√°ska R *Ji≈ô√≠ Ra≈°ka *Ji≈ô√≠ Rohan *Ji≈ô√≠ Rosick√Ω (disambiguation) **Ji≈ô√≠ Rosick√Ω (footballer, born 1948) **Ji≈ô√≠ Rosick√Ω (footballer, born 1977) *Ji≈ô√≠ Ryba S *Ji≈ô√≠ Sabou *Ji≈ô√≠ ≈†ejba *Ji≈ô√≠ Sequens *Ji≈ô√≠ Skobla *Ji≈ô√≠ ≈†l√©gr *Ji≈ô√≠ Sn√≠til *Ji≈ô√≠ Sov√°k *Ji≈ô√≠ ≈†tajner *Ji≈ô√≠ ≈†tancl *Ji≈ô√≠ Stiv√≠n *Ji≈ô√≠ St≈ô√≠brn√Ω (1880‚Äì1955), Czech politician *Ji≈ô√≠ Such√Ω T *Ji≈ô√≠ Tepl√Ω *Ji≈ô√≠ Tich√Ω *Ji≈ô√≠ Tlust√Ω *Ji≈ô√≠ To≈æiƒçka *Ji≈ô√≠ Trnka *Ji≈ô√≠ T≈ôanovsk√Ω V *Ji≈ô√≠ Vanƒõk (disambiguation) **Ji≈ô√≠ Vanƒõk (rower) **Ji≈ô√≠ Vanƒõk (tennis) *Ji≈ô√≠ Vesel√Ω *Ji≈ô√≠ Voskovec *Ji≈ô√≠ Votruba W *Ji≈ô√≠ Wachsmann *Ji≈ô√≠ Weil (1900‚Äì1959) Czech Jewish writer and novelist *Ji≈ô√≠ Welsch *Ji≈ô√≠ Wolker Z *Ji≈ô√≠ Zelenka *Jiri Zidek (paleontologist), contemporary Czech paeleontologist *George Zidek (b.

Persson has four children, one of whom, Malin Persson Giolito, is also a crime writer.https://skavlan.com/en/news/skavlan-october-19 ==Early life== Leif Gustav Willy Persson was born on 12 March 1945 in Stockholm, Sweden to Gustav and Margit Persson. He attended the High School Norra Real. ==Career== In 1977, while working at the Swedish National Police Board, Persson was the whistleblower who worked with journalist Peter Bratt in the so-called Geijer Scandal when he confirmed a classified memo sent by then National Police Commissioner Carl Persson to Prime Minister Olof Palme about the alleged ties of the Minister of Justice, Lennart Geijer, to a prostitution ring in Stockholm. Following this affair he was fired from the National Police Board. The string of events almost drove Persson to suicide,Daniel Ekeroth: SWEDISH SENSATIONSFILMS: A Clandestine History of Sex, Thrillers, and Kicker Cinema, (Bazillion Points, 2011) . but he soon returned as lecturer at Stockholm University. The prostitution ring affair inspired him to write his first novel, Grisfesten. He returned to the National Police Board as a professor in 1992. Persson was a professor in criminology at the Swedish National Police Board from 1992 to 2012. He is well known in Sweden for his crime fiction novels and for his regular appearances as an expert commentator on notable crime cases on television and in newspapers. Between 1999 and 2009, he participated as an expert commentator on the TV3 television show Efterlyst, which is primarily about wanted Swedish criminals. Between 2010 and 2018, he participated in the SVT television show Veckans Brott with Camilla Kvartoft, which is primarily about unsolved Swedish criminal cases both recent and cold. ==Bibliography== * Grisfesten (1978; The Pig Party) * Profit√∂rerna (1979; The Profiteers) * Hidden criminality : theoretical and methodological problems, empirical results (1980) * Min kompetens (1981; My Competence) * Samh√§llsb√§rarna (1982; The Pillars of Society) * Mellan sommarens l√§ngtan och vinterns k√∂ld (2002 - first volume in a trilogy which deals with Sweden in the cold war era, which has as a common element, events related to the yet unsolved 1986 murder of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme; Between Summer's Longing and Winter's End, UK 2010, trans.

B√§ckstr√∂m is one of the most successful investigators within the police force; he displays excellent deductive skills. B√§ckstr√∂m appeared as a supporting character in the TV mini-series En pilgrims d√∂d and Den fj√§rde mannen. (The main characters in these series were Jarnebring and Johansson.) In both of these series, B√§ckstr√∂m was played by Claes Malmberg. An American TV Series was made in 2015 entitled Backstrom. The show takes place in Portland, Oregon, USA instead of Sweden, and the character's first name is changed to Everett. However the character's actual personality remains more or less unchanged. Backstrom was played by Rainn Wilson. The show was cancelled after one season. Jarnebring and Johansson Several of Persson's novels feature police officers Bo Jarnebring and Lars Martin Johansson, partners and best friends. In the film Mannen fr√•n Mallorca (adapted from the novel Grisfesten) Jarnebring is played by Sven Wollter, and Johansson by Tomas von Br√∂mssen. Two TV mini-series featuring the characters were produced starring Rolf Lassg√•rd as Johansson and Per Svensson as Jarnebring: En pilgrims d√∂d (2013) and Den fj√§rde mannen (2014-15). (These two series also featured Persson's other character Evert B√§ckstr√∂m.) Anna Holt Created by Persson, police detective Anna Holt has appeared in both Persson's novels, and in novels by fellow author Jan Guillou. Holt has also appeared in several television adaptations starring Petra Nielsen. ==Notable adaptations== * Profit√∂rerna (TV series, 1983) * Mannen fr√•n Mallorca (The Man from Majorca, film, 1984) * I lagens namn (In the Name of the Law, film, 1986) * En pilgrims d√∂d (Death of a Pilgrim, TV mini-series, 2013) * Den fj√§rde mannen (The Fourth Man, TV mini-series, 2014‚Äì15) * Backstrom, (US TV series, 2015) ==Awards== Persson won the Best Swedish Crime Novel Award (B√§sta svenska kriminalroman), for three of his novels: Samh√§llsb√§rarna in 1982, En annan tid, ett annat liv in 2003, and Den d√∂ende detektiven in 2010. This award is a literary prize awarded annually by the Swedish Crime Writers' Academy. He also received the 2011 Glass Key award for Den d√∂ende detektiven (The Dying Detective); this award is a given annually to a crime novel by an author from the Nordic countries and the 2011 Palle Rosenkrantz Prize, which is awarded by the Det danske Kriminalakademi for the best criminal literature translated into Danish. ==References External links == * *Leif G.

The caves were ten metres long at the maximum, four metres wide and three metres tall. The cave sides had walls of brick. Altogether there were forty-one caves.

American cruise missiles bombed a suspected al Qaeda site in Zhawar Kili in 1998 in retaliation for the bombing of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. The United States Air Force performed bombings during 2001. A bombing during November 2001, was indirectly caused by Richard A. Beck, a geologist at the University of Cincinnati who informed the Department of Defense he could identify the rocks showing within video footage of Osama bin Laden released during October 2001, from a field trip he had made to Khowst. Ascertainment of the location was facilitated by the utilization of GIS technology and remote sensing. During 2002, a period of bombing began, apparently, during the 3rd of January, and included a period from the 6th to the 14th of January 2002.

The story takes place between Gears of War and Gears of War 2. == Publication history == Epic Games and DC Comics announced on April 17, 2008, that a comic book based on Gears of War will be published. The comic is published under DC's Wildstorm imprint and is written by Joshua Ortega,Josh Ortega Talks \\"Gears of War\\", Comic Book Resources, December 24, 2008 with art by Liam Sharp.Ortega & Sharp on Gears of War Comic, Newsarama, July 24, 2008Sharp's Exclusive Gears of War Comic News , Comicon, August 11, 2008 The first storyline \\"Hollow\\" ran from Gears of War #1-6 and was followed by \\"The Quickening\\" with pencils by Simon Bisley and inks by Henry Flint. Sharp, Flint, Joel Gomez and Trevor Hairsine provided the art for the single issue \\"Harper's Story\\" in issue #8, before Sharp returned for the multi-issue storyline \\"Barren\\" starting in Gears of War #9. In addition to the main comic series there is The Gears of War: Sourcebook issue, which holds a collection of images from artists from the comic book industry. The issue also contains a story from Joshua Ortega titled \\"One Day\\", which focuses on the inner struggle of Dominic Santiago. == Plot ==  \\"Hollow\\"  In this comic books series, Marcus Fenix is training a new recruit, Jayson \\"Jace\\" Stratton. Delta Squad, composed of Marcus, Dom, Jace and Gil, is searching the Badlands for lost squads. They find another Gear, Corporal Michael Barrick of Echo Six. The rest of the members in the squad had been KIA. They set up camp and Dom and Marcus tell war stories to the other squad members. In the morning they encounter some locust drones. Gil gets seriously wounded just before two boomers arrive. While the rest of the squad takes out the enemy, Gil dies in Jace's arms. Jace recalls his own brother dying in his arms, but unlike then, Jace cannot shed a tear. The squad returns to Jacinto for a week's break. Dom and Anya meet, and Dom tells her that he appreciates the fact that she looked for his wife Maria. Anya then proceeds to meet Marcus Fenix in a bar. Two tough guys try to pick up Anya in a rough manner but Marcus hurts them to get them off. Once they find out who Marcus is, they lay off for good. The week is up and Dom, Marcus and Jace head out to find out that Michael Barrick is now in their squad.  \\"The Quickening\\"  During the invasion of his home Island, Tai Kaliso fought Indie soldiers in the jungle. After witnessing his village being cleansed by the UIR, Tai recognizes he has nothing to live for and ran into a member of the 26th Royal Tyran infantry. That same Gear, Marcus Fenix, invited Tai to fight for the COG, since he wanted him to be on the winning side. Years later Tai, along with the 26th, was fighting in Aspho Fields. Tai easily killed an Indie and mortally wounded another, giving comfort to the dying soldier but using his body as a Meat Shield after his death. Many years later, after the Lightmass Offensive, Tai explains to Jace that life is sacred. Later, during the Assault on Landown, Rig D77 is destroyed by Tickers but Tai was able to survive. He then joined up with Delta-One. Hours later Tai and Dizzy engaged Skorge in a melee combat. Realizing Skorge could not be beaten, he ordered Dizzy to escape. Tai was captured by the Locust, and \\"processed\\". After hours of torture, Tai's soul was ready to leave his body, and when Delta rescued him Tai took his own life.Gears of War:The Quickening  \\"Harper's Story\\" In the comic, Jonathan Harper tells his own story. His story begins as his squad cheers on as the train carrying the Lightmass Bomb took off. Later he tells how he and his squad witnessed the bombing and thought it was beautiful. When he states the Locust weren't completely wiped out, he stated a new threat emerged, Rust Lung. He said several soldiers were tested for a new disease, Michael Barrick called it Rust Lung. Vivian Merriweather told Jon he didn't have Rust Lung, but he was unable to handle fighting which Jon took offense of. He was later given medicine. He was sent down into the hollows for Operation Hollow Storm. He was later captured and got very ill. He escaped the prison he was captured in, the same one as Maria's, and rescued a family evacuating out of Jacinto by taking some bullets where he perished near the sinkhole.Gears of War:Harper's Story  \\"Barren\\" Following a distress signal from the overrun city of Jilane, Delta Squad is dispatched to investigate with the help of a unique \\"scout\\" named Alex. The team, with the help of Sigma Squad, will explore one of the darker elements of the Gears universe, and to tell this unique and harrowing tale, series writer Joshua Ortega will be joined by Epic Games president Mike Capps. \\"Midnight\\" This issue shines a spotlight on Jace Stratton, who's joining the squad in the recently announced Gears of War 3 game!

Cyclists had been trying the ride since at least July 1880, when H Blackwell and C A Harman of the Canonbury Bicycle Club rode from Cornwall to Caithness in 13 days.Hilton, Tim (2004), One More Kilometre and We're in the Showers, Harper Collins, UK The first formal attempt was by George Pilkington Mills, who rode a penny-farthing with a 52-inch wheel for 5d 1h 45m in July 1886, when he was 19.The record, for a machine of the type, still stands; shortly afterwards cyclists switched to chain-driven machines with smaller wheels. The Road Records Association formed two years later to formalise attempts. It ruled that riders were free to take whatever route they preferred provided they covered the distance. That proved critical in Poole's ride and in the challenge that ended his record. ==The record he won== Dick Poole set off from Land's End at 9:45 am on Wednesday, 16 June 1965Woodland, Les (2005), This Island Race, Mousehold Press, UK, p146Sporting Cyclist, UK, undated 1965 He was 31, married with a daughter, and worked full-time as an accountant. The record he was challenging was 2d 10m 40s, set by Reg Randall of the Harlequin cycling club in 1958. The timekeeper was Frank Fischer of the Kentish Wheelers. Poole fell in road works at Cullompton and slid 10 minutes behind Randall when he got held up in traffic at Wellington. The pain of cuts on his hip from the fall cost him a further six minutes by Bristol, where Reg Randall helped direct his challenger through traffic. Night fell, rain fell, Poole's lights refused to stay lit. Poole was 42 minutes behind Randall at Wigan, after 365 miles but picked up speed along the main A6 highway. He got lost in the streets of Lancaster before an observer from the Road Records Association found him and pointed him the right way. Poole finally moved ahead of Randall's time at Crawford, across the border into Scotland. Sporting Cyclist reported: :The run along the coast of Sutherland, prelude to the ascent of Helmsdale and the Ord of Caithness, revealed climbing that set the helpers talking about Charly Gaul!Gaul, from Luxembourg, was so talented at climbing in the Tour de France that he was called The Angel of the Mountains. Dick rode Berridale, the toughest hill of a tough journey, without faltering. To attain his own schedule for the first time since Okehampton was a great reward for climbing of the highest order. He raced past the 'desert of telegraph poles' along the coast of Caithness and reached Wick (855 miles) with 10min in hand of the two-day schedule. Two more minutes were gained in the next three miles ‚Äì and John o'Groats (871.7 miles) was reached in 1 day 23hr 46min 35sec. ==The record he missed== Poole was tired and reluctant to continue. But a further at would bring him the 1,000-mile record, which Randall also held. \\"I was in the state you'd expect after the end-to-end\\", Poole said, \\"but they were saying I'd barely have to do it at club run speedThe speed of a leisurely ride by friends, typically between 12 and 17mph. So I agreed and I had a rest and I set off again.\\"Woodland, Les (2005), This Island Race, Mousehold Press, UK, p147 The weather at John o'Groats was calm. Poole rode the first 15 miles at 20 mph and the first 30 at 17 mph. The weather turned to cold rain pushed by a high wind. Bernard Thompson, the organiser, allowed Poole to continue beyond the extra 128 miles as the timekeeper timed him through landmarks about every mile. By measuring the whole route afterwards, Fischer could calculate where Poole had passed 1,000 miles and at what time. At what Thompson considered a safe margin, 1,010 miles, Poole came to a halt. Fischer's unconfirmed time for 1,000 miles was 2d 8h 6m, which had beaten Randall's time by 2h 34m. The problem came when the course was measured. It showed that, despite the extra 10 miles measured on the odometer of the following car, Poole was a few yards short of the distance. Poole said: :We couldn't understand it. They measured it again and then the motoring organisations joined in and they measured it and still it came out short. And it was getting to be quite a story in the papers. It took a lot of puzzling to work out what had happened. We had based our attempt on the schedule that Reg Randall used. The route was clear except in Scotland, where there was a choice between going straight over a mountain, which was the shorter route, or round it, which was longer but meant he could ride faster. :We didn't know which way he'd gone but we assumed the shorter way, and that's the way I went. The over-the-mountain route was 10 miles and so many yards shorter and so I hadn't done 1,000 miles when we were all sure I'd ridden 1,010.\\"Woodland, Les (2005), This Island Race, Mousehold Press, UK, p148 ==The records broken== Poole's end-to-end record stood for 14 yearsThompson, Bernard (1988), Alpaca to Skin Suit, Geerings of Ashford, UK, p43 before it fell to Paul Carbutt, a rider who rode everything from short hill-climb time-trials to Land's End-John o'Groats. He won national championships at 50 and 100 miles and 12 hours and won the British Best All- rounder competition for the highest average speeds over three races. Bernard Thompson said: \\"Paul Carbutt is probably the one and only rider ever to have covered such a wide variety of unpaced distances with such success... Carbutt turned professional for a successful career which included the Land's End to John o'Groats record in 1d 23h 23m 1s, breaking Dick Poole's 14-year-old record by 23m 34s. In the process, Carbutt lost five minutes in Cornwall when police accused him of speeding. . The writer Tim Hilton said: :Paul Carbutt broke Poole's record in 1980. There is one difference in their routes through Scotland: the Forth Road Bridge was built between the two attempts, meaning that Carbutt rode 13 fewer miles. On the other hand he was entangled with traffic on the way to the bridge and might have lost half an hour among the trucks and cars. Poole's time had not been much slower. In 1965 he had arrived at the John o'Groats Hotel at 9.46 am. Surely this proves that Poole's ride, all of 15 years before, had set a magnificent record. The 1,000-mile record fell in September 2001 to Gethin Butler, a 33-year-old from Preston, who recorded 2d 7h 53m 7s having beaten the end-to-end record on the way in 1d 20hrs 4m 19s. ==Poole's ride== Sporting Cyclist reported that Poole wore four club jerseys, two pairs of shorts, two pairs of shoes, several pairs of socks, sweaters and a nylon anorak. He had quick halts for food but, as he was riding, got through 2 lb of fruit cake, 11 packets of malt bread sandwiches, one gallon of rice and fruit salad, seven pints of Complan, 12 oranges, cans of fruit, eight pints of coffee, 13 pints of tea and eight pints of Ribena. His bicycles had gears of 102, 90, 84, 73, 72, 70, 62 and 59 inches. His Mercian frame had a head angle of 72 degrees and a seat angle of 73. He rode on 8oz tubularsKnown in some countries as sew-ups or singles. He had handlebar controls for his gears, Mafac Racer brakes, Campagnolo hubs and a Stronglight chainset. ==Retirement== Poole became head coach of the Road Time Trials Council before its coaching scheme merged with that of the British Cycling Federation. He is now a coach at Reading track west of London and is President and Treasurer of the Farnborough and Camberley Cycling Club. Along with Aleck Hunter, he was instrumental in forming the British Triathlon Association after the first U.K. Triathlon had been organised in 1982 by health club owner and former Olympic pentathlete Mike Ellis along with David Wall, Peter Metalli and Maurice Hoare at a disused gravel pit at Kirton's Farm, Pingewood,Reading in 1982. Poole was BTA Chairman from 1983 to 1989.Trinews, UK, December 2007, p14 He now lives in Reading with his wife and has two daughters called Kate and Caroline and two grand-daughters, Gemma and Elysia. ==References== Category:Living people Category:English male cyclists Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Dick Poole (cyclist)"},{"id":"20217669","text":"A Day at the Beach is a 1970 film written by Roman Polanski.

Saroyan received his B.A. in history from Princeton University. He later began studying Soviet politics at UC Berkeley in 1986. In 1990 he became one of the first doctorate students of Berkeley's Soviet and Post-Soviet Studies program.Saroyan, 231 After his graduation, Saroyan was hired as an assistant professor of political science at Harvard. At the same time he was diagnosed with a fatal illness. Though he took his position at Harvard, due to his worsening state Saroyan returned to Berkeley in 1993. He died on July 21, 1994 at the age of 34. Saroyan was a unique voice in the field of Soviet studies, especially concerning Islam in the Soviet Union. At a time when the field was focused on elite-politics within Russia proper, Saroyan emphasized anthropological approaches among the other Soviet republics.Saroyan, 1. Unlike other contemporary scholars such as Alexandre Bennigsen and H√©l√®ne Carr√®re d'Encausse who portrayed regional Islam as a static, anti-Soviet force, Saroyan examined the constantly shifting nature of the religion and its elite in an ever-evolving historical and sociopolitical context.Saroyan, 3. Going against prevailing Western views, Saroyan argued that Islam was not a threat to Soviet rule. More generally, he also argued against the theory, found in both Soviet and Western writings, that Islam, along with other religions, was an anachronism that would soon disappear from the region.Saroyan, 4. Besides religious issues, Saroyan examined ethnic issues in the former Soviet Union, especially Armenia‚ÄìAzerbaijan relations and the Nagorno-Karabakh War.Saroyan, 6.

The first of Locke's Two Treatises of Government consists mainly of criticism of Filmer.

The Lardeau River runs into Trout Lake (the lake) and exits at the south end of the lake. It then runs as does the lake on a southeastern course to the community of Lardeau at the north end of Kootenay Lake, while beyond it and the townsite of Trout Lake at its northwestern end is a low pass to the Beaton Arm of Upper Arrow Lake at Galena Bay. Speculation on railway development through this pass promoted a great amount of speculation at Trout Lake, or Trout Lake City as it soon was proclaimed to be, as well as at Lardeau and other potential townsites along the rail line's route. Halcyon Hot Springs, originally a railway-era resort, is located approximately thirty minutes away on Highway 31 (later 23). The Windsor Lodge Trout Lake BC has a restaurant and bar and there is also a gas station/convenience store located within Trout Lake City. A coffee shop/cafe, the No-Board Cafe opened in 2006 in Trout Lake City. Long term residents do most of their grocery shopping in Nakusp, the nearest town, about forty-five minutes away. Trout Lake also has a general store which offers provisions and gasoline, operating out of the original Hladinec Esso garage. In 1882, while surveying the land for railway development, Robert Sproule noted a large area of iron staining on the eastern shore of Kootenay lake. Large amounts of high-grade silver was discovered, setting off an explosion of prospecting activity around Trout Lake. Many new discoveries followed throughout the late 19th century. Trout Lake grew as a staging point and shipping hub for ore from the Silver Cup, Broadview, True Fissure, Great Northern, and Nettie L. mines. As demand for mining equipment and labour grew, so did the surrounding settlements of Ferguson and at Trout Lake. Trout Lake City has fluctuated in size and population since the 1870s primarily based on the boom and bust cycle of resource development. Despite the mineral wealth of the region, mining pursuits have been afflicted by the same adversities which were present in 1900. Effective development has often been handicapped by transportation difficulties and the propensity of unscrupulous businessmen to over-hype their claims. E.M. Morgan said in 1900, \\"There's too many cheap-john jacklegs in the camp looking for something for nothing, and they find it. The result is they go down into the penny ante belt, float a jim-crow company, sell shares, find they have a wildcat, go broke and the shareholders in chorus condemn the country in general, instead of stringing up the 'floater'\\". In 2007 a new mining boom began with the production of molybdenite concentrates at Roca's MAX mine. This was relatively short-lived however, and the mine shut down in 2011 due to underground collapse and low molybdenum prices. The MAX mine processing facility and tailings pond have remained inoperative since the MAX mine closure in 2011. Substantial mineral deposits remain in the vicinity of Trout Lake, and exploration and development work has been ongoing since the 1970s. ==See also== *List of ghost towns in British Columbia *Goat Range Provincial Park ==References== * Category:Unincorporated settlements in British Columbia Category:Ghost towns in British Columbia Category:Mining communities in British Columbia Category:Populated places in the West Kootenay ","title":"Trout Lake, British Columbia"},{"id":"20217753","text":"Champion is a 2003 Bengali sports-drama film directed by Rabi Kinagi, the movie featured Jeet and Srabanti Chatterjee. This movie is Jeet's third movie and Srabanti Chatterjee's debut movie. The film is the remake of 1999 Telugu film Thammudu which was loosely based on the 1992 Hindi film Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar which itself was loosely based on the 1979 movie Breaking Away. ==Plot== The main theme of the film depicts how an irresponsible boy can be very responsible at a particular stage of life. In this film we have got a glittering appearance of a new hero at Tollygunge named 'Jeet'. Raja is a college student who is forever committing mischief. He and his peers Bhola, Dhonu & Kanu always stay on the top of the list of failures. Raja has an elder brother, Rohit (Siddhartho) who is the exact opposite of the infamous Raja. Rohit works at their father's cafe, and is bright in studies. Their father is fed up with the restless Raja. Even after repeated whackings from his father the stubborn mule refuses to change. Raja's only support is his childhood friend Kavita who is secretly in love with him. But the flirtatious Raja finds solace in the spoilt brat Riya, the daughter of a millionaire. Raja saves Riya from the villainous millionaire student Ronny. But Riya dumps Raja & patches up with the affluent Rony. In the meanwhile Rohit starts rigorously practising for the upcoming kick boxing championship final against Rony. All hell breaks loose when Rohit is beaten by Rony & his mates. Rohit is hospitalised in a critical condition. Raja approaches Rohit's coach and begs him to train Raja. Thus a vigorous practice schedule begins. Raja with support from Kavita gets himself ready for the match. In the match he emerges victorious and dedicates the trophy to Rohit and then celebrates his love with Kavita. With Jeet's journey in Bengali film world taking a new-found momentum from this film after the huge success of 'Saathi', the industry got yet another great young actor in Siddhartho Banerjee, in the role of Rohot (Jeet's elder brother). Siddhartho, though a regular face in TV serial lead roles, was relatively a newcomer on the big screen. His screen presence was at par with that of Jeet and acting was top-notch. This film also gifted the industry another budding actor, Sagnik (in the role of Rony) who was a great fit opposite the Jeet- Siddhartho duo. ==Cast== * Jeet as Raja * Srabanti Chatterjee as Kavita * Deepankar De as Raja's Father * Rajesh Sharma as Sports Coach * Siddhartho Banerjee as Rohit * Sagnik Chatterjee as Ronny * Sandhita Chatterjee as Riya * Shyamal Dutta as Kavita's Father == Soundtrack == Singers are Shreya Ghoshal, Jojo, Reema Mukherjee. ==Reception== Champion was a high critically and commercially success. Mainly Jeet's comic timing and acting was praised. ==Awards== Best actor nomination (Jeet) Best playback singer and Best Supporting Actor Nomination (Siddhartho Banerjee) ==References * Category:2003 films Category:2000s Bengali-language films Category:Indian films Category:Bengali-language films Category:Films directed by Rabi Kinagi Category:Indian sports drama films Category:2000s sports drama films Category:Indian romantic drama films Category:Indian boxing films Category:2000s buddy films Category:2003 romantic drama films Category:Bengali remakes of Telugu films Category:2003 drama films ","title":"Champion (2003 film)"},{"id":"20217758","text":"Prasit Taodee (Thai: ‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏™‡∏¥‡∏ó‡∏ò‡∏¥‡πå ‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏≤‡∏î‡∏µ; born March 9, 1985) is a Thai football player.

It is one of three high schools in Baia Mare designated a \\"National College\\", the most prestigious rank for institutions of secondary education in Romania. It also ranks high on the national level in results at the Romanian Baccalaureate, university admissions and school contests. Over 17,000 have graduated from »òincai, with the majority going on to university. History ==History== »òincai was founded on , shortly after the Union of Transylvania with Romania. Its first head, appointed by the Directory Council of Transylvania, was Prof. Dr. Gheorghe Hetco, who remained in his position until 1940. When it opened, the high school had 172 students, 17 teachers, eight classrooms, a chemistry laboratory and a physics one. The library had 10,099 books. 561 pupils graduated during the interwar period. In 1940, the Second Vienna Award granted Northern Transylvania, including Baia Mare, to Hungary. The Romanian high school was closed and a Hungarian-language one functioned in its stead. Gheorghe »òincai High School reopened on 1 December 1944, once it had passed back under Romanian control, although classes did not resume until January 1945, with the canon and catechist Dr. Vasile »öiplea being named director. In 1959, the school building was expanded with twenty new classrooms and a gym. Expansion continued in the 1970s, with the building eventually housing 44 classrooms, some of which were used as laboratories. After World War II, the high school had one Romanian-language section and one in Hungarian, until a Hungarian high school was established in Baia Mare. In 1959, as part of a crackdown on Hungarian institutions in Romania, this again became a section of »òincai, a status maintained until 1998, when the Hungarian high school was re-established. ==Facilities== »òincai has 32 classrooms and 12 scientific and linguistic laboratories. The latter consist of three computer labs with 60 computers, three physics labs, two chemistry labs and one for biology, and one each for French, English and geography. The library has some 30,000 volumes and a reading room. The French, English, German and computer science departments have their own libraries. In addition, there are 11 teachers‚Äô offices, a teachers‚Äô room, five personnel offices, a gym, an outdoor athletic area, and a guidance counselor‚Äôs office. A psychologist and a doctor are on staff. Classes occur during the morning, with afternoons reserved for arts and sports. Facilities Outside the computer labs, there are additional computers in the classrooms, along with teaching equipment that is constantly being updated (printers, copy machines, scanners, four video projectors, DVD players, televisions, tape recorders, microscopes, dissection kits, laboratory kits for physics, chemistry, and biology, etc.). The original building was constructed in 1903-06, and is classified as a historic monument by the Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs. Lista Monumentelor Istorice 2010: Jude≈£ul Maramure≈ü, p.1703 This, along with the 1959 addition, was refurbished in 2000-2007. ==Activities== Intramural sports championships take place at »òincai: the High School Championship, the 9th Grade Classes' Cup, the 12th Grade Classes' Cup; as well as participation in city, county and national sports championships. The Gheorghe »òincai Cultural Society functioned from 1919 to 1940. In 1969 the magazine Speran»õe (\\"Hopes\\") first appeared, on the occasion of the school's semicentennial. It was published, with interruptions, until 1994, after which faculty and students attempted to start other publications, none of which had more than one issue. From 1994, »òincai has been in a network of pilot schools experimenting with and applying elements of education reform. Starting in 1958, »òincai began to appear among the schools with excellent performance at academic olympiads, a goal that continued to be met in the ensuing decades. As of 2008, pupils had won 679 prizes at national olympiads, 32 at international olympiads, and 13 at presentations of compositions. The school‚Äôs gymnastics, basketball and volleyball teams have won national championships, and numerous prizes at county and regional contests. ==Notable alumni== *Augustin Buzura (b. 1938), member of the Romanian Academy, president of the Romanian Cultural Foundation *Dezideriu Duma (1905-1988), member of the Academy of Medical Sciences *Mircea Flonta (b. 1932), member of the Romanian Academy, professor at the University of Bucharest‚Äôs Faculty of Philosophy *Vasile Ghe≈£ie (1903-1990), titular member of the Romanian Academy, Doctor Honoris Causa of the University of Leipzig, member of the New York Academy of Sciences, member of the Royal Society of Medicine *Marius Porumb (b. 1943), corresponding member of the Romanian Academy *Leon Prodan (1902-1984), professor of public health at the Boston University School of Medicine *Florian C.

Encek Wan Akub discovered a large amount of tin ore at Ulim river, south Bangka Island on a voyage of discovery with his secret task force and reported it to sultan Badaruddin I of Palembang Darussalam.

The name turlupin is a derisive epithet; they appear to have called themselves the \\"society of the poor\\" or \\"fellowship of poverty\\". Mention of them survives only in writings of their opponents, who condemned them as heretics. Therefore, very little is known about them, but they apparently wore few clothes as an expression of the vow of poverty, which led to accusations of nudism and promiscuity. Some historians think their importance may have been exaggerated to add \\"local colour\\" to academic theological disputes. The sect was active mainly in the second half of the 14th century around Paris, being one of the few heretical sects active in Paris at that time. In 1372 a number were imprisoned, with a female leader, Jeanne Daubenton, burnt at the stake for witchcraft and heresy. A similar sect may have been active in the 1460s around Lille. ==References== Category:14th century in France Category:15th century in France Category:Religious organizations established in the 14th century Category:Ascetics Category:Sects Category:Christian mystics Category:Medieval Paris ","title":"Turlupins"},{"id":"20217946","text":"Philip Joseph Deloria (Dakota) is a historian who specializes in Native American, Western American, and environmental history. He is the son of scholar Vine Deloria, Jr. (Dakota), and the great nephew of ethnologist Ella Deloria (Dakota). Deloria is the author of the award-winning books, Playing Indian (1999) and Indians in Unexpected Places (2004), among others. Deloria received his Ph.D. in American Studies from Yale University and currently teaches in the Department of History at Harvard University. ==Family background== Deloria is an enrolled member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, and the son of Barbara and Vine Deloria Jr. (both Yankton Dakota). His father Vine was a scholar, writer, and activist for Native American rights who earned national recognition for his 1969 book, Custer Died for Your Sins: An Indian Manifesto. Philip J. Deloria's paternal great aunt Ella Deloria (Yankton Dakota) worked as an ethnologist, and Ella's sister Mary Sully was an artist. Deloria's grandfather, Vine Deloria Sr. and great grandfather Philip Joseph Deloria, also known as Th√≠pi S√°pa (Black Lodge), were Episcopal priests. Philip J. Deloria is also the great-great grandson of U.S Army officer and painter Alfred Sully, and the great-great-great-grandson of painter Thomas Sully. ==Education and career== Deloria graduated from the University of Colorado in 1982 with a B.M.E. in music education. In 1988, Deloria completed his M.A. in journalism and mass communications at the University of Colorado, as well. Deloria received his Ph.D. in American studies from Yale University in 1994. Deloria worked as a professor at the University of Colorado in the Department of History from 1994 to 2000, before taking up a professorship at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in both the Department of American Culture and the Department of History. Deloria was the associate dean of undergraduate education in the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor's College of Literature Science and the Arts and was the Carroll Smith-Rosenberg Collegiate Professor. In 2018 he was made the first tenured professor of Native American history at Harvard University. ==Published works== Deloria is the author of two non-fiction books and a number of articles and book chapters. Deloria's 1999 text, Playing Indian, addresses the historical phenomenon of \\"playing Indian\\", whereby non-Native people in the United States construct national and personal identities through the performance of Indian dress and ritual. Playing Indian won the 1999 Gustavus Myers Outstanding Book Award from the Gustavus Myers Program for the Study of Bigotry and Human Rights in North America. Deloria's second book, Indians in Unexpected Places (2004), explores stereotypes of Native American people which confine them to the past and analyzes the seeming disunity between Indian people and modernity. Indians in Unexpected Places received the John C. Ewers Prize for Ethnohistorical Writing in 2006 from the Western History Association. Deloria additionally produced, directed, and edited PBS program Eyanopapi: Heart of the Sioux. ==List of selected works== * Playing Indian.

It has received three modern editions, the first by the philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1698.The other editions are: Ernst Joachim von Westphalen, Monumenta Inedita rerum Germanicarum praecipue Cimbricarum et Megapolensium, III (Leipzig, 1739-45), and Johann Martin Lappenberg, Chronicon Holtzatiae auctore Presbytero Bremensi, Quellensammlung der Schleswig-Holstein-Lauenburgischen Gesellschaft f√ºr vaterl√§ndische Geschichte (Kiel, 1862). Other than that it has been rather neglected by medievalists; its Latin is poor and its author imaginative.In an era of positivism (late 19th century), it was valued only because the late Middle Ages lacked an Adam of Bremen or a Helmold of Bosau. For the years before 1170 the principal source for the anonymous presbyter is Helmold's Cronica Slavorum. After this date he has no discernible source. He describes himself as a scriba hujus patrie (scribe of this fatherland), probably indicating a low-level position in the comital chancery, then in its earliest stages. An analysis of the Chronicon suggests that he had access to comital documents and that he participated in the 1447 negotiations at L√ºbeck between Adolf VIII of Holstein-Rendsburg and Duke of Schleswig and the free people of the Dithmarschen, wedged between Holstein and the sea. The Chronicon pays especially close attention to the west of the county (Dithmarschen, Krempermarsch, and Wilstermarsch), and particularly to Itzehoe. This suggests that the anonymous presbyter may have hailed from the western country, or maintained links with the Cistercian monastery of Saint Lawrence/Our Lady at Itzehoe. The majority of counts of Holstein were buried there and since 1421 their memory was preserved through various memorial masses and other services rendered by the monks. The author of the Chronicon may have been one of the twenty vicars assigned special roles in this regard. The Chronicon, interpreted in the political context of its compilation, was a propaganda tool for the Schauenburg dynastic line of Holstein-Rendsburg. The house of Schauenburg had ruled Holstein since Adolf I acquired it in 1101. Though six different cadet branches ruled the county divided after 1261, these were all, save the Holstein-Pinneberg, reunited under the Rendsburg branch by 1390. At the time of the Chronicons compilation Adolf VIII was childless and facing a succession crisis in both Holstein and Schleswig, a fief of the Kingdom of Denmark that was often in dispute between the Holsatian counts and Danish kings. When Christian of Oldenburg, who had married Adolf's sister in 1421, succeeded the Danish throne as Christian I in 1448, the succession problem and the problem of Danish interference in Holstein were suddenly resolved in favour of the Rendsburg interests.Rendsburg interests were made clear when Adolf VIII supported his brother-in-law's claim to the Danish throne despite that it came to him through the female line, and was thus not legal in Denmark. The maintenance of the high status of Itzehoe and the denigration of the claims of the counts of Holstein-Pinneburg to the county of Holstein- Rendsburg fuelled the anonymous presbyter of Bremen to compose his chronicle at this time. In the anonymous's own words: ' (\\"to complement the chronicle that brother Helmold of pious memory faithfully composed of the princes of Holstein and their neighbours\\"). ;References *Mathieu Olivier. 2005.

By then a journalist, he was killed in the Munich air disaster. He was an uncle to historian Norman Davies. ==Sporting career== A talented footballer in his youth, Davies played as a right winger for the Northern Nomads F.C. and Port Vale. He was capped three times for the England national amateur football team in 1914, with tours of Austria, Hungary and Romania. Also in 1914 he was offered a professional contract with Stoke City but as war had broken out he instead decided to join the Royal Flying Corps. Just a fortnight after receiving his wings, Davies was shot down over the French town of Douai, captured, and placed in a German Prisoner of War camp. When he eventually returned to England he weighed only six stone and army doctors had given him no more than six months to live. Davies recovered from his ordeal and took up sport again, playing cricket for Bradshaw in the Bolton League. He was lured to Lancashire and spent the 1924 and 1925 seasons there as an amateur. He appeared in 11 first-class matches as a righthanded batsman, scoring 260 runs with a highest score of 46, and held four catches.Donny Davies at CricketArchive Davies made his highest score of 46 in his debut innings, against Kent at Old Trafford before being dismissed by Test bowler Tich Freeman. ==Journalist career== In 1932, having begun his journalism career two years earlier, Davies was given a job with The Manchester Guardian newspaper and was their football reporter under the name \\"An Old International\\". He also did some work on the radio for the BBC. Davies served as a member of the Lancashire committee from 1930 to 1956 and in 1957, just before his death, was appointed vice-president. Davies was considered to be one of the finest writers that the game of football ever had.Michael Henderson. The Spectator. Vol.290, Iss. 9084. September 14, 2002. page 12. His reporting on the Manchester United team was so in depth that the general public who read/listened to his reporting felt like they were connected to the team.The Guardian. Richard Williams. February 2, 2008. https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/02/newsstory.manchesterunited2 Neville Cardus, who was a cricket correspondent and chief music critic for The Manchester Guardian, described Davies' as \\"the first writer on soccer to rise above the immediate and quickly perishable of his themes and give us something to preserve. Old International was not only the best of soccer reporters; he was also something of a poet.\\" About. An Old International. [online]. https://www.anoldinternational.co.uk/about/. ==Death== On 6 February 1958, a plane carrying Davies, other journalists and the Manchester United squad crashed on takeoff from Munich-Riem Airport in Germany. Davies, who had spent the 1950s covering Manchester United's footballing exploits, was killed along with 22 others. They had been returning from a European Cup tie in Belgrade. John Arlott, who had covered Manchester United's game at Highbury a week earlier, was originally meant to take Davies' spot on the trip to Belgrade as the 'Old International' was unavailable. Davies however expressed a desire to attend the trip at the last moment and replaced Arlott. He was 65 at the time of his death, and was the oldest victim of the tragedy. ==References== Category:1892 births Category:1958 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Manchester Category:Writers from Manchester Category:English footballers Category:Association football wingers Category:Northern Nomads F.C. players Category:Port Vale F.C. players Category:England amateur international footballers Category:English cricketers Category:Lancashire cricketers Category:English male journalists Category:British sportswriters Category:The Guardian journalists Category:Victims of aviation accidents or incidents in Germany Category:Victims of aviation accidents or incidents in 1958 Category:Victims of the Munich air disaster ","title":"Donny Davies"},{"id":"20218080","text":"is a former Japanese football player. ==Playing career== Nishimura was released by Nagoya Grampus after nine-season with the club on 10 November 2016, going on to announced his retirement from the game on 30 December 2016. ==Club statistics== {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"National Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Continental !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"4\\"Kyoto Purple Sanga 2003 J1 League 000000colspan=\\"2\\"-00 - 2004 rowspan=\\"2\\"J2 League 1901000colspan=\\"2\\"-200 - 2005 401000colspan=\\"2\\"-50 - 2006 J1 League 1601020colspan=\\"2\\"-190 - rowspan=\\"2\\"Kyoto Sanga FC 2007 J2 League 000000colspan=\\"2\\"-00 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !39!!0!!3!!0!!2!!0!!colspan=\\"2\\"-44!!0 - rowspan=\\"10\\"Nagoya Grampus 2008 rowspan=\\"9\\"J1 League 402080colspan=\\"2\\"-140 - 2009 1020101050 - 2010 000020colspan=\\"2\\"-20 - 2011 0000000000 - 2012 0000000000 - 2013 000000colspan=\\"2\\"-00 - 2014 000000colspan=\\"2\\"-00 - 2015 000000colspan=\\"2\\"-00 - 2016 000010colspan=\\"2\\"-10 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !5!!0!!4!!0!!12!!0!!1!!0!!22!!0 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !44!!0!!7!!0!!14!!0!!1!!0!!66!!0 } ==References * Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Association football people from Mie Prefecture Category:Japanese footballers Category:J1 League players Category:J2 League players Category:Kyoto Sanga FC players Category:Nagoya Grampus players Category:Association football goalkeepers ","title":"Koji Nishimura"},{"id":"20218171","text":"Deseret Test Center Logo features globe in aerosol cloud The Deseret Test Center was a U.S. Army operated command in charge of testing chemical and biological weapons during the 1960s. Deseret was headquartered at Fort Douglas, Utah, a former U.S. Army base. ==History== Progress toward standardizing new biological warfare agents was limited from 1961 to 1962 by the lack of adequate extra-continental test facilities in which toxic agent munitions combinations could be fully assayed without the legal and safety limitations that were necessary in less remote test areas within the Continental United States. In May 1962 the Joint Chiefs of Staff established the Deseret Test Center at Fort Douglas, Utah, a disused army base.Regis, Edward. The Biology of Doom: The History of America's Secret Germ Warfare Project, (Google Books), Macmillan, 2000, p. 198, (). The U.S. Army command at Deseret was established as a result of being tasked with conducting Project 112 and Project SHAD. The Deseret project required a joint task force to undertake overseas chemical and biological testing. In response, the Joint Chiefs of Staff established the Deseret Test Center under the auspices of the U.S. Army Chemical Corps.Harris, Sheldon H. Factories of Death: Japanese Biological Warfare, 1932-45, and the American Cover-up, (Google Books), Routledge, 1994, p. 232-33, (). A directive from May 28, 1962 outlined Deseret Test Center's mission: No tests were actually conducted at Deseret Test Center however, the Deseret administration facility was supported by Dugway Proving Ground about away. The Deseret center occupied Building 103 and 105 at Fort Douglas, where administrative and planning decisions were made. The headquarters at Fort Douglas was staffed by 200 individuals. The U.S. Army closed Deseret Test Center in 1973.\\"Fact Sheet - Yellow Leaf \\", Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), Deployment Health Support Directorate, accessed November 15, 2008.  Project Deseret (1961-1963)  Project Deseret was developed to conduct a highly classified military research, development, and testing program which was aimed at both offensive and defensive human, animal, and plant reaction to biological, chemical, toxicological, entomological, and radiological warfare agents in various combinations of climate and terrain. The top secret research was conducted by the United States' Deseret Test Center with Britain, Canada, and Australia under the Quadripartite agreement. During Project Deseret each agent needed to be tested at sea, in the arctic, desert, and in a tropical jungle environment. In the autumn of 1961 Project Deseret was divided into two main parts consisting of Project 112 and Project SHAD. Project Deseret was designated to assist not only the Army but the Navy, Marine Corps and the Air Force as well; thus, it was funded jointly by all branches of the U.S. military and U.S. intelligence agencies, a euphemism for the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) Office of Technical Services. On April 17, 1963, President Kennedy signed National Security Action Memorandum 235 (NSAM 235) authorizing: The deployments of Project 112 agents and field testing commenced immediately after the memorandum was signed. ==Tests== Between its opening in 1962 and 1973 the Deseret Test Center was at the helm of Project 112,Guillemin, Jeanne. Biological Weapons: From the Invention of State-Sponsored Programs to Contemporary Bioterrorism, (Google Books), Columbia University Press, 2005, pp. 109-10, (). a military operation aimed at evaluating chemical and biological weapons in differing environments. The test began in the fall of 1962 and were considered \\"ambitious\\" by the Chemical Corps; the tests were conducted at sea, in Arctic environments and in tropical environments. Tests were aimed at human, plant and animal reaction to the chemical and biological agents and were conducted in the United States, Liberia, Egypt, South Korea and Okinawa. According to the Department of Defense, Deseret planned 134 chemical and biological weapons tests and of those 46 were carried out and 62 were canceled.\\"DOD RELEASES DESERET TEST CENTER/PROJECT 112/PROJECT SHAD FACT SHEETS\\", U.S. Department of Defense, October 9, 2002, accessed November 15, 2008. The tests of Project 112, and the related seaborne Project SHAD, were kept secret until October 2002.Judson, Karen. Chemical and Biological Warfare, (Google Books), Marshall Cavendish, 2003, pp. 83-86, (). Many tests occurred on U.S. soil and released live biological agents, chemical agents or their simulants. In total, according to the reporting of CBS News, more than 5,000 soldiers and sailors were involved in the secret tests, many of them unknowingly.\\"Secrecy Over Cold War WMD Tests\\", CBS News, January 16, 2004, accessed November 15, 2008. From 1963-1965 there were 18 tests involving biological simulants, usually Bacillus globigii (BG). BG was used to simulate dangerous agents, such as anthrax; once thought harmless to humans, research in the intervening years has revealed some simulants can actually cause infection in those with weakened immune systems.Shanker, Thom. \\"U.S. Tested a Nerve Gas in Hawaii\\", The New York Times, November 1, 2002, accessed November 15, 2008. 14 separate tests were performed using VX, sarin, nerve agent simulants and tear gases. ==See also== *Deseret Chemical Depot *Human experimentation in the United States *Fort Detrick *Fort Douglas *Fort Terry *Tooele Army Depot *Tooele Chemical Agent Disposal Facility *Weteye bomb ==References *Davidson, Lee. \\" Secrets at sea: Cloud of secrecy lifting on Dugway Navy's tests of germ and chemical agents in the Pacific during Vietnam War\\", Deseret News, Oct 22, 1995, accessed September 27, 2019.

Huabiao () is a type of ceremonial columns used in traditional Chinese architecture. Huabiao are traditionally erected in pairs in front of palaces and tombs. The prominence of their placement have made them one of the emblems of traditional Chinese culture. When placed outside palaces, they can also be called bangmu (). When placed outside a tomb, they can also be called shendaozhu (). ==Structure== Extant huabiao are typically made from white marble. A huabiao is typically made up of four components. At the bottom is a square base, called a sumeru base, which is decorated with bas-relief depictions of dragons, lotuses, and other auspicious symbols. Above is a column, decorated with a coiled dragon and auspicious clouds. Near the top, the column is crossed by a horizontal stone board in the shape of a cloud (called the \\"cloud board\\"). The column is topped by a round cap, called the chenglupan (ÊâøÈú≤Áõ§) \\"dew-collecting plate\\" (see fangzhu). At the top of the cap sits a mythical creature called the denglong (), one of the \\"nine children of the dragon\\", which is said to have the habit of watching the sky. Its role atop the huabiao is said to be to communicate the mood of the people to the Heavens above. ==History== Classical texts in China attribute the beginning of the huabiao to Shun, a legendary leader traditionally dated to the 23rd-22nd century BC. Some say it developed from the totem poles of ancient tribes.Culture of Beijing: Huabiao The Huainanzi describes the feibangmu (), or bangmu for short, literally \\"commentary board\\", as a wooden board set up on main roads to allow the people to write criticism of government policies. However, tradition holds that by the mid-Xia dynasty, the king had moved the bangmu in front of the palace, in order to control public criticism. During the notorious reign of King Li of Zhou, the king would monitor those who wrote on the bangmu, and those who criticised the government would be killed. The practical use of the bangmu gradually diminished as a result of such practices. In the Han dynasty, the bangmu became merely a symbol of the government's responsibility to the people. These were erected near bridges, palaces, city gates and tombs; the name huabiao arose during this time. During the Southern and Northern Dynasties, the Liang dynasty restored the institution of the bangmu, by installing boxes next to the bangmu. Those wishing to air grievances or to comment on government policies could post their writings in these boxes. However, by this time, the column itself was no longer treated as a bulletin board.Aspect of Chinese Culture by Li Xukui Chang Zonglin Jan 1, 1991 It is thought that, in their use on spirit roads, the huabiao replaced the ornate que towers, which were commonly used during the Eastern Han dynasty (25‚Äì220 AD). ==Notable examples== Some prominent examples of ancient huabiao that can still be seen today include the following. * There are two pairs of huabiao at Tiananmen, with one pair located inside the gate, and one pair outside. These were erected in the Ming dynasty in the 15th century. * Pairs of huabiao flank the spirit way of most of the medieval and pre-modern imperial tombs which survive to this day, including the imperial tombs of the Ming and Qing dynasties. * A pair of huabiao are located outside the tomb of the Marquess Pingzhong of Wu of the Liang dynasty, located in Nanjing. * A pair of huabiao originally from the Old Summer Palace in Beijing are now located within the grounds of Peking University (photo) * Two pairs of huabiao near the Lugou Bridge (Marco Polo Bridge) at the southwestern outskirts of Beijing. One pair is located at the eastern end of the bridge, the other at the western end, flanking the roadway. In the early 20th century, the huabiao, in a Modernist form, was incorporated into the developing vocabulary of a modern Chinese architectural style. Examples of these modernist re-interpretations of the huabiao can be seen in front of a variety of institutions built during that period, such as Tongji University in Shanghai, or the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing. More recently, a trend has developed in some parts of China to create (often enlarged) replicas of the classical huabiao, though not often used in the classical context. For example, Xinghai Square in Dalian, which was built in the 1990s, incorporated a single huabiao at its centre, to commemorate China's resuming sovereignty on Hong Kong. On August 5, 2016, Dalian's landmark huabiao was demolished in secret at 00:30am, as the government considered it as a vanity project of Bo Xilai (a former mayor of Dalian who was arrested in 2013 for corruption). It had been there for 19 years and had become a landmark and symbol of Dalian. Citizens were angry with that, according to taxi drivers in the city and many comments on the Internet by Dalian locals. However, the media and government both remained silent. During the 2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, a pair of huabiao were featured as part of the performance. ==See also== * Totem Pole * Paifang ==References * Category:Architecture of China Category:Columns and entablature Category:Traditional Chinese architecture ","title":"Huabiao"},{"id":"20218261","text":"Street punk (sometimes alternatively spelled streetpunk) is an urban working class-based subgenre of hardcore punk, partly as a rebellion against the perceived artistic pretensions of the first wave of British punk. Street punk emerged from the style of early Oi! bands such as Sham 69 and Cockney Rejects, and the Oi! bands that followed them such as Blitz, The Business and Angelic Upstarts. A key band in defining the aesthetic was The Exploited. However, street punk continued beyond the confines of the original Oi! form with bands such as GBH, Chaos UK, Discharge, The Anti-Nowhere League and Oxymoron. Street punks generally have a much more ostentatious and flamboyant appearance than the working class or skinhead image cultivated by many Oi! groups. Street punks commonly sported multi-coloured hair, mohawks, tattoos, heavily studded vests and leather jackets, and clothing, especially plaids, adorned with political slogans, patches, and/or the names of punk bands. In the 1990s and 2000s, a street punk revival began with emerging street punk bands such as The Casualties, The Virus, Cheap Sex, Lower Class Brats and The Unseen. The Casualties achieved underground success in the 2000s. ==Characteristics== Street punk band Charged GBH on Warped Tour Street punk music is characterized by single-note guitar lines and short solos. Unlike similar genres, such as traditional hardcore punk, street punk bands sometimes consisted of two guitarists, one of which plays guitar melodies while not singing. Street punk also makes frequent use of communal vocals, gang vocals, and sing‚Äìalong choruses. Street punk lyrics commonly address topics including fighting, drinking, partying, inner-city turmoil or personal relationships. Street punk bands sometimes express political viewpoints, typically of a left-wing variety, although some street punks eschew politics altogether in favor of a more hedonistic, nihilistic outlook. Punk veteran Felix Havoc said: ==History== Origins (1980s) UK 82 1980s-era punks UK 82 (also known as UK hardcore, second wave punk or No Future punk) took the existing punk sound and added faster drumbeats and an aggressive distorted guitar sound. The term UK 82 is taken from the title of a song by The Exploited.UK82 Access date: September 20, 2008. Cross-pollination existed between this era of British street punk and American hardcore punk. The lyrics of UK 82 bands tended to be much darker and more violent than the lyrics of earlier punk bands. They tended to focus on the possibilities of a nuclear holocaust, and other apocalyptic themes, partially due to the military tension of the Cold War atmosphere. The other mainstay of the lyrics of the era was unemployment, and the policies of the Conservative Party government. Lyrics frequently denounced the Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher in the same way that American hardcore punk bands addressed the Ronald Reagan administration. The three most prominent UK82 bands, according to Ian Glasper, are The Exploited, Discharge,Matt Diehl, \\"The Young Crazed Peeling\\", My So-Called Punk: Green Day, Fall Out Boy, The Distillers, Bad Religion‚ÄîHow Neo-Punk Stage-Dived Into the Mainstream, New York: Macmillan, 2007, , p. 107. and Charged GBH. The Exploited were controversial due to their aggressive lyrics and rowdy concerts, and were considered by Glasper to be \\"cartoon punks\\". Glasper wrote: \\"For many, The Exploited were the quintessential second wave punk band with their senses-searing high-speed outbursts against the system, and wild-eyed frontman Walter 'Wattie' Buchan's archetypal orange mohican.\\" Discharge's early work proved to be enormously influential, providing the blueprint for an entire subgenre. Their later work, however, has been described as moving into heavy metal. D-beat D-beat (also known as Discore or k√§ng (boot), in Sweden) was developed in the early 1980s by imitators of the band Discharge, for whom the genre is named.: \\"I just wanna be remembered for coming up with that f-ckin' D-beat in the first place! And inspiring all those f-ckin' great Discore bands around the world!\\" ‚Äì Terry \\"Tez\\" Roberts The first such group was The Varukers.: \\"The Varukers were the original Discore band, the first and best of the hardcore punk acts to take the simple, yet devastatingly effective formula laid down by Discharge and play it as fast, hard, heavy as they could.\\" The vocal content of D-beat tends towards shouted slogans. The style is distinct from its predecessors by its minimal lyrical content and greater proximity to heavy metal. It is closely associated with crust punk, which is a heavier, more complex variation. D-beat bands typically have anti-war, anarchist messages and closely follow the bleak nuclear war imagery of 1980s anarcho-punk bands. The style was particularly popular in Sweden, and was developed there by groups such as Anti Cimex and Mob 47. The Unseen Revival (1990s and 2000s) In the 1990s, a new era of street punk began with emerging street punk bands like The Casualties, Rancid Cheap Sex, The Unseen, The Virus, A Global Threat, Clit 45, Career Soldiers, The Krays, Defiance, and Lower Class Brats. Many of these bands were signed by Punk Core Records. The Casualties became one of the most well-known street punk bands and achieved underground success. Their 2004 album On the Front Line peaked at number 8 on the Independent Albums chart. On the Front Line and The Casualties' 2006 album Under Attack peaked at numbers 7 and 9 on the Heatseekers Albums chart, respectively. ==See also== * Clockwork Orange Punks * List of street punk bands * Oi! ==ReferencesBibliography== * * * Category:Punk rock genres Category:British styles of music Category:British rock music genres ","title":"Street punk"},{"id":"20218276","text":"Ji≈ôina is a Czech given name for females which may refer to: *Ji≈ôina Bohdalov√° (b. 1931), actress and TV personality *Ji≈ôina Haukov√° (1919‚Äì2005), poet and translator *Ji≈ô√≠na Nekolov√° (1931-2011), figure skater *Ji≈ôina Petrovick√° (1923‚Äì2008), film actress *Ji≈ôina Pt√°ƒçn√≠kov√° (b. 1986), pole vaulter *Ji≈ôina ≈†ejbalov√° (1905-1981) actress *Ji≈ôina Steimarov√° (1916‚Äì2007), film and television actress *Ji≈ôina ≈†tƒõpniƒçkov√° (1912‚Äì1985), actress *Ji≈ôina ≈†vorcov√° (1928 ‚Äì2011), actress and pro-Communist activist *Ji≈ôina T≈ôebick√° (1930‚Äì 2005), dancer and actress. ==See also== *Ji≈ô√≠ (disambiguation) *Jiri (disambiguation) Category:Czech feminine given names br:Ji≈ôina cs:Ji≈ôina de:Ji≈ôina ","title":"Ji≈ôina"},{"id":"20218278","text":"Richard Pearce (c.1835 ‚Äì 17 July 1868) was a British plant collector, who introduced the tuberous begonia to England, which led to the development of the hybrid begonias grown today. ==Early career== Pearce was born at Stoke, Devonport in Devon. His first employment was with Pontey's nursery in Plymouth, where he stayed until about 1858, when he went to work at the nursery of James Veitch at Mount Radford, near Exeter. ==Plant collecting== James Veitch & Sons In February 1859, Pearce was sent by Veitch to South America for three years as a \\"collector of plants, seeds, land-shells and other objects of Natural History\\". Pearce travelled initially to Valpara√≠so, with instructions to collect in Chile and Patagonia. In particular, he was directed to collect seeds of Libocedrus tetragona, at that time supposed to be the tree which produced the famous Alerce timber. His agreement also required him to locate and collect the Chilean Bellflower, Lapageria rosea and its white variety L. alba, the Chile Pine (then known as Araucaria imbricata) and other hardy trees and shrubs as well as to collect orchids and stove (hothouse) and greenhouse flowering plants. Pearce successfully carried out his instructions, and as well as the plants he was contracted to collect, he also obtained and introduced Prumnopitys elegans, Podocarpus nubigenus, Eucryphia glutinosa, several Bomareas, Cavendishia bracteata, Ourisia coccinea, Ourisia pearcei and quantities of ferns, the Victorian fern craze then being at its height. His researches on this trip showed that the tree that produced Alerce timber was the Patagonian Cypress, Fitzroya cupressoides and not Libocedrus tetragona as had been previously thought. During 1860 Pearce made many journeys to the mountains and the interior of Chile. He wrote of the scenery of that part of the Chilean Cordilleras which he explored: > \\"It is of the most charming description: gently undulating meadows covered > with a carpet of short grass, placid lakes reflecting from their smooth > surface the mountains around, foaming cataracts and gentle rivulets, deep > gorges and frightful precipices, over which tumble numerous dark, > picturesque waterfalls reaching the bottom in a cloud of spray. High rocky > pinnacles and lofty peaks, surround one on every side. > \\"Nor is the vegetation less beautiful and interesting. At an elevation of > 4,000 ft. the vegetation exhibits a totally different character from that of > the coast. Here one finds Antarctic Beeches (Fagus antarctica and F. > betuloides), which constitute with Fitzroya patagonica the large forest > trees. The Embothrium coccineum, Desfontainia spinosa, Philesia buxifolia, > three species of Berberis, Pernettya and Gaultheria are the most abundant of > the flowering shrubs, whilst the numerous pretty little rock-plants meet one > at every step with their various forms and colours.\\" Sanchezia nobilis Early in 1862 Pearce left Chile and travelled north to Peru and Bolivia, before moving on to Ecuador in search of stove and greenhouse plants. From Cuenca he sent seeds of many plants, including Befaria ledifolia, Lisianthus magnificus, Calceolaria ericoides, and several kinds of Tacsonia, before returning from Guayaquil to Britain with six large Wardian cases of plants, amongst which was a handsome plant of the Marantaceae, which was named Calathea veitchiana in honour of his employers. In January 1863, James Veitch again sent him to South America on another three-year expedition \\"to collect plants, seeds and other objects of Natural History\\". He travelled initially to Lima, Peru, from where he was to travel to \\"such parts of South America as by written instructions to him should be determined. Particular attention was to be directed to the Tucum√°n Province, [Argentina] should there be facilities for reaching that country.\\" His travels took him through Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia, before eventually reaching Tucum√°n. Amongst the plants that he discovered on this expedition and introduced to European hot-houses were Aphelandra nitens and Sanchezia nobilis. From Argentina, he collected Nierembergia rivularis and N. veitchii, Palava flexuosa, Mutisia decurrens and several varieties of Peperomia. On his return to La Paz, in November 1865 he also sent back to England a number of Hippeastrums, including H. pardinum and H. leopoldii and some samples of Eccremocarpus which were subsequently lost. Pearce continued to explore the Andes; one of his final discoveries before returning to Britain was Masdevallia veitchiana, which he discovered in Peru and successfully introduced to cultivation. Begonias Whilst exploring in the Andes, Pearce discovered three varieties of tuberous begonia, which were introduced to Britain, and became the fore-runners of the many varieties now available: :Begonia boliviensis was discovered in the Bolivian Andes by Pearce in 1864 and shortly afterwards was introduced to Europe. Begonia boliviensis is of special historical interest to gardeners, being one of the species used by John Seden in the production of the first hybrid tuberous begonia raised in Britain, Begonia √ó sedenii. :Begonia pearcei, discovered in Bolivia in 1864, is also important in the hybridising of the Begonia √ó tuberhybrida begonias, the first of which appeared in 1867. :Begonia veitchii was introduced to Europe in 1866 after Pearce discovered it in the Peruvian Andes near Cusco at an elevation of from 10,000‚Äì12,000 feet. Begonia veitchii played an important role in the development of today's popular hybrid cultivars and, together with Pearce's other introductions, B. boliviensis and B. pearcei, was subsequently hybridized to produce the Begonia √ó tuberhybrida cultivar group. Pearce also brought back from Peru a species he named Begonia rosiflora, but this has subsequently been considered to be the same as B. veitchii, since the two forms differ only slightly, mainly in flower colour. ==Later career and death== On returning from La Paz in 1866, Pearce's contract with James Veitch & Sons was terminated and he returned to his home at Plymouth, where he married. In 1867 he moved to London where he was contracted by William Bull to travel back to South America in search of Masdevallia veitchiana. On arrival in Panama he set off in search of a species of Cypripedium (C. planifolium) which he had been advised was growing nearby.About Orchids ‚Äì A Chat by Frederick Boyle (1893) His search was in vain and following his return to Panama City, he was taken ill on 13 July, and died on 17 July 1867 (aged 33) of yellow fever transmitted by a mosquito bite. According to Hortus Veitchii, \\"as a botanical collector Pearce was one of the best, and his untimely death was a great loss to the world of horticulture\\". ==References== Category:English botanists Category:1835 births Category:1868 deaths Category:People from Plymouth Category:Veitch Nurseries Category:Botanists active in South America Category:Plant collectors ","title":"Richard Pearce (botanist)"},{"id":"20218283","text":"Edison Joseph (; born November 27, 1989) is a football player of Nigerian origin.

First introduced in Kingdom Come #1 (May 1996), Kingdom Come Superman was created by Mark Waid and Alex Ross. The character was loosely adapted in the CW Arrowverse crossover \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\" portrayed by Brandon Routh. ==Publication history== The Superman of Kingdom Come first appeared as the main character of the 1996 Elseworlds miniseries Kingdom Come written by Mark Waid and Alex Ross with art by Ross, set in the future of the DC Universe. In 1999, The Kingdom, a sequel to Kingdom Come written by Waid but without the involvement of Ross, was published. This series again featured this version of Superman as a central character. In 52 #52, the Kingdom Come universe is shown in the DC Multiverse as becoming, for the first time, a part of the mainstream DC continuity. Starting with Justice Society of America #9, Kingdom Come Superman appears as a member of the Justice Society of America. The character also received a solo one-shot, Justice Society of America: Kingdom Come Special: Superman. ==Fictional character biography== Kingdom Come Ten years prior to the start of the events of Kingdom Come, the Joker floods the offices of the Daily Planet with his trademark toxin, killing all the staff except for Lois Lane, who finds a gas mask. Lois tries to attack the Joker, who fractures her skull in retaliation. Superman returns as Lois succumbs to her injuries and dies. As the Joker arrives for his trial, he is killed by a new superhero named Magog. In an instance of jury nullification, Magog is acquitted for his act. Superman is appalled by the public embracing a killer as a hero. Already disheartened at the death of Lois Lane, Kal-El abandons his life as Superman and retreats to his Fortress of Solitude, where he spends the next decade. During Superman's absence a team of new heroes, led by Magog, attempts to capture the Parasite, which results in the irradiation of the entire state of Kansas and much of the surrounding area when the Parasite kills Captain Atom.Kingdom Come #1 (May 1996) Coaxed back into action by Wonder Woman, Superman decides to return to Metropolis and re-form the Justice League. He manages to collect former heroes (including Green Lantern, the Flash, Hawkman, and Dick Grayson, now known as Red Robin, among others) and some of the newer heroes who had risen during his absence. Superman's Justice League constructs a prison and gathers up new violent heroes who followed in the example of Magog. A battle soon breaks out between the imprisoned heroes, the Justice League, a third group of heroes led by Batman, and Lex Luthor's Mankind Liberation Front‚Äîwhich includes a mind-controlled Captain Marvel.Kingdom Come #2 (August 1996) As conditions worsen, the United Nations Secretary General Wyrmwood authorizes the deployment of three tactical nuclear warheads, hardened against certain metahuman powers.Kingdom Come #3 (August 1996) The battling heroes manage to stop two of the bombers, but the third drops its warhead. Superman attempts to stop the bomb, but Captain Marvel frees himself from Luthor's control and sacrifices himself in Superman's place. The bomb goes off, killing many superhumans. In the aftermath of the battle, Superman helps fix the damage done to Kansas and resumes his identity as Clark Kent. He begins a romantic relationship with Wonder Woman, and at the end of Kingdom Come, the two are expecting a child.Kingdom Come #4 (August 1996) The Kingdom Twenty years after the events of Kingdom Come, a survivor of the Kansas disaster is granted power by the Quintessence, who dub him Gog. The power drives him mad, and he takes out his anger on Superman, killing him and carving his \\"S\\" shield on the ground. He then travels a day backward in time and kills him again, and repeats the process.The Kingdom #1 (February 1999) As Gog travels closer to the modern DC universe, the Linear Men panic when they see that their ordered index of time is unraveling; Superman is dead in the 21st century, yet alive in the 853rd, and their instruments register no error. When Rip Hunter tries to stop Gog from killing Superman on the day his and Wonder Woman's child is born, Gog manages to steal the infant (named Jonathan), whom he plans to raise and name Magog.The Kingdom #2 (February 1999) Rip Hunter recruits Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman from the Kingdom Come era to stop Gog in 1998. Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman team up with their 'past selves' and battle Gog to a final confrontation in a restaurant outside of reality, where they use various weapons gathered from across Hypertime. During the fight, the future Wonder Woman reveals to the Superman of the present why Gog is after him, and Superman vows that the timeline of Kingdom Come will never happen in his universe. He strikes back at Gog, finishing the battle once and for all. As the heroes return to their proper places in time, Rip Hunter explains that there actually are alternate timelines, so the Kingdom Come reality still exists, but it will no longer be the future of the DC universe. Justice Society of America Superman enters New Earth through a dimensional portal created inadvertently by Starman when he opened a black hole to stop a raging mystical fire the Justice Society couldn't contain that was coming from the hole in the chest of the villain Goth. Starman creates a black hole and places Goth inside of it. Goth's powers harmlessly erupt in the black hole, causing a rip in the dimension which brought this Superman to New Earth. The Kingdom Come Superman was depressed, as many of the heroes he knew from his timeline had died, including many of the present members of the JSA like Alan Scott; he has been drawn from his universe at the moment that the other heroes were struck by a nuclear bomb, causing him to conclude that his entire world has been lost. He attempts to escape from JSA headquarters and exerts his impressive power levels while doing so, including defeating Starman's gravity powers, which made Superman one hundred times heavier than normal. His escape was not to run from the JSA, but rather to save a young woman who was attempting suicide. He had heard her mumble about how the \\"world doesn't need her\\" from blocks away. Her depth of despair snaps him out of his own feelings of failing and loss. He responds, \\"Giving up never helped anyone miss, trust me on that.\\" In saving her, he begins to save some of his own sense of self. Superman returns to the JSA headquarters and meets with the JSA, the Justice League, and his own younger counterpart, the Superman of New Earth, to determine his real identity and background. Later when dealing with Japanese metahuman assassins trying to kill the new Judomaster, he shows he had little or no problem threatening the life of his opponents, an option the present Superman would never consider as he follows a strict code of ethics that abhors the use of deadly force. Power Girl, unable to ignore the strong resemblance between the newly arrived Superman and her dead cousin Kal-L, the Superman of Earth-2, starts to form a bond with this version of Kal-El, who in turn is reminded of his fallen cousin, Kara Zor-El of Earth-22. The Kingdom Come Superman asks if it would be all right if they think of each other as family. Power Girl accepts. Thy Kingdom Come After Mr. America brings word of his run in with Gog to the JSA, the Earth-22 Superman visits Metropolis, where he uses his listening powers to hear the various conversations around the city. This leads him to the Daily Planet, where he is overwhelmed by the sight of his old friends and Lois Lane. He is interrupted by New Earth Superman, and they talk about Gog and the danger he represents. Superman demonstrates that he is more powerful than his younger counterpart when he hears something in Gotham City that New Earth Superman cannot. Arriving in Gotham City, they both confront Hercules, who has survived a battle with Gog. Hercules attacks and injures New Earth Superman, but is defeated by the Earth-22 Superman. After returning to JSA headquarters Superman and the JSA are attacked by Gog. Gog proves to be an equal match for the entire JSA, and it is only when Amazing-Man absorbs the properties of Gog's staff that the fight turns. The fight transfers to the African Congo, where they find the true Gog has revived. The true Gog removes his powers from Williams, killing him, and reclaiming all of his own powers. Superman remains with the New Earth JSA. He is suspicious of the revived David Reid, who has been revived as Magog, and fearful that Reid will become like the being he knew on Earth-22. The Daily Planet is attacked and flooded with a green gas. Superman arrives and has a flashback to the time the Joker attacked his world's Daily Planet. The green gas is filled with kryptonite, which has no effect on Superman other than to cause his eyes to sting. Superman captures the terrorists and questions them. They reveal Lex Luthor hired them. Superman is about to kill the terrorists but is stopped by New Earth's Superman. Superman lashes out and accidentally hits New Earth's Superman. He apologizes but flees at the sound of New Earth's Lois Lane. Later, Lois Lane meets Superman in JSA headquarters, and asks him what happened to Lois Lane of Earth-22. Superman tells her the story of how his wife died. Sandman, Superman and the JSA learn that Gog is on the verge of permanently rooting himself into the Earth's core, which would result in the planet's destruction if he ever leaves. Realizing their only choice is to kill Gog and remove his head, Superman and the JSA confront Gog, and with the help of Gog's disillusioned followers achieve their goal. Superman has Starman open a Stargate to the Source Wall, where he places Gog's head. Superman then asks Starman, who has a map of the Multiverse on his costume, to send him back to Earth-22, to just before the bomb that destroyed Kansas went off. Superman instead arrives at the point shortly after the detonation, which corresponds to issue 4 of the Kingdom Come miniseries. In the epilogue, Superman is shown to have survived 1000 years after his return, and as an old man, he watches the fly-by of the Legion of Super-Heroes future generation of superheroes. ==Powers and abilities== Kingdom Come Superman shares most of the powers of Superman, including vast superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, senses, intelligence, regeneration, invulnerability and longevity; super breath, heat vision, x-ray vision, and flight. Kingdom Come Superman is shown to be much more powerful than New Earth Superman.Justice Society of America (Vol. 3) #13 (April 2008) Like other extra-dimensional versions of Superman, he is immune to the Kryptonite of New Earth; in the original Kingdom Come mini-series, Lex Luthor explains that Superman has absorbed several more years' worth of solar energy, effectively erasing his Kryptonite vulnerability. ==In other media== Brandon Routh as Superman in the Arrowverse crossover \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\". Brandon Routh, who previously portrayed Superman in the 2006 film Superman Returns and currently portrays the Atom in the CW Arrowverse series, reprises his role as Superman for the Arrowverse crossover event \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\", with elements adapted from the Kingdom Come version of the character. This version resides on Earth-96 and dealt with a significant tragedy when a dissatisfied Gotham City inhabitant gassed the Daily Planet, which took the lives of Lois Lane and his fellow co-workers. Following the incident, Clark became the new editor-in-chief and took on a red and black s-shield to remind himself that hope will always rise out of darkness. Amidst the Crisis, Earth-38's Superman and Lois Lane as well as Earth-1's Iris West- Allen show up to recruit him to help fight the Anti-Monitor as he is one of seven heroes capable of stopping the anti-matter being from destroying the multiverse, or Paragons. However, Lex Luthor of Earth-38 shows up and uses the Book of Destiny to force the Supermen to fight each other until Lois knocks him out. When the heroes came under attack from an Anti-Monitor possessed Harbinger, Pariah used his powers to send the Paragons to the Vanishing Point and keep them safe. Once there however, Superman-96 disappears and Lex Luthor appears in his place as he used the Book of Destiny to replace him. After the Paragons restore the multiverse and defeat the Anti-Monitor, a restored Superman-96 flys in his Earth's atmosphere, having returned to his traditional red and yellow s-shield. ==References== Category:Comics characters introduced in 1996 Category:DC Comics aliens Category:DC Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds Category:DC Comics characters with accelerated healing Category:DC Comics characters with superhuman strength Category:Extraterrestrial superheroes Category:Fictional adoptees Category:Fictional characters from parallel universes Category:Fictional characters from Kansas Category:Fictional immigrants to the United States Category:Fictional orphans Kingdom Come Category:Kryptonians Category:Characters created by Mark Waid Category:Characters created by Alex Ross Category:Superheroes who are adopted ","title":"Superman (Kingdom Come)"},{"id":"20218322","text":"A myodisc or myopic disk is a corrective lens with a steep concave curvature that is fitted on the posterior surface of a carrier lens, or a high power single-vision lens specially ordered with slab-off the edge, creating a central prescription disc. These are used for correction of extremely high myopia often seen in low vision patients. Myodiscs are not a preferred lens type, but are the least expensive option among available lenses fitted for minus powers beyond -12 diopters. They are cheap to produce but cause scotoma, a ringed blind spot. As a result, most practitioners encourage using other lens styles. The myodisc has been categorized as a lenticular lens. These are rarely prescribed sets of specialty lenses used in cases of extremely poor vision, or near blindness. The lenticular subrogate nomenclature has been extensively used in ophthalmology, requiring scope of context. Newer lens products can also be found using vague terminology. Low vision clinics in under-privileged cost-reducing centers list the myodisc for correction of high myopia. Another factor is spectacle frame selection. Large eyesize fashion frames are impractical. Lens box diagrams used in dispensing should consider edge thickness, reduced by smaller eyesizes, and oval/circular shapes. The bridge should be fitted to increase surface contact using rigid nose support if possible. Weight problems associated with these lenses are often not anticipated by untrained dispensaries, and end products are disappointing after inclusion of special instructions to fabricating labs. In some cases, more aesthetic aspheric lens designs can be fitted, reducing Scotoma associated with lenticulars. ==References== Category:Corrective lenses ","title":"Myodisc"},{"id":"20218341","text":"The Pan American Nikkei Association, the English-language name of the Asociaci√≥n Panamericana Nikkei, is a multi-national, non-governmental organization with membership of 14 countries from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Japan, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Dominican Republic, Uruguay, Venezuela, United States.National Association of Japanese Canadians: PANA overview ==History== In 1981, Mexican Nikkei organized the first convention; and its character was summarized in a slogan: \\"Let us be better citizens in our continent\\" (Seamos mejores ciudadanos en nuestro contiente).Kikumura-Yano, Akemi et al.

It was first opened in 1634 and was run by members of the Ichimura family for much of the following nearly three centuries before it was destroyed by fire in 1932. It has not been rebuilt. ==History== The theatre which would later be known as the Ichimura-za was founded as the Murayama-za, by Murayama Matasabur≈ç I in March 1634.Sh≈çriya, Asagoro. \\"Ichimuraza.\\" Kabuki21.com. Accessed 15 November 2008. After it was destroyed by fire in 1641 and rebuilt, the theatre, now controlled by Murayama's son-in-law Murata Kuroemon, with the help of Ichimura Uzaemon III, was renamed the Ichimura-za in 1643. Uzaemon became the official manager of the theatre in 1652, upon Kuroemon's death. The Ichimura-za was destroyed by fire and rebuilt numerous times over the years, including during the famous 1657 \\"Furisode Fire\\" or \\"Great Fire of Meireki\\". Ichimura Uzaemon III retired to become a priest in 1664, leaving ten-year-old Ichimura Takenoj≈ç I as his successor as zamoto (manager) of the theatre. It was then renamed the \\"Ichimura-Takenoj≈ç-za\\" for roughly a decade. In 1670, the shogunate officially restricted the licensed theatres in the city to four; the Ichimura-Takenoj≈ç-za received a license along with the Nakamura-za, Morita-za and Yamamura-za. The Ichimura-za would be host to numerous premieres and significant historical events for the kabuki genre. March 1680 saw the very first performance of a sayaate scene, or love rivals' competition; Chikamatsu Monzaemon's masterpiece The Battles of Coxinga, the first kabuki play derived from a bunraku (puppet) play to be performed in Edo, premiered simultaneously in 1717 at the Ichimura- za, and two other licensed theaters. Sugawara Denju Tenarai Kagami, which remains today among the three most famous and popular kabuki plays, debuted at the Ichimura-za in 1747. From 1784 to 1788, and again from 1793 to 1798, the Ichimura-za was forced to close due to financial difficulties, and gave its license temporarily to the Kiri-za. This circumstance was relatively common in the kabuki world, and was experienced by all of the licensed theaters at least once; in some cases, repeatedly. The Ichimura-za would be forced to declare bankruptcy and close again from 1815‚Äì1821, during which time its license traded hands several times, as other theaters too went bankrupt. It eventually reopened, under the management of Ichimura Uzaemon XII. After the theatre was destroyed once again by fire in 1841, and forbidden by the government to be rebuilt in its old location in the Sakai-ch≈ç neighborhood, the Ichimura-za was reconstructed and reopened in the Asakusa Saruwaka-ch≈ç area. In 1871, Ichimura Uzaemon XIV, struggling with the theater's debts, relinquished his position as zamoto, and gave control to Fukichi Mohei. Fukichi renamed the theater the Murayama-za once more, and named his 10-year-old son Murayama Matasabur≈ç II as official zamoto. The theatre would change management, and names, two more times: to Miyamoto-za in 1874 and Satsuma-za in 1875, before it was destroyed by fire yet again, and reopened in 1878 as the Ichimura-za once more. The theater was no longer controlled by the Ichimura family however, and was then managed by Ichikawa Benz≈ç and Nakamura Zenshir≈ç. The theater was then acquired in 1908 by entrepreneur Tamura Nariyoshi, marking the beginning of a brief golden age for the theater. Onoe Kikugor≈ç VI and Nakamura Kichiemon I, the stars of the Ichimura-za productions, were extremely popular, and for ten years brought great success to the Ichimura-za. A fire destroyed the theater for the last time, on May 21, 1932. It was not rebuilt.\\"Ichimura-za.\\" Ê≠åËàû‰ºé‰∫ãÂÖ∏ (kabuki jiten; \\"Kabuki Encyclopedia\\"). Japan Arts Council, 2001-2003.

Johnson appointed two individuals to the Supreme Court of the United States in just over five years as president. In 1965, Johnson nominated his friend, high-profile Washington, D.C. lawyer Abe Fortas, to the Supreme Court, and he was confirmed by the United States Senate. In 1967, Johnson nominated United States Solicitor General Thurgood Marshall to the Supreme Court, and he also was confirmed by the Senate. In 1968, however, Johnson made two failed nominations to the Supreme Court. He nominated Fortas to become Chief Justice to replace the retiring Earl Warren, and he nominated United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit judge Homer Thornberry to replace Fortas as Associate Justice. However, Johnson wound up withdrawing Fortas' nomination after his confirmation was filibustered by Sen. Robert Griffin (R-MI), and he was not able to make another Chief Justice nomination before his presidency ended. As a result, Warren continued as Chief Justice and Fortas as an Associate Justice, so Johnson also ended up withdrawing Thornberry's nomination. Ultimately, Johnson's successor, President Richard Nixon, appointed Warren E. Burger as Chief Justice of the United States. After Fortas resigned from the Supreme Court, Nixon appointed Harry Blackmun to fill Fortas' seat after his previous nominations of Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell to that seat both were voted down by the United States Senate. At the appellate level, Johnson formally nominated one person, Barefoot Sanders, for a federal appellate judgeship who was never confirmed. The United States Senate did not act on Sanders' nomination before Johnson's presidency ended, and Nixon did not renominate him. Johnson also considered other appeals court nominees whom he never wound up nominating. ==List of failed appellate nominees== *United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit **Seat - Barefoot Sanders (judgeship later filled by Nixon nominee George MacKinnon) (Sanders later was appointed by President Jimmy Carter to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas) In addition to Sanders, three Johnson nominees to district judgeships were not voted on by the United States Senate before Johnson's presidency ended: David Bress to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia; Cecil F. Poole to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California; and William Byrne to the United States District Court for the Central District of California. Johnson had nominated Sanders, Poole, Bress and Byrne during the 90th United States Congress, and he renominated the four in the 91st United States Congress, right before his presidency ended. However, three days after taking office, Nixon withdrew all four nominations. Nixon later wound up renominating Byrne to the same court in 1971, with Byrne quickly winning Senate confirmation. Poole was renominated by President Gerald Ford to a seat on the same court in 1976, and was quickly confirmed by the Senate. In Nixon's first news conference after his inauguration, he explained his decision to withdraw the four nominations: ==Others who were considered for nomination== In 1964, Johnson considered nominating either noted civil rights lawyer Bernard Segal or William Thaddeus Coleman, Jr. to fill a vacancy on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that had been created by the death of Herbert Funk Goodrich. Johnson personally approached Coleman regarding the nomination, but Coleman declined the offer. Johnson ultimately wound up nominating Abraham Lincoln Freedman to the seat, and he was confirmed quickly by the United States Senate. In 1968, Johnson had wanted to nominate liberal Republican Sen. Thomas Kuchel to a newly created seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit after he lost re- election in his party's primary that year. However, because the judgeship was created while Kuchel was in the Senate, Kuchel was constitutionally barred from being appointed to that seat during the final months of his Senate term (and the final months of Johnson's presidency). ==See also== * United States federal judge * Federal judicial appointment history ==References== Judicial appointment controversies Category:Federal judicial appointment controversies in the United States ","title":"Lyndon B.

The Criminal Matters came to prevail over the others, because hacendaria remained in the area of the executive branch and as \\"criminal hacendario\\" in the Public Ministry. The matter \\"criminal hacendaria\\" was of little significance, since its laws unique to the administrative procedure reserved most of the activities, for its part, the art heritage was as a task for the Attorney General's Office in a relatively equal terms with private subject. ==Organizational structure== The Public Ministry is made up of different units and prosecutors' offices, including: * Prosecutor General's Office. * Fiscal Council. * Prosecution of the Deputy Attorney General. * Assistant General Procuratorates. * Office of Technical and International Relations. * Unit Tax Inspectorate. * Prosecutors from the Attorney General. * Training and Monitoring Unit. * Administrative Unit. * Unit Property Crime. * Drug Trafficking and Juvenile. * Deputy Economic Crime, Corruption and Tax. * Enforcement of the penalty. * Unit scams. * Unit vehicle thefts. * Domestic Violence Unit and Sex Crimes. * Deputy Environment. * Civil Defense Office of the Victim. * Office of Information and Guidance for the Victim. ==The Civil Defense Office of the Victim== It is an office that supplies to victims of a crime the services of a legal representative, to help them obtain compensation for the damages they have suffered. The Civil Defense Office of the Victim is under the Public Ministry and began its work on January 1, 1998, with the entry into force of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The professional service provided by this office is absolutely free and is to assign the victim a lawyer, who performs the procedures necessary to enable the accused or who responds by him, paid the damages caused. This is called \\"civil action for damages.\\" If the office finds that it did have enough resources to hire a legal representative who leads the particular case, carry out the formalities to pay for professional services received. ==Office of Information and Guidance for Victim== Created with the purpose of guiding the victim and reduce their problems during the development of the criminal proceedings. Seeks to provide assistance as quickly as possible, because if the aid is late, worsens the situation of persons injured and that is precisely what we are trying to avoid. This Office is also attached to the Public Ministry and is on the sixth floor of the Courts of the First Judicial Circuit. ==See also== * Supreme Court of Costa Rica * Judicial Investigation Department ==External links== * Official Site Category:Institutions of Costa Rica Category:Costa Rican law ","title":"Public Prosecutor of Costa Rica"},{"id":"20218426","text":"Dallas is a surname of Scottish and English origin, as well as a given name.

The design was derived from the MS.35, first flown during World War I, modernised to feature a wing that now included slight sweepback, and a redesigned fuselage of rounder cross-section. The basic layout remained the same, being a wire-braced, parasol-wing monoplane with open cockpits in tandem and fixed tailskid undercarriage. Construction was mostly of wood, with the exception of the metal wing spars, and all control surfaces were covered in fabric. Most of the production run went to the A√©ronautique Militaire, with a few others built for the A√©ronavale and for military use by Greece and Denmark.

It was a major diplomatic blunder that worsened relations and badly hurt the Kaiser's reputation; after that he played a much smaller role in deciding foreign policy. The episode had a far greater impact in Germany than overseas.Christopher M. Clark, Kaiser Wilhelm II (2000) pp. 172-80.Lamar Cecil, Wilhelm II: Emperor and Exile, 1900‚Äì1941 (1996) vol. 2, pp. 123-45. ==Publication== The Telegraph presented what appeared to be an interview with the Kaiser. It was in fact the reworked notes by British Army officer Edward Montagu-Stuart-Wortley of conversations he had with Wilhelm II in 1907. The Telegraph sent the \\"interview\\" to Wilhelm II for approval, who in turn passed it to Chancellor Bernhard von B√ºlow, who later stated that he was too busy to edit the document, though B√ºlow's critics charged that he did not wish to challenge the Kaiser. Instead, B√ºlow passed it on to the Foreign Ministry for their review, which apparently was not done. It included wild statements and diplomatically damaging remarks, the most infamous of which was directed at the English: > You English are mad, mad, mad as March hares. What has come over you that > you are so completely given over to suspicions quite unworthy of a great > nation? What more can I do than I have done? I declared with all the > emphasis at my command, in my speech at Guildhall, that my heart is set upon > peace, and that it is one of my dearest wishes to live on the best of terms > with England. Have I ever been false to my word? Falsehood and prevarication > are alien to my nature. My actions ought to speak for themselves, but you > listen not to them but to those who misinterpret and distort them. That is a > personal insult which I feel and resent.The World War One Document Archive. > The Daily Telegraph Affair , > https://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/The_Daily_Telegraph_Affair, quoted in Ham, > p.148-9 Wilhelm had seen the interview as an opportunity to promote his views and ideas on Anglo-German friendship, but due to his emotional outbursts during the course of the interview, he ended up further alienating not only the British, but also the French, Russians, and Japanese.Thomas G. Otte, \\"‚ÄòAn altogether unfortunate affair‚Äô: Great Britain and the daily telegraph affair.\\" Diplomacy and Statecraft 5#2 (1994): 296-333. He implied, among other things, that the Germans cared nothing for the British; that the French and Russians had attempted to incite Germany to intervene in the Second Boer War; and that the German naval buildup was targeted against the Japanese, not Britain.partial text of \\"The interview of the Emperor Wilhelm II on October 28, 1908\\" ==Effects== The British leadership had already decided that Wilhelm was somewhat mentally disturbed, and saw this as further evidence of his unstable personality, as opposed to an indication of official German hostility.Thomas G. Otte, \\"'The Winston of Germany': The British Foreign Policy √âlite and the Last German Emperor.\\" Canadian Journal of History 36.3 (2001): 471-504. The Daily Telegraph crisis deeply wounded Wilhelm's previously unimpaired self-confidence, and he soon suffered a severe bout of depression from which he never fully recovered. He lost much of the influence he had previously exercised in domestic and foreign policy.Cecil, Wilhelm II: Emperor and Exile, 1900‚Äì1941 (1996) vol. 2, pp. 138‚Äì41 The effect in Germany was quite significant; severe embarrassment was followed by serious calls for the Kaiser's abdication. The conservative Junker politician Elard von Oldenburg-Januschau was the only member of the Reichstag to defend the Kaiser throughout the affair. Wilhelm kept a very low profile for many months after the Daily Telegraph fiasco, slumping into a deep depression, never fully recovering from the humiliation. He later exacted his revenge by forcing the resignation of the Chancellor B√ºlow,Strachan, Hew, The First World War (2001), p. 22 whom he blamed for having abandoned him to public scorn by not having the transcript edited before its German publication.Lamar Cecil, Wilhelm II: Emperor and Exile, 1900‚Äì1941 (1996) vol. 2, pp. 135‚Äì7, 143‚Äì45Donald E. Shepardson, \\"The 'Daily Telegraph' Affair,\\" Midwest Quarterly (1980) 21#2 pp 207‚Äì220 B√ºlow recalled in his Memoirs that: > A dark foreboding ran through many Germans that such... stupid, even puerile > speech and action on the part of the Supreme Head of State could lead to > only one thing ‚Äì catastrophe. ==NotesFurther reading== * Cecil, Lamar.

Implied licenses may arise by operation of law from actions by the licensor which lead the licensee to believe that it has the necessary permission. Implied licenses often arise where the licensee has purchased a physical embodiment of some intellectual property belonging to the licensor, or has paid for its creation, but has not obtained permission to use the intellectual property. ==Examples== * A person who purchases a record album does not explicitly purchase a right to perform that album by playing it on a record player, but this right is implied.\\"An incident to the purchase of any article, whether patented or unpatented, is the right to use and sell it....\\" United States v. Univis Lens Co., 316 U.S. 241, 249 (1942); see also Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 377 U.S. 476, 484 (1964) (\\"[I]t is fundamental that sale of a patented article by the patentee or under his authority carries with it an 'implied license to use.'\\") (quoting Adams v. Burke, 84 U.S. (17 Wall.) 453, 456 (1873)). * A person or entity that purchases computer software in a suite. Software that is individually purchased, or not included in the suite is protected by a single license & and not part of a implied license. * A person who posts a lengthy comment to an internet forum may claim copyright to that post. However, if posters in that forum commonly copy the entire text to which they are responding into a later post, the original poster will be deemed to have given an implied license for his text to be copied into the later post. * In a non-IP context, a person who holds a party on their house gives all of the invited guests an implied license to enter their property, and to enter those parts of the property that would usually be made available to guests, such as the bathrooms. * In patent law, where an employee invents something while on company time, the employer receives an implied license to use the invention, even if no contract exists to assign rights to the employer. This is sometimes referred to as shop right.United States v. Dubilier Condenser Corp., 289 U.S. 178 (1933); Lariscey v. United States, 949 F.2d 1137 (Fed. Cir. 1991). In copyright law, the work for hire provision would grant the employer copyright to the work, provided the invention is within the employee's job description.Section 101, Copyright Act of 1976 (USC 17 ¬ß101) * In 2008, the Ninth US Circuit held that a non- exclusive license to use copyrighted material can be granted by implied license, but not an exclusive license. Further, if the creator has received consideration for the work, the non-exclusive grant is irrevocable.Asset Marketing Systems, Inc. v. Gagnon, 542 F.3d 748 (9th Cir. 2008) * Where a copyrighted work has been commissioned, the law in the United Kingdom is that the creator retains rights in the commissioned work. Unauthorised use of the work would therefore infringe the creator's copyright. Nevertheless, the commissioner may have an implied license to use the commissioned work, although only for the particular purpose under which the commission was originally agreed.Blair v Osborn and Tomkins [1971] 2 WLR 503David Bainbridge, Intellectual Property, 1999 (4th ed.), pp.84-85 * A U.S. court has ruled in Jan 19th 2006 that Web caching does not constitute a copyright violation, because of fair use and an implied license. Was the \\"Field vs Google, US District Court, District of Nevada, CV-S-04-0413-RCJ-LRL\\". In that context implied license refers to a de facto standard: if the copyright holder does not use any no-archive tags and robot exclusion standards to prevent caching. * A Holocaust-victims who created and concealed materials documenting war atrocities gave implied consent for the distribution of such copyrighted material, and often amounts to fulfillment of their explicit wishes. In such cases following the letter of US copyright law, which protects unpublished anonymous works for 120 years since the year of their creation would go directly against their intentions. ==Implication: from surrounding circumstances or by operation of law?== In the United States, implied licenses are usually considered to be of two kinds: either they reflect the intention of the parties, which is inferred from a fact-specific inquiry into the surrounding circumstances, or else they are constructive agreements, in which case the intention of the parties is likely to be immaterial. In reality, there is a continuum between these kinds of implied license and it may be difficult to determine whether the license or contract in question is one which the law implies, irrespective of any protests by the unwilling licensor, or instead one inferred from the whole pattern of factual circumstances including the evidence of intent. In England, there is more of a tendency to regard all implied licenses as matters of fact and intent, while what would be a license implied by law in the US is treated under some other branch of substantive law such as the doctrine of non-derogation from grants.An illustrative case is British Leyland Motor Corp. v. Armstrong Patents Co., [1986] A.C. 577, [1986] All E.R. 850 (H.L.). The opinion by Lord Templeman in that case pointed out that an implied license might be negatived by express language, under principles of freedom of contract, but that was not so when non-derogation instead is involved: ‚ÄúThe right cannot be withheld by the manufacturer of the car by contract with the first purchaser and cannot be withheld from any subsequent owner.‚Äù That is, the nature of property makes the right inherent and not a matter of freedom of contract. It is thus seen that the effect is comparable to the US license that is implied by operation of law. In both countries, the exhaustion doctrine has the effect of creating an implied license to use a product sold under the \\"authority\\" of the patentee. It is controversial whether and to what extent contractual expedients can successfully limit the scope of such implied licenses. ==Express license== The opposite of an implied license is an express license, which, for some forms of intellectual property, must be in writing. Oral exclusive licenses were permitted, however, under US copyright law before 1978.See Davis v. Blige, 505 F.3d 90, 108 (2d Cir. 2007). Oral nonexclusive copyright licenses remain valid under US law.See Vincent v. City Colleges of Chicago, 485 F.3d 919, 922 (7th Cir. 2007); Bateman v. Mnemonics, Inc., 79 F.3d 1532, 1538 n.12 (11th Cir. 1996). Patent licenses may be oral.Waymark Corp. v. Porta Systems Corp., 334 F.3d 1358, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2003); Enzo APA & Son v. Geapag A.G., 134 F.3d 1090, 1093 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Licenses under the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act must be in writing. Section 903(b) of the Act, 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 903(b), provides: \\"The owner of the exclusive rights in a mask work may transfer all of those rights, or license all or less than all of those rights, by any written instrument signed by such owner or a duly authorized agent of the owner.\\" ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Kenneth L.

He studied at the University of Oxford, matriculating from Jesus College in 1628 but graduating from Oriel College in 1630, becoming a fellow of Oriel, where he was a tutor for many years, in 1631. During the English Civil War, he was arrested in September 1642 for uttering Royalist views when the Parliamentarian Lord Lieutenant of Oxfordshire visited Oxford. In 1644, he was appointed prebend of Ampleforth by John Williams, the Archbishop of York, to whom Lloyd was chaplain, but the advance of the Scottish army prevented his installation at that time. Three years later, in 1647, the House of Lords ordered that he be installed as vicar of Ruabon on taking the National League and Covenant, but he would appear not to have stayed in post for long, if indeed he in fact was installed at this time. However, following the Restoration, Lloyd returned to Ruabon and was also installed as prebend of Ampleforth. He was awarded his DD degree in 1661, when he also became vicar of Northop. He was appointed as Dean of St Asaph in 1663, resigning as vicar of Northop in 1664. In 1673, Lloyd was appointed Bishop of Bangor; in addition, he was permitted to be archdeacon of Bangor and of Anglesey, prebend of Ampleforth and vicar of Gresford (where he had recently succeeded his brother after leaving Ruabon). He was enthroned on 5 January 1674, by proxy. As bishop, he was hostile to dissent and to presbyterian missionaries. He died on 18 January 1689, and was buried in Bangor Cathedral. ==References== Category:1610 births Category:1689 deaths Category:Welsh bishops Category:Bishops of Bangor Category:Welsh subscribers to the Solemn League and Covenant 1643 Category:Alumni of Jesus College, Oxford Category:Alumni of Oriel College, Oxford Category:Fellows of Oriel College, Oxford Category:Deans of St Asaph Category:17th-century Anglican bishops ","title":"Humphrey Lloyd (bishop)"},{"id":"20218484","text":"Homer Se (born May 5, 1977 Albay, Bicol, Philippines) is a former Filipino professional basketball player of the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA). ==Player profile== Se is a tough, physical, and aggressive player who never backs down.

According to the chief, the curse of the valley was its breathtaking landscape.OUR PEOPLE: Southern Arapahos Are Part of Boulder's Spirit, by Judy Mattivi Morley, Ph.D. (Originally appeared in Boulder Magazine, 2005.) Now at: Niwot was the leader of the Southern Arapaho. The visitors were encamped at what the Arapaho considered to be a sacred site, Valmont Butte, some four miles to the north east of what is now central Boulder, Colorado. Niwot and his closest elder braves, Bear Head and Many Whips, rode out to the site where the new arrivals had decided to camp, near the place where Boulder Creek releases from the Front Range onto the Great Plains. Some see the Curse as portentous of the settling of not only the Boulder Valley, but of the entire Western United States. == Europeans come to Boulder Valley == In fall 1858, led by Captain Thomas Aikins, a group of gold prospectors, part of the Colorado Gold Rush, came from Fort St. Vrain, 30 miles east. As they made camp at the site where Boulder Creek rushes down from Nederland to meet Sunshine Creek and flow onto the Great Plains, Niwot and his braves met them. They had ridden from Valmont Butte to greet them in peace, and to admonish them to leave. Chief Niwot, it is said, as eloquent and capable as he was with the English language learned from his brother-in-law, his sister's husband, the trapper John Poisal, told the European erstwhile settlers the area was cursed. He is said to have told them the Curse of Boulder Valley is: \\"People seeing the beauty of this valley will want to stay, and their staying will be the undoing of the beauty.\\" As the conversation heightened, he proceeded to threaten them with a visitation by War Party if they did not leave. ==Battle looms and a dream brings initial peace== Aikins and his men refused to leave and prepared to do battle against the Arapaho. At some point, Bear Head and Many Whips headed back to the Arapaho encampment to raise a War Party while the Chief lingered. While they were away, Aikins and his group took steps to avoid hostilities by focusing personal attention on Chief Niwot, plying him with canned beans and salt pork, and getting him drunk. As a result, when Bear Head and Many Whips and the War Party returned, Niwot was advocating peace with the gold seeking Caucasians, yet tension reigned. After three tense days, the threat of battle remained in the air. Then, abruptly, Niwot rode into Aikins‚Äô camp once more. He had come to tell them one of his Arapaho shamans had received a dream from the Great Spirit the night before. In the dream, a flood covered the earth and swallowed the Arapaho people, while the whites survived. Niwot interpreted this to mean that gold seekers would flood his homeland, and he could do nothing to stop it. Peace with the whites, Niwot realized, was the only way his people would avoid being swept away by the flood. Starting then, Niwot and his fellow chief Little Raven, who had recently welcomed white settlers to the Denver gold camps, maintained their stance of peaceful coexistence with the newly arrived Europeans, at least for the time being. He was killed shortly thereafter in the notorious Sand Creek massacre. ==References== Category:Pre-statehood history of Colorado Category:Curses ","title":"Curse of the Boulder Valley"},{"id":"20218512","text":"Rifled mountain cannon \\"Canon de montagne de 4 mod√®le 1859 Le P√©tulant\\".

Count Antoine Hector Th√©s√©e Treuille de Beaulieu (7 May 1809 ‚Äì 24 July 1885) was a French General of the 19th century, who developed the concept of rifled guns in the French Army.A Dictionary of Military History and the Art of War by Andr√© Corvisier, p.44 He studied the subject of rifling between 1840, particularly in the famous Manufacture d'armes de Ch√¢tellerault, and 1852.Journal By Royal Society of Arts (Great Britain), p.617 Following a request by Napoleon III in 1854 to develop such a weapon, the de Beaulieu system was adopted by the French Army. It consisted in cutting six grooves inside the bore of a muzzle-loading cannon, and to use shells equipped with six lugs which would engage the grooves.A Dictionary of Military History and the Art of War by Andr√© Corvisier, p.45 This development was paralleled by that of the Armstrong gun in Great Britain (adopted in 1858 by the British Army). These developments led to the introduction of the La Hitte system in 1858, a fully integrated system of muzzle-loading rifled guns. The Beaulieu 4-pounder rifled field-gun was adopted by the French Army in 1858, where it replaced the canon-obusier de 12, a smoothbore cannon using shells which was much less accurate and shorter-ranged.\\"...the introduction by the French army of the Beaulieu 4-pounder rifled field-gun in 1858: the new artillery, though much more accurate and long-ranged than the smoothbore 'canon-obusier' it replaced (which, incidentally, was the most prevalent artillery piece of the US Civil War), was not suited to firing anti-personnel case-shot (which, in French, is called 'mitraille').\\" in The Mitrailleuse by Dr. Patrick Marder Military History Online The Beaulieu rifled artillery was first used in Algeria, and then in the Franco-Austrian War in Italy in 1859.\\"Beaulieu rifled artillery was first tentatively used in Algeria but received great acclaim only during the Italian War of 1859.\\" in The Bloody Crucible of Courage by Brent Nosworthy p.644 ==Notes== Category:√âcole Polytechnique alumni Category:French generals Category:1809 births Category:1885 deaths Category:People from Lun√©ville ","title":"Antoine Treuille de Beaulieu"},{"id":"20218514","text":"Marvin Lu Cruz (born December 31, 1985) is a Filipino free agent professional basketball player who lastly played for the GlobalPort Batang Pier of the Philippine Basketball Association.

It is adjacent to Dobongsan. It is run in conjunction with Shin Heung University. The incumbent chairman is Park Jeong-jin, and the ex-chairman of the school is a Korean representative Kang Sung-Jong, of the Democratic Party of South Korea. However, due to an embezzlement scandal involving the former chairman of the school, who channeled approximately 3.6 billion Korean Won of tuition to his personal use, the school's reputation plummeted and its budget was crippled. Several teachers have also complained implicitly that they have not been compensated for their work a number of years ago. Reports say that the teacher situation in regards to pay was resolved around 2007. A sizeable portion of the parents and the students left Indianhead International School, with some headed to Korean public schools while others, to other international schools in Korea. During the academic year of 2010‚Äì11, Chairman Park Jeong- Jin, a relative of Rep. Kang Sung-Jong, declared that the school will move to Jeju Island and double the tuition fee; the Parent-Teacher Association responded with dissent both within and against the chairman and many parents have said that they will leave to other educational institutions. Although the consensus of the Parent-Teacher Association was that the school should continue to operate, many members in the PTA disagreed on the means by which the school should be restored to its normal function. Most recently, Indianhead International School declined the opportunity to continue administering the SATs as they no longer have the personnel to staff the events. Since an international school is required to replace Indianhead International School as an SAT test center, the International Christian School in Uijeongbu was assigned as the new testing center in the region. It is estimated that, due to lack of families contributing their tuition fees, the Indianhead International School will cease to function after the graduating class of 2012 or 2013. ==See also== *List of International Schools Category:International schools in South Korea ","title":"Indianhead International School"},{"id":"20218584","text":"Ernesto Billiones or better known as Egay Billiones is a Filipino Professional basketball player who plays for the Muntinlupa Cagers of the Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League.

There are health risks associated both with pregnancies placed closely together and those placed far apart, but the majority of health risks are associated with births that occur too close together. The WHO recommends 24 months between pregnancies. A shorter interval may be appropriate if the pregnancy ended in abortion or miscarriage, typically 6 months. If the mother has had a prior C-section, it is advisable to wait before giving birth again due to the risk of uterine rupture in the mother during childbirth, with recommendations of a minimum inter-delivery interval ranging from a year to three years. Pregnancy intervals longer than 5 years are associated with an increased risk of pre- eclampsia. The global public health burden of short inter-pregnancy intervals is substantial. Family planning can help increase inter-pregnancy interval. == Factors influencing birth spacing == Contraceptives, such as the birth control pill, can help increase inter-pregnancy interval, if desired. Breastfeeding can increase time between births. Family planning, such as the use of contraceptives can increase inter-pregnancy interval. Breastfeeding and extended breastfeeding can also increase birth spacing due to lactational amenorrhea. Cultural and religious attitudes towards both sex and the use of contraceptives, price and availability of health care, and poverty are all factors which can decrease inter-pregnancy intervals. == Health risks ==  Short inter-pregnancy interval  Short inter-pregnancy interval is associated with an increase in maternal mortality, stillbirth, and child mortality. Inter-pregnancy interval of lower than 18 months is associated with an increased risk of pre-term birth. Short inter-pregnancy interval after a prior C-section can be a contraindication for having a vaginal birth after a prior C-section (VBAC). In one study inter-pregnancy intervals shorter than 6 months were associated with 2-3 times increased risk of uterine rupture, major morbidity, and blood transfusion during vaginal delivery in mothers with at least one prior C-section. Complications of a short inter-pregnancy interval are lower after an abortion or miscarriage compared to a full-term pregnancy.  Long inter-pregnancy interval  An inter-pregnancy interval of greater than 5 years is associated in an increased risk of pre-eclampsia. == Public health == The global public health burden of short inter-pregnancy intervals is substantial. In developing countries, children born two years or earlier after an older sibling were at a 60% increased risk of death in infancy, while those born between two and three years had a 10% increase, compared with those born after intervals of four to five years. Various organisations, including the World Health Organization have identified birth spacing as an important area of public health intervention. == In primitive societies == Birth intervals have been found to be higher in traditional hunter-gatherer societies. The median birth interval of the Gainj people of the New Guinea Highlands has been reported as 3.6 years (43 months), and that of the !Kung people of Africa as 3.7 years (44 months). == In other animals == The inter- birth intervals in wild apes are reported to be significantly longer than those in humans, with median birth intervals at 3.8 years for gorillas, 5.6 years for chimpanzees and 7.7 years for orangutans. == See also == * Weaning == References == Category:Childbirth Category:Human pregnancy Category:Public health ","title":"Birth spacing"},{"id":"20218616","text":"Pocholo I√±igo Villanueva (born November 24, 1982) is a Filipino former professional basketball player.

From 2001‚Äì2007, he played for the De La Salle Green Archers in the UAAP where he won a championship in 2007 and was named co-Finals MVP with JVee Casio. Barangay Ginebra traded Paul Artadi, Rafi Reavis, and the rights to 2009 8th pick overall Chris Timberlake for Enrico Villanueva, Rich Alvarez, Celino Cruz, and Paolo Bugia of Purefoods. Burger King acted as the conduit team, trading Cholo Villanueva to Ginebra and acquiring the rights to 2009 Rookie draft eighteenth pick Orlando Daroya and future picks. However, he chose to retire and pursue a career in coaching and was part of Franz Pumaren staff in De La Salle University in the UAAP. On 2011, Cholo joined his former DLSU Coach, Franz Pumaren as the Assistant Coach in then, newly formed PBA team, Shopinas. This team was renamed later on to be Air21. Coach Cholo stayed on with the team as Assistant Coach and Team Manager until the team was bought by NLEX Road Warriors in July 2014. In March 2014, Coach Cholo was also asked to join the Coaching Staff of JRU (Jose Rizal College) under Vergel Meneses' leadership. He has helped them get into the Final Four of the NCAA once again.

Tate, in turn, created an advisory panel of \\"Fellows in American Letters,\\" which, over the course of the next few years, would include most of the pillars of English modernist literature. Among them were T. S. Eliot, W. H. Auden, Mark Van Doren, Van Wyck Brooks, Carl Sandburg, Willard Thorp, Ted Spencer, Conrad Aiken, and Karl Shapiro. Virtually all of the Fellows were friends of Tate, several of them his prot√©g√©s. In 1944, MacLeish stepped down as Librarian and Tate's term expired. MacLeish's successor, non-poet Luther H. Evans (1945‚Äì1953), relied on Tate to serve as an ongoing consultant and recommend candidates to fill the Poetry Consultant position. Among those Tate recommended to become Consultant were his old friend and colleague Robert Penn Warren (1944‚Äì1945), Louise Bogan (1945‚Äì1946), Shapiro (1946‚Äì1947), Robert Lowell (1947‚Äì1948), L√©onie Adams (1948‚Äì1949), Elizabeth Bishop (1949‚Äì1950), and Aiken (1950‚Äì1952). Most Consultants accepted invitations to become Fellows when their terms expired. The Fellows may be best known for the controversy created in 1948-1949 over the newly established Bollingen Prize which was to be awarded by the Library of Congress upon the recommendation of a jury consisting of a committee of the Fellows. Eliot and other renowned poets who felt a great debt to Ezra Pound planned to use the prize to build a momentum to free Pound, then confined in St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, where he had been confined after being charged with treason but declared mentally unfit to stand trial. Pound was awarded the prize for The Pisan Cantos in 1949, despite objections by juror Shapiro (who had originally favored the award but then withdrew his vote) over the anti-Semitic nature of many parts the work Pound began while incarcerated in an American military prison in Pisa. A firestorm followed, dividing the literary establishment. And the public outcry over the involvement of a public institution (the Library of Congress) in bestowing an award on a fascist sympathizer led Congress to end the Library's participation in the prize, which was subsequently awarded by the Yale University Library. The following year (1950), Yale awarded the prize to the thoroughly non-controversial Wallace Stevens. == External links == * The Library of Congress website Category:American literary awards Category:Library of Congress ","title":"Fellows in American Letters of the Library of Congress"},{"id":"20218645","text":"Jalwa Four 2 Ka 1 is an Indian television reality dance show produced by Bonnie Jain Productions.

He played for eight teams in the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA), most recently for the Phoenix Pulse Fuel Masters. ==Player achievements== Career high Kramer set a career-high 19 rebounds along with 3 blocks and 16 points in Ateneo's 98‚Äì88 win over University of the Philippines on August 20, 2006. He also made the famous Game 1 winning shot of the Ateneo vs. UST championship on Sept. 22, 2006. His team won game 1 and ended up losing Games 2 and 3 to eventual champions, UST. Kramer set a career high in rebounding twice while still with Air21 on his last 2 of 3 games with them before Rain or Shine traded for him. He had 16 points and 17 rebounds in 23 minutes against his former team, Ginebra on June 20, 2010. Then had 17 points and 17 rebounds in 33 minutes against Rain or Shine on July 4, 2010. He then set his career high in points on his first game with Rain or Shine on Oct. 6, 2010 with 19 points. On his 2nd conference with Rain or Shine, only behind import Hassan Adams, Kramer led his team both in scoring and rebounding among all locals at the end of eliminations on April 6, 2011 of the 2010‚Äì11 PBA Commissioners Cup. He averaged 9.56ppg and 7.67rpg in only 23.33 minutes per game. This would serve as his best conference averages in his PBA career. After being traded to the Powerade Tigers from his former team Rain or Shine, Kramer at his 8th game as a Tiger, finally eclipsed his personal rebounding best of 17, to 20 rebounds against the Talk and Text Tropang Texters on Nov. 9, 2011. Although his team lost during that outing, it was his all-time career best in rebounding since playing college, amateur, and professional basketball. During the 2011-2012 PBA Philippine Cup 14-game Eliminations with the Powerade Tigers, Kramer registered a career best 9 double doubles (which included 6 straight double doubles), with conference highs of 18 points against Petron and career best 20 rebounds against Talk and Text. His 9 double doubles is 2nd most for the conference and is only behind Arwind Santos, who registered 11 double doubles. He averaged a double double during that All- Filipino conference with 11.64 points/game and 10.57 rebounds/game in 30.79 minutes/contest, all of which were career highs in averages. He was also 6th best in the league in 2-point field goal percentage with .516%. Kramer was 3rd best in the league in Rebounding with his 10.57 rebounds/game and was 2nd best in total rebounds hauled down with 148. Kramer was the number 3 top scorer for the Powerade Tigers and number 1 rebounder for his team during that conference. During the whole 2011‚Äì12 Philippine Cup 14-game eliminations, there were only 4 players who averaged double doubles. Arwind Santos, Harvey Carey, Jay R Reyes and Doug Kramer. Rounding of the 2011‚Äì12 PBA Philippine Cup, Doug Kramer played 28 games for the Powerade team all the way to Game 5 of the Finals against the eventual champion team, Talk and Text, which beat them 4‚Äì1 in the series. Doug Kramer registered his all-time career best in rebounds during that series, where he hauled down 23 boards during Game 3 of the Philippine Cup finals on Jan. 12, 2012. He would register a league best 18 double doubles during that conference and would also lead the league in total rebounds hauled down with 303, No. 1 in total offensive rebounds with 101, No. 1 in total defensive rebounds with 202, and would get a league 2nd best average with 10.82 rebounds/game for the 28 games that Powerade played. He also averaged a career best 11.32 points/game, to average a double double throughout the whole 2011‚Äì12 Philippine Cup Conference. Doug Kramer would eventually get traded on May 4, 2012 to the Barako Energy Cola team after playing 2 conferences with Powerade. He would get traded for Jondan Salvador and a 2nd round pick. It was the 2nd big trade for the Powerade team as rumors were swirling that they would trade their marquee players before selling their franchise to a new company. With four months left in his PBA contract, Barako signed him with a contract extension of three more years, which was rumored to be above 12 million pesos. Doug would play his first game as a Barako Bull player on May 25, 2012. He would eventually finish the 2011‚Äì12 PBA Season on a high note as he would end up having the 2nd best rebounding average of 8.77 on 48 games played, only behind Arwind Santos' 10.67. He would also end up with 279 total defensive rebounds for 2nd most in the league, 142 total offensive rebounds for 3rd most in league, and 3rd most in total rebounds with 421. He would also average a career best 9.54 points/game. And have the 2nd most double doubles for the season with 22. He capped off his career best season with nominations from the Most Improved Player award (his 2nd straight nomination) and Mythical 5 All-Defensive team. He would end up bagging the trophy for being part of the All-Defensive team for the 1st time in his career. During the 2012‚Äì13 Philippine Cup conference 14-game eliminations, Doug was 2nd best in the rebounding average with 10.43 rebounds/game. He would also have an impressive run of rebounding in Barakos last 3 of 4 games before getting eliminated. He got 21 rebounds against Petron on Nov. 24, 2012; 18 rebounds against Meralco on Nov. 30; and 22 rebounds against Ginebra on Dec 2, to average 20.3 rebounds/game for the 3 games. ==Personal life== Kramer is married to Filipina actress Cheska Garcia. They have three children together: Clair Kendra, Scarlett Louvelle and Gavin Phoenix. Kramer has six siblings: older brothers Lincoln and Mark, who currently live in California, younger sister Stacey who lives in London, and siblings Lauren, Karl Lewis and Brandy, who reside in the Philippines. They are the children of John Noel Kramer and Nellie Rimorin Kramer. ==PBA career statistics== Correct as of September 14, 2016http://www.pba-online.net/profile/Doug-Kramer/34/ Season-by-season averages -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Air21  49  12.4  .433  .200  .781  3.5  .4  .1  .1  3.7 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Air21 / Barangay Ginebra  27  13.0  .453  .200  .654  3.1  .4  .1  .3  3.8 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Barangay Ginebra / Air21  19  12.0  .500  .000  .686  4.3  .2  .1  .3  5.0 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Rain or Shine  35  20.1  .448  .000  .680  6.7  .5  .1  .2  7.4 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Powerade  48  26.6  .496  .500  .658  8.8  .9  .2  .2  9.5 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Barako Bull / Petron  48  17.8  .436  .000  .771  5.9  .4  .2  .1  4.5 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Petron  42  16.3  .527  .000  .609  5.0  .3  .1  .1  5.1 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  San Miguel  16  22.1  .520  1.000  .710  6.1  .5  .1  .1  6.2 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  GlobalPort  38  17.7  .484  .000  .704  6.2  .4  .2  .1  5.0 -class=sortbottom  align=\\"center\\" colspan=2  Career  322  17.7  .473  .267  .685  5.6  .5  .1  .1  5.6 ==References *Profile at pba.ph Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Ateneo de Manila University alumni Category:Barako Bull Energy players Category:Barangay Ginebra San Miguel players Category:Basketball players from Benguet Category:Centers (basketball) Category:Filipino men's basketball players Category:Filipino people of German descent Category:NorthPort Batang Pier players Category:Ilocano people Category:Phoenix Super LPG Fuel Masters players Category:Powerade Tigers players Category:Power forwards (basketball) Category:Rain or Shine Elasto Painters players Category:San Miguel Beermen players Category:Sportspeople from Baguio Category:Ateneo Blue Eagles men's basketball players ","title":"Doug Kramer"},{"id":"20218705","text":"1964 Operation Chrome Dome Map from Sheppard Air Force Base, TX 1966 overview of Operation Chrome Dome related or derivative flights Operation Chrome Dome was a United States Air Force Cold-War era mission from 1960 to 1968 in which B-52 Stratofortress strategic bomber aircraft armed with thermonuclear weapons remained on continuous airborne alert, flying routes to points on the Soviet Union border. == Background == During the Cold War, General Thomas S. Power initiated a program whereby B-52s performed airborne alert duty under code names such as Head Start, Chrome Dome, Hard Head, Round Robin, and Operation Giant Lance. Bombers loitered near points outside the Soviet Union to provide rapid first strike or retaliation capability in case of nuclear war.US Nuclear Weapons Deployments Disclosed , Nautilus Institute History of the Custody and Deployment of Nuclear Weapons: July 1945 to September 1977 == Primary mission == The missions in 1964 involved a B-52D that left Sheppard Air Force Base, Texas and flew across the United States to New England and headed out to the Atlantic Ocean. The aircraft refueled over the Atlantic heading north to and around Newfoundland. The bomber changed course and flew northwesterly over Baffin Bay towards Thule Air Base, Greenland. At this point it flew west across Queen Elizabeth Islands of Canada. Continuing to Alaska, it refueled over the Pacific Ocean again heading south-east and returned to Sheppard AFB. By 1966, three separate missions were being flown - one East over the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, another north to Baffin Bay, and a third over Alaska. ==Military units== The following military units were involved: * Strategic Air Command Divisions: ** 306th Bombardment Wing ** 494th Bombardment Wing, Sheppard Air Force Base ** 821st Strategic Aerospace Division ** 822d Air Division * Homestead Air Force Base * Strategic Air Command in the United Kingdom * 2nd Bomb Wing, 62nd Bomb Squadron Barksdale AFB, Bossier City, LA * Strategic Air Command 42 Bomb Wing Loring AFB, Limestone, Maine * 4126/456th bomb wing Beale AFB Marysville California ==Accidents== Homestead AFB, FL to Italy The program was involved in the following nuclear-weapons accidents: * 1961 Goldsboro B-52 crashThe Goldsboro Broken Arrow, 2011, * 1961 Yuba City B-52 crash * 1964 Savage Mountain B-52 crashAccident happened while the aircraft was returning to its home base, having already completed its alert mission. * 1966 Palomares B-52 crash * 1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash.

The Parajet SkyCar is a roadable aircraft (or PAV), now in production, developed by British paramotor manufacturer Parajet, a subsidiary of Gilo Industries. It utilises a paramotor and a Paramania ParaWing (a parafoil) attached to a roadworthy vehicle to achieve sustained level flight. Should the engine fail, the vehicle can glide back to the ground. In the event of catastrophic wing failure, car connection system failure or mid-air collision, an emergency ballistic reserve parachute would be deployed. It requires three minutes to convert it from a car to an aircraft. The prototype model runs on biodiesel and is fully road-legal. ==Skycar Expedition 2009== An expedition team led by Neil Laughton set out on 15 January 2009 to fly and drive the SkyCar from London to Timbuktu. After the Civil Aviation Authority failed to grant permits in time due to confusion over how to categorise the SkyCar, the team decided to start flying the SkyCar from northern France,, however, this was also not possible without permission from the CAA and the skycar was driven to southern Spain. Neil Laughton managed to fly across the Straits of Gibraltar damaging the car on landing in Morocco. After repairs, the car was driven to Mauritania where the team made a couple of short flights. Although the car was designed for two people, it never flew successfully with more than a driver / pilot. The flying portion of the expedition eventually ended when inventor Gilo Cardozo crashed into a tree in the sparsely vegetated desert while attempting to take-off for a third flight. The team deemed the expedition successfully completed on 25 February 2009 and returned the Skycar to Wiltshire, England. Parajet is taking deposits for the public to purchase the production version of the vehicle for ¬£50,000 each.

Fronted by guitarist/painter/sculptor Peter L. Baker and keyboardist B.A.L. Stack, the earliest Stick Men lineup formed in 1977 and went through various member changes before settling on the group that would tour and record together in the early 1980s, featuring Chuck Mattern Jr. on vocals, saxophone, trumpet and electronics, Bill Bradfield on bass guitar, and Jim Meneses on drums/percussion. In 1982 the band released their debut LP This is the Master Brew, followed by the EP Get on Board the Stick Men in 1983. ==History== Peter L. Baker returned to Philadelphia after graduating from the Columbus College of Art and Design in 1977. In addition to working in the fields of avant-garde visual and performance art, Baker formed a musical group, The Undertakers of Love, with synthesizer work by Charles Cohen, keyboard from Jeff Cain, the bass playing of Art Noel, and poet J.W. McCullough joining Baker on guitars. The group performed in local bars before Baker met Beth \\"B.A.L.\\" Stack in 1978. Baker and Stack played as the hollow-body guitar duo Blu Beth and the Gentleman Caller in Philadelphia's art gallery scene. Baker's two groups eventually merged with his performance art to form the Stick Men, shedding some members and by 1980 had enlisted George Shirley on drums, Michael McGettigan on the drum kit and bass, and Charles Mattern Jr. on trumpet, sax, and homemade drum devices. This new group entered Philly's punk rock scene and played gigs with The Contortions and Johnny Thunders, among others. For a time, Powelton Village\`s bassist Lance Walker, who'd worked with Patti LaBelle and Buff, introduced a true touch of funk to the band. Pete, Beth, Michael and Lance recorded a demo and worked New York City\`s punk scene. In 1981 Shirley was replaced by funk bassist Billy Bradfield, and McGettigan was swapped for percussionist Jim Meneses, forming the group's characteristic sound that mixed danceable disco and funk rhythms with less predictable art rock time changes and frenetic punk energy that draws comparisons to James Chance and the Contortions and The Minutemen. The Stick Men gained wider notoriety with the release of their debut 1982 album and opened for many famous musical acts including Gang of Four, The Slits, Lords of the New Church, Oingo Boingo, The Psychedelic Furs, Bush Tetras, The Pop Group, Nina Hagen and Wall of Voodoo. After extensive touring in the northeast U.S., one tour to the Midwest and the release of their second record, the Stick Men disbanded. ==Aftermath== Peter L. Baker died in 1994 and a retrospective of the Stick Men's recordings was released in 2001 on the now defunct Cuneiform Records. The CD, titled Insatiable, contains the entire Stick Men recorded output as well as songs from live radio broadcasts and a 20-minute live video of the band. The reissue did not include the songs \\"Charmed\\" and \\"Kreskin Eye\\" as well as a combined dub remix of \\"Mystery Party\\" and \\"Personality Pollination\\" titled \\"The Flame Breathers Meet Wax Gumby in Iceland\\" from a 7\\" that was included with \\"This Is The Master Brew\\" that featured drummer \\"Disco\\" Fred Abrams instead of Meneses.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4crq616SxRohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQWvk7tQRrohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC1mmA_4kYA Percussionist Jim Meneses and bassist Bill Bradfield are the only members reputed to be musically active.

The Polish capital at the time was in Krak√≥w, where scholars, artists and merchants from Western Europe had already been present. Other cities which were part of the Polish kingdom followed later. Cities of northern Polish province of Royal Prussia, like the Hanseatic League city of Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk), had established printing houses early on. The first printing shop was possibly opened in Krak√≥w by Augsburg-based G√ºnther Zainer in 1465. In 1491, Schweipolt Fiol printed the first book in Cyrillic script. The next recorded printing shop was a Dutch one known by the name Typographus Sermonum Papae Leonis I. that might have been established in 1473 on Polish territory, but its exact location has yet to be determined.Wieslaw Wydra, \\"Die ersten in polnischer Sprache gedruckten Texte, 1475‚Äì1520\\", Gutenberg-Jahrbuch, Vol. 62 (1987), pp.88‚Äì94 (88) The oldest known print from Poland is considered to be the Almanach cracoviense ad annum 1474 (Cracovian Almanac for the Year 1474) which is a single-sheet astronomical wall calendar for the year 1474 printed and published in 1473 by Kasper Straube. The only surviving copy of Almanach cracoviense measures 37 cm by 26.2 cm, and is in the collections of the Jagiellonian University. The first text in Polish language was printed in Breslau (Wroc≈Çaw) in 1475. The first book printed in Polish was Historyja umƒôczenia Pana naszego Jezusa Chrystusa, published in 1508 by Johann Haller's publishing house.. For a long time, the first print written in Polish language was believed to be Hortulus Animae polonice, a Polish version of Hortulus Animae written by Biernat of Lublin, printed and published in 1513 by Florian Ungler in Krak√≥w. The last known copy was lost during World War II. One of the first commercial printers in Poland is considered to be Johann Haller who worked in Krak√≥w in the early 16th century (since 1505) who in 1509 printed Nicolaus Copernicus Theophilacti Scolastici Simocatti Epistole morales, rurales at amatoriae, interpretatione latina. Other well known early printers in Poland are: * Hieronymus Vietor from Silesia who worked in Vienna and Krak√≥w * Printers from the Scharffenberg family, * Florian Ungler In the late 16th century there were 7 printing shops in Krak√≥w, and in 1610 10 printing shops. A decline started in around 1615. Due to this fact in 1650 there remained only 3 secular printing shops, accompanied by a few ecclesial ones. Only one printing shop is recorded in Warszawa in 1707, owned by the Piarists. This situation improved during the realm of the last Polish king, Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, that marked political and cultural revival in Poland. Unfortunately his attempts to reform the state led to the Partitions of Poland carried out by Prussia, Austria and Russia. ==See also== * Global spread of the printing press * History of printing * Book of Henryk√≥w * Almanach cracoviense ad annum 1474 * Kasper Straube * Johann Haller * Florian Ungler * ≈Åazarz Andrysowicz ==References * Category:Polish printers Printing Poland ","title":"History of printing in Poland"},{"id":"20218912","text":"This is a list of football matches played by the South Korea national football team between 1945 and 1949. ==1948== {  style=\\"font-size: 95%\\" !Date !Opponent !Result !Score !Venue !Competition - bgcolor=\\"#D3D3D3\\"  6 July 1948  Hong Kong‚ÄìChina XI  W  5‚Äì1  Hong Kong  Unofficial friendly - bgcolor=\\"#CCFFCC\\"  2 August 1948   W  5‚Äì3  London, Great Britain  1948 Summer Olympics - bgcolor=\\"#FFCCCC\\"  5 August 1948   L  0‚Äì12  London, Great Britain  1948 Summer Olympics } Source: ==1949== {  style=\\"font-size: 95%\\" !Date !Opponent !Result !Score !Venue !Competition - bgcolor=\\"#D3D3D3\\"  1 January 1949  Hong Kong League XI  W  5‚Äì2  Hong Kong  Unofficial friendly - bgcolor=\\"#D3D3D3\\"  2 January 1949  Hong Kong‚ÄìChina XI  L  2‚Äì3  Hong Kong  Unofficial friendly - bgcolor=\\"#D3D3D3\\"  4 January 1949  Hong Kong‚ÄìForeigners XI  L  2‚Äì3  Hong Kong  Unofficial friendly - bgcolor=\\"#D3D3D3\\"  9 January 1949  Hong Kong League XI  W  4‚Äì2  Hong Kong  Unofficial friendly - bgcolor=\\"#D3D3D3\\"  15 January 1949  Vietnam Reserves  W  4‚Äì2  Saigon, Vietnam  Unofficial friendly - bgcolor=\\"#FFFFCC\\"  16 January 1949   D  3‚Äì3  Saigon, Vietnam  Friendly - bgcolor=\\"#D3D3D3\\"  18 January 1949  French Military in Vietnam  W  5‚Äì0  Saigon, Vietnam  Unofficial friendly - bgcolor=\\"#CCFFCC\\"  25 January 1949   W  3‚Äì0  Macao  Friendly } Source: ==See also== * South Korea national football team results * South Korea national football team ==References== Category:1940s in South Korean sport 1940 ","title":"South Korea national football team results (1945‚Äì49)"},{"id":"20218937","text":"The Battle of Katole was a military engagement between forces of Portuguese Angola and the Kingdom of Matamba. The battle took place on 4 September 1681 at Katole in what is today Angola. It was one of the largest military engagements anywhere in the world during the 17th century. ==Prelude to Battle== The kingdom of Matamba, also known as the kingdom of Matamba and Ndongo, lay in what is today eastern Angola. It was created by the warrior queen Nzinga via her 1631 conquest of the kingdom from its BaKongo vassal. Throughout the mid-17th century, Queen Nzinga fought a guerilla war against the Portuguese colony of Angola to regain her throne and protect her people, the Mbundu, from the slave trade. By 1657, the queen had regained her traditional capital and ended the wars with Angola in her favor. After her death in 1663, the kingdom she fought so hard to establish devolved into civil war. The war did not end until 1680 when Francisco Guterres Ngola kannini, Njinga's nephew, defeated one of his aunt's former commanders and became king. ==Casus Belli== In 1681, King Francisco invaded the neighboring Imbangala kingdom of Kassanje to place his own candidate on the throne. While on campaign, he robbed the pombeiros, Afro-Portuguese slaving agents, and beheaded the kingdom's ruler. This angered the Portuguese, who had never been comfortable with an independent Matamba in the first place. The Portuguese immediately sent the victor of Mbwila, Lu√≠s Lopes de Sequeira, to crush the kingdom once and for all. ==The battle== On September 4, 1681, Sequeira arrived at Katole, which was but three days' march from the royal kabasa or palace. He came with over ten thousand infantry and even a small complement of horses (almost unheard of in Central African warfare). He was met by King Francisco's forces sometime before dawn that day. In the course of the fighting, both Sequeira and Francisco were killed. Matamba's forces retreated, and the Portuguese were able to claim at least a tactical victory by holding their position. ==Aftermath== Despite taking the field, which had never been an objective in the first place, the Portuguese losses were such that the invasion of Matamba's capital was called off. After encamping at Katole for nearly thirty days, the Portuguese and their African allies retired to Mbaka under the command of Jo√£o Ant√≥nio de Brito. ==See also== *History of Angola *Kingdom of Matamba *African military systems to 1800 ==ReferencesSources== * Katole 1681 Katole Katole Category:1681 in Africa Category:Conflicts in 1681 Category:Portuguese Angola ","title":"Battle of Katole"},{"id":"20218968","text":"Doreen Tess Waddell (10 July 1965 ‚Äì 1 March 2002), also known by her stage name Do'reen, was a singer who worked with Soul II Soul, The KLF and the Phunklawds. ==Music career== Soul II Soul Waddell sang lead vocals on Soul II Soul's \\"Feel Free\\" and \\"Happiness (Dub)\\", and backing vocals on other tracks, on the album Club Classics Vol. One.

They have been studied in combinatorial game theory as a generalization of Nim, Kayles, and similar games. Revised and reprinted as Revised and reprinted as Octal games are impartial meaning that every move available to one player is also available to the other player. They differ from each other in the numbers of tokens that may be removed in a single move, and (depending on this number) whether it is allowed to remove an entire heap, reduce the size of a heap, or split a heap into two heaps. These rule variations may be described compactly by a coding system using octal numerals. ==Game specification== An octal game is played with tokens divided into heaps. Two players take turns moving until no moves are possible. Every move consists of selecting just one of the heaps, and either * removing all of the tokens in the heap, leaving no heap, * removing some but not all of the tokens, leaving one smaller heap, or * removing some of the tokens and dividing the remaining tokens into two nonempty heaps. Heaps other than the selected heap remain unchanged. The last player to move wins in normal play. The game may also be played in mis√®re play, in which the last player to move loses. Games played with heaps in this fashion, in which the allowed moves for each heap are determined by the original heap's size, are called Taking and Breaking games in the literature. Octal games are a subset of the taking and breaking games in which the allowed moves are determined by the number of tokens removed from the heap. The octal code for a game is specified as :0 . d1 d2 d3 d4 ‚Ä¶, where the octal digit dn specifies whether the player is allowed to leave zero, one, or two heaps after removing n tokens from a heap. The digit dn is the sum of * 1 if leaving zero heaps is permitted, 0 otherwise; * 2 if leaving one heap is permitted, 0 otherwise; and * 4 if leaving two heaps is permitted, 0 otherwise. Zero tokens are not counted as a heap. Thus the digit dn is odd if a heap of n tokens may be removed entirely, and even otherwise. The specification of one-heap results in dn applies to removing n tokens from a heap of more than n. The two-heap results in dn apply to removing n tokens from a heap of at least n+2, and separating the remainder into two nonempty heaps. Octal games may allow splitting a heap into two parts without removing any tokens, by use of the digit 4 to the left of the decimal point. This is similar to the move in Grundy's game, which is to split a heap into two unequal parts. Standard octal game notation, however, does not have the power to express the constraint of unequal parts. Octal games with only a finite number of non-zero digits are called finite octal games. ==Particular octal games== Nim The most fundamental game in combinatorial game theory is Nim, in which any number of tokens may be removed from a heap, leaving zero or one heaps behind. The octal code for Nim is 0.333‚Ä¶, appearing in the published literature as :0.\\\\dot{3} , to signify the repeating part as in a repeating decimal. It is important to realize, however, that the repeating part does not play the same role as in octal fractions, in that the games :0.0\\\\dot{7} and :0.1 are not identical, despite their equality as octal fractions. Kayles The game Kayles is usually visualized as played with a row of n pins, but may be modeled by a heap of n counters. One is allowed to remove one or two tokens from a heap and arrange the remainder into zero, one, or two heaps. The octal code for Kayles is 0.77 . Dawson's Chess Dawson's Chess is a game arising from a chess puzzle posed by Thomas Rayner Dawson in Caissa's Wild Roses, 1938. The puzzle was posed as involving opposed rows of pawns separated by a single rank. Although the puzzle is not posed as an impartial game, the assumption that captures are mandatory implies that a player's moving in any file results only in the removal of that file and its neighbors (if any) from further consideration, with the opposite player to move. Modeling this as a heap of n tokens, a player may remove an entire heap of one, two, or three tokens, may reduce any heap by two or three tokens, or may split a heap into two parts after removing three tokens. Dawson's Chess is thus represented by the octal code 0.137. Dawson's Kayles In the game 0.07, called Dawson's Kayles, a move is to remove exactly two tokens from a heap and to distribute the remainder into zero, one, or two heaps. Dawson's Kayles is named for its (non- obvious) similarity to Dawson's Chess, in that Dawson's Kayles heap of n+1 tokens acts exactly like a Dawson's Chess heap of n tokens. Dawson's Kayles is said to be a first cousin of Dawson's Chess. ==Generalization to other bases== Octal games like Nim, in which every move transforms a heap into zero or one heaps, are called quaternary games because the only digits that appear are 0, 1, 2, and 3. The octal notation may also be extended to include hexadecimal games, in which digits permit division of a heap into three parts. In fact, arbitrarily large bases are possible. The analysis of quaternary, octal, and hexadecimal games show that these classes of games are markedly different from each other, and the behavior of larger bases has not received as much scrutiny. == Nim-sequence == The Sprague‚ÄìGrundy theorem implies that a heap of size n is equivalent to a nim heap of a given size, usually noted G(n). The analysis of an octal game then consists in finding the sequence of the nim- values for heaps of increasing size. This sequence G(0), G(1), G(2) ... is usually called the nim-sequence of the game. All finite octal games analyzed so far have shown a nim-sequence ultimately periodic, and whether all finite octal games are ultimately periodic is an open question. It is listed by Richard Guy as an important problem in the field of combinatorial games.Richard K. Guy, Unsolved problems in Combinatorial Games, Games of No Chance, 1996 == Computation records == A complete analysis of an octal game results in finding its period and preperiod of its nim-sequence. It is shown in Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays that only a finite number of values of the nim-sequence is needed to prove that a finite octal game is periodic, which opened the door to computations with computers. Octal games with at most 3 octal-digits have been analyzed through the years. There are 79 non-trivial octal games, among which 14 have been solved: * .156 by Jack Kenyon in 1967 * .356, .055, .644 and .165 by Richard Austin in 1976 * .16, .56, .127 and .376 by Anil Gangolli and Thane Plambeck in 1989 * .454, .104, .106, .054 and .354 by Achim Flammenkamp between 2000 and 2002Achim Flammenkamp, Octal games There remain 63 of these games, despite the computation of millions of nim-values by Achim Flammenkamp. ==References== Category:Combinatorial game theory Category:Mathematical games ","title":"Octal game"},{"id":"20219080","text":"Chuck Williams may refer to: *Chuck Williams (author) (1915‚Äì2015), American author, cook, and businessman (founder of Williams-Sonoma) *Chuck Williams (basketball) (born 1946), basketball player *Chuck Williams (American football), American football coach *Rockin' Rebel (Charles \\"Chuck\\" Williams, 1966‚Äì2018), professional wrestler ==See also== *Chuckie Williams (born 1953), American basketball player *Charles Williams (disambiguation) ","title":"Chuck Williams"},{"id":"20219113","text":"Thomas Ebbesen in 2010 Thomas Ebbesen (born 30 January 1954 in Oslo) is a franco-norwegian physical chemist and professor at the University of Strasbourg in France, known for his pioneering work in nanoscience.

For his pioneering and extensive contribution to the field of carbon nanotubes, he shared the 2001 Agilent Europhysics Prize with Sumio Iijima, Cees Dekker and Paul McEuen. While working at NEC, Ebbesen discovered a major new optical phenomenon. He found that, contrary to the then accepted theory, it was possible to transmit light extremely efficiently through subwavelength holes milled in opaque metal films under certain conditions.T.W. Ebbesen, H.J. Lezec, H.F. Ghaemi, T. Thio, and P.A. Wolff, Extraordinary optical transmission through sub-wavelength hole arrays. Nature 391, 667 (1998) The phenomenon, known as extraordinary optical transmission, involves surface plasmons. It has raised fundamental questions and is finding applications in broad variety of areas from chemistry to opto-electronics. Ebbesen has received several awards for the discovery of the extraordinary optical transmission such as the 2005 France Telecom Prize of the French Academy of Sciences and the 2009 Quantum Electronics and Optics Prize of the European Physical Society. His current research is focused on the physics and chemistry of light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. In 1999, Thomas Ebbesen joined ISISisis-ulp.org. founded by Jean-Marie Lehn at the University of Strasbourg, which he headed from 2004 to 2012. He is the director of the International Center for Frontier Research in Chemistry.icfrc.fr. and the University of Strasbourg Institute for Advanced Study.usias.fr. He is a member of the Institut Universitaire de France, the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, the French Academy of Science and the Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Sciences and the Arts.

Georg Kopprasch was a member of the Prussian Regiment band and by 1822 played second horn in the Royal Theater in Berlin. By 1832 Kopprasch had returned to Dessau and played second horn in the court orchestra, where he likely spent the remainder of his career. ==Horn Etudes== Active in the Berlin horn playing scene in the early 1800s, Kopprasch was acquainted with the inventor of the valved horn, Heinrich St√∂lzel. Because horns could not play chromatically prior to St√∂lzel's invention of valves, no chromatic etudes existed for the horn and it is likely Kopprasch composed his now seminal works to fill that need.Ericson, John. ‚ÄúThe Original Kopprasch Etudes‚Äù.

Growing up in Maden, Fethiye √áetin had no reason to suspect that she had other than Turkish Muslim roots, until her maternal grandmother, Seher, revealed to her that her real name was not Seher: she was by birth an Armenian Christian, named Heranu≈ü Gadaryan. Heranu≈ü was born to parents Hovannes and Isguhi Gadaryan, and was taken from her mother's arms during a death march in the course of the Armenian Genocide. This legacy inspired √áetin's first book, a memoir published in 2004 about her grandmother's story entitled My Grandmother: An Armenian Turkish Memoir.Lawyer and writer Fethiye √áetin: \\"My identity has never been purely Turkish\\" . The memoir follows Heranu≈ü through the eyes of her granddaughter, from memories of √áetin's childhood, to the horrendous events of the Armenian Genocide her grandmother revealed to her as an adult. √áetin discovered that all the men of Heranu≈ü' village had been slaughtered in 1915, and the women and children were forced into exile, walking for many miles with Turkish soldiers more than willing to pick off any stragglers. During this long march, Heranu≈ü was taken out of her mother's arms and adopted by a Turkish gendarme. It was from this adoption that √áetin's grandmother adopted the identity of Seher, the content, Muslim housewife that raised √áetin. Her grandmother's experiences launched a search for Heranu≈ü' family, who had escaped to New York.

B. bohemicus practices inquilinism, or brood parasitism, of other bumblebee species. B. bohemicus is a generalist parasite, successfully invading several species from genus Bombus. The invading queen mimics the host nest's chemical signals, allowing her to assume a reproductively dominant role as well as manipulation of host worker fertility and behavior. ==Taxonomy and phylogeny== thumb B. bohemicus is part of the order Hymenoptera, which includes ants, bees, wasps, and sawflies, the family Apidae, specific to bees, and the genus Bombus, which includes all bumblebees. B. bohemicus belongs to the subgenus Psithyrus, or the cuckoo bees, which includes 29 species found in Europe and the New World. Species in this subgenus are obligate parasites of other bumble bees. The females have lost their pollen-collecting corbiculae and their ability to rear their own brood. Cuckoo bees have also entirely eliminated the worker class, producing only reproductive males and females. This form of parasitism is known as inquilinism. Psithyrus was historically considered a separate genus from Bombus due to the significant biological and morphological differences associated with its parasitic life cycle. However, the majority of phylogenetic research in the last few decades has supported the recent conclusion that Psithyrus is a monophyletic group within Bombus. Morphology and phylogenetic analysis supports a close relationship with Bombus ashtoni from North America, suggesting a recent speciation event, or even that these bee species actually represent geographically separated populations of the same species. In Europe, they are often confused with Bombus vestalis, since both are parasitic and are found in the same region. B. bohemicus can hence be identified by its more intense colors and the fact that it is a generalist when choosing its host. == Description == Queens are around 15‚Äì20 mm in length with a round face and a short proboscis. Hair on the face and head is black, with a pale yellow collar that normally lacks any intermixed black hairs. The abdomen is mostly black, often with yellow hairs on the first tergite (abdominal segment), pale yellow sides on the third tergite and a white or pale yellow tail end. Males in northern Scotland sometimes have yellow tails instead of white. The defining physical trait in comparison to non-Cuckoo bumblebees is that B. bohemicus lacks corbiculae, or pollen sacks, on its posterior tibia, instead the area is covered in dense hair. Females have very thick cuticles, longer and more powerful stings, and larger venom sacs and Dufour's glands compared to its host species. Males are smaller, around 11‚Äì17 mm in length and similarly colored to females. Males are stingless. B. bohemicus does not produce any workers; instead, they enslave the host workers. B. bohemicus does not exhibit any nest-building behavior; instead, they move into newly established host nests and usurp the host queen. B. bohemicus parasitizes three species: B. locurum, B. cryptarum, and B. terrestris. ==Distribution and habitat== B. Bohemicus is one of the most common Cuckoo bees in Europe. This bumblebee is distributed through most of Europe, from within the Arctic Circle to northern Spain and Greece and from Britain and Ireland in the west to eastern Russia. It is also found in Turkey. In Britain, it is common in the southwestern peninsula, northern England, and Scotland. In the southeastern part, however, it is rare (with exception of the East Anglian brecks). B. bohemicus lives in temperate climates and is found in the same temperate habitats as its host bee species, allowing for easier access to host nests. However, it does show differences from its hosts in flower preference for foraging. This is likely due to the fact that it forages solely for nectar, and it differs in the timing of foraging behavior during its life cycle. It prefers to forage in scrub-type flowering plants. In analyses of population densities of both host bees and B. bohemicus, there appears to be a threshold host population density at which the parasites are able to maintain a presence. This threshold has not been accurately quantified, but areas of low host population density have been observed to be free of cuckoo-bee parasites. ==Colony cycle== Host nest selection Fertilized B. bohemicus queens emerge from hibernation in April several weeks after the queens of their host species, so that the hosts have already established new nests and produced an initial brood of workers. Before locating a host nest, the queen forages on flowers for a short time while her ovaries develop. The queen will select and invade a host hive by the end of May. Nest-searching flights are used to locate possible host nests, and the nests are identified as belonging to suitable hosts by species-specific chemical signals, or \\"trail pheromones\\" consisting of volatile hydrocarbons of varying lengths, given off by the host bees. Evidence suggests that cuckoo- bees are able to detect quantitative and qualitative differences in these scent markers that provide information about various colony characteristics, possibly allowing for host nest discrimination based upon colony size and overall health. Nest-searching queens have been observed visiting several different potential host nests before selecting one to invade, further supporting the hypothesis that they are able to discriminate nests based on potential viability. B. bohemicus is a generalist parasite, invading the nests of B. locurum, B. cryptarum, and B. terrestris, and so is attracted to the chemical signals of any of these potential host species. This generalist approach gives B. bohemicus more options, which has allowed it to occupy such a large geographical area, but it also has a lower success rate than other members of Psithyrus.  Colony initiation  Artificially introduced B. bohemicus queens consistently did not encounter aggressive host defense responses, while other parasitic species were consistently attacked when similarly introduced. Within the first hour of introduction, host queens showed no observable response, while host workers approached but never attacked the unfamiliar bee. When B. bohemicus females were artificially introduced to freely-foraging early-stage colonies of B. lucorum, the introduced female refused to remain with the host nest, despite a lack of host bee response, suggesting a specific selection mechanism, rather than random selection or simply the one initially encountered, that is not fully understood. When selecting a host nest, B. bohemicus queens preferentially attack larger host nests, but the size of nest invaded (measured by number of host bees) is correlated to the mortality rate of the invading queen. Smaller nests, which contain fewer workers, will produce fewer, and smaller, reproductive B. bohemicus. This nest preference represents a trade-off between the relative ease of invading a smaller nest and the benefits that come from the increased resources of larger nests. A single queen will move into a host nest, usurping and sometimes killing the host queen. After several days, the invading queen begins ejecting host larvae from their brood cells and eating host eggs and then begin to lay her own eggs into host-constructed wax cells after another few days. B. bohemicus and other Psithyrus queens have a more powerful sting and mandibles as well as generally thicker exoskeleton than their hosts, granting an advantage in conflicts. These invasions are usually successful if they occur before the second batch of workers has been produced. The invading queen eats the eggs or larvae of the host queen, although they will frequently let more-developed larvae and existing workers survive to allow for a sufficient workforce. The invading queen allows the growth of a sufficient number of host workers, typically one or two broods, to perform the necessary tasks of a functional nest. After a period of waiting, the new queen begins to lay her own eggs. B. bohemicus will sometimes allow the original host queen to remain in the invaded hive. The queen is marginalized within the hive and is the recipient of the majority of the parasite's dominance behavior, but continues to perform grooming and brood-tending behaviors and may even continue laying her own eggs, which will be promptly eaten by the parasite queen, preserving her reproductive dominance. Reasons influencing whether or not the host queen is killed is unclear, but there is evidence that the invading queen is better able to maintain dominance over the workers when the host queen remains alive and in the nest. During observations, when the host queen reproductive dominance over the workers is lost (characterized by sexual maturation of the workers and associated behavioral changes), the B. bohemicus queen also loses dominance and she and her brood become the objects of worker aggression. ==Behavior==  Dominance behavior  During the first few days of occupation, prior to beginning to lay her eggs, an invading queen will attempt to establish dominance by acting aggressively towards host queen and workers. This behavior includes physically pushing the other bees around, as well as demonstrating \\"mauling\\" behavior, which consists of grabbing the victim as if to sting it, then releasing without actually stinging. Though this behavior is performed towards both the host queen and workers, it is directed at the queen (versus all workers combined) about 62% of the time. In addition to physical dominance, the invading queen attempts to establish reproductive dominance by eating host eggs and ejecting larvae. To eject host larvae, the queen uncovers the larvae and removes them from the brood clump, dropping them outside the brood-rearing area, where they are subsequently carried away from the hive by host workers. If the uncovering and removal process is interrupted by the approach of a host worker, the queen will stop and move away from the cell, which will likely be repaired by the worker. After the worker has moved on, the queen will resume the ejection behavior. Division of labor B. bohemicus maintains the division of labor in the host nest, as it does not produce any workers to perform foraging, brood- rearing, or defensive tasks. During its time in the host nest, the B. bohemicus queen performs some brood care tasks, participating in feeding and brood incubation. To feed the larvae that are sealed in wax cells, either the B. bohemicus queen or host workers bite a hole in the cell wall and then regurgitate pollen inside. This pollen comes from nearby pollen storage receptacles in the hive and was originally collected by foraging host workers. Host worker reproductive suppression In addition to dominating the host queen, B. bohemicus suppresses host worker fertility, particularly male production, by physical and chemical means. However, this suppression is more effective in the presence of a cohabitant host queen. B. bohemicus must stabilize its presence as the dominant reproductive female, so workers continue nursing behaviors and do not begin to lay their own eggs. The invading queen demonstrates oophagy, particularly of male eggs, allowing some females to survive to become additional workers. The queen produces a combination of chemicals that mimic the fertility signals of the host queen, specifically wax-type esters, tetracosyl oleate, and hexacosyl oleate. These chemical signals are transferred to nearby workers via physical contact in the form of non-aggressive body rubbing. These signals mimic those of reproductively active host queens, suppressing ovarian development of the host workers. No significant difference has been found between worker reproductive suppression by native queens and invading queens, illustrating the effectiveness of the chemical mimicry. Chemical mimicry B. bohemicus mimics the cuticular hydrocarbons of the host bumblebee, facilitating entry into the nest. However, this mimicry of its host is imperfect in comparison to other members of Psithyrus, likely due to its variability of host. This likely contributes to B. bohemicus's relatively low invasion success rate compared to other members of Psithyrus. B. bohemicus also produces dodecyl acetate, which is a known worker-repellent, to aid its safe entry into the nest. In the first 24 hours after invasion, host workers undergo a significant change in their chemical bouquets, finishing with a qualitatively similar chemical mix to the invasive queen. Two hypotheses exist for this outcome. The first is that the workers begin to produce their own chemicals in an arms-race pattern to assume reproductive roles in response to the death of their native queen, which happens under normal conditions if a queen dies. The second hypothesis is that these chemicals are in fact applied to workers‚Äô bodies by the invasive queen as she takes over to establish herself as the reproductively dominant individual. Male offspring survival The small and stingless males lack the physical defensive abilities of females, as well as a Dufour's gland to produce mimicking chemical signals. Additionally, males are more easily recognizable as a different species due to their species-specific cephalic secretions that serve as their sexual marking pheromones. In response, B. bohemicus and other Psithyrus bumblebees have incorporated worker-repellant chemicals into their cephalic secretions, which reduce host worker aggression towards male young. It is hypothesized that during reproduction, males transfer some of these chemicals to females, which in turn aids in future infiltration into host nests the following cycle. Mating behavior Mating occurs in mid to late summer. B. bohemicus shows a 1:1 offspring sex ratio, consistent with production of only reproductively active offspring.  Loss of dominance  At any point during the invasion or brood rearing process, B. bohemicus may lose dominance. When this occurs, host workers will begin to eat or eject the parasite brood. The parasite queen will attempt to defend her brood by pushing host workers away while buzzing aggressively, and with frequent cell examination. However, she will likely be overwhelmed and her brood eaten or ejected. This loss of dominance is likely tied to the loss of dominance by the host queen in cases where she survived invasion and remained in the nest, though the nature of this association is not understood. This loss of dominance is characterized by the maturation of worker ovaries as they become reproductively active. The invasive queen is not necessarily killed after dominance is lost, but may remain in the hive, either incubating host cocoons or sitting inactively beside the comb. ==Life history== New reproductive males and females emerge from the nest from late June onward to mate. Queens hibernate through the winter once they have been fertilized. Males may be seen until late September, after the conclusion of reproduction, eventually all dying before the onset of winter. ==Mimicry and camouflage== B. bohemicus is similar in appearance to its host B. terrestris species. Since bees identify nest members by scent and other chemical signals, rather than visual appearance, this similarity is instead considered to be M√ºllerian mimicry. More important to their success as parasites is their ability to chemically camouflage within their host nest to avoid detection and repulsion during their initial entry. ==Interaction with other species== B. bohemicus is an obligate parasite, and so it is almost always found in association with a host nest. It parasitizes Bombus locurum, Bombus cryptarum, and Bombus terrestris. In the short time that B. bohemicus is independently foraging, it feeds on the nectar of flowering plants. It shows preference to a diverse selection of scrub-type food plants across its large geographical range, such as: thyme, scabious, knapweed, ling, lavender, masterwort, marsh, and thistles for the male, and sallow, dandelion, clover, bilberry, sycamore, cornflowers, bistort, bugle, thyme, cotoneaster, heath, and raspberry for the female. After invading the host nest, it will be fed by the foraging host workers according to their particular foraging habits. ==Human interaction and agriculture== B. bohemicus does not act as a pollinator, as it has lost its pollen-collecting corbiculae and produces no worker females. Interaction with humans is minimal, as B. bohemicus individuals are only rarely found outside of nests, and do not exhibit aggressive behavior towards humans unless disturbed. == References == Category:Bumblebees Category:Hymenoptera of Europe Category:Insects described in 1838 Category:Insects of the Arctic ","title":"Bombus bohemicus"},{"id":"20219251","text":"Bombus branickii is a species of cuckoo bumblebee. == References == Category:Bumblebees Category:Insects described in 1893 ","title":"Bombus branickii"},{"id":"20219255","text":"Bombus chinensis is a species of cuckoo bumblebee. ==References== Category:Bumblebees Category:Insects described in 1890 ","title":"Bombus chinensis"},{"id":"20219257","text":"Bombus coreanus is a species of cuckoo bumblebee. ==References== Category:Bumblebees Category:Insects described in 1934 ","title":"Bombus coreanus"},{"id":"20219259","text":"Bombus expolitus is a species of cuckoo bumblebee.

Riilahti was commissioned in 1940 and sunk in 1943. The vessel was named after the battle of Riilahti, which was fought between Sweden and Russia in 1714. == New minelayers for the navy == Funding for two new minelayers had been secured as early as in 1937, but instead the money was used to refurbish the garrison at M√§kiluoto. Riilahti was launched on December 14, 1940, three weeks after her sister ship Ruotsinsalmi. The ship had an extensively modified propulsion system and hull, compared to her sister vessel, and it took some time before the crew had figured out all the characteristics of the vessel. Originally, the vessels were intended as escort minesweepers for the Finnish navy's coastal defence ships Ilmarinen and V√§in√§m√∂inen, and they were therefore designed with a draft of only 1.5 m. Riilahti was armed with one 75 mm gun, one Bofors 40 mm guns and two Madsen 20 mm anti-aircraft cannons. The vessel had three mine dropping rails, and could carry about 100 mines. The ship could also hunt submarines, and was equipped with sonar, depth charge throwers and rails. The vessel was also strong enough to be ale to tow minesweeping equipment. She was equipped with smoke generators so she could protect itself, and other near-by vessels from the enemy. Riilahti was commanded by kapteeniluutnantti Osmo Kivilinna during her entire career. == Riilahti during the Continuation War == Riilahti and Ruotsinsalmi began mining the Gulf of Finland on June 26, 1941, immediately after the outbreak of the Continuation War. Riilahti launched almost 1,000 sea mines during 1941, most of them in the Juminda minefield. In 1941, Riilahti managed to seize control of a Soviet barge and participated in minesweeping operations south of the Hanko Peninsula. In the summer of 1942, Riilahti laid numerous mines near Hogland. Riilahti was sent as reinforcement to the island of Someri on 8 July 1942, when the Russians tried to land and take the island. She was involved in artillery duels with ships from the Soviet Navy, gave fire support to the Finnish defenders on the island and fended of several air attacks. The vessel counted 56 aircraft attacking her, but she survived, thanks to the gallantry of her crew. The island was held by the Finnish defenders. The Marshal of Finland, Gustaf Mannerheim, awarded the Mannerheim Cross to Osmo Kivilinna on 8 March 1943, citing the war record of the ship, whose characteristics still were not all known. The ship had also previously sunk the Soviet submarine Shch-406 together with some German patrol vessels on 26 May 1943. == The last battle== On August 22, 1943 at 5.30 am, Riilahti set out from Loviisa on an anti-submarine mission west of Hogland. The patrol vessel VMV 1 followed her on the journey. At 2 pm on August 23 an outlook spotted two Soviet motor torpedo boats and sounded the alarm. The officer on duty had previously ordered the engines to be stopped so that the sonar operators easier could listen for submarine sounds. While the vessel tried to start her engines and reach steering power, the Soviet motor torpedo boat TK 94 fired a torpedo, which struck Riilahti amidships and broke her in two. Riilahti sunk in two minutes, taking with her 23 of her crew. VMV 1 saved eleven men from the water, one being the commander of the ship, and Mannerheim knight Osmo Kivilinna. He later died from his wounds on the operating table. This was one of the most significant single losses during the war years; Kivinlinna was a very well-liked officer, and it was widely believed that he could become the first full Admiral of the Finnish Navy. The wreck of Riilahti lies five nautical miles from the island of Tiiskerihttp://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?174077 at a depth of 70 m. The loss of Riilahti left the Finnish Navy with a gap in their mine warfare capabilities. This was addressed with the launching of the Keih√§ssalmi in 1957. The third engine, which had been ordered, but not yet fitted on the Riilahti was instead fitted onto the sister vessel Ruotsinsalmi. Riilahti laid 1,733 sea mines and 599 obstacles during her career. ==References== Category:Minelayers of the Finnish Navy Category:1940 ships Category:Ships built in Turku Category:World War II naval ships of Finland Category:Maritime incidents in August 1943 Category:World War II shipwrecks in the Baltic Sea ","title":"Finnish minelayer Riilahti"},{"id":"20219265","text":"Bombus ferganicus is a species of cuckoo bumblebee. ==References== Category:Insects described in 1893 Category:Bumblebees ","title":"Bombus ferganicus"},{"id":"20219271","text":"Bombus flavidus is a species of cuckoo bumblebee found in Austria, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Slovenia, Spain, and Switzerland. ==References== Category:Bumblebees Category:Insects described in 1852 Category:Hymenoptera of Europe ","title":"Bombus flavidus"},{"id":"20219272","text":"Danio Bardi (23 May 1937 - 9 July 1991) was an Italian water polo player who competed in the 1960 Summer Olympics and in the 1964 Summer Olympics.

He won one cap against Wales in 1899. He served as Chief Constable of Birmingham from 1935 to 1941, and his manuals and books on police procedures became essential guidebooks for police in the United Kingdom. ==Biography== Born in Tralee, County Kerry, Moriarty was the second son of The Rev. Thomas Alexander Moriarty, a Church of Ireland Rector of Millstreet, County Cork. Moriarty graduated from Trinity College, Dublin in 1898, the year before his cap for the Irish rugby union team. He graduated in 1912 with a bachelor of laws and in 1932 received an additional degree of doctor of laws. Moriarty then joined the Royal Irish Constabulary, becoming a first-class district inspector in 1902. In 1912, he joined RIC headquarters. In 1918, he moved to Birmingham to take on the role of assistant chief constable. Many Irish constables had been recruited to move to Birmingham by Sir Charles Rafter, Chief Constable of Birmingham from 1899 to 1935, who relied on the Irish to help stamp out the infamous Peaky Blinders gang. The British police strikes in 1918 and 1919 led to the Police Act 1919, which made it illegal for police officers in the UK to strike. Moriarty realised more professionalism was required among police recruits and officers, and subsequently \\"became the key figure in organising an intensive training curriculum\\" in Birmingham. The programme gained a national reputation for police training, and over the next two decades, officers from 77 police forces from England and Wales had trained in Birmingham. Moriarty wrote several books and papers on police procedures, notably Moriarty's Police Law (1929), which for more than half a century was a fundamental resource for law enforcement officials in the UK. Moriarty succeeded Rafter as Chief Constable of Birmingham in 1935, and retired six years later, having led the city through two years of the Blitz. He was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1925. In 1936, he was made a Commander of the Venerable Order of Saint John and in 1938 a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. ==Personal life== Moriarty married Muriel Una (n√©e Carter) of Belmullet, County Mayo, in 1906. They had three daughters. He died in 1958 in Worcestershire. ==Publications== *Moriarty's Police Law (originally Police law: an arrangement of law and regulations for the use of police officers) (1929) *Police Procedure and Administration (1930) *Moriarty's Questions and Answers on Police Subjects (1954) ==References *Cecil Moriarty at Scrum.com * Category:1877 births Category:1958 deaths Category:Irish rugby union players Category:Ireland international rugby union players Category:Monkstown Football Club players Category:Commanders of the Order of St John Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:British Chief Constables Category:People from Tralee Category:Royal Irish Constabulary officers ","title":"Cecil Moriarty"},{"id":"20219457","text":"Dante Rossi (August 28, 1936 ‚Äì March 15, 2013) was an Italian water polo player who competed in the 1960 Summer Olympics and in the 1964 Summer Olympics.

Ruotsinsalmi was commissioned in 1940 and remained in service until 1975. The vessel was named after the battle of Ruotsinsalmi, which was fought between Sweden and Russia in 1790. == New minelayers for the navy == Funding for two new minelayers had been secured as early as in 1937, but instead the money was used to refurbish the garrison at M√§kiluoto. Ruotsinsalmi and her sister vessel, , were intended as escort minesweepers for the Finnish navy's coastal defence ships and , and they were therefore designed with a draught of only . Ruotsinsalmi was armed with one gun, one Bofors 40 mm guns and two Madsen 20 mm anti-aircraft cannons. The vessel had three mine dropping rails, and could carry about 100 mines. The ship could also hunt submarines, and was equipped with sonar, depth charge throwers and rails. The vessel was also strong enough to be able to tow mine sweeping equipment. It was equipped with smoke generators so it could protect itself and other near-by vessels from the enemy. == During the Continuation War == Ruotsinsalmi and Riilahti began mining the Gulf of Finland on 26 June 1941, immediately after the outbreak of the Continuation War. The first minefield, Kipinola, Ruotsinsalmi laid together with Riilahti south-east of Hanko which was intended to block Soviet seaways to Hanko. Same group laid already on 27 June the next minefield, Kuolemaj√§rvi, north-west of Paldiski again to block route to Hanko. Another one, Valkj√§rvi, was laid on 29‚Äì30 June. {  + Minefields laid by Ruotsinsalmi in 1941 - ! Date ! Mines ! Location !

After two failed attempts by gunboats to rendezvous with minelayers on the nights of 25-26 and 27‚Äì28 August the minelayers penetrated the Soviet minefield and met with the gunboats west of Hanko and then escorted them through to Helsinki on 29 August 1941. Ruotsinsalmi again with Riilahti were sent on 21 November to as minesweeping escorts for convoy of German ships consisting of two tugs and a depot ship headed to west through the Soviet minebarrier south of Hanko. However, in the dark the convoy deviated from the swept route and as the sweeping gear became entangled with mines it had stop. Before the convoy managed to resume its journey, tug F√∂hn slipped outside the swept area and sank after hitting a mine but the rest of the convoy reached its destination. The voyage back through the minebarrier with a convoy of freighters started at midnight of 3 December after the escort group had been strengthened with German minesweepers M 4 and M 7 and it took place without any incidents. Ruotsinsalmi was Finland's most active minelayer during the Second World War, laying a total of 3,967 sea mines and 541 sweeping obstacles. She was forced to lay mines against the Germans after the end of the hostilities with the Soviet Union in an attempt to hinder German submarine activity. She participated in the sinking of one Soviet submarine Shch-408 on 25 May 1943 (along with VMV 6). == After the war == Ruotsinsalmi had proven to be a sound design and well suited for its task. However, it continued to serve a number of different missions after the war. The ship ended its career as a diving support vessel (1973‚Äì1975). She was mothballed in Upinniemi, and there were plans to make her into a museum, but she was scrapped at the beginning of the 1990s, after the owners had failed to gather enough funds. ==References== Citations Bibliography * Category:Minelayers of the Finnish Navy Category:1940 ships ","title":"Finnish minelayer Ruotsinsalmi"},{"id":"20219504","text":"Bombus balteatus, the golden-belted bumble bee, is a species of bumblebee with a boreal and high altitude distribution in northern Eurasia and North America. == Range and distribution == This species is found in Finland, northern Sweden, Russia, and North America from arctic Alaska, Canada, and mountain ranges in the United States such as the Sierra Nevada and the White Mountains down south to New Mexico. Their preferred habitat includes high altitude and boreal regions, and they are often found at higher elevations than the tree line. Bombus balteatus is often most abundant where Castilleja, Chrysothammnus, and Mertensia plant species are common. Some populations of bees, including in the Rocky Mountains, specifically Mount Evans, Niwot Ridge and Pennsylvania Mountain have declined in the 21st century. == Morphology == Bombus balteatus is a long-tongued bumblebee. Often the tongue length reaches two-thirds or more the length of the body. This morphological feature allows them to specialize on flowers with long corollas. In North America, workers can be identified by a distinctive black abdomen pattern and robust body. == Systematics == The most closely related species are Bombus hyperboreus, Bombus frigidus, and Bombus mixtus, which all occur in Western North America and Arctic Europe. == Effects of climate change == In the Rocky Mountains, USA, many native plants species include flowers with elongated corollas. With abundant resources, B. balteatus can be a dominant species in the ecosystem. However, Rocky Mountain bumblebees, including B. balteatus and Bombus sylvicola, have shown changes in abundance and foraging range as long-tubed floral resources are declining at higher altitudes; they have also exhibited a trend towards shorter tongues over the last 40 years. This is indicative of niche expansion; although this species of bumblebee is considered highly specialized, it is now adapting to forage on a broader range of morphologically diverse flowering plants. Immigration by short-tongued bumble bees into higher altitudes, as well as an increase in the number of Bombus balteatus individuals with shorter tongues, has also occurred as a result of warming and climate change. This creates new competition for long-tongued B. balteatus for limited floral resources. ==References== Category:Bumblebees Category:Insects described in 1832 Category:Hymenoptera of Europe Category:Hymenoptera of North America Category:Insects of the Arctic ","title":"Bombus balteatus"},{"id":"20219515","text":"Samia Shoaib is a Pakistani-born American writer and former actress.

Dominello is a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, representing the electorate of Ryde for the Liberal Party since 2008. He is tipped to be the next health minister after Brad Hazzard retires in 2020. He has previously served as the Minister for Finance, Services and Property in the first Berejiklian ministry between January 2017 and March 2019; as the Minister for Innovation and Better Regulation between April 2015 and January 2017 in the second Baird government; as the Minister for Citizenship, Communities and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs between 2011 and 2015, and the Minister for Veterans Affairs and Assistant Minister for Education between 2014 and 2015, in the O'Farrell and first Baird governments. After a career as a solicitor and local councillor, Dominello was elected to the Parliament of New South Wales following a Ryde by-election triggered by the resignation of his predecessor John Watkins. The by-election saw Dominello receive a two-party swing of 23.1 points. Dominello increased his margin at the 2011 election; however, the margin was reduced to 11.5 points at the 2015 state election. ==Early life and career== Dominello was born at Ryde Hospital and was educated at Holy Spirit School, North Ryde, and Marist College Eastwood. He then went on to study law at Macquarie University. In 1991, Dominello was admitted as a practitioner of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the High Court of Australia after taking the solicitor's admission board examinations. In one of his first cases, Dominello represented applicants in the Maralinga cases, who sought compensation following the findings made by the Royal Commission into British nuclear tests in Australia. Dominello successfully obtained an order that the limitation period be significantly extended to enable the applicants' claims to be maintained.. In 1994, Dominello commenced employment with Etheringtons Solicitors of North Sydney, and in 2000, became a partner. In 2000, he represented applicants in complex proceedings in the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales, where staff members sought damages against members of Parliament and the Speaker of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for unfair contract.Frost v The Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of NSW [2000 NSWIRComm 70]. Following his election to the Parliament of New South Wales in October 2008, Dominello stepped down as partner at Etheringtons. ==Political career== Local government He joined the Liberal Party in the early 1990s, and in 1995 Dominello was elected as a councillor for the City of Ryde. While on Council, Dominello was chair of a number of committees including the development committee and had a significant involvement in the establishment of the Ryde Aquatic Leisure Centre and the development of the Macquarie Business Park. Dominello served two terms, but did not nominate for the 2004 local government elections, citing his desire to concentrate on his legal career, and subsequently let his Liberal membership lapse.

NSW Opposition Leader Barry O'Farrell celebrates the 2008 Ryde by-election win with Victor Dominello and NSW deputy opposition leader Jillian Skinner. On 3 September 2008, Labor Deputy Premier John Watkins, who was also the local Member for Ryde, resigned from parliament, resulting in the need for a by-election. Dominello nominated for preselection and won, defeating Ryde Mayor Vic Tagg and several other local party members. On paper, Ryde was a safe Labor seat; Dominello needed a 10-percent swing to win it. However, it was located in territory that had historically been marginal at the federal level. Additionally, the by-election came at a very bad time for the government, whose polling numbers had rapidly tailed off only a year after winning a fourth term. Dominello went into the contest as the overwhelming favourite to win. He duly defeated Labor candidate Nicole Campbell in a landslide, receiving a swing of more than 25 points on the day of the by-election. The swing, at the time the largest a sitting NSW government had ever suffered, turned Ryde into a safe Liberal seat in one stroke. He was subsequently sworn as a member of the Legislative Assembly in on 25 October 2008. Dominello has spoken in Parliament about a number of local issues including the future of Ryde Hospital, the Homebush V8 Supercar race and the increase to the Parking Space Levy. Dominello won the seat in his own right at the 2011 state election, picking up a healthy swing of 12.7 points and increasing his vote to 75 percent, making Ryde the 10th-safest Liberal seat. Following the electoral victory of the O'Farrell government at that election, Dominello was appointed as the Minister for Citizenship, Communities and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Due to the resignation of Barry O'Farrell as Premier, and the subsequent ministerial reshuffle by Mike Baird, the new Liberal Leader, in April 2014 in addition to his existing responsibilities as a minister, Dominello was appointed as the Minister for Veterans Affairs and the Assistant Minister for Education. Following the 2015 state election, Dominello was sworn in as the inaugural Minister for Innovation and Better Regulation in the second Baird government. In 2017 Dominello was appointed as the Minister for Finance, Services and Property in the first Berejiklian ministry. Following the 2019 state election, Dominello was sworn in as the Minister for Customer Service in the second Berejiklian ministry, with effect from 2 April 2019.

Recent British attacks on the vital Dardanelles shows signs of inside knowledge. Von Sturm, the head of German intelligence, is ordered to find out if Ali Bey, the Turkish commander of the region, is the traitor. As his best agent has not been heard from in several weeks, von Sturm assigns Kruger the task. Shortly afterwards, Annemarie, known by the code name \\"Fr√§ulein Doktor\\", returns after completing her mission. She also informs von Sturm that fellow spy Mata Hari has fallen in love and therefore can no longer be trusted. She recommends that an incriminating message be sent using a code that she knows has been broken by the Allies. In addition, she uncovers Kruger as a British double agent known as K-6. When Kruger is arrested at his dentist contact's office, another patient, American medical student Douglas Beall, is also taken into custody, though he is later released. Just to be sure though, von Sturm orders Annemarie to make sure Beall is innocent. She arranges to be rescued from an unwanted \\"suitor\\" by Beall, who invites her to his hotel suite. During the course of the evening, he confesses he has fallen in love with her, now going by the name Helena Bohlen. Helena is attracted to him, but when she reads a coded message from von Sturm informing her that he has taken her advice regarding Mata Hari, she abruptly leaves. Beall persists however. When Helena boards the train to Constantinople, he follows her on the spur of the moment and continues courting her, despite her half-hearted attempts to discourage him. Her assistant Karl watches with growing concern. As they near the Turkish border, she orders Karl to return to Germany so Beall can use his visa. To answer Beall's persistent questions, Helena has to admit she is a German spy. This has no effect on his love. Meanwhile, she attracts Ali Bey with her beauty. When she accepts his invitation to dinner, she poses as British agent K-6 and negotiates for vital information. To gain his trust, she arranges for Beall to be framed as a spy by von Sturm (who has arrived after becoming concerned by Karl's reports) and supposedly executed by firing squad, though a French prisoner is to be substituted. His suspicions (and jealousy) allayed, Ali Bey compromises himself and is arrested by his Turkish superiors. When von Sturm admits that he was unable to make the switch and that Beall really was shot, Helena loses her sanity and is confined in a nunnery. Refusing to accept the truth, she expects her lover to find her and take her away. It turns out that von Sturm had lied in an attempt to avoid losing his best agent. He had not dared to risk antagonizing a then-neutral America. In the final scene, Helena is reunited with Beall. ==CastProduction== The story in Stamboul Quest is based on an actual person, a German-trained spy in World War I named Annamarie Lesser - as in this film - or possibly Elsbeth Schragm√ºller who used the code name \\"Fr√§ulein Doktor\\" - probably referring to the PhD she held from the University of Freiburg - and who ran a training school for espionage agents in Antwerp, Belgium during the German occupation of the city. According to Myrna Loy's autobiography, the studio was particularly careful about how the script portrayed Fr√§ulein Doktor, since at the time the film was made she was still alive, and a drug addict, living in a sanatorium in Switzerland, and they were concerned about being sued for libel.\\"Notes\\" on TCM.com Although the exploits of Fr√§ulein Doktor are not well known, and have been overshadowed by those of Mata Hari, it was possibly Fr√§ulein Doktor who exposed Mata Hari, resulting in the latter facing a French firing squad for espionage.

The queens have an average length of , and a wingspan of . The corresponding lengths of the other castes are (worker) and (male). In the nominate subspecies, the thorax is black, with the exception of a yellow collar (quite broad on the males) and on the edge of the scutellum. The first, and the frontal part of the second terga (abdominal segments) are black, as is the final tergite, but the rest of the abdomen is yellow to red. == Ecology == The bumblebee is normally a highland species, often found on bilberry, cranberry, and cowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea). It is a pollen storer; it actively feeds the larvae from a central pollen storage, rather than providing each larval cell with its own pollen container. It nests underground in the abandoned nesting burrows of small mammals, the relatively small nests frequently house less than 50 workers and their life cycle is 3-4 months. In Great Britain the queens emerge from their hibernation during April; the first workers appear in May, and the males and new queens start to emerge in July and last until early October. The cuckoo bumber bee Bombus sylvestris is likely to be parasitic on this species. == Taxonomy == This species is closely related to Bombus lapponicus but has a more eastern distribution; a number of subspecies are recognised: * B. m. monticola, the nominate subspecies, is rather darkly coloured and present on the British Islands. * B. m. scandinavicus, the Scandinavian subspecies, is also a more or less dark form. * B. m. alpestris is a subspecies present in the Alps and the Balkans. * B. m. rondoui lives in the Cantabrian Mountains and the Pyrenees. * B. m. konradini, living in the Apennines, is a light subspecies with a striking pattern; the thorax is almost zebra-striped in white, black and white. == Distribution == Bilberry Bumblebee, in sample tube for identification purposes. B. monticola is found in most mountainous areas of Europe, as northern Scandinavia (mostly Norway and northern Sweden; the distribution in Finland is rather patchy, and confined to the area along the Norwegian border), the Alps, the Cantabrian Mountains, the Pyrenees, the Apennines, and in the Balkans. It is also found in the lowlands in northern Norway and the Kola peninsula as on the British Islands. In Britain, it lives on upland habitat, predominantly moorland. The major areas populated by this bumblebee are Dartmoor, Exmoor, the Welsh uplands, the Peak District, the North York Moors, and the Scottish mainland. It is a recent arrival in Ireland (first recorded in the 1970s).Speight, M.C.D. (1974) Bombus lapponicus, Parasyrphus lineola and Phaonia exoleta insects new to Ireland. Irish Naturalists' Journal 18: 123-124 In Ireland, it is a montane species (hence the name). It is restricted to upland areas of counties Antrim (in the Northern Ireland part of Ulster) and Dublin, Wicklow, Carlow, and Wexford in the province of Leinster in the Irish Republic.Fitzpatrick, U., T.E. Murray, A. Byrne, R.J. Paxton & M.J.F. Brown (2006) Regional red list of Irish Bees. Report to National Parks and Wildlife Service (Ireland) and Environment and Heritage Service (N. Ireland).

The queen has an average wingspan of . The face and proboscis are short. Females (queens and workers) have a predominantly black abdomen with a yellow collar, the first and sometimes second terga yellow, and a white tail. The face is black, occasionally with a patch of yellow fur on the top. Males are similar, but with more yellow; the yellow collar continues on the ventral side, the two first terga are always yellow, and much more yellow fur is found on the face. However, darker forms of the females are seen, as well as forms (sometimes considered subspecies) that differ in the amount of yellow in the fur, and with brownish hairs on the white tail. Among these are B. j. hebridensis (which is endemic to the Hebridean islands of Scotland),Thompson, Francis (1968) Harris and Lewis, Outer Hebrides. Newton Abbot. David & Charles. p. 21 B. j. monapiae, and B. j. vogtii. On the Orkney and the Hebrides, a form exists where the males have red tails instead of white. == Ecology == The heath humble-bee is found in gardens and meadows, as well as on heath and moorland. The bumblebee visits various food sources, such as clover, bird's-foot trefoil, cowberry, thistles, and many others. The nest, which at most can contain 50 to 120 workers, can be situated both above and under ground. When the climate permits, as in southern England, this species can have two broods a season. A study in northern Sweden shows the males, when patrolling for young queens, do so at tree-top level, marking twigs and leaves with pheromones to attract the queens. == Distribution == B. jonellus is present in most of Europe and a large part of northern Asia. In the west, it is common from Iceland in the north to the Cantabrian Mountains in northern Spain. It is found beyond the Arctic Circle in Scandinavia and Russia, where it is continuous north of 55¬∫N, more uneven south of it. In southern Europe, the distribution, too, is patchy, and restricted to the mountains. In Asia, it reaches the Gulf of Anadyr on the Pacific. In United Kingdom, it is common in the south-east, in East Anglia, northern Scotland including the Hebrides, Orkney, and Shetland. It is also found in Canada east to Hudson Bay and Alaska. ==References== Category:Bumblebees Category:Hymenoptera of Europe Category:Hymenoptera of North America Category:Insects described in 1802 Category:Insects of the Arctic Category:Taxa named by William Kirby (entomologist) ","title":"Bombus jonellus"},{"id":"20219622","text":"Bombus lapponicus is a species of bumblebee.

The foundations and other stone blocks (spolia) of the Roman structure were used by the Seljuqs to build a replacement bridge in the 13th century, the K√∂pr√ºpazar K√∂pr√ºs√º, which stands to this day. This bridge is characterized by a significant displacement along its mid-line, noticeable by looking at its ancient piers. == Roman bridge ==  Structure  The characteristic mid- course displacement The original shape and construction of the Roman-era bridge have been reconstructed digitally, based on the extant remains of the ancient structure: the ramps, the abutments, and foundations of the piers. Several pieces of the original bridge are scattered along the river bed on both banks, and were not used during reconstruction. Originally, the bridge had a length of 259.50 m and a width of 9.44 m, and had nine semicircular arches. It crossed the river at a basic 90-degree angle, although it bent slightly on one end. The two access ramps provide information about the overall height of the structure, and the gradient on each end is similar (12.3% and 12.2%), The midpoint of the bridge was approximately 4.1 m higher than the later Seljuk structure. This middle section stood on six arches, while both sides had smaller arches (one on the right and two on the left) which served as spillways in case the river overflowed. At its normal level, the river flowed between the three central arches, constrained by double- wedge-shaped reinforcements of masonry, placed at the two outer pillars and intended to prevent their undermining by the river. These masonry structures were - according to the archaeological record - markedly higher on the upstream side (8.15 m) than on the downstream (4.76 m). In addition, wedge- shaped breakwaters were added on the piers, although not all piers feature them on both sides. The clear spans of the three central arches have been determined at 23.52 m for the central arch and 14.95 m for the two flanking arches, while the two piers supporting the central arch were measured at 9.60 m. The gaps in the right end of the structure reveal the hollow chamber construction method of the bridge deck, typical of several Roman bridges in Asia Minor, e.g. the Aesepus Bridge. The great height of the ancient structure is further verified by the discovery of 1.5 m long iron threaded rods, which, bound together with hooks and loops, were used to reinforce the masonry in the bridge's foundations. The main body of the bridge was built using concrete, which survives in at least one Seljuq-era pier as a foundation.  Dates  The pressure conduit of the Aspendos aqueduct The exact date of the bridge's construction is uncertain. The date of construction is closely connected with the Aqueduct of Aspendos, parts of which were re-used in the bridge. In the outer shell of the bridge alone, 250 pipe-shaped stones from the aqueduct's main pressure conduit were re-used. Since the aqueduct has been known to have functioned until into the 4th century AD, that provides a terminus post quem for the construction of the Eurymedon bridge, although it is still possible that an earlier bridge already existed on this location. This bridge could possibly have been destroyed in the large earthquake of May 363, which also ruined the aqueduct, thus explaining the use of the latter's duct stones in the rebuilding of the bridge. == Seljuq bridge == Close-up of the zigzag course Re-used duct stones In the early 13th century, the Seljuq Sultan Kayqubad I (1219‚Äì1237) built a new bridge over the remains of the late antique structure, which had collapsed, probably also because of an earthquake. The Seljuq builders followed closely the course of the Roman remains, even in sections where the piers had been partly moved downstream from their original position; as a result, the Seljuq bridge features a quite sharp displacement. This zigzag course, formed by two successive, 90 degree bends, in combination with the pointed arches give the Seljuq-era bridge an appearance that is quite distinct from that of its Roman precursor. The Seljuq bridge is also considerably reduced in dimensions, something that allowed the full use of the Roman remains. Thus, for instance, the reduction of the width to almost half the original made the integration of halfway surviving ancient piers possible. The medieval arches were also 4.1 m lower than the Roman ones, and the length of the bridge was shortened, so that the new bridge ramp began at the place where the Roman structure had already reached its final height level. The bridge is mainly constructed of stone blocks,Grewe 1999, Images 1, 2, 5, 7, 15, 16, 17, 18, 25 while parts of the antique structure have been reused, including the duct stones, which were built into the new ramp. Restoration works in the late 1990s in the bridge's crumbling breastwork also revealed stone inscriptions in Greek and Arabic. == See also == * List of Roman bridges * Eurymedon Bridge (Selge) == References  Sources == * == External links == * The Aspendos Aqueduct and the Roman-Seljuk Bridge Across the Eurymedon Category:Roman bridges in Turkey Category:Seljuk bridges in Turkey Category:Deck arch bridges Category:Stone bridges in Turkey Category:Bridges completed in the 4th century Category:Bridges completed in the 13th century Category:Pamphylia Category:Buildings and structures in Antalya Province Category:Arch bridges in Turkey ","title":"Eurymedon Bridge (Aspendos)"},{"id":"20219652","text":"Bombus consobrinus is a species of bumblebee found in Hungary, northern Scandinavia, Kazakhstan, Russia (Saghalien, Siberia), China (Soyorei, Hebei, Liaoning), North and South Korea, and Japan. ==Description== The bumblebee is large, with the thorax and anterior part of the abdomen coloured orange, followed by a black band.

It is distinguished from most other bumblebees by its long tongue used for feeding on pollen in deep-flowered plants. Accordingly, this bumblebee mainly visits flowers with deep corollae, such as deadnettles, ground ivy, vetches, clovers, comfrey, foxglove, and thistles. They have a good visual memory, which aids them in navigating the territory close to their habitat and seeking out food sources. ==Taxonomy and phylogeny== Bombus hortorum belongs to the Bombus, or bumblebee, genus. It is one of the six most common bumblebees throughout Europe. Of the six commonest species, only two are long-tongued: B. hortorum and B. pascuorum. Its close relative Bombus ruderatus also has a long tongue, but is much less common. Bombus hortorum and Bombus ruderatus are nearly identical in appearance, but DNA sequence data distinguishes them as clearly-separate species. ==Description== This bumblebee has an oblong head and a very long tongue, about , and in some cases even . The tongue is so long that the bee often flies with it extended when collecting nectar. The queen is variable in size, with body lengths between , and wing spans from . The workers are almost as large, the larger ones overlapping the smaller queens. Their color is black with a yellow collar, a narrow yellow band on the scutellum, and a third yellow band on terga (abdominal segments) 1 and 2. The tail is white. Darker forms, with little yellow in their fur, are common. Eye anatomy and vision The compound eyes of Bombus hortorum are two dark, oval structures situated on the dorsal-ventral axis of their head. They lack interfacetal hairs and feature a relatively thick cornea and large retinal cells. Three types of spectrally sensitive cells were identified: UV with peak sensitivity to light of 353 nm wavelength, blue and green sensitive receptors with peak sensitivities to wavelengths of 430 nm and 548 nm, respectively. The ratios of these three cell types were 1:1:6. Polarization sensitivity occurred mostly in the UV cell types. The median ocellus was found to possess a much wider acceptance angle and a higher UV : green receptor cell ratio than the compound eye. ==Distribution and habitat== This species is found in Europe as far north as 70¬∫N (in Scandinavia, south of the tundra). In the west, its distribution reaches Iceland, where it probably has been introduced. In the south, it extends to the middle of the Iberian Peninsula, to southern Italy (Calabria), northern Turkey, and to the Mediterranean islands except Corsica, Sicily, and (probably) Sardinia. It continues in northern and central Asia through Siberia to the Altai Mountains, and, in the southeast, to northern Iran. In 1885, it was introduced in New Zealand, where it still exists, but without being particularly common. It is also found in America, particularly Florida. It is found through the British Isles, including Orkney and Shetland. Bombus hortorum are commonly found in grassland environments with abundant flowers that they can feed on. In a study analyzing spatial patterns of Bombus in different habitats, it was discovered that B. hortorum are most abundant in recently cattle-grazed grasslands, as compared to arable, sheep-grazed, unmanaged, and disturbed land plots. Cattle play an important role in the habitat of Bombus species because their feeding actions in grasslands cause a more diverse floral environment, which is preferred by the bumblebees for their own foraging behavior. Due to their localized lifestyle and the destruction and loss of grassland habitats, Bombus hortorum populations are expected to decline in the future. In order to address the conservation of Bombus hortorum, it is important that large areas of foraging plant diversity and nesting sites either receive no intervention as to foster a natural habitat, or are extensively grazed by cattle during the summer in order to promote plant diversity and create an environment rich in favored flowers for Bombus. Nests Bombus hortorum queens searching for locations to build a nest are most frequently found along forest and field boundaries and in open uncultivated fields. B. hortorum usually build their nests under the ground. They need moss and dried grass to be present in their habitats in order to successfully build their homes. Thus, they prefer grassland habitats with ample sunlight reaching the land in order to ensure secure and warm nests beneath the ground. Both this species and Bombus pratorum are known to build their nests in unusual places. ==Colony cycle== Colony growth A single queen starts a new colony in the springtime. B. hortorum is usually the last of the common Bombus species in Europe to emerge after hibernation. The queens carry out all necessary duties by themselves for over a month until the first batch of workers develops from larvae. In late summer and early fall, new breeding females and males emerge. The males do not return to the nest after they have developed. Instead, they care for themselves independently. The colony size of Bombus hortorum is small compared to other bumblebee colonies. A large bumblebee colony is considered to be several hundred individuals. The typical season of bumblebees lasts from mid-March to October, with summer showing the largest population size. Colony decline At the end of the species‚Äô season in the winter, mated queens search for hibernation sites underground while the rest of the colony dies off. The modernization of agriculture and demand for crops to feed the human population has brought about a significant increase in pesticide use. This has an adverse effect on the genus Bombus. Pesticides can impact the B. hortorum colonies by reducing brood development and also negatively impacting their memory, preventing them from remembering the locations of their foraging sites and nests. When a single queen first establishes her colony at the beginning of the season, pesticide risks could pose consequences for colony development and size, therefore resulting in colony decline. However, this species overall is not in danger of extinction, despite this use of pesticides. ==Behavior== Communication Bombus hortorum do not readily communicate with others when foraging. Instead, they collect food independently using a method called ‚Äòtrap-lining', in which individuals follow a regular route and visit the same flowers each time they forage. Mating behavior Bombus hortorum females mate once only; this increases the overall relatedness of individuals in their colony. At the end of the season in late summer, females mate and then store the sperm in spermatheca during their hibernation period. Then, at the start of the season when the queen emerges to start her colony, she uses the stored sperm to fertilize her eggs and produce workers. The average ejaculate size in B. hortorum is 6,800 sperm, which is relatively small compared to other Bombus species. As with most bumblebees, the males of this species patrol a fixed circuit, marking objects along the route, about a meter above ground, with a pheromone to attract queens. This behaviour was noted by Darwin 1886 in his own garden. Foraging behavior Bombus hortorum have been found to forage on plants in the genus Aquilegia; specifically the species A. vulgaris in Belgium and A. chrysantha in North America and Belgium. In regards to Aquilegia foraging, Bombus hortorum do not show any preference in color of the flowers. When Bombus workers set out to forage, they typically restrict themselves to either pollen collection or nectar foraging on one specific plant species. On the other hand, queens combine both pollen and nectar foraging in one expedition and visit multiple plant species. The queens use their tongue and jaws to grasp the stamen and petals of the flowers and collect food. While several other Bombus species perforate the flowers when foraging, Bombus hortorum do not perforate the flowers they feed on. This lack of perforation is thought to be attributed to the species extremely long tongue length, which sufficiently reaches the nectar without any trouble. Bombus individuals forage in small areas of several square meters for many days. Small areas they have been found to feed in are commonly separated by brush from neighboring spaces. In a study examining diet preferences of Bombus hortorum, it was determined that foraging behavior of individual bumblebees affects isolation and hybridization of flowering plants. In comparing choices of Rhinanthus plant species, B. hortorum queens and workers showed a strong preference for R. serotinus which has a long corolla length, but it easily reached with B. hortorum‚Äôs long tongue length. Observations of B. hortorum foraging patterns reveal that they are nototribic, or upright pollinators. Thus, when feeding, pollen is deposited on their head and thorax rather than on their legs and the underside of their abdomen as seen in sternotribic, or inverted foragers. When feeding on plants in quick continuation, bumblebees have their proboscis extended as they approach the flower. Data from this study reveals that when pollinating, Bombus hortorum visit eighteen flowers per minute, which is more than other species. This large quantity is most likely due to the greater efficiency B. hortorum experience by having longer tongues. B. hortorum play a prominent role in causing cross-pollination in Rhinanthus flowers and thus, make hybridization possible. Red clover The majority of the pollen they collect comes from the flowers of plants of the Fabaceae family. Bombus hortorum are especially fond of one species of Fabaceae, red clover, Trifolium pratense. The preference for Trifolium pratense is related to the very long tongue of B. hortorum. Because T. pratense is a flower species with a long corolla tube depth, B. hortorum can easily reach the nectar and pollen within the tube. Bumblebees tend to favor perennial flowers, which tend to produce more nectar than annual species. B. hortorum compete for nectar with honeybees, which bite holes in the flowers of red clover so that their short tongues can reach the nectar. Because B. hortorum has better visual sensitivity compared to other bees, they can start foraging earlier in the morning and return to their nests later in the day. Direct competition is thus avoided; bumblebees forage early in the morning and evening while honeybees forage during the afternoon. B. hortorum exhibit buzz pollination, a foraging behavior in which they generate vibrations that are transmitted onto the anthers of flowers, thus ejecting the pollen that they gather and then consume. In a study comparing other Bombus species, B. hortorum was found to create higher buzz amplitudes, thus making more efficient at collecting pollen. Traplining B. hortorum exhibit traplining, a foraging behavior in which they visit the same feeding areas using regular routes that they repeat over several days. The routes are unique to individual bees. Using their preferred routes, Bombus individuals move between plant groups and forage patches as they search for pollen and nectar to consume. The flight direction among these routes is often irreversible, unless environmental factors like wind interfere. Movement behavior B. hortorum have been found to fly distances up to 2.5 kilometers in a relatively short period of time, approximately one to four days. Queens in particular travel long distances in dispersal flights; this increases gene flow within the species. When traveling longer distances, bumblebees occasionally stop to rest, often resting on prominent structures in their landscape, such as trees. Unusual behavior due to transmitter attachment In a study assessing the movement behavior and flight distances of Bombus hortorum, radio tracking was used as a method to gather data on the bee's routes. To carry out this research, transmitters were attached to the bumblebee's bodies, directly on their abdomen. The bees took unusually long periods of rest and cleaning in the middle of their flight - one individual took breaks longer than forty-five minutes - in response to the extra weight and disturbance. Defense B. hortorum use defensive buzzes as warning signs and to show aggression. They are louder, produced with much more power than other buzzes. Parasites Neogregarine parasite In 1988, a new pathogen was discovered to be affecting B. hortorum workers and queens, causing the appearance of unusual spores on the bumblebees. Research confirmed that a new parasitic protozoan that belongs to the order Neogregarinida caused the infection; this was attributed to the type of spores and the life cycle associated with the protozoan. It is presumed that the parasite is widely distributed throughout Europe. Crithidia bombi Bombus hortorum serve as hosts for Crithidia bombi, a widespread gut parasite that is present in many bumblebee species. The pathogens negatively impact reproductive fitness of Bombus queens, as they affect their ovarian development as well as early colony establishment after the queens emerge from hibernation. Queens hibernating underground during the winter are not directly affected by the parasite. C. bombi‚Äôs dominant route of infection into Bombus individuals is by ingestion of the infectious agents by larvae from the workers that feed them. This process is known as vertical transmission and is greatly influenced by the number of available individuals who can serve as potential vectors. Horizontal transmission also occurs, in which foraging worker bees catch infections left on flowers by other bees. While inside their host bodies, Crithidia bombi have been discovered to reproduce clonally as well as sexually. After being ingested, the genotype of the host can play a prominent role in the development of the parasite. Bumblebee colonies that exhibit little variety in their gene pool, as a result of inbreeding, tend to have a higher occurrence of C. bombi as compared to Bombus populations with high levels of heterozygosity. Furthermore, the host genotype may affect the response to the parasite by triggering the bee's innate immune system, up-regulated effector genes that defend the host. ==Human importance== Bombus hortorum are frequent pollinators of many crops, including sunflowers, strawberries, apples, and tomatoes. The modernization of agriculture and demand for crops to feed the human population has brought about a significant increase in pesticide use. This has an adverse effect on the genus Bombus. The bees are directly exposed to the chemicals in two ways: by consuming nectar that has been directly treated with pesticide, or through physical contact with treated plants and flowers. Pesticides can impact the B. hortorum colonies by reducing brood development and also impairs their memory, preventing them from remembering the locations of their foraging sites and nests. Furthermore, when a single queen is first establishing her colony at the beginning of the season, pesticide risks could pose consequences for colony development and size. ==References== Category:Bumblebees Category:Hymenoptera of Australia Category:Hymenoptera of Europe Category:Insects described in 1761 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus Category:Hymenoptera of New Zealand ","title":"Bombus hortorum"},{"id":"20219665","text":"The Challenge...

He received his doctoral degree in 1921 from Max Planck. In 1922, while still at the University of Berlin, Gordon became the assistant of Max von Laue. In 1925, he worked for some months in Manchester with William Lawrence Bragg and later, at the Kaiser Wilhelm Society for fiber chemistry in Berlin. In 1926 he moved to Hamburg, where he attained the habilitation in 1929. In 1930 he became a professor. He married a local Hamburg woman, Gertrud Lobbenberg, in 1932. He moved to Stockholm in 1933 because of the political situation in Germany. While at the university he worked on mechanics and mathematical physics. ==Notable works== Oskar Klein and Walter Gordon proposed the Klein‚ÄìGordon equation to describe quantum particles in the framework of relativity. Another important contribution by Gordon was to the theory of the Dirac equation, where he introduced the Gordon decomposition of the current into its center of mass and spin contributions, and so helped explain the g=2 g-factor value in the electron's gyromagnetic ratio. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Poggendorff, J.

The book is a biographical portrait of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln and some of the men who served with him in his cabinet from 1861 to 1865. Three of his Cabinet members had previously run against Lincoln in the 1860 election: Attorney General Edward Bates, Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase and Secretary of State William H. Seward. The book focuses on Lincoln's mostly successful attempts to reconcile conflicting personalities and political factions on the path to abolition and victory in the American Civil War. Goodwin's sixth book, Team of Rivals was well received by critics and won the 2006 Lincoln Prize and the inaugural Book Prize for American History of the New-York Historical Society. US President Barack Obama cited it as one of his favorite books and was said to have used it as a model for constructing his own cabinet. In 2012, a Steven Spielberg film based on the book was released to critical acclaim. == Background == Team of Rivals is the sixth book by American historian Doris Kearns Goodwin. In 1995, Goodwin was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for History for her book No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II, a similar study of personalities in the Roosevelt White House. Goodwin spent ten years on the research and writing of Team of Rivals. She stated that she had been inspired to tell the stories of the four men (Seward, Chase, Bates, and Lincoln) together when realizing that the cabinet members had written extensive diaries and letters that might provide a \\"new angle\\" in Lincoln studies. During Goodwin's work on Team of Rivals, a plagiarism scandal erupted over unmarked quotations in Goodwin's 1987 book The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys. Goodwin stated that in dealing with the scandal, during which she had to apologize and make an out-of-court settlement to author Lynne McTaggart, she found Lincoln a consolation, particularly his philosophy \\"not to waste precious energies on recriminations about the past\\". In a 2012 interview, Goodwin cited early 20th- century muckraker Ida Tarbell on the pleasures of writing about Lincoln: \\"Somebody asked her, why do so many people write about Lincoln? And she said, because he's so companionable. And I think somehow that's been true for me.\\" == Contents == The book begins with an introduction where Goodwin explains how she plans to illuminate Lincoln's life: \\"In my own effort to illuminate the character and career of Abraham Lincoln, I have coupled the account of his life with the stories of the remarkable men who were his rivals for the 1860 Republican presidential nomination‚ÄîNew York senator William H. Seward, Ohio governor Salmon P. Chase, and Missouri's distinguished elder statesman Edward Bates.\\" The book is organised in two parts: Part 1 called \\"The Rivals\\" and Part 2 called \\"Master Among Men\\". The first part of the book chronicles the rise of Lincoln and each of his political rivals' journeys and how Lincoln ended up with the Presidency and ends with the inauguration of Lincoln in 1861. In the second part, Goodwin describes Lincoln's years as President of the Union through the civil war and till his eventual assassination in 1865. The first chapter of Team of Rivals portrays four major contenders for the 1860 Republican presidential nomination on May 18, 1860, awaiting the results of the national convention by telegraph: New York Senator and former governor William H. Seward, widely considered the frontrunner; Ohio Governor Salmon P. Chase, a favorite of the party's more radical wing; former Missouri Attorney General Edward Bates, preferred by more conservative elements of the party; and Abraham Lincoln, a former U.S. Representative from Illinois. Goodwin then describes how each candidate rose to national political prominence: Seward through a long alliance with New York political boss Thurlow Weed, Chase through his early advocacy of the abolition of slavery, Bates through a speech opposing President James K. Polk at the 1847 River and Harbor Convention, and Lincoln through a series of debates with Democratic rival Stephen A. Douglas in the 1858 Illinois Senate election. At the Chicago Republican Convention of 1860, Seward was the favourite, as he was the most widely recognised political figure and almost had a majority of pledges. Seward's detractors who thought that he was too radical on slavery and too liberal on immigration, were worried that if the opposition could not be united behind one man, he would be elected as the candidate - \\"Murat Halstead of the Cincinnati Commercial telegraphed the same message to his paper at the same time, reporting that \\"every one of the forty thousand men in attendance upon the Chicago Convention will testify that at midnight of Thursday‚ÄìFriday night, the universal impression was that Seward's success was certain.\\" However, it was a concern that even if Seward was elected as candidate, he would not be able to carry all the Northern States in the elections because of his abolitionist views against slavery and that would mean a Democratic win in the election. Similarly, Edward Bates could not represent the middle-line of the republican party: \\"He was much too conservative for liberal Republicans, who might welcome him into their party but would never accord him chief command of an army in which he had never officially enlisted. At the same time, the letter he had written to prove his credentials to the Republicans had diminished the previous enthusiasm of conservatives and former Know Nothings\\" Salmon Chase's candidature was hampered by attacks from Ohio politicians like Judge McLean or Ben Wade and could not mount a serious challenge. Lincoln emerged as the more palatable choice for these important delegates. Lincoln was ultimately the victor at the 1860 convention through a superior political operation and by making himself the unobjectionable second choice of all Republican factions, and proceeded to win the presidency. Determined both to hold the party together and to recruit the ablest men for his cabinet, Lincoln then persuaded each of his former rivals to join his cabinet. Seward assumed the post of Secretary of State, Chase that of Secretary of the Treasury, and Bates that of United States Attorney General. The South secedes following Lincoln's election, and the country falls into the American Civil War. Goodwin describes in detail some cabinet decisions, such as the debate over provisioning Fort Sumter in South Carolina, the first state that had seceded (in December 1860), and the issuing of the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed the slaves of secession states. She also traces the home life of the book's main figures, including the marriage of Chase's daughter and close companion Kate, First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln's role in Washington, D.C. society, and the death of Lincoln's son Willie. During the war, Seward comes to respect and collaborate with Lincoln. Chase, on the other hand, schemes against Lincoln from within the cabinet, hoping to replace him as the Republican nominee in the 1864 presidential election. Lincoln nonetheless keeps Chase in the cabinet until 1864 for his skill at financing the war effort, and his efforts to undermine the president are ultimately unsuccessful. Lincoln also recruits Chase ally Edwin M. Stanton to replace Pennsylvania political boss Simon Cameron as Secretary of War; like Seward, Stanton comes to respect and support Lincoln. While managing the disparate personalities of his cabinet, Lincoln also struggles to manage a series of generals including George B. McClellan, Henry Halleck, and George Meade. The president finally finds success in 1864 by promoting Ulysses S. Grant to commander of the Union armies. Lincoln oversees the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which abolishes slavery, and sees the war to its successful conclusion. During the battle for the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, Lincoln uses all kinds of persuasion and incentives to get the required number of votes for ratification: \\"I am President of the United States, clothed with great power. The abolition of slavery by constitutional provision settles the fate, for all coming time, not only of the millions now in bondage, but of unborn millions to come‚Äîa measure of such importance that those two votes must be procured. I leave it to you to determine how it shall be done; but remember that I am President of the United States, clothed with immense power, and I expect you to procure those votes.\\" He also appoints Chase as the Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court, believing him the best man to secure the rights of newly freed black citizens. Team of Rivals closes with the assassination of Abraham Lincoln on April 14, 1865. Seward is also attacked by a knife-wielding assailant, though he survives. An epilogue traces the later lives and deaths of Seward, Stanton, Bates, Chase, Mary Lincoln, and others. == Response == Team of Rivals was generally well received by critics. Pulitzer Prize-winning Civil War historian James M. McPherson called it \\"an elegant, incisive study of Lincoln and leading members of his cabinet that will appeal to experts as well as to those whose knowledge of Lincoln is an amalgam of high school history and popular mythology\\" and stated that Goodwin addressed Lincoln's gift for coalition-building \\"better than any other writer\\". Allen C. Guelzo wrote in The Washington Post that \\"this immense, finely boned book is no dull administrative or bureaucratic history; rather, it is a story of personalities ‚Äì a messianic drama, if you will ‚Äì in which Lincoln must increase and the others must decrease.\\" In the Seattle Times, Kimberly Marlowe Hartnett praised the book's \\"ambitious, multi-strand structure\\", concluding, \\"This monumental effort is a gift; Goodwin's work clarifies and preserves Lincoln's legacy with rare skill.\\" Randy Dotinga of the Christian Science Monitor called Team of Rivals an \\"immense and immensely readable work\\". Sanford D. Horwitt of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that Goodwin is \\"an engaging, insightful chronicler of Lincoln's Civil War presidency, although she strays from time to time from her stated intention of keeping the lens focused on Lincoln and his 1860 rivals, who, in turn, were often feuding with others in Lincoln's Cabinet.\\" In 2006, the book was awarded the Lincoln Prize, \\"awarded annually for the finest scholarly work in English on Abraham Lincoln, the American Civil War soldier, or a subject relating to their era\\". On March 29, 2006, Goodwin was announced as the winner of the $50,000 Book Prize for American History of the New-York Historical Society. Team of Rivals was also a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize. U.S. President Barack Obama named Team of Rivals as the one book he would want on a desert island. As a senator, he met with Goodwin in Washington to discuss the book. After his election in 2008, Obama reached out to previous rivals including Hillary Clinton, who became his Secretary of State, drawing comparisons to Lincoln's \\"Team of Rivals\\" approach. ==Film adaptation== While consulting on a project for director Steven Spielberg in 1999, Goodwin told Spielberg she was planning to write Team of Rivals, and Spielberg immediately told her he wanted the film rights. DreamWorks finalized the deal in 2001, and Goodwin sent Spielberg the book chapter by chapter as she composed it. Daniel Day-Lewis agreed to play Abraham Lincoln after Liam Neeson, the original lead, withdrew from the project in 2010. The screenplay was written by Tony Kushner, who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay). A number of critics noted that the final film, which focused almost entirely on the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment through Congress, was based on only a few pages of Goodwin's book, and that Kushner did substantial independent research composing the screenplay. Filming began on October 17, 2011, and ended on December 19, 2011. Goodwin consulted with Kushner on various drafts of the screenplay and took Day-Lewis on a tour of Lincoln's home and law office in Springfield, Illinois. The film was released nationwide on November 16, 2012 to commercial success and wide critical acclaim. Day-Lewis won the 2012 Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance. ==References== Bibliography * ==External links== * Team of Rivals at doriskearnsgoodwin.com * Category:2005 non-fiction books Category:21st-century history books Category:American biographies Category:American history books Category:Biographies of Abraham Lincoln Category:Books adapted into films Category:History books about the American Civil War Category:Simon & Schuster books ","title":"Team of Rivals"},{"id":"20219687","text":"The short-haired bumblebee or short-haired humble-bee, Bombus subterraneus, is a species of bumblebee found in Eurasia, as well as in New Zealand, where it is an introduced species. It lived in the British Isles among other parts of Europe. This species became extinct in the British Isles in 1989. The cause of the mass and sudden extinction is debated, but many scientists believe that it was due to a lack of genetic diversity. ==Introduction and reintroduction== Bombus subterraneus was one of four species of bumblebee introduced into New Zealand from the United Kingdom between 1885 and 1906 for pollination of red clover. In New Zealand, it is the rarest of the four species, with small numbers at a few locations in inland South Island.MacFarlane, R.P.; Gurr, L. 1995. Distribution of bumble bees in New Zealand. New Zealand Entomologist 18: 29-36. The last recorded sighting of B. subterraneus in the United Kingdom was in 1988 and it is believed extinct there.

Officially, these comparisons were to identify the best qualities of the four different schools of thought of locomotive design so that they could be used in the planned BR standard designs.

The work had its German premiere in Berlin on 7 November 2008 in a production by the Berliner Kammeroper, directed by Kay Kuntze. ==Critical reception== Reviews have generally been favourable, particularly in respect of Birtwistle's music. The composer's virtuosic use of a chamber ensemble, rather than the huge orchestral and electronic forces deployed, for instance, in The Mask of Orpheus, is generally seen as having produced an intensely atmospheric and psychologically insightful score. * \\"Like the man and the woman themselves... we've been somewhere strange and something troubling has happened to us. And when we come out we're not quite the people we were when we went in.\\"George Hall, Exactly what sort of shenanigans occurred on the parlour table?, The Observer, 11 July 2004. The Observer (London). * \\"A marvellous score, one of Birtwistle's most lyrical, with episodes of piercing beauty, moving solos, expressive themes in repetition or sequence, clarinet writing, string writing, and vocal writing that stirred the heart.\\"Andrew Porter, Love affair and variations, The Times, 23 July 2004 The Times (London). * \\"What is striking above all is the utterly tender songfulness of this music. As you depart into the night, you know that you have heard a true Passion, that is, the passion and ritual of a timeless, eternal pattern.\\" \\"Alban Nikolai Herbst\\" (Alexander von Ribbentrop), Die Geburt des Gottes aus dem Bock (review of the German premiere), Die Dschungel, 8 November 2008 Die Dschungel, Germany. * \\"The sense of something dark being stirred to life, of violence tightly contained, was riveting. The music, fascinating in its endlessly varied monotony, was exquisitely played, and the beautifully designed production seemed the perfect revelation of the work in all its vivid strangeness.\\" Ivan Hewett, A work of vivid strangeness stirs into life, The Daily Telegraph, 14 June 2004The Daily Telegraph (London). * \\"Birtwistle‚Äôs haunting, inventive music delves‚Ä¶deeply into the longings and confusion of the estranged lovers‚Ä¶ it may be the most lyrical music the composer has written for the stage.\\"Quoted on Boosey & Hawkes, the publishers of the score. Chicago Tribune Some critics found The Io Passion dated in its attitudes to sexuality. \\"The notion that a holiday fling on a Greek island - however intense the connection, however heavy with meaning, however supernatural - might be analogous to the rape of Io by Zeus is peculiar enough. That that analogy might be titillating to someone whose former lover has effectively become her stalker smacks of the era when liberal men would chomp on their cigars while discussing the female orgasm.\\"Anna Picard, A simple and seductive passion, The Independent, 27 June 2004 Others, like \\"Alban Nikolai Herbst\\", found more unsettling depths beneath apparent glibness. Discussing a scene in which ferocious argument leads to a passionate kiss, he writes, > Harrison Birtwistle's opera, then, does not merely concern itself with the > truth of the mythical parable - how the ancient Cretan matriarchy was > conquered by invading tribes, how the Mother Goddess was usurped by a Zeus > whose barbarian horniness knew no bounds... That is a sinister and accurate > picture, the picture of the powerlessness of cultures. But still, it isn't > that simple. Something else is working through these characters and gods, > something beyond their own will. Zeus is not merely an overpowerer.

The man posts a letter. The woman swats away a fly which is irritating her. The same scene is re-enacted in variations of increasing complexity, gradually unveiling layers of stories from the past. The man and the woman met at Lerna in Greece, the venue of one of the Mysteries of the ancient world, and the place where Zeus seduced the priestess Io and turned her into a heifer to hide her from his jealous wife, Hera. Hera sent a gadfly to madden the heifer, and Io roamed the world trying to flee it. The intense, compulsive passion of the lovers at Lerna awoke the ancient gods, who scented sacrifice. An outrage was committed, which has never been avenged. Back in the city, the woman refuses to see the man, clinging to her domestic routine and trying to deal with the terrible manifestation they witnessed in Greece. But neither the gods nor the man will leave the woman alone, and the civilised veneer of her existence is gradually stripped away. ==References== Category:Operas by Harrison Birtwistle Category:English- language operas Category:2004 operas Category:Operas Category:Operas based on Greco-Roman mythology ","title":"The Io Passion"},{"id":"20219725","text":"The 1971 France rugby union tour of South Africa was a series of matches played by the France national rugby union team in South Africa in June 1971.

Bangladeshis were the first to have started the curry industry in the UK, from small businesses. The curry is now regarded as Britain's National dish. Many others also own supermarket stores specialising in Bangladeshi products, and also in the media, the main Bengali channels - Bangla TV and Channel S. ==Curry industry== Today many of the Bangladeshi community are now part of the Curry Industry in Britain, more than 8 out of 10 Indian restaurants in the UK are owned by British Bangladeshis, 95% of which come from Sylhet. The number of restaurants owned by Bangladeshis increased rapidly years after years. In 1946, there were 20 restaurants or small cafes which were owned by Bengalis; then in 1960 there were 300 owned; and by 1980, more than 3,000 have been created by them. Now, as of today there are 8,500 Indian restaurants, of which around 7,200 are Bangladeshi. One of the main dishes in those restaurants, the chicken tikka masala, is now regarded as Britain's national food dish. The curry industry is seen as a great success for Bangladeshis living in Britain, the industry which changed the culture of food in British cuisine. Chicken tikka masala is now served in restaurants around the globe, and a UK survey claimed it is the country's most popular restaurant dish.Lloyd, J & Mitchinson, J: \\"The Book of General Ignorance\\". Faber & Faber, 2006. One in seven curries sold in the UK is a chicken tikka. The popularity of the dish led the British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook to proclaim it as Britain's true national dish,. Former prime minister, Tony Blair also recognised it as the favourite dish, by eating at a Bangladeshi curry restaurant for his daughter's birthday. Curry threat In April 2008, restaurants owned by Bangladeshis came under threat. Many of those who work in these businesses are recent immigrants legally brought in from outside the UK. The British government announced it would change immigration laws for these workers, blocking access for high skilled chefs from Bangladesh. The law demanded these workers speak fluent English, and have good formal qualifications in order to meet the requirements of society and work in Britain. These laws have not only affected the Bangladeshis, but have hit other migrant workers from China and India. However, the legislation may have a particularly dramatic effect on Bangladeshis because so many of them rely heavily on the curry business. It has been estimated that 30% of their restaurant businesses are seriously threatened by these new laws. On 20 April 2008, 44,000 people gathered and protested in London, including Bangladeshis, Chinese and Indians and other groups who were unhappy with the changes to the law. They argued their contribution to the economy of the United Kingdom meant they deserved better treatment. ==Local business== Many other Bangladeshis own grocery stores. Whitechapel has a thriving local street market which is located opposite the famous Royal London Hospital, which is the largest hospital in Britain. The market offers many low-priced goods for the people working in the area and the local Bengali community. People will go there to grab a bargain every day from Monday to Saturday, which contains over 80 stalls selling many products and foods, everything from fresh fruit to fish, clothing, bedding, carpets, jewellery and electrical goods such as toys. The nearby East London Mosque ensures a steady stream of visitors and many stalls now sell Indian spices and exotic vegetables as well as great quality silks and saree fabric. In Brick Lane, other than curry being served, there are many Bengali staples available such as jack fruit, betel nut and paan leaves and frozen fish caught from the Surma River. Various travel agents offer many flights to Sylhet with the national airline, Biman Bangladesh Airlines, for around ¬£500 and a new airline called, Air Sylhet was created by British Bangladeshi diaspora, offering low cost flights between both countries. Every Bangladeshi business located in the East End seems to hark back to the city of Sylhet, for example the Weekly Sylheter Dak - which has a UK circulation of around 7,000 a week; a shop called Sylhet Stores; a lawyers' office called Sylhet & Co; and a Bangladeshi Welfare Association. There are also booming black market in money transfer, such as First Solution Money Transfer which in June 2007, the company went into liquidation owing nearly ¬£2 million to the public who used their services. Seamark and Ibco, owned by millionaire Iqbal Ahmed,UK's appetite for Prawns is Fed by Brutality Abroad - The Observer Taj Stores, First Bangladeshi Real Estates in UK called Masha Estates Ltd and many others. The International, Bangladeshi grocery store, Taj Stores There also hundreds of fast food stores scattered across east London, owned by Bangladeshis. Mainly named as Perfect Fried Chicken or Halal Fried Chicken and many other names. These fast food shops are primarily found in the area of Stepney Green. == Media == People have gone beyond by working in media, where the first Bangladeshi channel abroad was created called Bangla TV in 1999, and later another channel called Channel S in 2004, 19 October 2017 another channel launched called ION TV UK to Asian community' reflects on the programs it broadcasts, with many talk shows offering advice from lawyers and barristers such as 'Legal Advice', talk shows, Bengali film and entertainment, an Islamic voice for the community, and much of the channel is broadcast in the community language, Sylheti - the only Bangladeshi channel to do so. Channel S had acquired the rights to broadcast the Baishakhi Mela, and there has been bitter rivalry between both channels. Also Bangla news published from London are Weekly Surma, Notun Din, Jonomot, daily Amader Protidin, Probasha Protidin, Potrica etc. Other notable business companies include, NRB Media, Masha Estates Ltd, Purple i - an IT expert company providing solutions to many restaurants, == First Solution Money Transfer == In July 2007, a British-based firm called 'First Solution Money Transfer' went into liquidation. Company chairman, Dr Fazal Mahmood, admitted the business owed hundreds of thousands of pounds to the public. The firm claimed it had lost control of the money it handled due to a lack of regulation in this fast-growing sector of the economy. The company was heavily used by the Bangladeshi community to send money to relatives in Bangladesh. However, huge amounts of this cash were lost. The scandal provoked anger amongst the community. Dr Mahmood received death threats and his home was pelted with eggs. Local leaders asked tough questions about the business's management, and the MP George Galloway raised the matter in the House of Commons. It eventually emerged that the company had lost an estimated 1.7 million pounds of public money. ==See also== * List of British Bangladeshis * Economy of Bangladesh ==References== Category:Bangladeshi diaspora in the United Kingdom Category:Business in the United Kingdom ","title":"Business of British Bangladeshis"},{"id":"20219777","text":"The Wild and the Brave, also known as Two Men of Karamoja, is a 1974 American documentary film directed by Eugene S.

Gabriel Garc√≠a Moreno is the father of Ecuadorian conservatism and no doubt the most controversial figure in the nation's history, condemned by Liberal historians as Ecuador's worst tyrant but exalted by Conservatives as the nation's greatest nation-builder. In the end, both appraisals may be accurate; the man who possibly saved Ecuador from disintegration in 1859 and then ruled the nation with an iron fist for the subsequent decade and a half was, in fact, an extremely complicated personality. Born and raised under modest circumstances in Guayaquil, he studied in Quito, where he married into the local aristocracy, then traveled to Europe in the aftermath of the 1848 revolutionary uprisings and studied under the eminent Catholic theologians of the day. Shortly after the onset of his third presidential term in 1875, Garc√≠a Moreno was hacked to death with a machete on the steps of the presidential palace. The exact motives of the assassin, a Colombian, remain unknown, but the dictator's most outstanding critic, the liberal journalist Juan Montalvo, exclaimed, \\"My pen killed him!\\" Between 1852 and 1890, Ecuador's exports grew in value from slightly more than US$1 million to nearly US$10 million. Production of cacao, the most important export product in the late 19th century, grew from 6.5 million kilograms to 18 million kilograms during the same period. The agricultural export interests, centered in the coastal region near Guayaquil, became closely associated with the Liberals, whose political power also grew steadily during the interval. After the death of Garc√≠a Moreno, it took the Liberals twenty years to consolidate their strength sufficiently to assume control of the government in Quito. Five different presidents governed during the two decades of transition between Conservative and Liberal rule. The first, Antonio Borrero, tried valiantly to return the nation to the rule of law, but, after only ten months in office, he was overthrown by the only military dictator of the period, Ignacio de Veintemilla. Although he came to power with the help of the old Liberal General Urbina, Veintemilla later evolved into a populist military dictator rather than a politician with any party or ideological affiliation. He was extremely popular with his troops and able to woo the masses with employment on public works programs and large-scale public festivals and dances during holiday periods. In office until 1883, Veintemilla enjoyed a period of relative prosperity resulting primarily from increased maritime activity while Peru, Bolivia, and Chile were mired in the War of the Pacific. Jos√© Mar√≠a Pl√°cido Caama√±o, a Conservative, then served as president until 1888, and he remained a powerful figure during the administrations of the duly elected Progressive Party (Partido Progresista) presidents who followed him, Antonio Flores Jij√≥n and Luis Cordero Crespo. Flores, who was the son of President Juan Jos√© Flores, intended progressivism to represent a compromise position between liberalism and conservatism. The Progressive program called for support for the Roman Catholic Church, rule by law, and an end to dictatorship and military rule. Although neither Caama√±o, Flores, nor Cordero was able to curtail the growing animosity between Conservatives and Liberals, their periods in office were, for the most part, characterized by relative political stability and prosperity. The latter resulted more from favorable international circumstances for cacao exports than from astute government policy making. In 1895, midway through his term in office, Cordero fell victim to scandal and charges of \\"selling the flag\\" over an agreement made with Chile. Cordero allowed the warship Esmeralda, which Chile was selling to Japan, to fly the Ecuadorian flag briefly in order to protect Chile's neutrality in the conflict between Japan and China. Bribes were apparently involved and, tremendously weakened by the scandal and also challenged by the outbreak of several military rebellions, the president resigned in April. In June the Liberals seized power in Guayaquil in the name of their most popular caudillo, General Jos√© Eloy Alfaro Delgado. Three months later, \\"the old battler\\" (a name Alfaro had earned during his armed struggle against Garc√≠a Moreno) returned after a decade of exile in Central America and marched triumphantly into Quito. It was the end of Ecuador's brief experiment with progressivism and the beginning of three stormy decades of rule by the Radical Liberal Party (Partido Liberal Radical--PLR), commonly referred to as the Liberal Party (Partido Liberal).

Consisting largely of alluvial longose groves, (or the Longoz as it is also known), but also featuring some of the Black Sea coastline, the area of the protected habitats in the reserve, together with Kamchia Sands Protected Area, totals 1.200 ha. Established in 1977, it protects the primeval forest from the intensive logging and drainage that had decimated it by mid-20th century. It is situated 25 km south of the town of Varna and is enclosed by the villages of Staro Oriahovo, Shkorpilovtsi and Bliznatsi. The biosphere reserve status was removed in 2017. ==History== A reserve was established in 1951 to protect the remnants of floodplain forests which had once covered a considerably larger area. The biosphere reserve itself was established in 1977, as with all other Biosphere Reserves in Bulgaria. The area has been subject to logging and drainage attempts in the past. The reserve status was under revision in 2016 and was withdrawn in 2017, and publicly announced on June 14. ==Geography== The core area of the reserve is 842.1 ha, (with a buffer zone of 230 ha), some 764 ha of it is afforested, and the rest 78.1 ha is not afforested, (34.5 ha of meadows, 0.4 ha of channels, 3.3 ha of openings, 21.8 ha of swamps, 9.9 ha of marshlands etc.), the reserve is 40 km in length and reaches 5 km in width in some areas. The \\"Longoz\\" forests in the lower course of the river are the best representatives of their kind throughout Europe. Within the reserve there are remnant riverine forests, small freshwater marshes of Phragmites and Typha along the riverbank, arable land (the former Staro-Oryachovo marshes), a beach with sand-dunes, and a sea bay.

The site is important for wintering Cygnus cygnus and is the most important breeding area in Bulgaria for the Middle spotted woodpecker Dendrocopos medius and the semi-collared flycatcher Ficedula semitorquata. The locality is also a major migratory bottleneck site, where 60,000 or more white storks pass overhead each autumn. Other birds include a small colony of little egrets (Egretta garzetta) and the rare half-collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis semitorquata). Twenty-five fish species have been recorded in the river, seven of which are listed under the IUCN Redlist, including wild common carp, (Cyprinus carpio), Knipowitschia caucasica and the Aral stickleback, (Pungitius platygaster). Mammals in the biosphere reserve include roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), wild boar (Sus scrofa), pine marten (Martes martes) and fox (Vulpes vulpes) There are also many reptiles and amphibians, including the European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis), tessellated water snake (Natrix tessellata) and alligator lizard (Ophisaurus apodus). There are twenty-five species of small mammals known to inhabit the reserve, including the European otter, (Lutra lutra), which is on the European IUCN Red List. Flora The forests are dominated by ash (Fraxinus oxyphylla), Ulmus, oak (Quercus pedunculiflora), Acer and Alnus, with scrub of Crataegus monogyna, Cornus, Paliurus and Ligustrum, and lianas of Clematis, Smilax and Periploca. ==Environment and Pollution== Most of the pollution in the reserve is associated with the River Kamchia's load and pollutants present there, however, that litter from tourists was once a major problem for the local authorities. Mainly this was because there was bridge which allowed people to visit the reserve. It was later destroyed and litter became less of a problem, however since it is still possible to cross the river mouth on to the beach area of the reserve, (see image), the problem has not entirely been resolved. Additionally litter and industrial pollutants are regularly washed up on the shore, much of which either come from the port of Varna or the nearby Resort of Kamchia, (which shares the same beach line). The mouth of the River Kamchia, viewing from the reserve. Note that its spit is currently facing south towards the reserve, and so much of its discharge would be directed towards the reserve's beachfront Pollution associated with the river A 2006 study conducted by the Institute of Oceanology and the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences on the water quality and its impact on the Black Sea coastal zone, (and so on the reserve as well) concluded that Other environmental issues are that the river is purportedly becoming marshy. The water lily, torfaceous snowdrop, and white Kamchia lily are also disappearing according to the World Wildlife Fund. The Storage Battery Plant in Targovishte is a significant polluter, spilling heavy metals into the Kamchia River. Cattle breeding is the second major source of water pollution and directly affects sources of drinking water. Due to a serious lack of water purification stations on cattle farms, non-purified waste waters pour into the various water basins. The same holds true for the underground waters, as nitrates, phosphates, and other minerals used in farming are dissolved and washed away by rains, to appear subsequently in water basins and mineral springs. As the river runs directly through the biosphere reserve, it has a strong impact on ecosystems within it. Since the entire area is irrigated by the river all of the animals and plants living there are dependent on it for their survival. However, on a more positive note, as a result of improvements to the Kamchia River, it no longer floods the dense forest. It was seen as responsible for the spread of Dutch elm disease, which was causing great damage to elms and ash trees. ==See also== *List of biosphere reserves in Bulgaria *River Kamchia *Varna ==References *http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=BUL+08&mode;=all UNESCO MAB Directory listing for Kamchia *https://web.archive.org/web/20070826143833/http://kamchia.net/natur_en.htm *http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/sites/index.html?action=SitHTMDetails.asp&sid;=410&m;=0 Category:Nature reserves in Bulgaria Category:Bulgarian Black Sea Coast Category:Geography of Varna Province Category:Tourist attractions in Burgas Province Category:Protected areas established in 1977 Category:1977 establishments in Bulgaria ","title":"Kamchia (biosphere reserve)"},{"id":"20219823","text":"Jacob Mossel (28 November 1704 ‚Äì 15 May 1761) went from being a common sailor to become Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies from 1750 to 1761. He was of noble birth, born in Enkhuizen. When he was 15 he left as an able-bodied seaman aboard a Fluyt (a type of Dutch sailing cargo vessel) called de Haringthuyn, bound for the Indies. As his family had a coat of arms, he was able to obtain a privileged position, through Dirk van Cloon, and was sent to the Dutch Coromandel (1721). On 30 March 1730, he married Adriana Appels, the fourteen-year-old stepdaughter of Adriaan van Pla, Governor of Dutch Coromandel. Jacob Mossel worked himself up finally to Governor and Director of Dutch Coromandel. In 1740 he got the title of Counsellor-extraordinary of the Indies and in 1742 he became a member of the Dutch Council of the Indies (Raad van Indi√´) in Batavia/Jakarta. In 1745, he became the first Director of the Amfioensoci√´teit, which tried to regulate its monopoly of the trade in opium. In 1747, he was named as the Director-General (the second highest post in the Dutch East Indies). When in 1750, Gustaaf Willem van Imhoff died, Mossel succeeded him as Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. He remained in post until his own death in 1761. Jacob Mossel ruled the Indies during a period in which things got steadily worse for the Dutch East India Company. He made may economies and he ended the war in Bantam Province, recognising that his predecessor had handled things badly. The Dutch were threatened by the expansion of the British East India Company. In the battle for Bengal, Mossel lost to the British. Mossel was a supporter of the policy to allow private entrepreneurs to trade for themselves in the territory of the Indies. This concerned small scale trading in which the Company could make no profit. Following that, Batavia/Jakarta underwent a period of growth, which, because of his successors tax regulations, came to nothing. The Company was plagued by corruption and self-interest among its office holders. Jacob Mossel was also involved in this. His great fortune could not in any case have been put together from his official salary. The initiatives he took against corruption were not very effective. To curb exaggerated displays of wealth, in 1754 he brought in a so-called \\"Regulation against pomp and splendour\\", which tried to lay down exactly what wealth an officer could display. These details went from the number of buttonholes they could have to the size of their houses. Of course, the regulations did not apply to himself, and there was great feasting at his daughter's wedding. After his death at Batavia/Jakarta, from a wasting disease, he was given a magnificent funeral. ==Sources== *Comprehensive Dutch website on the history of the Dutch Eat Indies *Inventaris van de collectie Jacob Mossel, 1699‚Äì1801.

Eloy Alfaro is the outstanding standard-bearer for Ecuador's Liberals, much as Gabriel Garc√≠a Moreno is for the Conservatives. Some Marxist groups have also looked to Alfaro; although his political program was in no way socialist, it did prove to be revolutionary in the extent to which it stripped the Roman Catholic Church of the power and privileges previously granted to it by Garc√≠a Moreno. Catholic officials and their Conservative allies did not give up without a fight, however. During the first year of Alfaro's presidency, Ecuador was ravaged by a bloody civil war in which clergymen commonly incited the faithful masses to rise in rebellion against the \\"atheistic alfaristas\\" and were, just as commonly, themselves victims of alfarista repression. The foreign-born Bishops Pedro Schumacher of Portoviejo and Arsenio Andrade of Riobamba led the early resistance to Alfaro. A fullfledged bloodbath may well have been averted only through the magnanimous efforts of the outstanding historian and Archbishop Federico Gonz√°lez Su√°rez, who urged the clergy to abandon the pursuit of politics. The Liberals can be credited with few further accomplishments of major proportions. The system of debt peonage that lingered in the sierra came under government regulations, albeit weak ones, and imprisonment for debts was finally outlawed in 1918. These and other limited social benefits gained by the Native Ecuadorians and the mixedblood montuvio (coastal mestizo) working class were overshadowed by the ruinous economic decline worldwide and the severe repression of the nascent labor movement at the hands of the Liberals during the early 1920s. Furthermore, Liberal rule did little to foster the development of stable democracy. On the contrary, the first half of the period saw even more illegal seizures of power and military- led governments than in previous decades. A major cause of the instability of the period was the lack of unity within the PLR itself. Alfaro and a second military strongman, General Le√≥nidas Plaza Guti√©rrez, maintained a bitter rivalry over party leadership for almost two decades. Following Alfaro's first period in the presidency, Plaza was elected to a constitutional term of office that lasted from 1901 until 1905. In 1906, shortly after a close associate of Plaza had been elected to succeed him, however, Alfaro launched a coup d'√©tat and returned to the presidency. Alfaro, in turn, was overthrown in 1911 after refusing to hand power over to his own hand-picked successor, Emilio Estrada. Four months later, Estrada's death from a heart attack precipitated a brief civil war that climaxed the rivalry between Alfaro and Plaza. Alfaro returned from his exile in Panama to lead the Guayaquil garrison in its challenge to the Quito-based interim government, which was under the military authority of General Plaza. The rebellion was quickly defeated, however; Alfaro was captured and transported to Quito via the same railroad that he had done so much to complete. Once in the capital, Alfaro was publicly and unceremoniously murdered, along with several of his comrades, by a government-instigated mob. Uprisings by his supporters (see Concha Revolution) were crushed. Shortly thereafter, Plaza was inaugurated into his second presidential term in office. It was the first of four consecutive constitutional changes of government: following Plaza (1912‚Äì16) came Alfredo Baquerizo Moreno (1916‚Äì20), then Jos√© Luis Tamayo (1920‚Äì24), and Gonzalo C√≥rdova (1924‚Äì25). Real power during this second half of the period of Liberal rule was held, not by the government, but by a plutocracy of coastal agricultural and banking interests, popularly known as la argolla (the ring), whose linchpin was the Commercial and Agricultural Bank of Guayaquil led by Francisco Urbina Jado. This bank gained influence by loaning vast quantities of money to the free-spending government as well as to private individuals. According to Ecuadorian historian Oscar Efren Reyes, the bank was influential \\"to the point that candidates for president and his ministers, senators, and deputies had to have the prior approval of the bank\\". Many of the private loans were to members of the Association of Agriculturists of Ecuador, an organization that also received government funds intended to promote an international cartel of cacao growers, but which instead were used to line members' pockets. All parties involved in la argolla, from the government officials to the bankers and the growers, were professed militants of the Liberal cause. It was not only the political fortunes of the party that fell victim to their financial activities, however, but also the national economy, which experienced runaway inflation as a result of the printing of money by the private banks. The severe economic problems during the final years of Liberal rule were also partially caused by factors beyond the control of the politicians. A fungal disease that ravaged Ecuador's cacao trees and the growth of competition from British colonies in Africa abruptly ended conditions that had favored Ecuador's exportation of cacao for over a century. What was left of the nation's cacao industry fell victim to the sharp decline in world demand during the Great Depression. Ecuador's economic crisis of the early 1920s was especially devastating to the working class and the poor. With real wages, for those lucky enough to have jobs, eaten away by inflation, workers responded with a general strike in Guayaquil in 1922, and a peasant rebellion in the central Sierra the following year. Both actions were aimed at improving wages and working conditions; both were put down only after massacres of major proportions. President Gonzalo C√≥rdova, closely tied to La Argolla (the ring), had come to office in a fraudulent election. Popular unrest, together with the ongoing economic crisis and a sickly president, laid the background for a bloodless coup d'√©tat in July 1925. Unlike all previous forays by the military into Ecuadorian politics, the coup of 1925 was made in the name of a collective grouping rather than a particular caudillo. The members of the League of Young Officers who overthrew C√≥rdoba came to power with an agenda, which included a wide variety of social reforms, the replacement of the increasingly sterile Liberal-Conservative debate, and the end of the rule of the Liberals, who had become decadent after three decades in power.

He became interested in printing in his twenties and first experimented with type and a home-made press in Oxford in 1934.Letter to D. Chambers, 1969 (private collection). In the following year Morris bought his first iron hand-presses (a small Albion press and a larger Columbian press) and established the Latin Press at Langford, near Bristol, undertaking some of his earliest work for Bristol Zoo.Baker 1969, p. 144. Morris was a passionate printer and typographical designer, but he was not a good businessman and had to move several times, suffering a series of difficulties and bankruptcy before being called up for active service in 1940. He suffered a breakdown during the War, and for a short while ran a tea-shop with his first wife, Doreen.Letter to E. Gordon Craig, 1944 (Biblioth√®que Nationale de France). In 1946, after the break-up of his marriage, he moved to St Ives in Cornwall and re-established the Latin Press. Here he printed posters, catalogues and other ephemera for the local artistic community, and had his most settled period, continuing to operate until 1953, when the Press was again declared bankrupt. Later he worked as an editor and as a guard on London Underground. In 1969 an article about his life and work appeared in The Private Library,Baker 1969. and interest in his printing was revived, not least with Morris himself, who bought a small press and began to print again, this time calling his press the \\"Officina Mauritiana\\" or \\"Officina Guidonis\\".Wilkinson 1995. He printed some ephemera and pamphlets between 1970 and 1974, but did not produce work on the scale, or of the quality, of his Latin Press days. Morris's printing was chiefly \\"jobbing\\" work, and he saw himself as a fine jobbing printer. He disliked printing books, although he printed several, for various clients over the years, which work he usually regarded with disdain.Morris, G. \\"My work as a printer\\", The Cornish review, 3, 1949, pp. 61-66. He did, however, attempt to launch an artistic/literary periodical called Loquela Mirabilis of which only three issues appeared in 1936 and 1937 before he was forced to abandon the project. While at Saint Ives, he also instituted a series of pamphlets called the Crescendo Poetry Series which was a little more successful, including new work by a number of contemporary poets (as well as by Morris himself). The first Crescendo pamphlet appeared in 1951 and the eighth, and last, in June 1952. Morris generally used Bembo type for his work at the Latin Press, though he did possess other typefaces and once remarked that he believed he had made a mistake in selecting Bembo as his \\"house\\" fount.Letter to Will Ransom, 1937 (Newberry Library, Chicago). When he re-established his press in 1970 he bought Van Dijck types instead. Morris was a handsome man, with a charming manner, wit, intelligence and intellectual curiosityInformation gathered by P.W.

Specimens of his printing have been collected since the 1930s, and major collections can be found at the Bodleian Library, the British Library (although currently (2008) the main portfolio of ephemera is missing), the Newberry Library at Chicago, and the Biblioth√®que Nationale de France, as well as in several private collections.

They have won the LNFA once, in 2001, and were runners-up in 1999, 2002 and 2012. They have also conquered the Spanish Cup in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2007 and 2009. ==History==  The beginnings  The team was established in the spring of 1989 as Madrid Bears, changing names to Madrid Osos when they joined their first official competition by the end of that year, the Second Catalan Football League. During those first years, the team received a lot of help (equipment, players, coaching staff, etc.) from the American soldiers stationed at the nearby base of Torrej√≥n. The team played their first game in the Community of Madrid before 500 spectators in a friendly match against the Barcelona B√∫fals in July 1989, which despite ending in a 14-6 defeat left a good impression and was vital to the development of new teams such as Madrid Panthers, Toros de Madrid (Madrid Bulls) and Delfines de Madrid (Madrid Dolphins). The Bears' first participation in official competition implied searching for a sponsor, to reduce the cost of equipment. American football in Spain was practiced only in the area of Catalonia, so the Bears entered the II Catalan Football League. Their first game in the league was against the incumbent league champions, Badalona Dracs. The Dracs were defeated by the Bears who only had played one game before then. Madrid Osos reached the semifinals undefeated that year, being defeated then by the Dracs. The Osos participation in this competition ended in fourth position. The II Football Supercopa of Spain was a progression in the sport for the Osos, as the team reached the Cup final against the mighty Barcelona Boxers in a great match in the Olympic Stadium in Barcelona, in which the Boxers won before 25,000 spectators. The Madrid Bears lost, and remained runners-up. Since then, the Bears have continued to be one of the greatest teams in football in Spain, always playing in the First Division.  The 1990s  * 1991. There is a split into two leagues, the League remains Catalana (FCFA), and creating a new business called Spain League Football League in which teams from all over Spain and which is transmitted by television. The league did not have much commercial success due to lack of sport for the audience. As far as sport was a success for the Bears, being a semifinalist in the two years. * 1993. Change the organization of the league to become organized by themselves Clubs (AFL); Bears again be a semifinalist. * 1994. AFL leagues and CFA are united in AEFA and creating the first National Football League unified with 20 teams in the competition. Start a generational change in Bears coinciding with the height of other teams, which makes the writing a few years without notable rankings: 7th, 9th, 7th and 8th but always stays in first division. * 1999. Bears Madrid proves again that is in the elite American football in Spain, getting a staff to be finalists national league, winning all matches played under the final. Never in the history of any equipment LNFA had made it to the Final without foreign players. The second offers the possibility to play Bears for the first time the European Football League, being eliminated in the first round for the Argonauts. The next season will again be at a good level, but have to settle for being a semifinalist in LNFA.  From 2000  * 2000. The team moved its headquarters to the town of Rivas, a town of 25,000 inhabitants, situated 15 km from Madrid, with the intention of developing a major football program in a town with very young population and devoted to the sport as a basis for youth development Rivas. Schools are created Bears in a new phase. * 2001. Tis the season for the confirmation of a job well done with the base, and making up the National League Championship and Cup of Spain without foreign signings. In addition to the championship of Spain Flag (Football contactless) played in Santurce. The League victory entitles the Bears team to the second participation in the European Football League. * 2002. Season of permanent settlement, is still with the same coach and are incorporated reinforcements in the face of European competition, and consolidation in the league and Cup This is achieved for the second consecutive Cup in Spain against Dracs. In League things are going very well and gets to close the regular season without losing a game and plants on the way back against Dracs. Too bad for failures and nervousness in the Finals, it was lost, until the last minute can choose the title. With regard to Europe had to face Lions Bergamo, Italy penta champion and Champion of Europe in the last two editions, which would also have to add this year. In the game of Rivas, with a packed stadium (about 1,000 spectators), the Italians were placed in a tough game in which the Bears gave no time lost the match and fought until the end. The result was 7-35. In the second leg more affected by rain Bears team that could not deploy their passing game thereby weakening the chances of at least stand up more plausible. The final result was 55-0. * 2003. It started with the aim of revalidation for the third consecutive Cup title, a goal that was achieved by defeating the team from Badalona again in the final. It pulled the European Cup competition, which the team gave up by not having a budget capable of making us competitive in continental competition. And in the National League was able to access the semifinals again. * 2004. The season was raised in the same way as above, but with the hope of being the only team to win four Cups in Spain in a row. But our hopes hit the wall after losing in the final against Badalona Dracs, who took their revenge after three years of victories for Bears. In the domestic competition and the absence of foreign contract achieved a pass to the semifinals. The joys of the season came for the procurement of R Madrid Liga and the Championship U16 flag that took the kids in Rivas and thus to represent the first tournament in Madrid in the autonomous community of Flag Football. * 2005. It was a transition year as sports and institutionally: there was a change in the policy team, signed a new agreement with the City and wanted to further boost the ranks. In the sporting arena reached the semifinals in the crown of Spain and got a very creditable fourth place in the league, a position not expected from the start to the season as the limited budget and low key players were an added disadvantage the competition. Opened at lower levels than the U-18 with two official parties and the future of the team put in Rivas players as the team comprises 14 players of this our town. And the Under-16 team for the second year remained champions of Flag Madrid which led them to represent Madrid in the Spanish Flag Bowl Championship U-16, achieving the fifth place. * 2006. Season settlement of the new sports policy and consolidation, has again demonstrated that it is one of the teams, players, Spain's strongest, managing to reach the final of the Cup of Spain and has successfully completed the regular phase in first position, but falling in the semifinals defeated the classification in the season falls to third in the league. In lower categories U-18 team has participated in the first National Junior League getting the Eighth, is a very young team that needs more running but still the team's future. And the Under-16 team for the third year has become League Champion Flag Madrile√±a which led them again to represent Madrid in the Spanish Flag Bowl Championship U-16 where they managed to finish third. * 2007. Madrid Osos again won the Cup in Spain against Pioners L'Hospitalet in Rivas (20-3), in the semifinals defeating Valencia Firebats League champion 2006 and 2007 - after a tight match (7-6) . * 2008. Repeated Osos Cup final against Spain L'Hospitalet Pioners; this time winning the Catalan side. In its participation in the XIII edition of the Bears LNFA demonstrated excellent offensive game, finishing as the second highest-scoring team in the league. Rivas's squad was led by Scott Mackey, quarterback from Wayne State University, due to the injury suffered by the historic Bears quarterback, Toni Velasco. The team concluded the regular season as the third place with a record of 6-2, losing in the semifinals in Valencia against Firebats ADT. It was also remarkable, after several years of work at lower levels, incorporating the first player the team coming from the quarry in recent years. * 2009-2010. In the last two years Osos reached the semifinals of the National League left in fourth place in the competici√≥n. The team is in a process of generational replacement that makes the average age of the team is very young. This coupled with the excellent preparation of the players that have formed in different categories of the Club, through Flagfootball, cadet, junior and team B has the potential of the immediate future is very good opting to major sporting successes. * 2010-2011. In this season Osos build a great team achievement among national players and transfers. Players such as Georgia Tech center Sean Bedford, the offensive tackle Rune Jensen from Denmark, the offensive tackle Matt Luck of England and American quarterback Scott Mackey completed a large roster that played good football despite being unable to reach semifinals competition. But the leap was great and the experience of our young players can face us with optimism for next season. The team may choose to what is proposed. * 2011-2012. In this season Osos continue building a great team.

Heartbroken at the dissolution of Gran Colombia, Bol√≠var is quoted to have said shortly before his death, \\"America is ungovernable. Those who have served the revolution have plowed the sea.\\" These words would seem prophetic during the chaotic first thirty years in the existence of Ecuador. General Juan Jos√© Flores became the first President of Ecuador, ruling from 1830 to 1834. In 1834, facing a rebellion, he co-opted its presidential choice, Jos√© Vicente Rocafuerte y Rodr√≠guez de Bejarano, and supported his presidency, while retaining considerable power as the commander of the military. In 1839, Rocafuerte retired, and Flores regained the presidency. In 1845, the Marcist Rebellion forced him into exile. The next fifteen years saw much turmoil, as various factions struggled for supremacy. Matters came to a head in 1859, the \\"Terrible Year\\" in Ecuadorian history. Then President Francisco Robles faced several opposition movements. Neighboring Peru, under President Ram√≥n Castilla, began negotiating with all factions and imposed a blockade. On Castilla's suggestion, the four competing Ecuadorian governments selected General Guillermo Franco to negotiate with him. When the various factions realized that Franco had betrayed them, they banded together. At the Battle of Guayaquil, fought between September 22‚Äì24, 1860, Franco was defeated, and a new conservative era of government was ushered in. ==Beginnings of the Republic of Ecuador== Independence did not bring a revolutionary liberation of the masses of Ecuadorian peasants. On the contrary, as bad as the peasants' situation had been, it probably worsened with the loss of the Spanish royal officials who had protected the indigenous population against the abuses of the local criollo elite. These criollos, who had spearheaded the struggle for independence, were to be its principal beneficiaries. General Juan Jos√© Flores, the first President of Ecuador The early battle for control of the new state was fought, to a great extent, among the various factions--Ecuadorian and foreign, military and civilian--of this elite. General Juan Jos√© Flores, the \\"Founder of the Republic\\" and first President of Ecuador, was of the foreign military variety. Born in Venezuela, he had fought in the wars for independence with Bol√≠var, who had appointed him governor of Ecuador during its association with Gran Colombia. Although of humble origins with little formal education, Flores married into the Quite√±o elite, gaining acceptance, initially at least, within the local criollo upper class. As a leader, however, he appeared primarily interested in maintaining his power. Military expenditures, from the wars of independence and from an unsuccessful campaign to wrest Cauca Province from Colombia in 1832, kept the state treasury empty while other matters were left unattended. In 1833, four intellectuals who had begun publishing the newspaper El Quite√±o Libre to denounce the \\"pillaging of the national treasury by foreigners\\" were killed by the authorities at a time when Flores was absent from Quito. Although not directly responsible for the killings, Flores inevitably became associated with them, and criticism of his regime grew. In 1834, opponents staged a rebellion in an effort to place Jos√© Vicente Rocafuerte y Rodr√≠guez de Bejarano, a member of the Guayaquil aristocracy who had recently returned from fourteen years abroad, in the presidency. The effort failed; Flores then co- opted his opponent and sponsored Rocafuerte as a presidential candidate. For four years following this Machiavellian political move, in effect the nation's first coup d'√©tat, Flores continued to wield considerable power behind the scenes as commander of the military. President Rocafuerte's most lasting contribution was to begin development of a public school system. Although he had previously condemned Flores's violations of civil liberties, Rocafuerte argued that \\"the backwardness of Ecuador makes enlightened despotism necessary.\\" At the end of his term in 1839, Rocafuerte returned to his native Guayaquil as provincial governor, while in Quito Flores was again inaugurated as president. After four years in office, Flores summoned a constitutional convention that wrote a new constitution, dubbed \\"the Charter of Slavery\\" by his opponents, and elected him to a new eight-year term of office. After 1843, opposition to Flores often manifested itself in unpleasant ways: in reference to the dark skin of Flores and his fellow Venezuelan and Colombian soldiers, Rocafuerte (by now exiled in Lima) wrote that \\"the white oppressors of the peninsula were less oppressive than the Negro vandals who have replaced them.\\" A young student named Gabriel Garc√≠a Moreno--later to become the most infamous of all of Ecuador's nineteenth century dictators--tried unsuccessfully to assassinate Flores. ==The Marcist Revolution== Discontent had become nationwide by 1845, when an insurrection in Guayaquil forced Flores from the country. Because their movement triumphed in March (marzo), the anti-Flores coalition members became known as marcistas. They were an extremely diverse lot that included liberal intellectuals, conservative clergymen, and representatives from Guayaquil's successful business community. On March 6, 1845, the people of Guayaquil revolted against the government of the General Flores under the leadership of General Ant√≥nio Elizalde and Lieutenant Colonel Fern√°ndo Ayarza. The people took over the artillery barracks of Guayaquil along with other military and civilian supporters, including the guard on duty. Flores surrendered on his plantation, La Elvira, near Babahoyo and agreed to terms that included his leaving power and rendering all his decrees, laws, and acts void and null, ending fifteen years of foreign domination of Ecuador. Flores received 20,000 pesos for his property and immediately left the country for Spain. The country was then governed by the triumvirate composed of Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Olmedo, Vicente Ram√≥n Roca and Diego Noboa. In 1846 the child Agust√≠n Mu√±oz de Borb√≥n, the half-brother of queen Isabella II of Spain, became a candidate for the throne of Ecuador.Ralph W. Haskins, \\"Juan Jos√© Flores and the Proposed Expedition against Ecuador, 1846-1847\\"The Hispanic American Historical Review 27, no. 3 (August 1947): 467-95. Camilo Destruge, La expedici√≥n Flores: Proyecto de monarquia americana, 1846-47 (Guayaquil: Impr. de el Tiempo, 1906). The proposal was made by Flores, former President of Ecuador, and consisted of two parts: the first one was declare Agust√≠n as King of Ecuador, with his mother and Flores as Regents, and then as Restorer of the monarchy in Per√∫ and Bolivia, converting him in the monarch of the tentative United Kingdom of Ecuador, Per√∫ and Bolivia. While at first the proposal received some support from the Spanish and British governments, it collapsed. The next fifteen years constituted one of the most turbulent periods in Ecuador's century and a half as a nation. The marcistas fought among themselves almost ceaselessly and also had to combat Flores' repeated attempts from exile to overthrow the government. The first marcista president was businessman Vicente Ram√≥n Roca, who served a full four-year term. The most significant figure of the era, however, was General Jos√© Mar√≠a Urbina, who first came to power in 1851 through a coup d'√©tat, remained in the presidency until 1856, and then continued to dominate the political scene until 1860. During this decade and the one that followed, Urbina and his archrival, Garc√≠a Moreno, would define the rivalry between liberals from Guayaquil and conservatives from Quito that remained the major sphere of political struggle in Ecuador into the 1980s. Liberalism under Urbina took on anticlerical, ethnic, and regional dimensions. In 1852 he accused a group of Jesuit priests --admitted by his predecessor, Diego Noboa, only a year earlier--of political meddling and expelled them. Urbina freed the nation's slaves exactly one week after his coup of 1851, and six years later, his successor and lifelong friend, General Francisco Robles, finally put an end to three centuries of annual payments of tribute by the native peoples. Henceforth, liberalism associated itself with bettering the position of Ecuador's non-white population. Urbina and Robles also favored Guayaquil businessmen over Quito landowners. ==1857: beginnings of renewed conflict with Peru== The early years of the Republic of Ecuador were spent under debt moratorium on the international financial market. The debts had been incurred during the Gran Colombia era, and had been assumed by President Flores in 1837.St John, p.59 The debt owed to Great Britain, known as the Deuda inglesa (\\"English debt\\") exceeded 6.6 million pounds sterling, of which Ecuador owed 21.5 percent, or 1.4 million pounds. As the Ecuadorian government had done at least twice previously, President Francisco Robles attempted to settle this debt by transferring title over part of its territory; the lands would go to the creditors represented by the Ecuador Land Company, Ltd. Relations between Ecuador and neighboring Peru had been cut off since 1855, but were reestablished by August 1857. In November, Peru formally claimed its right to the lands that were to be sold to the British creditors. Attempts at diplomatic resolution resulted in another breakdown of relations, and in October 1858, the Peruvian government authorized President Ram√≥n Castilla to go to war with Ecuador if necessary to resolve the matter. A blockade of Ecuador's ports began in November. ==1859: the Terrible Year== General Francisco Robles, constitutional President of Ecuador By 1859, known in Ecuadorian history books as the \\"Terrible Year\\", the country was poised on the brink of a leadership crisis. President Robles, faced with the threat of the Peruvian blockade, moved the national capital to Guayaquil, and charged General Jos√© Mar√≠a Urbina with defending it. In the wake of this unpopular move, a series of opposition movements championed by regional caudillos were formed.Avil√©s Pino; Hoyos Galarza, p. 60 On May 1, a conservative triumvirate, initiated by Dr. Gabriel Garc√≠a Moreno, Pac√≠fico Chiriboga and Jer√≥nimo Carri√≥n (Robles' vice president), formed the Provisional Government of Quito. On May 6, Carri√≥n separated himself from the triumvirate, and formed a short- lived government in the city of Cuenca; he was deposed the next day by forces loyal to Robles. General Urbina promptly set out for Quito to subdue Garc√≠a Moreno and his movement. The Provisional Government was no match for Urbina, and fell in June. Garc√≠a Moreno fled to Peru, where he requested the support of President Castilla; the Peruvian leader supplied him with weapons and ammunition to subvert the Robles regime. Believing that he had the support of the Peruvians, in July, Garc√≠a Moreno published a manifesto in a July edition of the Peruvian newspaper El Comercio, calling on his countrymen to accept Peru as their ally against Robles, despite the territorial dispute and blockade. Shortly afterwards, Garc√≠a Moreno traveled to Guayaquil, where he met with General Guillermo Franco, General Commander of the District of Guayas and third in the Urvinista caudillo hierarchy, after Urbina and Robles. Garc√≠a Moreno proposed that they disavow Robles' government and declare free elections. While Franco accepted, he also aspired to the presidency of the republic, and would prove to be willing to betray his country to satisfy his desire for power. Dr. Gabriel Garc√≠a Moreno, leader of the Provisional Government of Quito As Garc√≠a Moreno was trying to resurrect his movement, the mediation efforts of the Granadine Confederation (a short-lived federal republic) and Chile had fallen through, with both countries blaming Peru for the failure. The Peruvians were playing to all sides in the civil dispute; on August 31, 1859, Castilla betrayed his commitment to Garc√≠a Moreno, and came to an agreement with Franco that resulted in the end of the blockade of Guayaquil.Naranjo, p.146 Several weeks later, the Mosquera-Zelaya Protocol, the result of the secret agreement between Peru and Cauca to take control of Ecuador, was signed in Popay√°n. When he received word of Franco's allegiance with Castilla, Robles disavowed their treaty, and moved the capital once again, this time to Riobamba, where he handed over leadership of the government to Jer√≥nimo Carri√≥n. He and Urbina would leave the country for good within a fortnight. Meanwhile, Rafael Carvajal, a member of the defeated Provisional Government, invaded Ecuador from the border to the north; within the month, Carvajal had reestablished the Provisional Government in Quito. Finally, on September 17, Guillermo Franco declared himself Supreme Chief of Guayas;According to Avil√©s Pino, Franco declared himself Supreme Chief of Guayaquil and Cuenca on September 6, rather than September 17 however, Babahoyo, Vinces and Daule sided with the Provisional Government. On September 18, an assembly in Loja named Manuel Carri√≥n Pinzano military and civil chief of the province; the following day, Carri√≥n Pinzano called a new assembly that established a federal government presiding over Loja, El Oro and Zamora.According to Avil√©s Pino, Franco declared himself Supreme Chief on September 17, not September 19 On September 26, Cuenca affirmed its allegiance to the Provisional Government. With the domestic situation at its most tumultuous, and the Peruvian blockade of the rest of the Ecuadorian coast nearing the end of its first year, Castilla sought to take advantage of the circumstances to impose a favorable border settlement.Henderson, p. 45 On September 20, Castilla wrote to Quito to declare his support for the Provisional Government; ten days later, he sailed from Callao with an invasion force. While stopped over in the port of Paita, in Peru, Castilla proposed to the Ecuadorians that they form a single government which could negotiate an agreement to end the blockade and the territorial dispute. October 1859 Castilla and his forces arrived in Guayaquil on October 4; the next day, he met with Franco aboard the Peruvian steamer Tumbes. Castilla simultaneously sent word to Garc√≠a Moreno that he wished to meet with him as well. Garc√≠a Moreno set out for Guayaquil days later; on October 14, he arrived in Paita aboard the Peruvian ship Sachaca. When Garc√≠a Moreno became aware that an agent of Franco's was also traveling aboard the ship, he became furious, ending the possibility of discussions, writing to Castilla, \\"You have broken your promises, and I declare our alliance finished.\\" Castilla responded, \\"You sir, are nothing but a village diplomat, who does not understand the duties of a president, obligated by the demands of the position he occupies to give audience to all those who request it.\\" Treaty of Mapasingue General Guillermo Franco, Supreme Chief of Guayaquil and Cuenca Castilla reverted to negotiations solely with Franco's regime in Guayaquil; after several meetings, an initial deal was struck on November 8, 1859. Castilla ordered his troops, 5,000 strong, to disembark on Ecuadorian territory; the Peruvians set up camp at the hacienda of Mapasingue, near Guayaquil. Castilla did this to guarantee that Ecuador would fulfill its promises.Campos, p.81. In Volume V, Campos notes that \\"in effect the Generals Castilla and Franco celebrated an interview about the international matter, aboard the Peruvian steamer Tumbes, and as a result, on November 8, 1859, the Peruvian army made up of 5,000 men disembarked and took up positions in the haciendas of Mapasingue, Tornero, and Buijo, in the immediacies of Guayaquil. The occupation was explained as a guarantee that Ecuador would fulfill its promises to Peru.\\" In Loja, Manuel Carri√≥n Pinzano proposed that the four governments vying for control of Ecuador select a representative to negotiate a settlement with Castilla. On November 13, Cuenca was forced to recognize Guillermo Franco's government in Guayaquil; Franco thus became Supreme Chief of Guayaquil and Cuenca. The next day, Franco and Castilla met once again, aboard the Peruvian ship Amazonas, and made arrangements for a definitive peace treaty. Carri√≥n Pinzano's suggestion was not acted upon until November 19, when the governments of Quito, Guayas-Azuay and Loja began discussions; they agreed to delegate to Franco the task of negotiating with Peru, except on the matter of territorial sovereignty. According to the agreement signed between the governments, \\"the government of Guayaquil and Cuenca may not pledge to annex, cede or assign to any government any part of the Ecuadorian territory under any pretext or name.\\" Franco, however, had been negotiating just such matters with Castilla; they signed a preliminary convention regarding the territorial situation on December 4 for the purpose of lifting the occupation of Guayaquil and re- establishing peace.Paredes; Van Dyke, p.265 Garc√≠a Moreno soon became aware of the unauthorized pact between Franco and Castilla. In an unsuccessful attempt to seek a powerful ally, Garc√≠a Moreno sent a series of secretHenderson, p. 47 letters to the charg√© d'affaires of France, Emile Trinit√©, on December 7, 15 and 21; in them, he proposed that Ecuador become a French protectorate. Fortunately for his cause, the agreement between Franco and Castilla had the effect of uniting the disparate governments of Ecuador against their new common enemy: El Traidor (the traitor) Franco. On January 7, 1860, the Peruvian army made preparations to return home; eighteen days later, on January 25, Castilla and Franco signed the Treaty of 1860, better known as the Treaty of Mapasingue after the hacienda where the Peruvian troops were quartered.Wiesse, p.296 The treaty had as its object the resolution of the territorial debate. In its first article, it affirmed that relations were to be re-established between the two countries. The matter of the borders was dealt with in articles 5, 6 and 7, where the Icaza-Pritchett treaty was declared null, Peru's position of uti possidetis was accepted, and Ecuador was allowed two years to substantiate its ownership of Quijos and Canelos, after which time Peru's rights over the territories would become absolute if no evidence was presented.Paredes; Van Dyke, p.257: *Art. 5th. The Government of Ecuador, mindful of the value of the documents submitted by the Peruvian negotiator, among which the Royal Decree of July 15, 1802, figures as the one of most importance in support of the right of Peru to the territories of Quijos and Canelos, declares null and of no effect the adjudication of any part of those lands to the British creditors, and that those creditors shall be indemnified with other territories, exclusively and indisputably the property of Ecuador. *Art. 6th. The Governments of Ecuador and Peru agree to adjust the boundaries of their respective territories, and to appoint, within a period of two years, to be reckoned from the exchange of ratifications of the present treaty, a mixed commission, which shall fix, in accordance with the observations made and the evidence brought before them by both parties, the boundaries of the two republics. In the meanwhile those republics accept, as such boundaries, those that are governed by the uti possidetis recognized in article 5th of the treaty of September 22, 1829, between Colombia and Peru, and that were possessed by the Viceroyalties of Peru and Santa Fe conformably to the Royal Decree of July 15, 1802. *Art. 7th. Notwithstanding the stipulations in the two' preceding articles, Ecuador reserves the right to substantiate, within the peremptory term of two years.her rights over the territories of Quijos and Canelos, at the end of which term, if Ecuador shall have failed to produce evidence sufficient to overcome and nullify the evidence submitted by the Plenipotentiary of Peru, Ecuador's rights shall be deemed to have lapsed and the rights of Peru over those territories shall become absolute.\\" The treaty additionally nullified all prior treaties between Peru and Ecuador, whether with the latter as a division of Gran Colombia or as an independent republic. This constituted acknowledgement of the Real C√©dula of 1802, which Ecuador had previously rejected.Paredes; Van Dyke, p.258 ==1860: the Provisional Government of Quito rises to power== The pivotal Battle of Guayaquil was fought between September 22‚Äì24, 1860. Garc√≠a Moreno's forces, led by General Flores, defeated those of Franco. The Provisional Government of Quito assumed power, ushering in a Conservative era of Ecuadorian history. ==References== Category:History of Ecuador Category:19th century in Ecuador ","title":"History of Ecuador (1830‚Äì1860)"},{"id":"20219983","text":"Viktor Ivanovich Ageev (, born 29 April 1936) is a Russian water polo player who competed for the Soviet Union in the 1956 Summer Olympics, in the 1960 Summer Olympics, and in the 1964 Summer Olympics. == Biography == He was born in Moscow. == Career == In 1956 he was a member of the Soviet team which won the bronze medal.

Therefore, the consumers are capable of choosing their own provider and moreover they are able to switch between the provider respectively. The grid operation section still holds a natural monopoly, because of the high proportion of fixed costs concerning all grid operations. On the other hand, generation and distribution are fully opened for competition in the free market. There is also a new link between generation and distribution of electricity, namely the \\"trade section\\", including traders, brokers and private investors. The reason for the need of a liberalisation was the power stations and networks were too expensive to build and it took a lot of time (decades) to amortize the investments. Due to this high risk, there were only a few private entrepreneurs, who were willingly to invest in the electricity industry.

In the Weimar Republic he was a member of several governments, serving as minister of food/nutrition and minister of finance for the Catholic Zentrum. During the rule of the Nazi Party, he was part of the right-wing resistance, for which he was imprisoned and sentenced to death. After World War II, Hermes co-founded the Christian Democratic Union. ==Early life== Andreas Anton Hubert Hermes was born on 16 July 1878 in Cologne, then part of the Prussian Rhine province, as the son of Andreas Hermes (1832-1884), a railway worker, and his wife Theresia (1839-1905, n√©e Schmitz). He was raised as a Catholic in M√∂nchengladbach, and lost his father at the age of 8. Hermes studied agricultural science and philosophy at Bonn, Jena and Berlin. At that time he also travelled widely in Europe and South America, and he developed an interest in crossbreeding European with South American animal stock. In 1901 he became a teacher of agriculture at Cloppenburg and in 1902-04 was assistant to an animal breeder at Bonn. In 1905/06 Hermes was awarded a doctorate at Jena with a dissertation on the optimization of crop rotation and then became a research associate at the animal breeding department of the Deutsche Landwirtschaftsgesellschaft (German Agricultural Society) in Berlin. In 1911 Hermes was appointed director of the agricultural department of the International Institute of Agriculture in Rome. With the start of World War I, he returned to Germany and worked first for the general staff, then in several functions in the bureaucracy in charge of the national food supply (Kriegsern√§hrungswirtschaft), including organising the cultivation of oil seed in the Danube district and in the area near Lake Constance. ==Weimar Republic== After the end of the war, in 1919, Hermes headed the department on agriculture and forestry of the Reichswirtschaftsministerium (Ministry of Economic Affairs). He joined the Catholic Zentrum. In the first M√ºller cabinet Hermes became Reichsern√§hrungsminister (Minister for Nutrition/Food) in March 1920. Also in 1920, Hermes married Anna Schaller (b. 1894). They had three sons and one (or according to a different source, two) daughters. During his period in office, the Reichsern√§hrungsministerium was restructured according to his suggestions. In 1922 Hermes in addition to his post as Reichsern√§hrungsminister became Minister of Finance. After a short while he resigned from the former post but remained in charge of Finance. He stayed in that office until the resignation of the cabinet of Wilhelm Cuno in August 1923. Whilst serving as a minister, Hermes managed the transition from technocratic expert to politician. In 1924 he was elected for the Zentrum to the Prussian Diet and in 1928 to the Reichstag. In 1927 he was a member of the German delegation at the International Economic Conference at Geneva. In 1928 he led the German delegation in trade negotiations with Poland. At the same time, Hermes was active in the lobbying/umbrella organizations of the German agricultural industry. In 1928, he became president of the Association of the German Farmers Associations and after the economic crisis of the Great Depression started, this organization became part of the \\"Green Front\\". In 1930, he became president of the Reichsverband der deutschen landwirtschaftlichen Genossenschaften-Raiffeisen (National Association of German Agricultural Cooperatives). ==Nazi Germany== In March 1933, even before the passage of the Erm√§chtigungsgesetz he resigned from the Reichstag in protest against Nazi policies. He was arrested, charged and, on 12 July, sentenced to four months in prison for his opposition to the Nazis. He then was either affected by an amnesty, or released as his time served in jail counted towards the sentence, according to different sources. He resigned from his positions in the agricultural organizations and in 1936 emigrated to Colombia. There he worked as an economic advisor to the government in Bogota from 1936-39. He returned to Germany to collect his family, but the eruption of World War II prevented his departure back to South America. From 1942, Hermes was in touch with members of the resistance like Carl Friedrich Goerdeler and the Kreisau Circle. Immediately after 20 July 1944 he was arrested and on 11 January 1945 sentenced to death for being an active member of the conspiracy to kill Hitler. In one of Goerdeler's lists he was named as a post-putsch minister for agriculture. However, his wife succeeded in delaying his execution until the Red Army occupied Berlin. ==Post war== On 7 May 1945, the Soviet occupation authorities appointed Hermes as chief of the nutrition/food department of the city of Berlin. On 19 May 1945, Hermes became one of four deputy mayors of Berlin. He was the only non-communist/socialist member of the city council. He used his positions to work against the threat of a division of Germany. On 26 June 1945 he was one of the founder-members and the first chairman of the Christlich-Demokratische Union (CDU) of Berlin and the Soviet-occupied zone. As a result of his attempts to lead a pan-German policy and his refusal to agree to the so-called Bodenreform, he was deposed on 19 December 1945 by the Soviet occupation forces as chairman of the CDU. Seeing no chance of continuing to work in Eastern Germany, he left for Bad Godesberg in Western Germany at the end of 1945 where he continued to work against a division of the country. He founded the Gesellschaft f√ºr die Wiedervereinigung Deutschlands (Society for the Reunification of Germany) placing himself in opposition to the views of Konrad Adenauer. At a party convention at Neheim-H√ºsten the western CDU passed a new party manifesto in February 1946, mostly ignoring Hermes' views. In 1947, Hermes became a member of the ', as chairman of the food committee. In 1948, he was elected president of the Deutscher Bauernverband, which he founded. He was also made president of the '. In 1949, he founded the Godesberger Kreis, an organization working towards the reunification of Germany and an improvement in political relations with Eastern Europe, views that were highly controversial in the CDU at that time. From 1954-58 he was president, later until his death honorary chairman, of the European Confederation of Agriculture (CEA). Simultaneously he served as vice-president of the International Federation of Agricultural Producers. Hermes died on 4 January 1964 in Kr√§lingen/Eifel. ==References *Biography of Andreas Hermes on the website Gedenst√§tte Deutscher Widerstand (German) * Category:1878 births Category:1964 deaths Category:Scientists from Cologne Category:People from the Rhine Province Category:German Roman Catholics Category:Finance ministers of Germany Category:Centre Party (Germany) politicians Category:Christian Democratic Union (East Germany) politicians Category:Christian Democratic Union of Germany politicians Category:Members of the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic Category:German resistance members Category:People condemned by Nazi courts Category:Grand Crosses with Star and Sash of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany Category:Political party founders Category:Roman Catholics in the German Resistance Category:Members of the 20 July plot ","title":"Andreas Hermes"},{"id":"20220024","text":"Jovan Kostovski (, born 19 April 1987) is a Macedonian footballer who plays as a striker for Ethnikos Achna. ==International career== He made his senior debut for Macedonia in a December 2012 friendly match against Poland and has earned a total of 13 caps, scoring 2 goals.(North) Macedonia - Record International Players - RSSSF His final international was a March 2016 friendly against Bulgaria. ==International goals== :Scores and results list Macedonia's goal tally first. {  ! # !!

Cesena, and made his full debut for them in Serie B during the 1995‚Äì96 championship. After appearing once during the season he transferred for a year to Serie C1 side Montevarchi, returning in 1997‚Äì98 to newly relegated Cesena. There he played regularly throughout the season, contributing to the team's promotion back to Serie B. In 1998 Comandini signed to join Vicenza; the contract specified that he would first spend another season with Cesena, for whom he scored 14 times during the season. At Vicenza, he was the club's top scorer during the 1999‚Äì2000 season, his 20 goals contributing to the team's Serie B championship title and promotion to Serie A. At the season's close he was sold to A.C. Milan for around 20 billion lire. During his first season in Serie A Comandini played in 13 games, scoring twice, both times in the 6‚Äì0 derby against Internazionale on 11 May 2001, in the 30th matchday of the 2000‚Äì01 season. He also scored in a 2000‚Äì01 UEFA Champions League qualifier against Dinamo Zagreb.  Atalanta  In June 2001, Comandini was sold to Atalanta for 30 billion lire; teammate Luigi Sala for 7 billion lire.; teammate Luca Saudati for 18 billion lire as part of Cristian Zenoni and Massimo Donati's deal to Milan. He scored four times for Atalanta during 2001‚Äì02, and appeared in ten games during their 2003‚Äì04 campaign, before transferring to Serie B side Genoa in January 2004. He returned later that year to Atalanta, for whom he appeared twice in Serie A, before a January 2005 transfer to Ternana, where he made seven appearances. In 2006, following persistent physical problems and at age 29, Comandini retired from professional football. He moved back to Cesena, where he opened a restaurant and played for the Polisportiva Force Vigne, an amateur side founded by his father Paolo in 1983 and affiliated to the Italian amateur sports federation Centro Sportivo Italiano.Calpietra, Alessio Gianni Comandini: \\"Ho lasciato il calcio perch√® √® un ambiente non sempre limpido\\", Tutto Mercato, 6 October 2006 == International career == Comandini was a member of the Italy Under 21 national side between 1998 and 2000, earning 19 caps and scoring 6 goals, usually playing as a second striker behind Nicola Ventola.

He points to the myth of the struggle between Baal and Yam as evidence. Some theorize that Adonai was originally an epithet of the god Yahweh depicted as the chief antagonist of \\"the Ba øals\\" in the Tanakh. Only later did the epithet come to be used as a euphemism to avoid invoking the deity's proper name, Yahweh. In Canaanite/Ugaritic tradition,  æadn ilm, literally \\"lord of gods\\" is an epithet of El. However,  æadn \\"lord\\" could also be an epithet of other gods. When Yam is described as being at the zenith of his might, he is proclaimed  æadn or \\"lord\\" of the gods. In some Ugaritic texts the term  æadn  æilm rbm meaning \\"the Lord of the Great Gods\\" is used to refer to the lord and father over deceased kings. Some think that this is a reference to Baal. Other suggest this is a reference to a human necromancer, who was traveling to the land of the dead. Karel van der Toorn disagrees; he believes that it is a reference to Milku, Yaqar or Yarikh, or possibly El. Ugarit family households were modeled after the structure of the divine world, each headed by an  æadn meaning in this context \\"master\\" or \\"patron\\". Generally, this was the patriarch of the family and there may be some relation between  æadn and the Ugarit word for \\"father\\",  æad. ==Etymology== The name of the Greek god Adonis is similar to a Semitic word‚Äîadon (which means \\"lord\\"). Yet there is no trace of a Semitic deity directly connected with Adonis,R. S. P. Beekes, Etymological Dictionary of Greek, Brill, 2009, p. 23. and no trace in Semitic languages of any specific mythemes connected with his Greek myth; both Greek and Near Eastern scholars have questioned the connection.Burkert, p 177 note 6 bibliography ==Hebrew Bible== In the Hebrew Bible, adoni means ‚Äúmy lord,‚Äù and is a term of respect that may refer to GodPsalm 16:2 or to a human superior,1 Kings 1:31 or occasionally an angel, whereas adonai (literally \\"my lords\\") is reserved for God alone. In Jewish tradition, the pluralization can be used to distinguish God from earthly lords and to increase his majesty. However, many modern critical scholars see the use of a plural as a remnant of a polytheistic past, with the word only later coming to refer to Yahweh, the single god of Judaism. It is thought that at least some biblical authors used the word originally in a polytheist sense. ==See also== *Adonaist ==References== Category:Ancient Semitic religions Category:West Semitic gods Category:Baal Category:Phoenician mythology zh:Èòø‰∏ú ","title":"Adon"},{"id":"20220090","text":":For other persons named Edward Campbell, see Edward Campbell (disambiguation) Edward Fitzhardinge Campbell (1880‚Äì1957) was an Irish rugby international.

The reformist officers initially named a governing junta consisting of prominent opponents of the Liberal plutocracy, but neither it nor a succeeding junta was able to consolidate the power necessary to govern effectively. In 1926 they named as provisional president Isidro Ayora, a dedicated reformer who, although married into one of the wealthiest coastal families, possessed a social conscience and the vision to see that reform would help preserve the status of the upper classes. Ayora quickly assumed dictatorial powers, with which he set out to institute reforms that were partly of his own making and partly the making of the League of Young Officers. An advisory mission from Princeton University, headed by Edwin W. Kemmerer, was invited to propose measures to reorganize Ecuador's fiscal and monetary structures. Its major accomplishment was the creation of the Central Bank of Ecuador (Banco Central), which replaced the private banks' authority in the issuing of currency; in addition, the Kemmerer mission also reorganized the state budgeting and customs agencies. The appropriation of these functions, which were previously under the control of la Argonaut, brought a revenue windfall to the government during the next half-decade. In addition to building state fiscal and social agencies, the funds were used to initiate a number of programs, including pensions for state workers, that enhanced the security of the middle and lower economic sectors of the population. A range of social legislation‚Äîquite progressive for its day‚Äîintended to protect the working class from unscrupulous employers and to improve working conditions emerged from the enactment of the 1929 constitution. The same constitution, Ecuador's thirteenth in just under a century as a republic, also provided for a powerful legislative body with authority to censure presidential ministers. This diminution of executive power, the appearance of a wide variety (socialist, communist, and populist) of new groupings in political competition with the traditional parties and with the military, and the devastating effects of the Great Depression combined to make Ecuador's political record especially unstable during subsequent years. Ayora was the first of fourteen chief executives during the 1930s. World demand for cacao and other Ecuadorian export crops dropped precipitously in the wake of the Wall Street Crash of 1929: export crop value fell from US$15 million in 1928 to US$7 million in 1931 and US$5 million in 1932, causing widespread unemployment and misery. Few objections were voiced in 1931 when Ayora was the victim of a military coup. Neptal√≠ Bonifaz Asc√°zubi was then elected with the help of a quasi-fascist grouping of the serrano lower classes called the Consolidation of National Workers (Compactaci√≥n Obrera Nacional). In August 1932, after various Liberal and leftist elements in Congress blocked Bonifaz's assumption of power, the Compactaci√≥n fought a bloody four-day civil war against other paramilitary forces amassed by opponents of the president-elect. The latter were victorious, largely because the great majority of the government military forces remained in their barracks rather than defend Bonifaz. Another election two months later brought victory for the Liberal candidate, Juan de Dios Mart√≠nez Mera, but soon accusations arose that the election had been fraudulent. The congressional opposition censured virtually every minister as soon as he was named and also encouraged the Compactaci√≥n to lead demonstrations against the president in the streets of Quito. The campaign against Mart√≠nez was led by the charismatic president of the Chamber of Deputies, Jos√© Mar√≠a Velasco Ibarra, who at the time professed a \\"total lack of presidential ambitions.\\" In September 1934, less than a year after Mart√≠nez was forced to resign, Velasco assumed the presidency after having won popular elections by an overwhelming margin. The first of Velasco's five periods as president lasted only eleven months. He was overthrown by the military after attempting to assume dictatorial powers by dissolving Congress and jailing his congressional opponents. Shortly thereafter, the military placed Federico P√°ez Chiriboga in the presidential palace. An engineer and former senator, P√°ez ruled precariously for two years, first with the political support of the socialist left and then with that of the right, and he tried to advance the reforms undertaken by Ayora a decade earlier. Ongoing fiscal difficulties severely limited P√°ez's efforts, however, and in September 1937 he was overthrown by his minister of national defense, General Alberto Enr√≠quez Gallo. Although he ruled for less than a year, Enr√≠quez achieved note as a social reformer by his promulgation of the Labor Code of 1938. Enr√≠quez is also remembered for having initiated a protracted confrontation with the United States-based South American Development Company over the terms of its Ecuadorian concession and the wages it paid its Ecuadorian employees. The company refused to comply with Enr√≠quez's entreaty that more of the profits from its mining operations stay in Ecuador, and it won the support of the United States Department of State. The Ecuadorian government continued its demands despite United States pressure. In 1940 the United States, hoping to obtain Ecuadorian cooperation in its anticipated war effort, ended its support for the mining firm. Ecuadorian President Carlos Alberto Arroyo del R√≠o, in turn, proved generous in his cooperation with the Allies, allowing the United States to build a naval base on the Gal√°pagos Islands and an air base at Salinas on the Ecuadorian mainland. In addition to being a genuine friend and admirer of the United States, Arroyo del R√≠o was the leader of the PLR and a representative of the Guayaquil-based \\"plutocracy.\\" He came to power constitutionally in November 1939 upon the death of his predecessor, but he continued in office in January 1940 through fraudulent elections that were universally believed to have been won by Velasco, and continued in power later, through repression. Despite such antipopular methods of ruling, he managed to remain in office for almost four years, thanks to economic support by the United States and the recuperation of Ecuador's export markets as worldwide economic depression gave way to recovery during World War II. Arroyo del R√≠o's undoing was the disastrous 1941 Ecuadorian‚ÄìPeruvian War. Although the prior sequence of events‚Äîthe breakdown of talks aimed at resolving the boundary issues in 1938, followed by repeated border skirmishes‚Äîhad given ample warning of a possible outbreak of large- scale hostilities, Ecuador was unprepared to meet the July 5 Peruvian invasion. Furthermore, the president's fear of being left unprotected from his opponents led him to keep the nation's best fighting forces in Quito while Peruvian troops continuously attacked the nation's southern and eastern provinces until a ceasefire went into effect on . Peru's occupation ended only after January 1942, when the two nations signed the Protocol of Peace, Friendship, and Boundaries while attending the Third Conference of Foreign Ministers of the American Republics in Rio de Janeiro. Under the terms of the Rio Protocol, the informal name of the agreement, Ecuador renounced its claim to some 200,000 square kilometers of territory. Shortly afterward, the Rio Protocol was ratified by a bare plurality of the Ecuadorian legislature. The Ecuadorian government quickly regretted having become a party to the Rio Protocol. The protocol became the focus of a surge of Ecuadorian national pride and concomitant opposition to Arroyo in a new coalition‚Äîthe Democratic Alliance. The coalition brought together a wide array of Ecuadorian politicians dedicated to replacing the \\"president who had been unable to defend the national honor.\\" Arroyo's rejoinder that he would remain in office the full four years, \\"neither one day more nor one day less,\\" and his being prominently hailed in Washington as \\"the Apostle of PanAmericanism \\" only increased his political isolation. A persistent inflation that whittled away at the purchasing power of salaried workers was a further cause of popular resentment against Arroyo. In May 1944, following an uprising in Guayaquil that pitted the military and civilian supporters of Velasco against Arroyo's police, the president finally resigned. The military handed power to the Democratic Alliance, which in turn named Velasco, whose electoral candidacy had recently been vetoed by Arroyo, as the popularly acclaimed president of the republic. The populist master returned triumphantly from exile in Colombia, greeted by throngs of enthusiasts during a three-day journey to Quito, to assume the presidency for the second time. ==Notes References == Category:History of Ecuador ","title":"History of Ecuador (1925‚Äì1944)"},{"id":"20220119","text":"Greg Brady (born 1971) is a Canadian sports radio host on Sportsnet 590 The FAN, and is a regular pundit scheduled on the docket of BBC Radio 5 Live show Fighting Talk and holds the record for most wins on the show, alternating that honour with John Rawling over the years. ==Biography== Born and raised in London, Ontario, Brady attended the University of Western Ontario where he studied Political Science.

In November 2008, he was allowed to join League One club Northampton Town on a one-month loan to gain first team experience, making his debut on 15 November 2008 in a defeat by Oldham Athletic. His one-month loan was later extended into January, before he eventually returned to Bramall Lane having played nine matches for the Cobblers. Soon after returning to his parent club, Walker made his full debut for Sheffield United on 13 January 2009, starting in a third round FA Cup tie against Leyton Orient. With the Blades losing a number of players to injury in the closing weeks of the season, Walker was a surprise inclusion in the starting line up for the crucial last two matches of the season, making his full league debut for the club on 25 April 2009 against Swansea City. After two outstanding performances he retained his place as Sheffield United entered the play‚Äìoffs, starting both matches against Preston North End and the final against Burnley at the end of May. By playing in the final, Walker became the youngest Sheffield United player ever to play at Wembley Stadium. Tottenham Hotspur On 22 July 2009, Walker left Sheffield United to join Tottenham Hotspur along with fellow defender Kyle Naughton for a combined fee of ¬£9 million, but was loaned back to United for the duration of the 2009‚Äì10 season as part of the deal. While at Bramall Lane he was virtually ever present at right-back for the first half of the season but was unexpectedly recalled back to Spurs on 1 February 2010, just before the close of the January 2010 transfer window, as cover for Alan Hutton who was loaned out to Sunderland earlier the same day.

Walker with Tottenham Hotspur in 2010 At the start of the following season, Walker went out on loan once more signing an initial six-month deal with Queens Park Rangers (QPR) due to injuries at the club in the right-back position. In mid- October, his loan was extended until 3 January 2011. After he had left QPR, Walker joined Aston Villa on loan until the end of the 2010‚Äì11 season. He scored on his debut only nine minutes into the match against former club Sheffield United in the third round of the FA Cup in January 2011. At the start of February, Walker scored his first Premier League goal and first senior league goal, a 30-yard strike low into the left corner against Fulham. He returned to his parent club at the end of the 2010‚Äì11 season after scoring two goals in 18 appearances in all competitions for Aston Villa. On leaving Villa Park, Walker suggested that he would be happy to return to the club the following season, as first team opportunities were limited but Tottenham Hotspur manager Harry Redknapp later stated that he did not wish to sell the defender. Walker subsequently agreed to a contract extension at Tottenham until 2016.

He began his next season in a similar vein; he was at fault for Chelsea's 4th goal in the 4‚Äì2 defeat at White Hart Lane, getting shrugged off the ball easily by Juan Mata.

() was a Canadian mining and exploration company headquartered in Vancouver. The company conducted exploratory drilling to assess mineral rights within the Lone Pine Molybdenum Property outside of Houston, British Columbia, specifically focusing on molybdenum. The company has also held interests in several other projects, including a 50% interest in the Wasi Creek Zinc Lead Silver Project, outside of Mackenzie, British Columbia. ==History== The Lone Pine property has seen extensive historical exploration. A Minister of Mines and Resources (Canada) annual report from 1914 was the first mention of workings on the property, detailing a shaft intersection of a narrow silver-lead-zinc-copper-gold bearing quartz vein. Various surface workings continued in the 1920s as additional veins were discovered. Numerous companies from 1959 to 1971 conducted a variety of exploration over the property, however, it wasn't until 1976 that molybdenum mineralization was being sought after as a primary commodity. Between 1976 and 1992 continued exploration resulted in moderate molybdenum mineralization on the property. The Lone Pine Property consists of seven mineral claims covering 1051 hectares, which are approximately 15 kilometers north-northwest of Houston, BC, and are situated in the Omineca Mining Division. The Property area extends over several molybdenum showings including Quartz Breccia, Alaskite Zone, Mineral Hill and Granby. The Alaskite Zone is aptly named for the white, fine to medium grained quartz feldspar porphyry intrusive that was recognized and mapped in outcrop in 1967 as alaskite. The alaskite intrusive is the main focus of the Lone Pine Property drilling and has been interpreted as being the most favorable lithology for molybdenum mineralization. The alaskite intrusive to date continues to be drilled to the northwest of its original outcropping occurrence, BD-07-01 area, with exploration advancement to the northwest ongoing. ==Mining operations and community== Bard Ventures drilling program for the Lone Pine Property provides employment for the surrounding communities of Smithers, British Columbia and Houston. Commercial production will not interfere with the local communities as the property has access to an existing infrastructure and is located less than one kilometre off Highway 16 that connects Prince Rupert to Prince George in central BC. The main power grid connecting the area transects the property along Highway 16. In addition, a power sub station occurs within two kilometres of the property, opening the potential for simple, low-cost power for the project. Surface rights in the area are controlled by a few (less than five) local residents that have thus far been cooperative with the exploration efforts. Also transacting the property is a natural gas pipeline. Natural gas is an important component used to drive energy for a Mo roaster facility, should the project ever warrant the development of one. ==Demand for molybdenum== According to the International Molybdenum Association , demand from the manufacturing of tools, high-speed steel, stainless steel and low alloy steel accounts for about 80% of total molybdenum consumption. Demand for molybdenum has also increased because of its use as a reducer of sulfur in crude oil. One of the applications pertinent in current market conditions is the use of molybdenum in the pipework for the offshore oil and gas industry. High growth in the energy sector has contributed to the growth in global demand of molybdenum, due to increased demand for the metal for new and replacement pipelines. However, an analyst from Fundamental Research Corp. says: \\"The recent decline in energy prices and global steel consumption will put downward pressure on molybdenum demand growth.\\" Other mining companies in the molybdenum industry are Thompson Creek Metals Company Inc., General Moly, Inc. and Roca Mines Inc. ==References== Junior Mining Weekly, July 16, 2008, Canaccord Adams ==External links== * International Molybdenum Association * Current Price of Molybdenum Chart Category:Companies listed on the TSX Venture Exchange Category:Mining companies of Canada ","title":"Bard Ventures"},{"id":"20220262","text":"Julio Maximiliano Bevacqua (born June 9, 1980 in C√≥rdoba) is an Argentine footballer.

Galo Plaza brought a developmentalist and technocratic emphasis to Ecuadorian government. No doubt Galo Plaza's most important contribution to Ecuadorian political culture was his commitment to the principles and practices of democracy. As president he managed to foment the agricultural exports of Ecuador during his government, creating economic stability. During his presidency, the 1949 Ambato earthquake severely damaged the city and surrounding areas and killed approximately 5,050 people. Unable to succeed himself, he left his office in 1952 as the first president in 28 years to complete his term in office. A proof of the politically stabilizing effect of the banana boom of the 1950s is that even Jos√© Mar√≠a Velasco Ibarra, who in 1952 was elected president for the third time, managed to serve out a full four-year term. He continued to spend as before‚Äîbuilding bridges, roads, and schools at will and rewarding his political supporters (including, this time, the military) with jobs, salary increases, and weapons‚Äîbut, in contrast to his previous times in office, there were now sufficient funds to pay for everything. Always the master populist, Velasco (who by now liked to be known as \\"the National Personification\\") again came to power with the support of the common man, this time through the vehicle of the Guayaquil-based Concentration of Popular Forces (Concentraci√≥n de Fuerzas Populares, CFP). Once in office, however, he arrested and deported the CFP boss, Carlos Guevara Moreno, together with several other party leaders. Guevara Moreno reassumed control of the CFP in 1955 following a three-year exile. Velasco's subsequent party support during the 1950s came from the Conservatives, the conservative Social Christian Movement (Movimiento Social Cristiano, MSC), and the highly nationalistic, anticommunist, quasi- fascist Ecuadorian Nationalist Revolutionary Action (Acci√≥n Revolucionaria Nacionalista Ecuatoriana, ARNE). On repeated occasions, members of ARNE acted as thugs and shock troops, attacking students, labor unions, and the press. In 1955 Velasco also chose to pick a fight with the United States. In the opening round of what would later become known as the \\"tuna war,\\" Ecuadorian officials seized two fishing boats carrying the United States flag, charging them with fishing inside the 200-nautical mile limit claimed by Ecuador as territorial seas under its sovereignty. In 1956 Camilo Ponce Enr√≠quez, the MSC founder who had served in Velasco's cabinet, assumed the presidency after a close election replete with allegations of fraud. Although late support from Velasco proved crucial to Ponce's victory, shortly afterward \\"the National Personification\\" became the principal opponent of the new chief executive. In a display of statesmanship and political acumen, Ponce co-opted the Liberal opposition by including it, along with Conservatives and the MSC, in his cabinet. Although Ponce did not enact the Social Christian reforms of which he spoke vaguely during the campaign, the relative political calm that prevailed during his four years in office was, in itself, an accomplishment given the worsening economic situation. Ponce's term saw the end of the banana boom that had sustained more than a decade of constitutional rule. Falling export prices led to rising unemployment and a social malaise that briefly erupted into riots in 1959. By the following year, the effects of the discontent were ready to be exploited by the populist appeal of the irrepressible Velasco, who was elected with his widest margin of victory ever. Velasco's fourth turn in the presidency initiated a renewal of crisis, instability, and military domination and ended conjecture that the political system had matured or developed a democratic mold.

After Clarke fell with the score on 182, North (47*) and Haddin (37*) took the score to 254/5 from 68 overs, when bad light, and then rain, stopped play for the day. Dale Steyn was the pick of the bowlers with 3/82 from 19 overs, being both dangerous and economical early. Day Two: Haddin and North added 113 for the 5th wicket before the wicket- keeper was caught on 63. Marcus North (117) then continued on to make a century on debut (becoming the 18th Australian to do so, and the first against South Africa.) North and Mitchell Johnson (96*) put on 117 for the 7th wicket (a new record partnership for that wicket against South Africa). Mitchell Johnson later hit 26 from one over from Harris (an Australian Test record) before being stranded on 96 not out when Siddle and Hilfenhaus were dismissed off consecutive deliveries. Australia finished all out for 466. Steyn 4/113 and Morkel 3/117 were the pick of the bowlers. South Africa's response did not start well when Smith (0) and Alma (1) were dismissed with only 2 on the board. They finished the day at 85/3, with McKenzie 35* and de Villiers 13*. Day Three: AB de Villiers (104*) and McKenzie (36) were the only batsmen to pass 30 as South Africa were dismissed for 220. All the Australian bowlers used took a wicket with Mitchell 4/25 and Siddle 3/76 the best. The day ended early due to bad light with Australia 51/1 at the close; Hughes 36* and Ponting 1*. Morn√© Morkel took the only wicket. Day Four: From 99/1 Australia lost 4 wickets for 5 runs and were dismissed for 207. Hughes with 75 was the only batsman to pass 50. This gave Australia a lead of 453 with a day and almost 2 sessions to play. For South Africa, Kallis and Ntini both took 3 wickets. South Africa in reply started solidly reaching 178/2 from 55 overs at the close. Smith top-scored with 69. Johnson and Hilfenhaus took a wicket each. Day Five: South Africa progressed steadily to 206/2 when Amla was dismissed for 57. Wickets then fell steadily with the home team losing 8/85 to be all out for 291 just after tea. Johnson took 4/112, Siddle 3/46, Hilfenhaus 2/68 and McDonald 1/31. 2nd Test Selections: Australia and South Africa both went into the game with unchanged sides. *Australia won the toss and elected to bat. *Note: the \\"referral\\" system was amended for this Test to allow the third umpire to use \\"hot-spot\\" technology. Day One: Australia's openers put on 184 for the first wicket as Phillip Hughes (115) became the fourth youngest Australian to score a Test century.Hughes hit maiden century in Durban South Africa's bowlers appeared lethargic before striking back later in the day, but not before Katich (108) had scored his 6th Test century. Australia finished the day at 303/4 with Hussey (37*) and North (17*) at the crease. Bad light stopped play an over short. Day Two: South Africa's bowlers started the second day in better style and, after a wicketless first hour, found form on a lively pitch to take Australia from 4/329 to be all out for 352. Australia lost 5-4 in 18 deliveries, after Hussey and Steyn has a verbal slanging match mid-pitch.Steyn, Hussey exchange terse words Hussey (50) and North (38) were the only batsmen to score anything over 5 runs for the day. All the bowlers, bar Diminy, took a wicket with Steyn the best with 3/83 from 25.4 overs. Mitchell Johnson opened the bowling for the visitors and produced one of the best spells of fast, swing bowling seen in some time. He dismissed McKenzie (0) and Alma (0) in his first over, and then struck Graeme Smith on the hand in his second. Smith retired hurt with a broken finger and will take no further part in the match. Johnson later hit Kallis on the chin with a fast bouncer and the South African also retired hurt, though he was to return later in the innings. McDonald took three quick wickets after Tea and South Africa ended an eventful day at 138/7, with Duminy 73* and Steyn 8*. Day Three: Peter Siddle opened the bowling on day three and wrapped up the South African first innings in three deliveries. JP Duminy did not face a ball. South Africa were dismissed (with Smith not returning to the crease) for 138, giving Australia a first innings lead of 214. Ponting did not enforce the follow-on, and, in reply, Australia produced another 50-run opening stand before Katich (30) was dismissed with the score on 55. Hughes and Ponting (81) then put on a partnership of 164 before Hughes became the youngest player in history to score centuries in each innings of a Test match. Australia finished the day at 292/3.Australia drives home advantage Day Four: Australia pushed for quick runs on the fourth morning and declared at 331/5 with a lead of 545. Hughes was the pick of the batsmen with 160. With that innings Hughes became the youngest cricketer in the history of the game to achieve the milestone of scoring a century in both innings The South African bowlers spread the wickets around with none taking more than one. South Africa's second innings began well with Alma (43) opening with McKenzie (31) in the absence of Smith. Both were out by the time the score was 82, both dismissed by Siddle. After that, the experienced pair of Kallis (84*) and De Villiers (68*) appeared to be playing a different game as they took the score to 244/2 at the close: an unbroken partnership of 164.Kallis, De Villiers revive SAfrican cricketers Going into the fifth day, Australia require 7 wickets for a 2-0 lead in the series, and South Africa 302 runs for a record-breaking win. Day Five: Kallis (93) and De Villiers (84) extended their partnership to 187 before Kallis fell to Johnson. Wickets then fell steadily throughout the day with South Africa losing 8/103 to be all out for 370 (Smith did not bat in the second innings). This gave Australia the win by 175 runs and a series-winning lead of 2‚Äì0.Australian win clinches series Katich and Siddle each took three wickets for the visitors. 3rd Test Selections: In the absence of the injured Smith Jacques Kallis was appointed captain for South Africa. Prince replaced Smith, and Khan replaced McKenzie who had been dropped. Bryce McGain made his Test debut in place of Marcus North who came down with illness. *Australia won the toss and elected to bat. Day One: After Ricky Ponting won his sixth toss in a row Australia's openers started slowly, but looked set before Hughes (33) and Ponting (0) were out just before lunch. Hussey (20) and Clarke (0) went soon after and Australia were 4/81. With Katich (55) maintaining one end Haddin (42) and Johnson (35) provided support. Australia were all out for 209. Of the South African bowlers Ntini was the best‚Äîand most unlucky‚Äîearly before Harris and Steyn broke through. Ntini finished with two wickets, which could easily have been five if catches had been held and inside edges had hit the stumps. In reply South Africa seemed relatively untroubled with the new opening pair of Prince (37*) and Khan (15*) reaching 57/0 at the close.Proteas in control on first day in Cape Town Day Two: South Africa lost Khan (20) early on day two but were hardly pressed after that. Prince (150) continued his good domestic form but Alma (46) fell again when seemingly set. Kallis scored his 31st Test century to be 102*, with de Villiers 39*, and South Africa 404/3 at stumps.McGain's bowling murdered in day two slaughter The Australian bowlers looked tired and listless in the face of sustained batting with McGain taking a lot of punishment. Day Three: Kallis went for his overnight score, and Duminy and Boucher also went cheaply and South Africa were 467/6. De Villers and Morkel (58) added 124 for the 7th wicket, before South Africa were all out for 651, a lead of 442 on the first innings. De Villiers scored freely throughout the day to reach 163 before being caught on the fence. He was particularly harsh on McGain and McDonald taking 25 from one over from the second of these. Johnson finished with 4/138 and Katich 2/9 from 3 overs. Batting a second time Australia ended the day at 102/2, with a very hard fight ahead of them to save the match.Aussies on back foot as records tumble Day Four: Wickets fell steady during the day until Australia reached 6/218. Johnson (123*) and McDonald (68) then put on 163 for the 7th wicket to get Australia to within sight of making South Africa bat again. Paul Harris cleaned up the tail and Australia had lost by an innings for only the second time against South Africa, and for the first time in any Test match in over a decade. Harris finished with 6/127, and with his 3/34 in the first innings, was named Man of the Match. Johnson scored his maiden Test century off only 86 deliveries.Australia defeated after Johnson century ==Twenty20 Series== 1st Twenty20 2nd Twenty20 ==ODI series== 1st ODI 2nd ODI 3rd ODI 4th ODI 5th ODI ==Only Tour Match-First Class:South African A vs AustraliansSee also== *List of Australia Test cricket records ==References== Category:2009 in South African cricket Category:2008‚Äì09 South African cricket season 2008 Category:International cricket competitions in 2008‚Äì09 Category:2009 in Australian cricket ","title":"Australian cricket team in South Africa in 2008‚Äì09"},{"id":"20220425","text":"RISE is the official name given to the public art sculpture located at Broadway Roundabout in Belfast, Northern Ireland. However, it has been given unofficial, colloquial titles such as the \\"Balls of the Falls\\", \\"the Testes on the Westes\\" and \\"the Westicles\\". These names have been derived by both the sculptures location on Broadway Junction (located above the A12 Westlink and in close proximity to the Falls Road) and in reference to its shape made from two, spherical, metal structures. The RISE sculpture was designed by Wolfgang Buttress and consists of a geodesic sphere suspended inside a larger, 30 m (98 ft) diameter sphere and stands at an overall height of 37.5 m (123 ft). Geodesic refers to the shortest path between two points on a curve so that in the case of the RISE sculpture, adjacent connections on each of the spheres are connected using straight bars, thereby minimising the distance between two points. At 3om wide and 37.5m tall, RISE is the biggest public art sculpture in Belfast. RISE was commissioned by Belfast City Council and built in 2011 as part of a multimillion-pound road improvement programme. It now sits atop of the A12 Westlink Underpass (a grade-separated junction) where, according to a 2009 NI assembly report, sees approximately 80,000 cars on average flow past it each day. == Concept and Construction == RISE during construction The globe-shaped, white and silver steel sculpture is a representation of a new sun rising to celebrate a new chapter in the history of Belfast. The inner sphere represents the sun rising over the bogs and the outer sphere represents the sun's halo, while the angled, steel supports are to represent the reeds of the bog meadows that extended more widely across the area before it was developed. Due to the Belfast's history of conflict and the location of the Westlink separating some of Belfast's unionist and nationalist communities, the sculpturer noted that it was important to design a sculpture that could be viewed in its 'roundness' from any angle and therefore any political or religious persuasion. The sculptor encouraged input from local people living near the landmark sculpture, including the holding of creative workshops with groups from the Donegall Road and St James' areas of Belfast. This sculpture was favoured above others because of how it represents Belfast's positive outlook for a peaceful future. It was also favoured for its shape, which has neither a front or back but can be viewed equally from all angles. Belfast City Council coordinated the plans for the new sculpture with strong support and funding from the Department for Social Development (Regeneration Directorate) and the National Lottery, through the Big Lottery Fund, through the Arts Council of Northern Ireland as well as advice and assistance from Department for Regional Development Roads Service. Construction of the piece was challenging.http://www.mmiengineering.com/news.aspx?id=12 The steel was fabricated by M Hasson and Sons Ltd in Rasharkin. GRAHAM Construction were appointed Principal Contractor and supervised the on site erection. Work on RISE was due to begin in August 2009 and end in October 2009. However, due to delays the completion date was changed to March 2011. It was finally completed in September 2011, nearly two years behind the original schedule. == Structure == The artwork is made of two geodesic spheres supported on slender stanchions. The engineers, Price & Myers, made extensive use of the work done by Buckminster Fuller in the 1950s. The outer sphere has a geodesic frequency of 8. It required 1920 tubes to be bolted together. Tensigrity ‚Äì another concept developed by Buckminster Fuller ‚Äì is used to hold the inner sphere in position. == Competition == Buttress was selected after intense competition from more than 40 artists from the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and internationally. There had been a previous competition and previous winner: Trillian by Ed Carpenter. However, plans were scrapped amid escalating steel costs, which threatened to raise the price of the sculpture, originally agreed at ¬£400,000, to ¬£600,000. == Cost and Funding == Originally, the sculpture concept was estimated at a cost of ¬£400,000. This final cost was reported in the region of ¬£486,000, with ¬£330,000 coming from the Department for Social Development, ¬£100,000 coming from the Arts Council of Northern Ireland and ¬£56,000 being supplied by Belfast City Council itself. == Workshop == In October 2009 school children and senior citizens from across Belfast worked with New Belfast Community Arts Initiative, local writers and the artist, Buttress, to look at plans for RISE, and to learn more about creative expression through workshops. The workshops were designed to give people an insight into the process involved in creating the sculpture, to give an opportunity to reflect on what it symbolises for Belfast, and to offer their own creative insights in response. == Controversy == For the most part, the RISE sculpture has been widely accepted. Others may express discontent over spending on arts. However, the realisation is that the ¬£500,000 for the sculpture represented a cash-injection into the economy providing wages to local suppliers, fabricators and builders. == See also == * Golden (sculpture) == References  External links == * Wolfgang Buttress * Arts Council of Northern Ireland * BBC Newsline video * Department for Social Development * Price & Myers Category:Outdoor sculptures in Northern Ireland Category:Buildings and structures in Belfast Category:Tourist attractions in Belfast Category:Steel sculptures in Northern Ireland Category:2011 sculptures ","title":"RISE (sculpture)"},{"id":"20220430","text":"The Sayre Fire, also known as the Sylmar Fire, was a November 2008 wildfire that resulted in the loss of 489 residences in Los Angeles, California, United States, the \\"worst loss of homes due to fire\\" in the city's history. The fire was first reported at 10:29 p.m. PDT on November 14, 2008, in the Sylmar section of Los Angeles. As of November 20, 2008, the fire was 100% contained, had burned and destroyed more than 600 structures (480 mobile homes, nine single-family homes, 104 outbuildings and 10 commercial buildings). The number of homes lost in the Sayre fire exceeded the prior record set in 1961 by the Bel Air Fire which claimed 484 homes. There were no fatalities, just minor injuries to five firefighters and one civilian. ==Origins and cause== One day after the wind-swept \\"Tea Fire\\" destroyed more than 200 homes in Montecito and Santa Barbara, the Sayre Fire was reported in the 13000 block of Sayre Street in Sylmar, just north of the Foothill Freeway (Route 210) near Veterans Memorial County Park. It spread rapidly, fanned by strong Santa Ana winds with near hurricane-force gusts estimated at between and . California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger called the causative factors a \\"perfect storm\\"‚Äîstrong winds, low humidity, high temperatures, and dry brush.Comments of Governor Schwarzenegger in televised press conference at 9:50 PDT on November 16, 2008. Santa Clarita on November 15, 2008 ==Response== In the pre-dawn hours on November 15, 2008, over 600 firefighters battled the Sayre Fire, the number on site increasing to 1,100 by midday. Fire officials said winds of ‚Äúnear hurricane force‚Äù grounded some of their water-dropping aircraft. The fire moved west from Sylmar and threatened the luxury planned community of Knollwood in Granada Hills. On November 15, 2008, at 8:00 a.m. PDT, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa declared a state of emergency in the city, and Governor Schwarzenegger issued a state of emergency declaration later in the morning. On November 18, 2008, President George W. Bush declared the area struck by November 2008 California wildfires a federal disaster area, freeing up federal aid for reconstruction efforts. ==Impact of the fire== Worst loss of homes due to fire in City of Los Angeles history County fire officials reported on November 19, 2008 that the Sayre Fire had destroyed more than 600 structures, including 480 mobile homes, nine single-family homes, 104 outbuildings and 10 commercial buildings. The Los Angeles Times called it \\"the worst loss of homes due to fire in the city of Los Angeles\\" and reported that it \\"appeared to be the largest number of housing units lost to fire in the city of Los Angeles, surpassing the 484 residences destroyed in the 1961 Bel Air fire.\\" Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, a lifelong city resident, noted: \\"This is as bad a fire as I can remember since the Bel-Air Fire. The human devastation that's involved, whether you live in a mobile home or an estate, it's devastating. We can't even begin to weigh their loss.\\" Devastation at Oakridge Mobile Home Park In the pre-dawn hours on November 15, 2008, the fire devastated the Oakridge Mobile Home Park, destroying 480 of the park's 600 mobile homes. Los Angeles Fire Department Captain Steve Ruda described the scene as \\"an absolute firestorm\\" with high flames and added, \\"Hoses were melting into the cement and concrete. That's how hot the fire was.\\" Firefighters rescued several individuals from their mobile homes, and four civilians rescued a 300-pound disabled woman, who was trapped in her mobile home, as fire was breaking the glass. Though Los Angeles Police Chief William Bratton initially expressed concern that some elderly residents might have perished at the mobile home park, cadaver-sniffing dogs searched the ruins and found no evidence of any fatalities. The San Fernando Valley based Daily News described the Oakridge park, parts of which were also burned after the 1994 Northridge earthquake, as follows: > \\"With 600 households, well-manicured lawns and luxury amenities, Oakridge > Mobile Home Park was no trailer park. The gated community, most of which was > reduced to ash by a roaring wildfire that swept through the Sylmar hills > late Friday and early Saturday, featured a putting green, an Olympic-size > swimming pool and tennis courts. 'It wasn't just a mobile home (park),' said > Linda Pogacnik, 63, whose home was destroyed. 'It was the Beverly Hills of > mobile homes.' After the effort in Oakridge, a firefighter produced a burned U.S. flag on a broken stick taken from a home that was destroyed in Oakridge. The firefighter offered it as a sign of hope and bravery for firefighters. The flag was presented by Los Angeles Fire Department Acting Fire Chief Emile Mack to Oakridge Mobile Home Park manager Jinny Harmon. It was later framed and hung in the new clubhouse at Oakridge, where it can still be seen today. In a press briefing on November 16, 2008, Governor Schwarzenegger noted that the homes in the Oakridge community had ignited \\"like matches,\\" and called for a review of fire retardancy standards applicable to mobile homes and mobile home parks. Flames surrounded Olive View Medical Center Shortly after 1:00 a.m. PDT on November 15, 2008, flames from the Sayre Fire threatened Olive View-UCLA Medical Center in Sylmar. The Los Angeles Times reported that, around midnight, \\"tall walls of flames quickly surrounded Olive View Medical Center,\\" as \\"embers blew down streets, catching trees and shrubs on fire around the hospital,\\" and \\"before long, the hospital was surrounded on all sides by fire.\\" Some 200 patients were sheltered in place as firefighters fought the flames outside the hospital. The hospital lost power, generators failed to work, and the smell of smoke filled darkened hallways, as staff tended to patients with flashlights, and critical patients were kept alive with hand- powered ventilators. A number of infants and critical patients were evacuated in ambulances. In the end, more than 40 buildings on the Olive View campus were damaged in the fire, and the child care center was totally destroyed. Death of mosquito-killing fish Ash from the Sayre Fire also resulted in the death of Los Angeles County's mosquito-killing fish, which were bred in ponds located in Sylmar. The fish, Gambusia affinis, eat mosquito larvae and are distributed throughout the county from the Sylmar ponds as part of an effort to battle the spread of the West Nile virus. The Sylmar ponds where the mosquito fish are bred were inundated with ash, resulting in the kill off. Glendale fireworks display proceeds amid fire On November 15, 2008, despite the fire raging several miles to the north, a San Fernando Valley shopping center, Americana at Brand, decided to move ahead with an evening fireworks display as part of its Christmas tree lighting ceremony. The Los Angeles Times reported that the fireworks sent area residents \\"running outside in alarm.\\" One resident was quoted in the Times as saying that, with the local hotels filled with evacuees, \\"It was a really an inappropriate display. This was not the time to shoot off fireworks.\\" A mall spokesperson said the fireworks could not be rescheduled and added, \\"We weren't trying to be insensitive.\\" Looting On November 15, 2008, the Los Angeles Police Department arrested five individuals for looting in areas evacuated due to the fire, and imposed a curfew for young people. A homeowner in Porter Ranch found two women taking property from his home, \\"stacking his property outside the house and carrying them to a green four-door Infiniti.\\" The two women, one from North Hollywood and the other from Sherman Oaks, were arrested, and police believe the women may have burglarized other homes in the area. Damage to park lands While the immediate concern following the fire was with loss of homes, the Sayre fire also caused extensive damage to nine parks, including Stetson Ranch, El Cariso and Wilson Canyon Park in Sylmar, Placerita Canyon Nature Center, Whitney Canyon Park and Elsmere Canyon in Newhall, and O'Melveny Park in Granada Hills. Veterans Memorial Park in Sylmar suffered severe fire damage, including destruction of a administration building and a cactus garden. Cancellation of Pasadena Marathon On November 15, 2008, the organizers of the first Pasadena marathon were forced to cancel the event due to the heavy smoke in the air. Impact on gay marriage rally A rally protesting the passage of a ballot initiative banning gay marriage had been expected to draw 40,000 protesters to Downtown Los Angeles on November 15, 2008, but drew only 8,000, which some attributed to the evacuations, freeway closures, and traffic jams resulting from the Sayre Fire. Mayor Villaraigosa attended the rally between news conferences at the Sayre Fire site. Power outages The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (\\"DWP\\") had a major converter station in Sylmar and was forced to impose rolling blackouts, temporarily cutting off electricity to residents in Sherman Oaks, Mid City, Crenshaw, and other areas for about 25 minutes. ==Evacuation and shelters== In the early morning hours of November 15, 2008, officials ordered the mandatory evacuation of residents north of the 210 Freeway in the Sylmar area.http://lafd.blogspot.com/2008/11/lafd-sayre-fire-evacuation-zone.html The evacuation area was expanded to cover more than 10,000 people, living in the far north end of the San Fernando Valley from Sylmar in the east to Granada Hills in the west. Evacuation centers and shelters were established at Sylmar High School, San Fernando High School, Chatsworth High School and Kennedy High School. By the afternoon of November 16, 2008, all of the evacuation centers except for Sylmar High School had been closed.Report on KCAL 9 television at 3:42 p.m. PDT on November 16, 2008. Large animal evacuation centers were established at Pierce College and at the Hansen Dam Equestrian Center. ==Freeway closures== The fire resulted in temporary closures of several of the San Fernando Valley's major freeways, including the Golden State Freeway (Interstate 5) at the Newhall Pass, the Foothill Freeway (Interstate 210) from I-5 through Sylmar, the Simi Valley-San Fernando Valley Freeway (California State Route 118), the San Diego Freeway (Interstate 405) at Route 118 and the Antelope Valley Freeway (California State Route 14) from south Santa Clarita to the Newhall Pass. By the late afternoon on November 15, 2008, the California Highway Patrol announced the re-opening of the freeways closed due to the Sayre fire. ==See also== *Bel Air Fire (1961) *Freeway Complex Fire *Montecito Tea Fire *November 2008 California wildfires *Skirball Fire == Notes == Category:2008 California wildfires Category:History of Los Angeles Category:November 2008 events in the United States ","title":"Sayre Fire"},{"id":"20220434","text":"MG5 or MG 5 may refer to: * British NVC community MG5, community type in the British National Vegetation Classification system * Heckler & Koch MG5, machine gun, Germany * MG 5, compact car, United Kingdom ","title":"MG5"},{"id":"20220437","text":"William John Cullen (7 December 1894 ‚Äì 28 June 1960) was an Irish rugby international.

It existed from 1928 to 1946 and was represented by six Members of Parliament, including Mary Grigg, the first woman National Party MP. ==Population centres== In the 1927 electoral redistribution, the North Island gained a further electorate from the South Island due to fast population growth. Five electorates were abolished, two former electorates were re-established, and three electorates, including Mid-Canterbury, were created for the first time. These changes came into effect with the . ==History== The electorate existed from 1928 to 1946. David Jones was the first representative, winning the by a wafer-thin majority of 55 votes (0.59%) against Jeremiah Connolly; he had previously held and . Jones was defeated by Connolly in the . Connolly died on 2 October 1935 and as this was only weeks prior to the , the seat remained vacant and no by-election was called. Horace Herring of the Labour Party won the 1935 election. At the next election in , Herring was narrowly beaten by Arthur Grigg of the National Party. Grigg enlisted in the NZEF as a Major in World War II, and was killed in action in Libya on 29 November 1941.

It is located at 26¬∞54'0N 82¬∞57'0E with an altitude of 75 metres (249 feet). It is known as Dudhara derived from word Dudhwa (Madhya Pradesh). Further 'Thana' was added to the name as East India Company established the Police Station in the Pre-Independence era. It is believed that the great King of Dudhwa sent his son, the Prince of Dudhwa to this place for expansion and growth of his empire in the 16th century. When the Prince arrived, he had envisioned to develop an ideal and versatile secular State. So he brought along with him people of diverse cultures and professions. Even in the current times, this vision of the Prince seems not to have faded. The place is an example of great unity. Over a period of time, as Mughal influence expanded in India, Dudhara also grew rich in Islamic culture. Dudhara is famous also due to its historical connection with the great saint, Sant Kabir Das. Sant Kabir spent a significant part of his life in Maghar, Khalilabad, 15 km away from Dudhara. Sant Kabir, as per popular lore, was buried as well as cremated near this place. His Samadhi is present as a proof of this historical connection. Dudhara, today, is one of the most prominent villages of Sant Kabir Nagar. The local language spoken here is a mixture of Awadhi and Bhojpuri. The nearest river flowing is Ghaghara. Dudhara is a very fertile land and is a rich producer of sugarcane, wheat, rice and gram. Despite being a village Dudhara is well equipped with modern urban facilities like educational centers, hospitals, post office, police station etc. Some of the famous educational institutes are: #Abdul Hakeem Inter College - developed under the aid of Dudhwa ancestors. #Madarsa Arabia Rehmia - a center of Islamic Studies and Excellence. #The Modern Public School [affiliated, English medium, co- educational institute] a center for physical, mental and moral development of a child. ==References *wikimapia.org Category:Villages in Sant Kabir Nagar district The Modern Public School ","title":"Dudhara"},{"id":"20220514","text":"The 1909 Wabash River earthquake occurred at 04:45 local time on September 27 with a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong).

Holliman intended to train as a horse riding instructor, but after she developed hay fever at age 18 and with nothing else to do, her then boyfriend Andrew Ridgeley suggested she come and dance while he and his friend George Michael's band played a local gig. ==Music career== Holliman was never a band member of what became Wham!, but like her friend Dee C. Lee, was paid on a per performance basis as a backing singer, and continued to live with her parents. After Lee left to join The Style Council and later marry its lead singer Paul Weller, she was replaced by \\"Pepsi\\" DeMacque, and this duo performed on all the Wham! songs and concerts. As George Michael desired to create music targeted to a more sophisticated audience than Wham!'s primarily teenage fan base, the announcement of Wham!'s break-up was made in the spring of 1986, with a grand finale concert at Wembley Stadium on 28 June 1986, called 'The Final'. During their Wham! career, Holliman and DeMacque decided to form their own act, named Pepsi & Shirlie. Created immediately after the Wembley concert with an upbeat and more pop genre sound, they had two UK Top 10 hits: \\"Heartache\\", which was produced by Phil Fearon and Tambi Fernando, reaching #2 in the UK Singles Chart behind the #1 hit of George Michael and Aretha Franklin's \\"I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)\\", and \\"Goodbye Stranger\\", produced by Tambi Fernando and Pete Hammond, which reached #9. The duo with DeMacque went on hiatus in 1989, but briefly returned in 2000 to record backing vocals on the UK number one Geri Halliwell hit \\"Bag It Up\\". The duo also re-united to perform for the 'Here and Now 10th Anniversary tour' which began on 24 June 2011. On 29 November 2002 Holliman was a back-up vocalist in the Concert for George, a concert celebrating the music of the late George Harrison. ==Personal life== Holliman married Spandau Ballet bassist and singer Martin Kemp, and retired from steady performing after the birth of her daughter. Holliman had met Kemp through mutual friend George Michael, and the pair married in St. Lucia in 1988. They went on to have two children: daughter Harley Moon Kemp (born August 1989), and son Roman Kemp (born January 1993). Holliman and daughter Harley had brief roles together in the Spice Girls video for \\"Mama\\". After Holliman took time out from work to care for her husband through his illness with brain tumours, she was declared bankrupt in September 1996, and the family moved from Hampstead Heath to Muswell Hill to allow Kemp to recover. Holliman then went to work managing Aegean, a business associated with music and entertainment production.

However, he is persistent, and the next day she and her friend Ella reluctantly go on a double date with him and his piano player friend Harry in Balboa. In a nightclub, she expresses her distaste of trumpet music, whereupon he impresses her with his amazing prowess with the instrument. When a man tries to pick her up at the bar, he and Skid end up brawling, which lands Skid and Maggie in jail. As a result, Maggie misses her ship back to the States. With no money left after helping pay the fine, she is forced to move in with Skid and Harry. She talks a skeptical Murphy (a woman) into hiring the unambitious Skid and her as a trumpet player and showgirl, respectively, at \\"Murphy's Cafe y Bar\\" by telling Murphy that they are married. She clashes with fellow showgirl Anita Alvarez, Skid's former girlfriend, but Anita soon leaves for a better job. Maggie and Skid eventually fall in love and do marry. She prods the reluctant Skid into going to New York City to play in a major nightclub, leaving her behind. She finds out afterward that Anita works there. He is a big success, teamed with songstress Anita. Fame and fortune go to his head. He neglects to send Maggie the fare to join him and does not answer her letters. Finally Maggie borrows the money from Murphy. Anita intercepts her telegram to Skid, telling him where to meet her boat. After waiting at the pier for a long time, Maggie calls Anita's hotel room on a hunch, and a drunk Skid answers (Anita invited him in for a nightcap after a night on the town together). Maggie divorces him. Ella finds out and tells her old boyfriend, wealthy rancher Harvey Howell. Mary plans to sail to France to obtain a divorce and marry Harvey. Skid is so devastated, he starts drinking and missing performances, costing him his job and his career. Finally, he tries to reenlist, but fails the physical exam. Then, he runs into Harry, who has been searching for him. Harry has gotten a band together for a live radio performance to audition for an important sponsor and (to help his old friend out) wants Skid to play with them. Skid's old agent Georgie tries to get Maggie, just returned from France, to pull Skid into shape. She rushes over and does her best. During the broadcast, Skid is terrible at first, but after Maggie tells him that she is sticking to him \\"til death do us part\\", he recaptures his old brilliance. ==Cast== * Carole Lombard as Maggie King * Fred MacMurray as Skid Johnson * Charles Butterworth as Harry * Jean Dixon as Ella * Dorothy Lamour as Anita Alvarez * Harvey Stephens as Harvey Howell * Cecil Cunningham as Murphy * Charles Arnt as Georgie * Franklin Pangborn as Henri * Anthony Quinn as The Don * Charles Judels as Tony ==Production credits== * Mitchell Leisen - director * Arthur Hornblow Jr. - producer * Virginia Van Upp - screenplay * Oscar Hammerstein II - screenplay * Boris Morros - musical direction * Victor Young - compositions and arrangements * Phil Boutelje - compositions and arrangements * Al Siegel - vocal supervision * Ted Tetzlaff - photography * Farciot Edouart - special photographic effects * Earl Haman - sound recording * Don Johnson - sound recording * Travis Banton - costume design * A.

The club, for most of its history, played in the lower amateur leagues of the S√ºdwest (English: Southwest) region. In 1945, it renamed itself to SV Alsenborn but continued its existence as a village sport club. Rise Historical variant of SV logo from the club's heyday.The club's fortunes fundamentally changed in the 1960s when the retired captain of Germany's 1954 FIFA World Cup winning squad, Fritz Walter, moved to town. Walter became the coach of the side who was playing at this stage in the local A-Klasse, then the fifth tier of the German football league system in the region. He would remain coach for three years, a highly successful spell.Fritz Walter ‚Äî Captain who restored Germany's faith in football guardian.co.uk ‚Äî obituaries, published: 18 June 2002, accessed: 15 November 2008 While watching the 1962 European Cup Final in Amsterdam, Walter and Hannes Ruth, another former 1. FC Kaiserslautern player, vowed to build up the little club and take it to the top level of German football. With a number of former Kaiserslautern players in its squad, SVA started to win promotions straight away, winning the A-Klasse in 1963, the Bezirksliga in 1964 and then, on first attempt, winning the Amateurliga S√ºdwest (III) in the 1964‚Äì65 season. With this title, the club earned promotion to the Regionalliga S√ºdwest, then the second tier of German league football. Regionalliga S√ºdwest years The club spent the first two seasons in the new league settling in, earning mid-table finishes. In 1967‚Äì68, it won its first league championship, nine points clear of TuS Neuendorf. This qualified both clubs to take part in the promotion round to the Fu√üball- Bundesliga. In this, out of five teams in its group, SVA finished third on level points, when only the first place entitled to promotion. Poster for the SVA versus RWO Bundesliga promotion game in 1969 The next season saw a repeat of the league championship, sitting on equal points with Neuendorf but having scored considerably more goals. Again, the club went to the promotion round and despite its failure to gain a point from its two games against Rot-Wei√ü Oberhausen, the club stayed in contention for promotion to the very end by winning every other of its games. In the last round, against Hertha Zehlendorf, on 22 June 1969, it needed a win for promotion but lost 0‚Äì3 instead and Oberhausen went up, being one point ahead of SVA. At the end of the season, the club had to sell one of its best players, Lorenz Horr, who was then a record transfer for the German Bundesliga. The club also lost its championship-winning coach, Otto Render, in a car accident shortly after. In 1969‚Äì70, the team won the league title for a third consecutive time, beating FK Pirmasens by three points. Taking part in the promotion round for a third time, too, the club also finished third in its group, not coming as close to promotion as it was in 1969. In the German Cup, the club managed to hold the then rising star of German football, Borussia M√∂nchengladbach, to a 1‚Äì1 draw after extra time, to lose the replay 1‚Äì3 a few days later, quite an achievement for the small club. In its three years in the Bundesliga promotion round, the club played all its home games in the considerably larger stadium in Ludwigshafen. The club continued to be a strong team in the Regionalliga after 1970, earning a fifth and third place in the following seasons, but not being able to repeat its performance from the time between 1967 and 1970. From 1972, the club slipped down the ranks, coming eighth and tenth in 1973 and 1974. The year 1974 saw changes in the German league system. The five Regionalligas were disbanded in favor of two new 2nd Bundesligas, of which the 2nd Bundesliga S√ºd was the one SV Alsenborn aimed to qualify for. SVA managed to qualify for the new league, the qualification system taking the last five seasons into account. However, the club held the last qualifying spot for the new league, five points ahead of 1. FC Saarbr√ºcken. The SVA then found its license for the next season revoked on financial grounds as well as its home ground not being up to scratch, and 1. FCS was admitted instead. The club went through the various levels of appeal and at times the case was ruled in its favor but in the end the German Football Association ruled against the club. The situation brought back memories of 1963, when Saarbr√ºcken was awarded a place in the Bundesliga for similar reasons. In 1963, like in 1974, the rumor was that the German Football Association chairman Hermann Neuberger, a native of the Saarland and honorary member of the 1. FC Saarbr√ºcken, held its protecting hand over the club, to the disadvantage of the SV Alsenborn. But despite all outrage, the SVA had to step down to the third division and the 1. FCS stayed up, earning promotion back to the Bundesliga in 1976.Abseits guide to German soccer -SV Alsenborn accessed: 15 November 2008 Decline From this point in 1974, the club rapidly declined. SVA was not competitive in the third division Amateurliga S√ºdwest and within two seasons suffered another relegation, to the Bezirksliga Westpfalz. In this league, the club managed to earn a second place in 1977‚Äì78, winning promotion to the new Verbandsliga S√ºdwest (IV). Four seasons there saw a sixth place in 1979 as its best result but by 1982, it was back in the tier-five Bezirksliga Westpfalz. It earned a championship there in the 1982‚Äì83 and returned to the Verbandsliga straight away. Three seasons with a third place in 1985 followed before having to return to the Bezirksliga. In 1988, another relegation took the club back to where it once, in the early 1960s, came from, the A-Klasse. In 2011‚Äì12, the club played in the tier nine Kreisliga Kaiserslautern-Donnersberg-S√ºd, where it won promotion. After a season in the Bezirksklasse the club has played in the A-Klasse Kaiserslautern-Donnersberg since 2013.

It was the largest series Ladybird produced, and remained in print until 1986. ==Life== Peach, the son of Mary Ann n√©e Munns (1863-1940) and Charles Peach (1862-1943), a Unitarian minister and later the Secretary of the Northern Counties Education League,1891 England Census for Lawrence du Garde Peach - Yorkshire, Nether Hallam - Ancestry.com 1911 England Census for Lawrence du Garde Peach, Lancashire, South Manchester, Didsbury - Ancestry.com was born in 1890 in Sheffield, and attended Manchester Grammar School and Victoria University of Manchester before taking up a postgraduate position at University of G√∂ttingen in 1912, later earning a PhD at Sheffield University in 1921 for a thesis on the development of drama in France, Spain and England in the 17th century. He married Emily Marianne Leeming (1890-1972) in 1915, and served in military intelligence during World War I, serving for a period in France and reaching the rank of captain.British Army WWI Medal Rolls Index Cards, 1914-1920 - Lawrence du Garde Peach - Ancestry.com From the early 1920s, he began regularly writing humorous pieces for Punch and other magazines, and after a period as a lecturer at the University College of the South West of England (later to become the University of Exeter), Peach left academia to become a full-time writer. A major outlet was the then new medium of radio, for which he wrote his first play in 1924. Much of his work for radio dramatised history and biography, and became a staple of the Children's Hour strand for younger listeners. He also wrote extensively for the stage, forming a close relationship with the Sheffield Playhouse, and from 1934 to 1936, he wrote for a number of films, ranging from horror The Ghoul (1933), The Man Who Changed His Mind (1936), and musical comedy Princess Charming (1934), Land Without Music (1936), to serious drama adaptations Turn of the Tide (1935), and the all-star spectacular Transatlantic Tunnel (1935). He turned down lucrative offers from Hollywood, preferring not to have to deal with all the whims of those in the production process. Frank Launder once claimed that he and Sidney Gilliat had to abandon \\"most of the script\\" for Seven Sinners (1936) and that Peach's \\"only virtue was speed.\\"Quoted in Brian McFarlane (ed) The Encyclopedia of British Film, 2003, Methuen/BFI, p513. Peach was also a great supporter of the idea of amateur theatre, and wrote a number of plays specially tailored for particular kinds of amateur groups. In 1927, he founded an amateur group at Great Hucklow, close to his home in the Peak District of Derbyshire, which achieved a notably high standard. It continued until 1971 and ceased after he cut off his toe while mowing the lawn, this accident handicapping his activity. He wrote many plays and produced many productions for the group, and in 1938 created its own theatre, converted from an old lead mining building. Influential in the Rural Community Council which promoted local theatre as a way of developing local communities he also was involved with the formation of Tideswell Community Players in the next village and starred in its first production, Ambrose Applejohn's Adventure in 1930. After the war he also produced a number of large-scale theatrical pageants in Sheffield, Manchester and elsewhere. Peach also entered the world of politics, standing as a candidate for the Liberal Party at the 1929 General Election in the dual member seat of Derby, without success. He was made an OBE for services for literature in 1972, and recognised with an honorary DLitt from Sheffield University in 1964.

Shraeger was chosen mostly because Brown believes her to be incorruptible, since she comes from a wealthy family and chose to work for the police from a sense of doing good, rather than for money. As soon as she meets her new partner, they start a quest for Walsh's ex-partner's killer. He was known to be corrupt, but he was also investigating others at the 2nd Precinct, particularly Det. Henry Cole who once lived by another name and robbed an armored car. Cole's partner, Det. Allison Beaumont, is later revealed to be Walsh's girlfriend. Besides Shraeger, Walsh, Beaumont and Cole, the station has three more detectives: Leo Banks, who wears a bulletproof vest everywhere he goes, because he is afraid he will die at age 42, as his father, grandfather and uncle did; Banks' partner Eric Delahoy, who has a brain tumor (causing hallucinations) but refuses to notify anyone, for fear that treatment could kill or cripple him; and Eddie Alvarez, who sees himself as a \\"lone wolf\\" and talks about himself in the third person.

Parts of southeastern Sindh receive rainfall of up to and some cities have received very heavy rainfall on occasion. In 2005, Hyderabad received in just 11 hours. Sindh is divided into three climatic regions: Siro (the upper region, centred on Jacobabad), Wicholo (the middle region, centred on Hyderabad), and Lar (the lower region, centred on Karachi). The thermal equator passes through upper Sindh, where the air is generally very dry. The highest temperature ever recorded in Sindh was , which was recorded in Mohenjo-daro on 26 May 2010. It was not only the hottest temperature ever recorded in Pakistan but also the hottest reliably measured temperature ever recorded in the continent of Asia and the fourth highest temperature ever recorded on earth. The previous record for Sindh and Pakistan, and for all of Asia, had been , reached on 12 June 1919. In the winters, frost is common. Central Sindh's temperatures are generally lower than those of upper Sindh but higher than those of lower Sindh. Dry hot days and cool nights are typical during the summer. Central Sindh's maximum temperature typically reaches . Lower Sindh has a damper and humid maritime climate affected by the southwestern winds in summer and northeastern winds in winter, with lower rainfall than Central Sindh. Lower Sindh's maximum temperature reaches about . In the Kirthar range at and higher at Gorakh Hill and other peaks in Dadu District, temperatures near freezing have been recorded and brief snowfall is received in the winters. In Gorakh temperatures in winter nights can sour down to -15. The highest temperatures each year in Pakistan, typically rising to above , are usually recorded in Shaheed Benazeerabad District (previously called Nawabshah District) and Sibbi from May to August. Sometimes the temperature falls to ; on rare occasions (once every 25 years or so) it has fallen to below in December or January. ==See also== * Climate of Karachi * Climate of Pakistan * Climate of Hyderabad *Climate of Nawabshah * List of extreme weather records in Pakistan ==References * Pakistan Meteorological Department * Regional Met Center for Sindh Category:Environment of Sindh ","title":"Climate of Sindh"},{"id":"20220806","text":"Last Drive is the first and only studio album by Eric Burdon's Fire Dept., released in 1980. ==History== Every song title from the album is also listed on the front cover.

At the 2015 local government reform it became a subdivision of the municipality Kolonj√´.Law nr. 115/2014 It is located right at the Greek- Albanian border. The population at the 2011 census was 1,525.2011 census results ==History== Etymology The toponym Leskovik is formed from the Slavic word leska meaning ‚Äòhazel, corylus avellana‚Äô or ‚Äòhazel river' along with the suffix ik(√´). The name of the town has been written as Lexovico in a map (1821) by Pouqueville and as Leskovik in an Ottoman document (1851). Ottoman period The area came under Ottoman rule in the 15th century and became part of the Sanjak of Ioannina. Leskovik was recognized as a town in the early 1800s. It was conceived as a relaxing and retreat center for the Ottoman administration. Leskovik subsequently was elevated from kaza into a sanjak. Leskovik kaza (subdistrict) was located within Yanya sanjak, part of Yanya Vilayet (province) till 1912. Leskovik and the nearby mountain Melesin was the site of a battle in 1831. Ottoman Albanian spahis and landowners from nineteenth century Leskovik owned estate properties (chiftlik) in parts of the Balkans and in particular the Thessalian plain, until its loss to Greece in 1881 leading to local economic decline and increasing reliance on agriculture. Leskovik was a significant centre for the Sufi Bektashi order and it was strongly established in the surrounding area. The Sufi Halveti order was also present in the town and the Sufi Hayatiyya order had a tekke dating from 1796. In the late Ottoman period and on the eve of the Balkan Wars, the population of Leskovik was mostly Muslim Bektashi. \\"Durham proceeded to Kolonia... and to Leskovik, mainly full of Bektashi Muslims\\" In Leskovik, a Bektashi tekke was founded in 1887 by Abedin Baba, a town native and religious figure. The tekke housed a small number of dervishes and Abedin Baba's gravesite, later destroyed by war. \\"Liaskovik.-The population of this (till the war) thriving hill-town is largely Bektashi. The tekke just outside it, on a hill above the Kolonia road, is said to have been about thirty-five years old; it contained the grave of Abeddin Baba, and housed seven or eight dervishes. It is now entirely destroyed\\" Another religious building was the Pazar (Bazaar) mosque of Leskovik. A few Muslim Albanians from Leskovik were employed in the Ottoman bureaucracy as administrative officials governing some districts in parts of the empire. Greek education was present in Leskovik at the 1898-1899 school year with one boys' and one girls' school and a total of 100 pupils attending them.* During the Balkan Wars (1912-1913) Ottoman rule came to an end and Leskovik briefly came under the control of the Greek forces. Shortly after the town was visited by an international commission who was responsible to draw the precise borders between the Kingdom of Greece and the newly established Principality of Albania. There was some difficulty in drawing the new border by the international demarcation border commission as the area around Leskovik and nearby Konitsa contained mixed populations of Albanians and Greeks. Leskovik was finally ceded to Albania under the terms of the Protocol of Florence (17 December 1913). In the town officially joined the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus. World War II At 21 November 1940, during the Greco-Italian War, units of the II Army Corps of the advancing Greek forces entered Leskovik after breaching the Italian defences. Latter, the town showed a strong support to communist partisans during the Italian and German World War II occupation. Cold War The People's Socialist Republic of Albania, being an ally of the Soviet Union, was involved in the Greek Civil War (1946-1949) by supporting the communist led Greek Democratic Army. Leskovik became for a period its headquarters. The town also hosted a training, a supply center, as well as medical facilities for the communist guerrillas, who mounted several invasions from Albanian soil into the Greek region of Grammos and fled back to Albania once an operation was completed. Today The population has decreased after the 1990s, due to emigration. In the modern period, the town of Leskovik is religiously mixed, composed of Muslim Bektashis and Orthodox Christians. Few monuments in Leskovik surviving its turbulent past are the decorated tomb of Kani Pasha, located inside the present Bektashi tekke. In the wider area, the religious composition is distributed between Islam: (Bektashis and Halvetis) such as in nearby Gjon√ß and Gline and Christianity (mostly Orthodoxy) with some converts to Orthodoxy, \\"The villages of the Kolonj√´ district are commonly either Muslim or Orthodox Christian, whereas the towns of Ersek√´ and Leskovik have a mixed population. Leskovik used to have a majority Muslim population, related to the Bektashi and Halveti sufi brotherhoods.

Parts of the nave arcades are Norman, but all of the windows are Perpendicular in style.Pevsner, N. (1970) The Buildings of England, Cornwall; 2nd ed. p. 100 In about 1150 the church was given to Tywardreath Priory; later the priory sold it to Bishop Bronescombe of Exeter. In 1272 Bishop Bronescombe appropriated it to Crediton collegiate church and the cure of souls became a vicarage. In the late 15th and early 16th centuries, the vicars of Lelant resisted the demands of the inhabitants of Towednack and St Ives for rights of sepulture in those places. When this was conceded in 1542 the vicars moved their residence to St Ives where they remained for three centuries.Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford; p. 141 An early reference to the church is in 1170, when Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, referred to \\"The Church of Saint Euni\\".Parish Guide, n. d. The feast of St Uny is observed on the first day of February.Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford; p. 10 Like many other churches in Cornwall, St Uny has a copy of a letter from King Charles thanking the people of Lelant for their support during the English Civil War.

It is also an important record of the Cornish names for the Cornish language Kernowek and of Allhallowtide as Kalan Gwav (Dy Halan Gwav for All Saints' Day, Nos Kalan Gwav for Hallowe'en), also known as Allantide in Cornwall and Calan Gaeaf in Wales.Spriggs, M 2003, 'Where Cornish was spoken and When: A Provisional Synthesis', in Philip Payton (ed.), Cornish Studies, University of Exeter Press, Exeter. At the beginning of the 18th century, the church was in a bad state of repair, due to wind-blown sand, and in 1727 a rate (or bounty money) of ¬£263 15s was levied in the parish to meet the repairs. In 1731 there is an entry in the churchwardens' records of payment of one shilling for one day's work of carrying sand out of the church. The church was, again, restored in 1873, at a cost of ¬£1,175, by J. D. Sedding. During the night of 12 December 1878, the north-west pinnacle of the tower was struck by lightning. On examining the tower it was noticed that the flooring of the bell-chamber was rotten and had almost disappeared; the bells were supported by the frame alone. Funding was diverted from the building of the cathedral at Truro to make the tower safe, and the tower repaired and bells rehung in January 1880. The church has fine memorials to two William Praeds, dated 1620 and 1833 (the Praeds' home was at Trevethow in the parish), and also buried here are Henry Jenner (1848‚Äì1934) who was the first Grand Bard of the Gorseth Kernow, and the artist Peter Lanyon (1918‚Äì1964). ==Organ== Pipe organ by John Hele 1913 A new organ was installed in the north chancel by John Hele of London, Exeter and Plymouth at a cost of ¬£415 () and opened on 13 May 1913.

When the depot was created in 1941, a fence was erected around its perimeter, isolating a small herd of white-tailed deer, some of which had white coats. These deer are not albino, but instead carry a set of recessive genes for all-white coats. The isolation of the herd causes high levels of inbreeding. In the 1950s, the depot commander forbade GIs from shooting any white deer. The deer population has since grown to about 700 head, approximately 300 of which are white, making it the largest herd of white deer in the world. ==Future of the herd== Since the depot's closure, the future of the deer had been uncertain. The visibility of white deer makes them easy prey for hunters and natural enemies like coyotes, and such a herd would not survive in the wild. The depot land is New York's largest block of land available for development and some new uses have been found for it. A new maximum security state prison was built on the eastern rim and the former barracks on the northern tip was converted into housing for troubled teenagers. Plans to buy of land to build an ethanol and biofuel electricity production center and to plant crops of willow trees and switch grass to be converted into fuel was proposed. In 2006, a business plan was submitted to the Seneca County Industrial Development Agency, owners of the depot property, to convert the land into a conservation park and Cold War museum, but the plan was denied.

It can be also applied to solutes. Its definition depends on the ways of expressing chemical composition of mixtures. The osmotic coefficient based on molality b is defined by: : \\\\varphi=\\\\frac{\\\\mu_A^*-\\\\mu_A}{RTM_A\\\\sum_i b_i}\\\\, and on a mole fraction basis by: :\\\\varphi=-\\\\frac{\\\\mu_A^*-\\\\mu_A}{RT \\\\ln x_A}\\\\, where \\\\mu_A^* is the chemical potential of the pure solvent and \\\\mu_A is the chemical potential of the solvent in a solution, MA is its molar mass, xA its mole fraction, R the gas constant and T the temperature in kelvins. The latter osmotic coefficient is sometimes called the rational osmotic coefficient. The values for the two definitions are different, but since :\\\\ln x_A = - \\\\ln(1 + M_A \\\\sum_i b_i) \\\\approx - M_A \\\\sum_i b_i, the two definitions are similar, and in fact both approach 1 as the concentration goes to zero. ==Relation to other quantities== In a single solute solution, the (molality based) osmotic coefficient and the solute activity coefficient are related to the excess Gibbs free energy G^E by the relations: :RTb(1-\\\\varphi) = G^E - b \\\\frac{dG^E}{db} :RT\\\\ln\\\\gamma = \\\\frac{dG^E}{db} and there is thus a differential relationship between them (temperature and pressure held constant): :d((\\\\varphi -1)b) = b d (\\\\ln\\\\gamma) In ionic solutions, Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel theory implies that (\\\\varphi - 1)\\\\sum_i b_i is asymptotic to -\\\\frac 2 3 A I^{3/2}, where I is ionic strength and A is the Debye‚ÄìH√ºckel constant (equal to about 1.17 for water at 25 ¬∞C). This means that, at least at low concentrations, the vapor pressure of the solvent will be greater than that predicted by Raoult's law. For instance, for solutions of magnesium chloride, the vapor pressure is slightly greater than that predicted by Raoult's law up to a concentration of 0.7 mol/kg, after which the vapor pressure is lower than Raoult's law predicts. For aqueous solutions, the osmotic coefficients can be calculated theoretically by Pitzer equationsI. Grenthe and H.
