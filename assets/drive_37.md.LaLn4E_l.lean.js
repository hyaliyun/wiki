The provincial capital city of Toronto, Canada's largest municipality, is home to much of the English Canadian music industry and many individual musicians, and the most popular destination for musicians from other parts of Canada, besides French-Canadian musicians, looking to advance their careers. Hamilton, Ottawa, Kingston and Guelph have also been important centres for Canadian music. In classical music, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, and the National Arts Centre Orchestra are two of the most renowned orchestras in the world. Many smaller Ontario cities have orchestras of their own as well. The Canadian Opera Company, also based in Toronto, is the country's largest and most influential producer of opera productions. Other institutions in the province include the Royal Conservatory of Music, MuchMusic, and concert venues such as Roy Thomson Hall, Massey Hall and the National Arts Centre.

Funk designed A Compilation of Genuine Church Music for use in singing schools. It contained 208 pages, including rudiments of music and tunes harmonized for three voices. Funk released a second edition in 1835, and a third in 1842. The 1847 fourth edition was the first publication by Joseph Funk and Sons at Singers Glen. The name was changed to Harmonia Sacra in 1851, using the original title as a subtitle. In 1851, Funk also changed from the four-shapes to the seven-shape shape note system. Rather than adopt the Aikin system, Funk devised his own. Further editions were released, including 1860, 1866, 1878, 1980 and 1993. In 1866, called the 12th edition, the three voice parts were expanded to four. After 1878 (17th edition), the rudiments of music were deleted. In 1980, the 24th edition, the format was changed, changing the old four stave oblong tunebook to an upright modern soprano-alto-tenor-bass format. The 25th edition (1993) restored the old oblong tunebook format, as well as the rudiments of music and 27 three-voice hymns from the first and second editions. A newly typeset 26th edition is available. An online edition of the 26th edition provides tunes in both four- and seven-shape settings.

Sulimirski was a pioneer and leading expert in the study of the archaeology of steppe nomads, particularly the Cimmerians, Scythians and Sarmatians. ==Early life== Tadeusz Joseph Sulimirski was born on 1 April 1898 in the town of Kobylany, which was then part of the Austria-Hungary. He belonged to Polish nobility, the szlachta. He received his primary education in Chyrów. From 1916 to 1920, Sulimirski served in the Polish Legions, fighting initially against the Russian Empire in World War I, and then against the Russian SFSR in the Polish-Soviet War. After the peace, Sulimirski enrolled at the University of Lwów, acquiring a Doctor of Law in 1924. In 1929 he acquired a PhD in archaeology. He received a higher doctorate in 1931. Since 1931 he was Head of the Prehistory Department of the University of Lwów. Sulimirski became Chair of Prehistoric Archaeology at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków in 1936. In 1937 he was appointed Professor. While in this position, Sulimirski carried out pioneering archaeological research. Upon the Invasion of Poland, Sulimirski rejoined the Polish Armed Forces. After the occupation of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, Sulimirski escaped to Romania, and from there he left for France. Upon the Fall of France soon afterwards, Sulimirski left for the United Kingdom, where he became Secretary-General to the Polish Government. In that position he wrote a number of geopolitical propaganda articles calling for the expansion of Poland to the west through the annexation of German territory lying east of the Oder River, on the grounds that in early medieval times those territories had been part of the early Polish state. After recognition of the Polish government-in-exile was withdrawn by the Western governments, Sulimirski was a leading figure in the Committee for the Education of Poles in Great Britain. During this time, Sulimirski returned more and more to teaching. From 1952 he gave regular courses in East European prehistory at the London Institute of Archaeology of the University of London. In 1958 he was made Professor of Middle East and European Archaeology at the London University Institute of Archaeology. He also lectured at Cambridge University, University of Oxford, University of Glasgow, University of Edinburgh, University of Wrocław, and the University of Łódź. He gave lectures and seminars in many European countries in 1952-1965, and in a number of United States universities during a tour in 1968-1969. Sulimirski retired from the University of London in 1969, but continued to travel and lecture after retirement. He contributed immensely to the increasing the understanding of the archaeology of Eastern Europe in the West. Cut off from carrying out archaeological research by his exile from Poland, Sulimirski dedicated his later career to writing. During World War II, almost all of his previous work was destroyed, but with the help from colleagues both in Poland and abroad, he was able to have his works rewritten and published in 1968. He was writer of more than 200 books, articles and other scientific publications. Of particular note is his work Prehistoric Russia (1970), and a series of articles published in the Bulletin of the Institute of Archaeology, where he made available in English the most recent research on the archaeology of Russia. Sulimirski particularly specialized in the study of steppe nomads such as the Cimmerians, Scythians and Sarmatians. Much of this later writing was concerned with them. He was a pioneer and one of the world's foremost experts on the archaeology of the steppes. Sulimirski was a Fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland and the Society of Antiquaries of London. In 1973 he was the recipient of the Jurzykowski Prize. He was very active in Polish organizations such as Polish University Abroad and the Polish Scientific Society. Sulimirski died on 20 April 1983. He was survived by his wife, Olga Sulimirska; five children, Felicia Janiszewska (Boba), Maria Romanowska (Ninia), Witold Sulimirski, Karol (Charles) Sulimirski, Jerzy (George) Sulimirski; 15 grandchildren, including Witold's children, Ela (Landegger), Adam and Edward; and Karol's children, Roger, Mark and Renata (Weiss); and, numerous great grandchildren. ==Selected works== * Poland and Germany, Past and Future, 1942 * Corded Ware and Globular Amphorae North-East of the Carpathians, 1968 * The Sarmatians, 1970 * Prehistoric Russia: An Outline , 1970 ==See also== * List of Poles ==Notes== ==References== ==Sources== * * Category:1898 births Category:1983 deaths Category:20th-century historians Category:Academics of the UCL Institute of Archaeology Category:British archaeologists Category:Jagiellonian University faculty Category:People from Krosno County Category:Polish emigrants to the United Kingdom Category:Polish historians Category:Polish archaeologists Category:Polish nobility Category:University of Lviv alumni Category:University of Lviv faculty Category:Scythologists Category:20th- century archaeologists ","title":"Tadeusz Sulimirski"},{"id":"1275259","text":"Mira is a star in the constellation Cetus Mira may also refer to: ==People== * Mira (given name), a given name; includes a list of people with the name * Mira (surname), a surname; includes a list of people with the name * pen name of Mary Leapor (1722–1746), English poet ==Places== * Mira River (Nova Scotia), Canada * Mira Canton, Ecuador * Mira River (Ecuador and Colombia) * Mira, Veneto, a town near Venice, Italy * Mira, Portugal * Mira Municipality, Portugal * Mira River (Portugal) * Mira, Spain * Mira, Illinois, United States * Mira, Louisiana, United States * Kingdom of Mira, part of the kingdom of Arzawa in western Anatolia * Mira, Nadia, a census town in West Bengal, India ==Business== * MIRA Ltd., a UK automotive engineering and development consultancy company * Mira (shopping center), a shopping center in Munich * The Mira Hong Kong, a hotel * Mira Books, a book publishing imprint of Harlequin Enterprises * Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets, New York- based subsidiary of privately held Macquarie Holdings (USA) Inc. * Mira Airport, an airport in Serbia ==Science and technology== * IBM Mira, a supercomputer * MIRA procedure, a medical treatment involving tissue grafting and adult stem cells * Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm, a machine-learning algorithm * Middleware for Robotic Applications, a framework for robotic applications * Monterey Institute for Research in Astronomy, an observatory located in Monterey County, CA * Mira, the codename for Smart Display, a 2002 Microsoft product for a portable touchscreen terminal * Mira (wasp), a wasp genus in the family Encyrtidae ==Vehicles== * Mira (AK-84) or U.S. Army Engineer Port Repair Ship Robert M.

Moskowitz describes it as having \\"traded in sensationalism, filling columns with a mishmash of pioneering exposes of public corruption and totally unsubstantiated calumny.\\" Floyd B. Olson, the future governor of Minnesota, brought a suit against Near and Guilford because their newspaper had an overly anti-Semitic tone, which Olsen claimed was a violation of the Public Nuisance Law, also known as the Minnesota Gag Law, of 1925. The scandal sheet published countless exposes until it was shut down in 1927 by the Gag Law. In 1931, the historic U.S. Supreme Court case Near v. Minnesota struck the statute as unconstitutional.

Since 1997, several more short stories featuring Bond or set within the official James Bond universe have been published by authors who continued chronicling the world of Fleming's creation. The majority of these stories have, as of 2008, never been collected in book form, unlike the Fleming works. There are five exceptions: \\"Blast from the Past\\", \\"Midsummer Night's Doom\\" & \\"Live at Five\\" by Raymond Benson, \\"Your Deal, Mr. Bond\\" by Phillip and Robert King, and \\"Bond Strikes Camp\\" by Cyril Connolly which are discussed below. ==Raymond Benson short stories== In the late 1990s, Raymond Benson, who at the time was the official novelist of the James Bond literary franchise, became the first author since Bond's creator, Ian Fleming, to write officially sanctioned short stories featuring the superspy. Just before his sudden departure from writing Bond novels at the start of 2003, Benson had indicated his intention to write more short pieces and publish a short story collection along the lines of Fleming's For Your Eyes Only and Octopussy and The Living Daylights. This, however, has yet to occur as of 2008. To date these three stories remain the only pieces of James Bond literature that have never officially been published in Great Britain. Additionally, between 2001 and 2002, Benson wrote a fourth short story he planned to title \\"The Heart of Erzulie\\", however, it was never published. ===\\"Blast from the Past\\"=== First publication: Playboy, January 1997 issue. In publication order, this follows COLD and precedes Zero Minus Ten. Benson has stated that Playboy cut a third of the story for space reasons. The first Bond story published by Benson, \\"Blast from the Past\\" is a direct sequel to Fleming's You Only Live Twice and appears to exist outside the timeline of either Benson's or John Gardner's other Bond stories. Bond receives a message, apparently from his son James Suzuki (Suzuki's mother is Kissy Suzuki from You Only Live Twice, now dead from ovarian cancer) asking him to come to New York City on an urgent matter. When Bond arrives, he finds his son murdered. With the aid of an SIS agent, he learns that James was killed in revenge by Irma Bunt for the murder of Ernst Stavro Blofeld, and a woman whom Bond assumed had died alongside Blofeld (again in You Only Live Twice). James Suzuki's death was by way of being force fed fugu syrup, akin to a murder in You Only Live Twice. Bond's victory over Bunt is hollow, due to him having to come to grips with his absentee fathering and not spending time with his only remaining blood relative. The name of Bond's son, James Suzuki, is taken from the John Pearson faux biography, James Bond: The Authorised Biography of 007. In On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Blofeld started this chain of revenge by killing James Bond's wife, Tracy. \\"Blast from the Past\\" is included in the 2008 omnibus release, The Union Trilogy, which includes three additional Benson Bond novels. This makes \\"Blast from the Past\\" the first non-Fleming short story to be published in book form.The Literary 007: Bonding in 2008 - Jan. 1, 2008, retrieved 6 January 2008. ===\\"Midsummer Night's Doom\\"=== First publication: Playboy, January 1999 issue. In publication order, this follows The Facts of Death and precedes High Time to Kill. \\"Midsummer Night's Doom\\" is a special story commissioned to help celebrate Playboy's 45th anniversary. By Benson's own admission, the short story is a joke piece. In the story, Bond is assigned to attend a party at Playboy founder Hugh Hefner's Playboy Mansion in Beverly Hills, California where Ministry of Defence secrets are expected to be sold to a representative of the Russian Mafia. While there, Bond meets Hefner, who is aware of his mission and who actually provides Bond with several gadgets a la Q. Bond also has time to enjoy a quick romance with real-life Playmate Lisa Dergan, flirt with other Playmates including Victoria Zdrok, and rub elbows with the likes of actor Robert Culp and singer Mel Tormé. Dergan has the distinction of being the first real person ever to be awarded the status of Bond Girl. (Several other Playmates are referenced by name in this story, but Dergan is clearly Bond's girl of choice on this adventure.) Some sources give this story the erroneous title \\"A Midsummer Night's Doom\\", since the title is a play on William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. \\"Midsummer's Night's Doom\\" is included in the 2010 omnibus release, Choice of Weapons, which includes three additional Benson Bond novels. ===\\"Live at Five\\"=== First publication: TV Guide (American edition), 13–19 November 1999. In publication order, this follows the novelization of The World is Not Enough and precedes Doubleshot. Published the week The World Is Not Enough arrived in cinemas in America, \\"Live at Five\\" is the shortest of all James Bond stories, even shorter than Fleming's previous record-holder \\"007 in New York\\". Running only a couple of thousand words, if that, it is a brief episode that sees Bond, en route to a date with a female TV news reporter, recalling how he once helped a Russian figure skating champion defect in full view of TV cameras. The reporter, Janet Davies, becomes the second real person to be a Bond girl, seen daily on Chicago's local ABC station Channel 7 WLS. \\"Live at Five\\" was finally reprinted in the 2010 omnibus release, Choice of Weapons, which includes three additional Benson Bond novels. ===\\"The Heart of Erzulie\\" (unpublished)=== A fourth short story, titled \\"The Heart of Erzulie\\", was written by Raymond Benson in-between Never Dream of Dying and The Man with the Red Tattoo, however, it was never published because Ian Fleming Publications felt it was \\"too much of a Fleming pastiche.\\" Benson, himself, acknowledges that it was little more than a time-killer in the interim between the two book projects. ==Samantha Weinberg/Kate Westbrook short stories== In 2006, two additional short stories were written and published by Samantha Weinberg under the pseudonym \\"Kate Westbrook\\". These stories are part of The Moneypenny Diaries series, an officially licensed spin-off from the Bond novels series focusing on the character of Miss Moneypenny. In September 2020, both stories were republished as a free ebook titled The Moneypenny Diaries: Secret Chapters. ===\\"For Your Eyes Only, James\\"=== First publication: Tatler (November 2006). Set in September 1956, the story tells of a weekend James Bond and Moneypenny share at Royale-les- Eaux.http://www.angelfire.com/movies/settingtherules/fyeojames.html ===\\"Moneypenny's First Date with Bond\\"=== First publication: The Spectator, 11 November 2006. This story, set just after Bond's assignment to the 00 Sectionhttp://www.angelfire.com/movies/settingtherules/moneypennydate.html and before the events of Casino Royale, tells of Bond and Moneypenny's first meeting. ==Charlie Higson short story== ===\\"A Hard Man to Kill\\"=== The original Young Bond short story \\"A Hard Man to Kill\\" written by Charlie Higson, is included in the companion book, Danger Society: The Young Bond Dossier, which was released by Puffin Books on 29 October 2009. An extract from the story appears in the paperback edition of By Royal Command. It is the longest James Bond short story yet written. ==Unauthorised works== Several stories published without sanction from Glidrose warrant mention. ===\\"Some Are Born Great\\"=== \\"Some Are Born Great\\" was first published in the 3 September 1959 issue of Nursery World, later reprinted in the spring 1960 issue of Jonathan Cape's in-house magazine Now & Then, and then reprinted again in 2012 by Cinema Retro's Movie Classics. The credited author—J.M. Harwood—is the screenwriter Johanna Harwood, who subsequently co-wrote the first two James Bond films. The story (which is less than a page in length) details an intense card game with Bond facing off against an unseen opponent, only to reveal in the end that it's a game of \\"Snap\\" and this is a prepubescent James Bond playing against a nanny. ===\\"Bond Strikes Camp\\"=== Cyril Connolly's short story \\"Bond Strikes Camp\\" first appeared in the April 1963 issue of The London Magazine. Although a parody, the story clearly mentions Bond by name and code number. An expensive, privately printed edition of only fifty copies was done for the Shenval Press in 1963. Soon after, the story appeared in Connolly's miscellany collection Previous Convictions. Author, critic and Bond author Kingsley Amis compared the story unfavourably to The Harvard Lampoon spoof Bond novel Alligator by claiming that \\"Parodies have their laughter-value, but the laughter is partly affectionate, and the successful parodist is moved partly by wanting to write like his original by wishing he'd thought of doing so first. Mr Cyril Connolly no doubt doesn't wish this in regard to Mr Fleming; his 'Bond Strikes Camp', in which M orders Bond to dress up as a woman, ostensibly for purposes of espionage, and then tries to get him into bed, is much too far from the original, never catches the note, gets elementary details wrong. E.g. M is made to call Bond 'Bond'. This happened last in 1954 (Live and Let Die, ch. 2). Every Fleming fan knows it's either 'James' or '007'.\\" ===\\"Holmes Meets 007\\"=== Donald Stanley wrote this short story - under two-thousand words - first published in The San Francisco Examiner on 29 November 1964. The Beaune Press (San Francisco) subsequently published 247 copies of this seven page story in December 1967. There is no copy 222: this is instead numbered 221B. Copies 223 through to 247 are numbered I to XXV and were printed especially for the author's friends. Dr. John Watson, Sherlock Holmes's amanuensis, narrates the story. M and Bond visit Holmes and Watson at Holmes's Baker Street address. Holmes's deductive abilities impress M who wishes Bond had the same ability. Bond questions if such intuitive talents could hold up against a Smersh assassin. Bond confronts Holmes about the latter's drug addiction and accuses Watson of being the source of Holmes's narcotics supplier. Once Holmes admits it, Bond aims his Walther PPF [sic] at Watson and announces that Watson is an imposter and none other than Bond's arch-enemy Ernst Stavro Blofeld - the man who killed Bond's bride. Holmes throughout the meeting has been fiddling his Stradivarius - much to everyone's annoyance - and brings it crashing down, knocking Bond's gun away. Holmes plunges a needle containing morphine into M's arm, quickly rendering him unconscious. Holmes reveals that M is none other than Professor Moriarty; Bond is nothing more than a \\"fairly ignorant tool\\" who had been unaware of his boss's treachery all this time. ===\\"Toadstool\\"=== The Harvard Lampoon, responsible for the Bond spoof Alligator, published another \\"J*mes B*nd\\" story. Toadstool appeared in PL*YB*Y, the 1966 Harvard Lampoon parody of Playboy magazine. ===\\"License to Hug\\"=== Will Self's story License to Hug appeared in the November 1995 issue of Esquire. Bond goes to Holland to kill an IRA hitman involved in drug smuggling. This story, part thriller, part satire on modern life, also mentions Bond by name and code number. Sorrell Kerbel notes that \\"Self proves just as adept at skewering by mimicry the stiff upper lip style and macho substance of Ian Fleming's James Bond books as he is at pillorying the brave new world of political correctness (with its very own thought police) in which the 'Therapeutic Hug and Stroke' is the weapon of choice.\\" ===\\"Your Deal, Mr. Bond\\"=== In 1997 Phillip and Robert King published a collection of bridge-related short stories entitled Your Deal, Mr. Bond was published by B. T. Batsford (). The title piece is a short story featuring James Bond, who is assigned by M to defeat a villain named Saladin who is threatening to explode nuclear bombs in several major cities. Bond impersonates real-life bridge expert Zia Mahmood in order to combat Saladin at the bridge table. The short story includes bridge game charts in a similar fashion to that used by Ian Fleming in Moonraker, in which Bond similarly plays a high-stakes game of bridge against that novel's villain. The book, despite being issued by a major publisher and containing undisguised references to the Bond characters, contains no reference to Ian Fleming Publications, suggesting the use of Bond, M and Miss Moneypenny is unofficial, and rendering this story likely apocryphal. Its placement in the Bond canon, therefore, is unknown. The story contains a cultural reference to Star Trek, however, which sets it outside of Fleming's timeline. It should not be confused with the 1987 John Gardner Bond novel, No Deals, Mr. Bond. The authors also wrote the 1996 pastiche compilation Farewell, My Dummy, which featured bridge novellas, each one parodies a different author in turn: Jeffrey Archer, Jane Austen, Raymond Chandler, Arthur Conan Doyle and Victor Mollo. ===Licence Expired: The Unauthorized James Bond=== On 1 January 2015, the original Ian Fleming novels and short stories entered the public domain in Canada and other countries in which the length of copyright remains at the Berne Convention minimum of the life of the author plus 50 years. As a result, it is now legal in those countries for the original writings of Ian Fleming to be republished, or adapted into other media, without permission of the Fleming estate or its agent, Ian Fleming Publications (formerly known as Gildrose Publications). It is also now legal in those countries for original material based on Bond and other characters and concepts introduced in Fleming's written works (though not those elements that are unique to Eon Production's Bond movies) to be published. In late 2015, independent Canadian publishing house ChiZine Publications released Licence Expired: The Unauthorized James Bond, an anthology of 19 Bond short stories written by various Canadian and non-Canadian authors including Jeffrey Ford, Charles Stross, A.M. Dellamonica, James Alan Gardner, Corey Redekop, Jacqueline Baker, Richard Lee Byers, Laird Barron, Kathryn Kuitenbrouwer, Karl Schroeder, Claude Lalumiere, Robert Wiersema, and Ian Rogers. The stories examine different stages of the character's life from childhood to old age. The book's introduction states explicitly that due to copyright issues, it is not authorized for sale outside Canada.Matt Sherman, \\"Introduction\\", in Licence Expired: The Unauthorized James Bond (Madeline Ashby, David Nickle, eds.), Toronto: ChiZine, 2015, ==See also== * Outline of James Bond ==Footnotes== Category:Thriller short stories Category:Spy short stories Category:Short story series ","title":"James Bond uncollected and other miscellaneous short stories"},{"id":"1275306","text":"New Brunswick offers musical entertainment at different venues, including the Harvest Jazz & Blues Festival in Fredericton and Symphony New Brunswick, with its main series occurring in Saint John, Moncton and Fredericton. ==Festivals== New Brunswick's capital city is Fredericton, which is home to the Harvest Jazz & Blues Festival, an annual event.

The library is one of thirteen presidential libraries run by the National Archives and Records Administration. In 1954, a group of Hoover's friends incorporated the Herbert Hoover Birthplace Foundation to raise money for the preservation of his birthplace and the area around it, and to plan for improvements to the site. One of their ideas was to build a small museum, and with Hoover's approval work began in the late 1950s. The architectural firm of Eggers and Higgins of New York drew the plans for the original building, a modest limestone structure of just over 4,000 square feet. While the museum at West Branch was still under construction, Hoover decided to expand it and to make it his Presidential Library.Nye, Frank T., Doors of Opportunity: The Life and Legacy of Herbert Hoover (West Branch, IA, Herbert Hoover Presidential Library Association, 1988). The Library and Museum was officially dedicated and opened to the public on August 10, 1962, Hoover's 88th birthday. Hoover and Former President Harry S. Truman were present at the dedication. Hoover began his speech by saying, > When the members of the Congress created these presidential libraries they > did a great public service. They made available for research the records of > vital periods in American historyand they planted these records in the > countryside instead of allowing their concentration on the seaboard. Already > the three libraries of President Roosevelt, President Truman, and President > Eisenhower, by their unique documentation, serve this purpose, and today we > dedicate a fourthmy own. Within them are thrilling records of supreme action > by the American people, their devotion and sacrifice to their ideals. > Santayana rightly said: \\"Those who do not remember the past are condemned to > relive it.\\" These institutions are the repositories of such experiencehot > off the griddle. In these records there are, no doubt, unfavorable remarks > made by our political opponents, as well as expressions of appreciation and > affection by our friends. We may hope that future students will rely upon > our friends. In any event, when they become sleepy they may be awakened by > the lightning flashes of American political humor. Presidents Harry Truman and Herbert Hoover at the dedication of the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum on August 10, 1962 The original Library and Museum building was expanded several times, with major additions being completed in 1964, 1971, 1974 and 1992.

He previously played for HC Lugano and HC Fribourg-Gottéron and within the Chicago Blackhawks, Los Angeles Kings, Montreal Canadiens, and Washington Capitals organizations in the National Hockey League (NHL). He is the first French netminder and second French- trained player overall (after Philippe Bozon) to play in the NHL. Huet won the Stanley Cup with the Chicago Blackhawks during the 2009–10 NHL season, and became the first Frenchman to win the Stanley Cup as a player. ==Playing career== ===Amateur=== As a youth, Huet played in the 1988 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a team from Grenoble. ===HC Lugano=== Huet played for HC Lugano from the 1998–99 season to 2001–02. His career took a significant turn in these years. He won the National League A Championship in his first year, and reached the European Hockey League final four the next year. ===Los Angeles Kings=== Huet was drafted by the Los Angeles Kings as their seventh-round pick, 214th overall, in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft. He played for the Kings in the 2002–2003 and 2003–2004 seasons. He was traded to the Montreal Canadiens in a three-team deal that sent Mathieu Garon to Los Angeles and Radek Bonk from Ottawa to Montreal. During the 2004–05 lockout Huet played for the Adler Mannheim in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga. He led the team to the finals, where the Eagles lost in three straight games to Eisbären Berlin. ===Montreal Canadiens=== During the 2005–06 season, Huet eventually won the starting job in goal for the Canadiens at the expense of José Théodore, who was subsequently traded to Colorado in exchange for goaltender David Aebischer. He also won the Molson Cup in February 2006. He won the Best Defensive Player award from the NHL during the first week of March, ousting goaltenders such as the Ottawa Senators' Ray Emery and the New Jersey Devils' Martin Brodeur, with a 3–0–0 record and a 1.67 GAA. For the second time of the year, he was named NHL Best Defensive Player on April 3 with a 3–0–0 record, a 0.65 GAA and 0.979 SV%, ousting goaltenders Martin Brodeur, Flames goalie Miikka Kiprusoff and Detroit's Manny Legace. On April 23, in his first NHL playoff start, Huet starred in a 6–1 win against the 2nd seeded and eventual Stanley Cup champion Carolina Hurricanes. Huet stopped 42 of 43 shots in the contest to put the Canadiens up 1–0 in the seven game series. Two days later, Huet recorded his first overtime playoff win, when the Canadiens beat the Hurricanes 6–5 in double overtime to take the lead 2–0 in the series. However, Huet and the Canadiens lost the next four games and the series in goaltender duels with rookie Cam Ward, who had taken Martin Gerber's starting spot in the series, and who would later go on to win the Conn Smythe Trophy. The Canadiens re-signed Huet in the 2006 offseason to a two-year deal at $5.75 million total, earning $3 million the first season and $2.75 million in the second year. On January 13, 2007, Huet was announced as one of the three goalies of the Eastern Conference All-Star Team in the 55th NHL All-Star Game in Dallas. A month later, however, he suffered a left hamstring injury that caused him to miss most of the final two months of the season. In his absence, the Canadiens struggled, and the team missed the postseason. Huet with the Washington Capitals, March 2008 ===Washington Capitals=== On February 26, 2008 Montreal Canadiens general manager Bob Gainey traded the French netminder to the Washington Capitals for a 2009 second-round draft pick. The Canadiens decided to trade Huet because of highly touted prospect, Carey Price. In Washington, he took over the starting position from Olaf Kölzig, pushing incumbent backup Brent Johnson to the pressbox, and his exceptional play helped lead Washington to secure a playoff berth, where they lost the opening round series against the Philadelphia Flyers in seven games. ===Chicago Blackhawks=== On July 1, 2008, the first day of unrestricted free- agency, Huet agreed to terms on a new 4-year contract with the Chicago Blackhawks worth a total of $22.4 million or $5.625 million per season. Following the signing, Blackhawks general manager Dale Tallon announced the team would enter the season with a tandem of Huet and Nikolai Khabibulin. Unable to win the starting job over Khabibulin to start the season, Huet found himself on the bench more often than not. Gradually, he earned back his playing time and both alternated every game for almost 3 months until Khabibulin went down with a groin injury in early February. The tandem, however, earned praise around the NHL. A second Khabibulin injury in early February thrust Huet in the spotlight once again, and he was named the NHL's 3rd star of the week for Feb 15–21, posting a 3–0–0 record and allowing just five goals on 72 shots. In the end however, Khabibulin was named the playoff starter for the Blackhawks, and they defeated the Calgary Flames in the first round as well as the Vancouver Canucks in the second round. Huet made his next appearance for the Blackhawks during game three of the 2009 Western Conference Finals, where he was called to replace an injured Khabibulin. He made six saves, and allowed the Blackhawks to collect an overtime win. With Khabibulin still recovering from a lower body injury, Joel Quenneville named Huet the team's starting goalie for the fourth game against Detroit. Huet allowed five goals on 21 shots, and was temporarily replaced by Corey Crawford. During the final game of the series, Huet stopped 44 shots en route to a 2–1 overtime loss. For the first time in his career, Huet started a season as the undisputed number one goaltender, but as the 2009–10 campaign wore on, Antti Niemi eventually replaced Huet as Chicago's starter going into the playoffs. Huet played only twenty minutes in the 2010 Stanley Cup Playoffs, which the Blackhawks won with Niemi in net and with an overall playoff record of 16–6. Cristobal Huet with Fribourg-Gottéron in 2010 On September 27, 2010, Chicago loaned Huet to HC Fribourg-Gotteron of the Swiss National League A in order to stay within the salary cap. ===Fribourg-Gotteron=== In his first year with Fribourg-Gotteron, Huet played in 41 games but struggled in the second half of the season, accumulating a 2.84 goals against average as the team finished 8th. Fribourg qualified for the playoffs only to be swept by HC Davos. The following season he improved to a goals against average of 1.99 in 39 games, third best in the league that year. The team defeated HC Lugano in the quarterfinals in 6 games but lost to SC Bern in the semifinals in 5 games. Huet's loan and his contract with the Blackhawks expired when the playoffs ended, thus making him a free agent. ===Lausanne HC=== Cristobal Huet with LHC in 2014 Failing to sign with an NHL team, he returned to the National League and signed a 4-year deal with Lausanne HC of the National League B. His first season in Lausanne was a success, as the team won the National League B title and went on to win promotion to the National League by defeating SC Langnau in the qualification round. ===Retirement from the French national team=== In May 2017, Huet played at the 2017 IIHF World Championship, in Paris, representing France. He played his last game at the final round robin game of France, against Slovenia, with a win, and ended with a standing ovation, retiring with France's Team Captain Laurent Meunier.

Prince Edward Island is one of the three Maritime Provinces and is the smallest province in both land area and population. The musical culture is changing rapidly in Prince Edward Island at this time as traditional Celtic musicians, while in some ways more prominent than ever, are not as common in small rural communities as they once were. Celtic music is still very much around and can be heard at festivals, ceilidhs and pubs throughout the island, especially in the summer. That being said traditional Scottish ceilidhs are rarely frequented by young people and the younger generation has been diverging along an urban rural divide, in that young people in rural parts of the island now tend to follow Country and Western music, almost assuming it is an extension of local tradition, due to the similarities, when it is in fact an American import. Before the introduction of radio to the island, Country and Western music was unheard of and in most places traditional Celtic or Acadian music dominated. Due to the rural farming traditions of the Island and the similarities between Country Music and Celtic Music, Country Music quickly became popular in the 1930s. It was an easy adoption, considering that the Bluegrass/Mountain Music which spawned Country and Western Music, is closely related to the Celtic and Maritime musical tradition. Even the Ceilidh itself is suffering. With fewer young people attending them, they are becoming more of a tourist attraction than an actual living form of culture. While Celtic music on the island may appear to some to be stronger than ever due to the promotion of many world class island musicians, its place in the rural, local culture has been somewhat diminished. That being said, there is a strong effort to revive Celtic culture on the island, from the PEI Fiddle Camp held every July, to the availability of Gaelic classes at Colonel Gray High School in Charlottetown. Other festivities, events and locations promoting local traditional music culture include: Rollo Bay Fiddle Festival which was created to preserve Prince Edward Island's tradition of music, Close to the Ground concert series hosted by Fiddler's Sons, The International PEI Shellfish Festival hosted by Liam Dolan, The Festival of Small Halls, the College of Piping and Celtic Performing Arts concert series (Highland Storm), The Benevolent Irish Society Ceilis, The Orwell Corner ceilidhs, the Summerside Highland Gathering, the Belfast (PEI) Highland Games, the Indian River Festival and more. The summer time is the best time of the year to experience PEI traditional music and despite the concerns noted above, if you were to tour the island in the Summer, you would leave with the impression that the traditional Celtic and Acadian cultures brought the island over 300 years ago were remarkably intact. ==Prince Edward Island Symphony Orchestra== The Prince Edward Island Symphony Orchestra (PEISO) is a community orchestra based in Charlottetown and founded in 1967. It consists of professional, amateur, and student musicians, and is currently led by conductor Mark Shapiro. The PEISO's annual concert season consists of four programs, which are performed at the Confederation Centre of the Arts or at Zion Presbyterian Church. ==Charlottetown== Charlottetown is the capital and largest city on the island. Its documented music history begins in the 19th century, with religious music, some written by local pump and block maker, and organ-importer, Watson Duchemin. Several big bands including the Sons of Temperance Band and the Charlottetown Brass Band, were active. By the end of the century, Charlottetown had its own opera house, performing comic operas by Gilbert and Sullivan. The Prince Edward Island Music Festival was first held in 1946, inaugurated by the Women's Institute of Prince Edward Island. Fiddler Don Messer moved to Charlottetown in 1939 where he joined CFCY as music director. He formed the \\"Islanders\\" and by 1944 the group was airing a show nationally on CBC Radio, becoming established as the most popular on Canadian radio from the 1940s to the 1960s and later on television. In 2015 Charlottetown became home to the island's most controversial record label Act Of War Records, Who focus on a more hardcore controversial truth style rap music. Founders Havo Killer (formally II DIE IV 2011-2015) and Sadiztik Have both released albums and demos under the label. They have been known to offend many in the community for there willingness to let the past die and focus on new styles of music for the island, Act Of War Records mainly plays hardcore rap and death metal. The Prince Edward Island Symphony Orchestra is also well-known. Other well-known famous performers from Charlottetown have included Haywire, Teresa Doyle, Tara MacLean, Nancy White, Walter MacNutt, UIGG, William Keith Rogers and ECMA winners The Saddle River Stringband. The Charlottetown Festival is a seasonal musical theatre festival which runs from late May to mid-October every year since 1965. It includes a summer musical theatre training program called the \\"Young Company\\", whose shows are freely available to the public and feature Canadian-themed content. ==Fiddle culture== The province is known for its old and vibrant fiddling tradition. Fiddle music came to Prince Edward Island in the late 18th century with its early Scottish settlers. Further immigration from the fiddle hotbeds of Ireland and the Scottish Highlands strengthened the tradition, which gradually spread in all communities, including the Evangeline region with a sizeable Acadian population. Although the role of community fiddlers has declined due to advancements in technology, the tradition is still part of cultural life of the province.http://atlanticbookstoday.ca/the-story-of- traditional-fiddling-on-prince-edward-island/ ==Notable musicians== *Lennie Gallant *Stompin' Tom Connors *Cynthia MacLeod *Gene MacLellan *Tim Chaisson *Angèle Arsenault *Tara MacLean *Nancy White *Walter MacNutt *Ben Chase ==Notable music bands== *Two Hours Traffic *Boxer the Horse *Paper Lions *Saddle River String Band *Haywire *The Saddle River Stringband *Death Valley Driver *Alvvays *The East Pointers *Barachois *Strawberry *Saddle River String Band *Ten Strings and a Goat Skin *Vishtèn *The Danks *Eklektikos *English Words ==See also== *College of Piping and Celtic Performing Arts of Canada *Prince Edward Island Music Awards ==References== * ","title":"Music of Prince Edward Island"},{"id":"1275383","text":" The Armstrong Siddeley Double Mamba, Ministry of Supply (MoS) designation ASMD.n, is a turboprop engine design developed in the late 1940s of around 3,000-4,000 hp (2,500-3,000 kW). It was used mostly on the Fairey Gannet anti-submarine aircraft developed for the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy. ==Design and development== The Double Mamba (rarely known as the Twin Mamba) was a development of the Armstrong Siddeley Mamba with two Mambas driving contra-rotating propellers through a combining gearbox.Gunston 1989, p.20.

Part of the book takes place in Northern Europe, including Finland; to make his book as authentic as possible, Gardner even visited Finland. ==Plot summary== Bond reluctantly finds himself recruited into a dangerous mission involving an equally dangerous and treacherous alliance of agents from the United States (CIA), the Soviet Union (KGB) and Israel (Mossad). The team, dubbed \\"Icebreaker\\", waste no time double-crossing each other. Ostensibly their job is to root out the leader of the murderous National Socialist Action Army (NSAA), Count Konrad von Glöda. The Count used to be known as Arne Tudeer, a one-time Nazi SS officer who now perceives himself as the new Adolf Hitler. The National Socialist Action Army is essentially a new wave of fascism as a means to wipe out communist leaders and supporters around the world. The novel is full of double-crosses and even triple-crosses, where the agents and agencies go without sharing their true loyalties with one another. The American agent, for instance, first appears to be a good guy then later is in cahoots with Glöda, and then still even later is a good guy once again. Things become even more complicated when the Israeli agent, Rivke, is revealed to be the daughter of Glöda/Tudeer and her allegiance, although appearing to be legitimate, is doubtful. The Russian agent also double-crosses Bond in the hope of capturing him for KGB interrogation. Bond gets several weeks of driving training from Erik Carlsson as preparation for this Arctic assignment. ==Characters== * James Bond * M * Paula Vacker: is a frequent love interest of James Bond that he visits while he is in Helsinki. During the course of the novel, her loyalty to him is questioned, initially appearing totally innocent, then in league with von Glöda, and finally discovered to be a deep under cover agent for Supo. * Brad Tirpitz: is a member of the Icebreaker team and an agent from the CIA. He is later discovered by Bond to be in league with the National Socialist Action Army and to have killed the real agent Tirpitz and taken his place; he claims, his name is actually Hans Buchtman and is described as von Glöda's Heinrich Himmler. Buchtman, however, turns out to be an alias of Brad Tirpitz, who created this back-story as a way to gain entry into von Glöda's organisation; indeed, he actually works and is loyal to the CIA. * Kolya Mosolov: is a KGB agent who is a member of the Icebreaker team. He is discovered to have planned the entire Icebreaker team in coordination with von Glöda. The two have a deal in which Mosolov would betray his country and sell arms to von Glöda in exchange for the capture of secret agent 007. Mosolov being not only an agent of the KGB, but also an agent working within \\"Department V\\", a department formerly known as SMERSH; Bond's main nemesis throughout the Ian Fleming novels. Mosolov believes that von Glöda will not succeed and is merely going along with the deal for the time being in order to capture Bond for the Soviets. * Rivke Ingber: is a member of the Icebreaker team and an agent working for the Mossad. She is discovered to actually be Anni Tudeer, the daughter of Count von Glöda (aka Aarne Tudeer). Rivke plays both sides, initially acting like she is disgusted with her father's past, but later actually being discovered to be in league with him, thinking of herself as a future Führer. * Count Konrad von Glöda: is the mastermind behind the National Socialist Action Army and self-declared Führer. His real name is Aarne Tudeer, a low-level SS officer wanted by the Allies for crimes during the Second World War. He attempts to bring back fascism by targeting communist leaders and supporters around the world. ==Publication history== Gardner reveals that his publisher originally rejected the title Icebreaker, only to come back to it after rejecting \\"turkey after turkey\\" in terms of alternate titles.John Gardner The Bond Page Icebreaker was released in Finland under a title Tehtävä Suomessa, James Bond (Mission in Finland, James Bond), as part of the book takes place in Finland. * UK first hardback edition: July 7, 1983 Jonathan Cape * U.S. first hardback edition: April 1983 Putnam * UK first paperback edition: 1984 Coronet Books * U.S. first paperback edition: May 1984 Berkley Books ==Reviews== The New York Times critic Anatole Broyard believed that John Gardner was underqualified to write Bond. \\"His book strikes me as deficient in many of the basic requirements. Mr. Gardner is all awkwardness. Every time I try to enter into his latest conspiracy we bump heads. It's one thing to accept an improbable plot and quite another to accept an improbable style. I'm willing to suspend my disbelief, but not my affection for the English language. I don't see why, when Mr. Gardner can learn all about the various weapons, machines and intelligence procedures he describes, he can't do a bit of basic research in ordinary narrative technique. A man who has no talent for describing women, for example, should let them alone.\\" Broyard cited numerous examples of clichéd writing and dismissed the plot as \\"a muddle\\". Available online. T.

Binyon, writing in The Times Literary Supplement, believed the book was \\"full of good action; his torture scenes are splendidly painful; his villain is adequately megalomaniac, though perhaps not sufficiently outre; his girls are pretty, sexy, and available, and the courting routines as embarrassingly obvious as anything in the original. But in the end Gardner's Bond doesn't really measure up to Fleming's. There isn't that maniacal snobbery about trivial and useless detail which the original so endearingly manifests. And, further, Gardner simply hasn't grasped Bond's most important trait: he only takes assignments where his creator would like to take a holiday. And who on earth would want to holiday in the 'desolate Arctic wastes of Lapland'? Certainly not the luxurious Bond.\\" People Magazine's anonymous reviewer said that \\"the action in Icebreaker is fitful at best\\" and that the book was \\"not at all up to Gardner's (first) 007 outing, License Renewed. The Russian villain, however, is an original and sometimes interesting menace.\\" Available online. The Globe and Mail crime critic Derrick Murdoch believed Icebreaker was Gardner's best Bond novel thus far. \\"In most technical respects (writing, plotting and minor-character sketching), he is more skilful and more painstaking than Fleming even attempted to be. On the other hand, nobody since the Grimm brothers could equal Fleming's gift for improvising such audaciously grotesque adversaries as Dr. No, Blofeld, Auric Goldfinger and his henchman, Oddjob. To make up for the lack of gnomes or behemoths, Gardner offers a plot of labyrinthine complexity, subtler than any of Fleming's. In short, he has taken more risks in Icebreaker to display his own talents, and it has paid off.\\". Mel Watkins, writing in The New York Times Book Review, praised Gardner for adding \\"a touch of the plot subtlety of less insistently action-oriented thrillers.\\" He also applauded Gardner's updating of Bond. \\"Although Mr. Gardner's Bond is less raffishly macho and arrogant than previously depicted,\\" observed Watkins, \\"the spirit of the 007 series remains intact, and few Fleming admirers are likely to object. There is, in fact, something appealing about a James Bond who can react to women with some sympathy and confusion at a crucial moment.\\" Available online. Long-time Gardner admirer and Listener crime critic Marghanita Laski believed Icebreaker \\"is one of his best yet in his 007 mode.\\" She especially admired the book's Finnish setting which she said \\"has been good thriller value since Gavin Lyall introduced it.\\" ==See also== * Outline of James Bond ==References== Category:1983 British novels Category:James Bond books Category:Novels by John Gardner (British writer) Category:Cold War spy novels Category:Novels set in the Arctic Category:Jonathan Cape books ","title":"Icebreaker (novel)"},{"id":"1275392","text":"I Can't Be New is the sixth album by American singer-songwriter Susan Werner, released in 2004 (see 2004 in music). ==Track listing== all songs written by Susan Werner, except where noted #\\"I Can't Be New\\" (Jane Paul, Werner) – 2:54 #\\"Late for the Dance\\" – 3:36 #\\"Seeing You Again\\" – 2:41 #\\"I'm Not Sure\\" – 4:15 #\\"Much at All\\" – 4:08 #\\"Tall Drink of Water\\" – 3:01 #\\"You Come Through\\" – 3:13 #\\"No One Needs to Know\\" – 2:58 #\\"Let's Regret This in Advance\\" – 2:45 #\\"Don't I Know You\\" – 3:05 #\\"Philanthropy\\" – 2:53 #\\"Stay on Your Side of Town\\" – 2:54 #\\"Maybe If I Sang Cole Porter (Coda)\\" – 1:46 ==Personnel== *Susan Werner – piano, rhythm guitar, ukulele, vocals, background vocals, Wurlitzer, nylon string guitar *Eugene Friesen – cello *Crit Harmon – percussion, handclapping, snaps *Hatfield Five – string quartet *Brad Hatfield – piano, Hammond organ, vibraphone, Fender Rhodes *John Lockwood – upright bass *Dave Mattacks – drums *Billy Novick – clarinet, woodwind *Stephen Sadler – banjo, dobro, mandolin, ukulele, baritone ukulele *Mike Turk – chromatic harmonica ==Production== *Producer: Crit Harmon *Engineer: Crit Harmon, John Lupfer *Mixing: John Lupfer *Mastering: Paul Angelli *A&R;: David Wilkes *Digital editing: Matt Beaudoin *Arranger: Billy Novick *Product manager: Dan O'Leary *Design: Jeff Gilligan *Caricatures: Adam Belmares Category:Susan Werner albums Category:2004 albums Category:Jazz-pop albums Category:Vocal jazz albums Category:Swing albums Category:E1 Music albums ","title":"I Can't Be New"},{"id":"1275395","text":"Propagation delay is the length of time taken for a signal to reach its destination. It can relate to networking, electronics or physics. Hold time is the minimum interval required for the logic level to remain on the input after triggering edge of the clock pulse. ==Networking== In computer networks, propagation delay is the amount of time it takes for the head of the signal to travel from the sender to the receiver. It can be computed as the ratio between the link length and the propagation speed over the specific medium. Propagation delay is equal to d / s where d is the distance and s is the wave propagation speed. In wireless communication, s=c, i.e. the speed of light. In copper wire, the speed s generally ranges from .59c to .77c. This delay is the major obstacle in the development of high-speed computers and is called the interconnect bottleneck in IC systems. ==Electronics== A full adder has an overall gate delay of 3 logic gates from the inputs A and B to the carry output Cout shown in red In electronics, digital circuits and digital electronics, the propagation delay, or gate delay, is the length of time which starts when the input to a logic gate becomes stable and valid to change, to the time that the output of that logic gate is stable and valid to change. Often on manufacturers' datasheets this refers to the time required for the output to reach 50% of its final output level when the input changes to 50% of its final input level. Reducing gate delays in digital circuits allows them to process data at a faster rate and improve overall performance. The determination of the propagation delay of a combined circuit requires identifying the longest path of propagation delays from input to output and by adding each tpd time along this path. The difference in propagation delays of logic elements is the major contributor to glitches in asynchronous circuits as a result of race conditions. The principle of logical effort utilizes propagation delays to compare designs implementing the same logical statement. Propagation delay increases with operating temperature, as resistance of conductive materials tends to increase with temperature. Marginal increases in supply voltage can increase propagation delay since the upper switching threshold voltage, VIH (often expressed as a percentage of the high-voltage supply rail), naturally increases proportionately. Increases in output load capacitance, often from placing increased fan-out loads on a wire, will also increase propagation delay. All of these factors influence each other through an RC time constant: any increase in load capacitance increases C, heat- induced resistance the R factor, and supply threshold voltage increases will affect whether more than one time constants are required to reach the threshold. If the output of a logic gate is connected to a long trace or used to drive many other gates (high fanout) the propagation delay increases substantially. Wires have an approximate propagation delay of 1 ns for every of length. Logic gates can have propagation delays ranging from more than 10 ns down to the picosecond range, depending on the technology being used. ==Physics== In physics, particularly in the electromagnetic field, the propagation delay is the length of time it takes for a signal to travel to its destination. For example, in the case of an electric signal, it is the time taken for the signal to travel through a wire.

In return for divesting the local Bell Operating Companies (Baby Bells), AT&T; was allowed to have an unregulated division to sell computer hardware and software. Prior to the divestiture of the Bell System on January 1, 1984, the Bell Labs Processor Division had developed the 3B20D (\\"D\\" for Duplex); the commercial simplex version 3B20S, which competed with the DEC VAX for internal Bell System usage; the world's first 32-bit microprocessor, the Bellmac 32A; and, using this microprocessor, the 3B5 and 3B15 computers for billing and telecom switching control applications. ==Divestiture== After divestiture, January 1, 1984, American Telephone & Telegraph was required to put its computer business into a fully separated subsidiary called AT&T; Information Systems (ATTIS, without the ampersand or hyphen). Software was developed in New Jersey locations (Murray Hill, Summit, Holmdel, and Piscataway), and software, hardware, and system solutions were developed in Naperville and Lisle, Illinois. After a couple years of court hearings, AT&T; was allowed to pull the business back into the mainstream corporate organization, and it was renamed AT&T; Data Systems Group, consisting of 3 divisions: Computer, Terminals (the Teletype Corporation of Skokie, Illinois), and Printers. In 1991, the AT&T; Data Systems Group, with the three divisions was announced to the public. In 1992 the Terminals division (Teletype Corporation) was sold to Memorex-Telex, and the Printer division, which had only bought OEM equipment from Genicom, was phased out. By the mid-1990s, this left only AT&T; Computer Systems. AT&T; Computer Systems (abbreviated AT&T-CS;) was the home of the UNIX System V operating system, originally developed in the Bell Labs Research Division. The important System V Interface Definition (SVID) was written, attempting to standardize the various flavors of Unix, and define the official interfaces which made up a UNIX operating system. In 1988, AT&T; announced its intent to buy up to a 20% stake in Sun Microsystems, a company then most well known for making high-end UNIX workstations. Upset at their academic-minded supplier (Bell Labs) now turned competitor (AT&T-CS;), the \\"Gang of Seven\\" founded the Open Software Foundation (OSF), each contributing source code from their UNIX SVR3 versions. AT&T; founded the UNIX International organization as a counter-response to the OSF. But by the late 1980s, AT&T; had almost given up, sold most of its stake in Sun Microsystems, spun the UNIX business off as Unix System Laboratories (which was later bought by Novell), canceled its WE 32000 (aka BELLMAC) and CRISP (C Reduced Instruction Set Processor) microprocessor product lines, and just concentrated on networked server computer systems. See also Unix wars. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, AT&T-CS; produced many \\"firsts\\" in the computer world, besides the UNIX operating system itself. The 3B5 and 3B15 were the first computers to be designed with the 32-bit WE 32000 microprocessor, and the 3B15 was the first computer to run a demand-paging version of Unix. There was a project, codenamed \\"Alice\\", to develop the 3B5 into an asymmetric multiprocessor with 3 CPUs, but this was canceled in favor of the demand paging 3B15 project, and a few of the \\"Alice\\" participants left the company and went to Sequent Computer Systems. The 3B5, 3B15, and 3B20S and 3B20D were aimed at the former AT&T; subsidiaries the RBOCs. However, starting with the ATT-IS days, development of a commercial version of this hardware commenced. The product line was started in 1982, with the introduction of the UNIX PC (aka the 3B1), based on a Motorola 68010 processor. This product was not a success, in part due to the high margin on the machines, AT&T; sold the machine for $8,000 although their cost was approximately $4,000. The next product was the 3B2 product line. It ranged from a 3B2/200 (desktop) unit, to a 3B2/1000, (data center sized), these machines were sold with System V Release 2, and later System V Release 3. The 3B2 was the reference platform for SVR3. ==Desktops== The 3B2 was the first desktop supermicrocomputer (1983) with a 32-bit microprocessor and UNIX. The model 300 and 400 series were uniprocessors. The 3B2 became the official \\"porting base\\" for UNIX System V Release 3. Later versions were the first to introduce UNIX asymmetric multiprocessing (3B2/600 Falcon) and nearly symmetrical multiprocessing (3B2/1000 Galactica). The Falcon won the highly touted US Air Force Office Automation contract, initially estimated at $1.7 billion, and the largest single computer contract the Federal government had awarded at that time. It was also the first supermicrocomputer to use a first- level cache memory based on virtual addresses instead of physical addresses, which made it 80% faster than the original requirements called for. Because the 3B5/3B15 was a large minicomputer with only 1 CPU, it was sometimes referred to as \\"the body without a brain\\". Also the small 3B2 had a desktop design with (supposedly) less expansion capability, but had capacity available for up to 4 CPUs, it was thus also at times referred to as \\"the brain without a body\\". The \\"Companion\\" was developed, the first \\"laptop\\" computer to have a 32-bit CPU and UNIX. The \\"Alexander\\" system measured about 14 inches on each side square, and about 5 inches high, featured a unique stacking I/O bus for up to 8 cards, featured compressed Unix filesystems on pluggable ROM cartridges like modern gaming consoles, and used the WE 32100 microprocessor running UNIX SVR3. Both were so outrageous and ahead of their time, they were never marketed. ==Servers== On the large side, the 3B4000 (1986) was the first \\"snugly coupled\\" multiprocessor (the \\"network in a box\\"), containing the A-BUS which supported 16 large single-board computer (SBC) circuit panels, and featured the first SVR4 distributed UNIX kernel (codenamed \\"Apache\\", nothing to do with the open source project started in the 1990s). Although the SBCs did not share address space, the UNIX kernel was distributed across all SBCs in a single virtual image. The StarServer E (\\"Enterprise\\" or SSE) was an Intel-based symmetric multiprocessor (SMP), introduced just after the Sequent system, making the SSE the world's second SMP UNIX system, and the first to run System V.4. It featured 4 Intel i486 CPUs. A later design (codenamed \\"Bigfoot\\") was to feature 10 Pentium CPUs, but this was never released because of the NCR deal. AT&T-CS; also introduced the world's first \\"PC&C;\\" (personal computer and communication), the famous AT&T; Safari laptop, the first to have a built-in modem and networking. This system used an Intel x86 microprocessor, and ran Microsoft software instead of Unix. AT&T-CS; also marketed a line of desktop PCs, first using Olivetti as an OEM, later designing its own product line (codename Cascade) using OEM mainboards from Intel. Other innovative designs which were never released included the \\"Starburst\\", a distributed Unix kernel message-passing multiprocessor with a fiber-optic switching core, and \\"Intercept\\", a unique High-Availability multiprocessor. ==Partners== NCR 3000 (Class 3434) external view (manufactured 1989) NCR 3000 (Class 3434) 80486 internal view (manufactured 1989) AT&T-CS; also bought OEM systems from Tandem Computers and Pyramid Technology. The Tandem Integrity S2 was renamed the StarServer FT and sold only internally to other AT&T; divisions. The Pyramid \\"System 7000\\" was a large symmetric multiprocessor, containing 12 CPUs, and saw its first large-scale application at the AT&T; Universal Cards credit-card billing center, the first enterprise-scale replacement of mainframes by a UNIX server within AT&T.; Both these systems used the MIPS R-series RISC microprocessors. After the WE 32000 microprocessors were canceled, the 3B2 follow-on (codenamed \\"Phoenix\\") was also to use a MIPS CPU. The entire MIPS- based product line was to be renamed the System 9000, and to feature \\"scalavailability\\" - from normal commercial availability (NCA) choices, to fault-tolerant (FT), to high performance SMP. The System 9000 strategy was canceled when AT&T;'s Board of Directors decided to close down AT&T; Computer Systems, and buy the NCR Corporation, announced in 1991, and implemented January 1, 1992. NCR management tried to cancel all further development of AT&T-CS; systems, though some refused to allow this for a few years, and backlash from AT&T; Network Systems (later to be spun off as Lucent Technologies) precipitated a purge of NCR upper management by the AT&T; Board. NCR had just developed and suddenly canceled its Motorola 88000-based systems, and then started the NCR 3000 series, developed using Intel x86 microprocessors. The AT&T; StarServer E could still beat the comparably equipped NCR 3450 by 11% in the TPC Benchmark B test, and some of the SSE's 7 patented innovations were then adapted and retrofitted into the NCR 3000 design. NCR was renamed AT&T; Global Information Solutions (AT&T-GIS;) in 1994, and some of the top NCR management was purged. The Naperville, IL operation provided LifeKeeper Fault Resilient System software (a failover high-availability software cluster product), the Distributed lock manager for Oracle Parallel Server, and the Vistium computer-telephony integrated (CTI) on-line hardware-assisted networked meeting product. Only about 400 employees remained in the Naperville location by the beginning of 1995. In the mid-1980s, there had been something like 30,000 employees associated with AT&T-CS;, including marketing, customer support, factories, and development. In 1994 a high powered team from AT&T; Naperville transferred to NCR San Diego in the midst of developing a Micro Channel architecture based four channel SCSI adapter based on a custom ASIC. This host bus adapter went on to great success in NCR and served as a connection point for over a billion dollars worth of peripherals attached to NCR minicomputers and database servers. On September 20, 1995, Bob Allen, American Telephone & Telegraph Chairman of the Board and CEO, announced the \\"trivestiture\\" - the 3-way split of American Telephone & Telegraph into the new service-oriented American Telephone & Telegraph, a newly independent NCR, and the new telecom equipment business which would later be named Lucent Technologies. On December 15, the former AT&T-CS; operations were shut down, signaling the end of AT&T;'s involvement in designing computer systems. 3 AT&T-CS; employees went into the new NCR, 25 stayed with AT&T;, and the rest (about 200) went to Lucent. Many former AT&T; Computer Systems employees have been employed by Schaumburg, IL based Motorola. ==See also== *3B Computers * DMERT operating system * J. O.

Disgusted with his former employers, Bond places his services on the open market, where he later attracts the attention of representatives of SPECTRE who are quite willing to put their one-time enemy on their payroll. But the whole thing was a hoax, just a plan to get Bond inside the enemy's organization. Prior to joining up, Bond spends a month in Monte Carlo with Miss 'Percy' Proud, a CIA agent who teaches him everything she knows about programming languages and computers in general. This background allows Bond to attract Jay Autem Holy, an agent of SPECTRE who left the Pentagon, faked his death, and later started a computer game company that creates simulations based on real-life battles and wars. Bond's allegiance to SPECTRE is periodically questioned throughout the novel, even at one point going so far as to send Bond to a terrorist training camp (known as \\"Erewhon\\") to see if he has 'the right stuff'. Proving his worth, Bond becomes involved in a plot to destabilise the Soviet Union and the United States, by forcing them to rid the world of their nuclear weapons. What SPECTRE leaders Tamil Rahani and Dr. Jay Autem Holy suspect, but never fully realise is that Bond's resignation is false.

The screenplay by Rod Serling was an adaptation of his teleplay Patterns originally telecast January 12, 1955 on the Kraft Television Theatre, which starred Sloane, Begley and Richard Kiley. ==Plot== Most of the scenes are set in the corporate boardroom and surrounding offices of Ramsey & Co., a Manhattan industrial empire headed by the ruthless Walter Ramsey. He brings youthful industrial engineer Fred Staples, whose performance at a company Ramsey has recently acquired has impressed him, to do a top executive job at the head office. Ramsey is grooming Staples to replace the aging Bill Briggs as the second in command at the company. Briggs has been with the firm for decades, having worked for and admired the company's founder, Ramsey's father. His concern for the employees clashes repeatedly with Ramsey's ruthless methods. Ramsey will not fire Briggs outright but does everything in his power to sabotage and humiliate him into resigning. The old man stubbornly refuses to give in. Staples has mixed feelings about the messy situation, his ambition conflicting with his sympathy for Briggs. The stress gets to Briggs, who collapses after a confrontation with Ramsey and later dies. This causes a heated showdown between Ramsey and Staples, in which Staples announces he is quitting and Ramsey says that only high performers have any right to leading posts. In the end, Ramsey persuades him to stay, telling him that he is the only one who can function at Briggs's level and that he would not be able to reach his full potential anywhere else. Staples accepts a promotion with double his salary and stock options but warns Ramsey that he will actively work to replace him in the company. Staples also tells Ramsey of Briggs' \\"one pitiful little dream\\" of someday walking in and breaking Ramsey's jaw. He now reserves that dream for himself. Ramsey says he'll have it written into the contract agreement and will attach a special rider giving him the same privilege. Ramsey notes that Briggs' son will be \\"taken care of\\" and Staples asks if that will let him sleep better tonight. Ramsey smiles and says \\"It begins.\\" While the film's initial goal was to seemingly deconstruct and examine the world of corporate America, and those at the top of the ladder, it ends endorsing it. That is to say, as long as money and power are at stake, how people are treated in the workplace matters little. ==Cast== * Van Heflin as Fred Staples * Everett Sloane as Walter Ramsey * Ed Begley as William Briggs * Beatrice Straight as Nancy Staples, Fred's wife * Elizabeth Wilson as Marge Fleming, Briggs' loyal secretary, who is reassigned to Staples * Joanna Roos as Miss Margaret Lanier, Ramsey's secretary * Valerie Cossart as Miss Stevens * Eleni Kiamos as Sylvia Trammel * Ronnie Welsh as Paul Briggs, William's teenage son * Shirley Standlee as Miss Hill * Andrew Duggan as Mr. Jameson * Jack Livesey as Mr. Vanderventer * John Seymour as Mr. Gordon * James Kelly as Mr. Latham * John Shelly as Mr. Grannigan ==From play to film== Apart from establishing shots on New York City streets, the film's screenplay makes a couple of major changes from the teleplay - after the death of Andy Sloane, Fred Staples is shown at a bar, where his wife comes to pick him up and take him home, insisting he is in no condition to drive. Staples is more insistent in the film than in the play that he and his wife leave town, even telling her to pack. The final confrontation between Staples and Ramsey takes place the next day, not immediately afterwards. For the film, Andy Sloane's name was altered to \\"Bill Briggs.\\" Also, Ramsey and Company is depicted as a huge corporate machine, with expansive quarters downtown. And the company does things \\"in a big way.\\" In the teleplay, Staples tells Ramsey he and his wife have \\"found a house\\", but the film version has Staples moving into a big home more or less provided by the company, and stocked with \\"all the essentials\\" including beer in the ice box and food in the freezer. While Sloane and Begley reprised their roles, Heflin replaced Kiley in the role of up-and-coming executive Fred Staples, though at 46, he was arguably a little too old to play a junior executive. But Serling also changed Staples's character. Instead of a junior-level manager of a small factory that had done some sub-contracting work for Ramsey, he was now shown as the manager of a presumably much larger facility taken over by Ramsey and Company, and whose performance there in keeping the factory afloat during that period impressed Ramsey enough to hire Staples direct. In the teleplay, the other execs talk of having expected a much older man. That was also omitted from the film version. ==Reception== ===Critical response=== Film critic Dennis Schwartz highly praised the film and also discussed the background of the production in his review, \\"Patterns is based on the teleplay of Rod Serling which was aired live on TV in January of 1955 on Kraft Television Theater, and was so-well received that it was repeated four weeks later. That was something not done during that period. This brilliant script by the creator of the Twilight Zone, Rod Serling, is considered by many as the finest piece of writing he has ever done and brought him instant acclaim. It is ably directed by Fielder Cook ... The ensemble cast is superb, with special kudos to Van Heflin, Ed Begley, Beatrice Straight and Everett Sloane. This is Van Heflin's finest role since Shane (1953).\\" In the April 27, 2008 edition of TV Week, the television critic Tom Shales compared the movie unfavorably to the live TV production: :Some people thought live TV was the beginning of a truly new storytelling medium—one uniquely suited to intimate, unadorned, psychological dramas—but it turned out to be a beginning with a tiny middle and a rushed end... Patterns was so well-received that Kraft mounted a live repeat of the show a month later, and the intimate TV show was turned into a less intimate (and somehow less satisfying) movie in 1956. Except for the use of terms like “mimeographed” and “teletype,” little about the drama seems dated, unless one is of the opinion that corporate politics and boardroom bloodletting no longer exist... With minimally judicious scene-setting (shots of clocks, a building directory, a switchboard) and a rapid introduction of characters, Serling pulls a viewer almost immediately into his story, a tale of corporate morality—or the lack of it—and such everyday battles as the ones waged between conscience and ambition. ==See also== *List of American films of 1956 ==References* * * Patterns at the TCM Movie Database * * Patterns plot summary at Classic Film Guide Category:1956 films Category:1956 drama films Category:American business films Category:American films Category:American drama films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Films about businesspeople Category:Films based on television plays Category:Films directed by Fielder Cook Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films with screenplays by Rod Serling Category:United Artists films Category:1956 directorial debut films ","title":"Patterns (film)"},{"id":"1275440","text":" The Armstrong Siddeley Mamba was a British turboprop engine produced by Armstrong Siddeley in the late 1940s and 1950s, producing around 1,500 effective horsepower (1,100 kW).

A 500-hour test was undertaken in 1948 and the Mamba was the first turboprop engine to power the Douglas DC-3, when in 1949, a Dakota testbed was converted to take two Mambas. The Mamba was also developed into the form of the Double Mamba, which was used to power the Fairey Gannet anti-submarine aircraft for the Royal Navy. This was essentially two Mambas lying side-by-side and driving contra-rotating propellers separately through a common gearbox. A turbojet version of the Mamba was developed as the Armstrong Siddeley Adder, by removing the reduction gearbox.Gunston 1989, p.20. ==Variants and applications== The Armstrong Siddeley Mamba-powered Douglas C-47B Dakota testbed in 1954 showing the slim outline of the Mambas ;ASMa.3 Mamba: :Armstrong Whitworth Apollo :Avro Athena :Boulton Paul Balliol :Breguet Vultur :Miles M.69 Marathon II :Douglas C-47 Dakota :Short SB.3 ;ASMa.5 Mamba:Development engine for Armstrong Siddeley ASMD.3 Double Mamba ;ASMa.6 Mamba: :Short Seamew ;ASMa.7 Mamba:A version for civil applications ;Swiss-Mamba SM-1 (aft turbofan variant) :EFW N-20 ;Mamba 112: (ASMa.6) ==Engines on display== An Armstrong Siddeley Mamba is on static display at the Midland Air Museum, Coventry Airport, Warwickshire, at the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford and at the East Midlands Aeropark.

Francis Hincks, a journalist and colonial administrator, was invited to become its first cashier. In 1835, it was taken over by a group of Reformers and constituted as a joint-stock company called the Farmers' Joint Stock Banking Company by deed of settlement. The first board of directors appointed John Elmsley, a member of the Family Compact, to be its first president, which forced Hincks and other Reform investors to leave and found the Bank of the People in December 1835. When Upper Canada moved in 1837 to restrict the ability of institutions other than incorporated banks to issue their own banknotes, the Bank was exempted. A financial crisis that affected Upper Canada in 1837 resulted in a suspension of the Bank's activities for two months at the end of that year. In 1838, it was barred from issuing banknotes that were not payable on demand. Economic conditions, together with poor management and political intrigue, led to a move by the board to wind up the Bank in January 1844, which was not completed until December 1848 with its sale to new owners. William Brown Phipps, who had been Manager since 1841, returned to become Manager of the revived Bank in March 1849. In June 1849, it flooded Toronto and Buffalo with new issues of its banknotes, which were subsequently boycotted by merchants. It was finally closed in 1854.

One of two families in the order Myctophiformes, the Myctophidae are represented by 246 species in 33 genera, and are found in oceans worldwide. They are aptly named after their conspicuous use of bioluminescence. Their sister family, the Neoscopelidae, are much fewer in number but superficially very similar; at least one neoscopelid shares the common name 'lanternfish': the large-scaled lantern fish, Neoscopelus macrolepidotus. Lanternfish are among the most widely distributed, diverse and populous vertebrates, with some estimates suggesting that they may have a total global biomass of 550–660 million metric tonnes, accounting for up to 65% of all deep-sea fish biomass. Commercial fisheries for them exist off South Africa, in the sub-Antarctic, and in the Gulf of Oman. == Description == Myctophum punctatum Lanternfish typically have a slender, compressed body covered in small, silvery deciduous cycloid scales (ctenoid in four species), a large bluntly rounded head, large elliptical to round lateral eyes (dorsolateral in Protomyctophum species), and a large terminal mouth with jaws closely set with rows of small teeth. The fins are generally small, with a single high dorsal fin, a forked caudal fin, and an adipose fin. The anal fin is supported by a cartilaginous plate at its base, and originates under, or slightly behind, the rear part of the dorsal fin. The pectoral fins, usually with eight rays, may be large and well-developed to small and degenerate, or completely absent in a few species. In some species, such as those of the genus Lampanyctus, the pectorals are greatly elongated. Most lanternfish have a gas bladder, but it degenerates or fills with lipids during the maturation of a few species. The lateral line is uninterrupted. In all but one species, Taaningichthys paurolychnus, a number of photophores (light-producing organs) are present; these are paired and concentrated in ventrolateral rows on the body and head. Some may also possess specialised photophores on the caudal peduncle, in proximity to the eyes (e.g., the \\"headlights\\" of Diaphus species), and luminous patches at the base of the fins. The photophores emit a weak blue, green, or yellow light, and are known to be arranged in species-specific patterns. In some species, the pattern varies between males and females. This is true for the luminous caudal patches, with the males' being typically above the tail and the females' being below the tail. Lantern fish are generally small fish, ranging from about in length, with most being under . In life, shallow-living species are an iridescent blue to green or silver, while deeper-living species are dark brown to black. They are the most populous fish species in the open ocean with an approximate density of one per cubic metre. ==Ecology== Lanternfish are well known for their diel vertical migrations: during daylight hours, most species remain within the gloomy bathypelagic zone, between deep, but towards sundown, the fish begin to rise into the epipelagic zone, between deep. The lanternfish are thought to do this to avoid predation, and because they are following the diel vertical migrations of zooplankton, upon which they feed. After a night spent feeding in the surface layers of the water column, the lanternfish begin to descend back into the lightless depths and are gone by daybreak. Most species remain near the coast, schooling over the continental slope. Different species are known to segregate themselves by depth, forming dense, discrete conspecific layers, probably to avoid competition between different species. Due to their gas bladders, these layers are visible on sonar scans and give the impression of a \\"false bottom\\"; this is the so-called deep-scattering layer that so perplexed early oceanographers (see below). Great variability in migration patterns occurs within the family. Some deeper-living species may not migrate at all, while others may do so only sporadically. Migration patterns may also depend on life stage, sex, latitude, and season. The arrangements of lanternfish photophores are different for each species, so their bioluminescence is thought to play a role in communication, specifically in shoaling and courtship behaviour. The concentration of the photophores on the flanks of the fish also indicate the light's use as camouflage; in a strategy termed counterillumination, the lanternfish regulate the brightness of the bluish light emitted by their photophores to match the ambient light level above, effectively masking the lanternfishes' silhouette when viewed from below. A major source of food for many marine animals, lanternfish are an important link in the food chain of many local ecosystems, being heavily preyed upon by whales and dolphins, large pelagic fish such as salmon, tuna and sharks, grenadiers and other deep-sea fish (including other lanternfish), pinnipeds, sea birds, notably penguins, and large squid such as the jumbo squid, Dosidicus gigas. Lanternfish themselves have been found to feed on bits of plastic debris accumulating in the oceans. At least one lantern fish was found with over 80 pieces of plastic chips in its gut, according to scientists monitoring ocean plastic in the Pacific Ocean's eastern garbage patch. ==Deep scattering layer== Sonar operators, using the newly developed sonar technology during World War II, were puzzled by what appeared to be a false sea floor 300–500 metres deep at day, and less deep at night. This turned out to be due to millions of marine organisms, most particularly small mesopelagic fish, with swimbladders that reflected the sonar. These organisms migrate up into shallower water at dusk to feed on plankton. The layer is deeper when the moon is out, and can become shallower when clouds pass over the moon.Ryan P \\"Deep- sea creatures: The mesopelagic zone\\" Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand. Updated 21 September 2007. Sampling via deep trawling indicates that lanternfish account for as much as 65% of all deep sea fish biomass. Indeed, lanternfish are among the most widely distributed, populous, and diverse of all vertebrates, playing an important ecological role as prey for larger organisms. The estimated global biomass of lanternfish is 550–660 million metric tonnes, several times the entire world fisheries catch. Lanternfish also account for much of the biomass responsible for the deep scattering layer of the world's oceans. Sonar reflects off the millions of lanternfish swim bladders, giving the appearance of a false bottom. ==References== ==Further references== * * \\"Order Myctophiformes: Blackchins and Lanternfishes\\".

Soon after his birth the family emigrated to Moscow, Russia. Galamian studied violin at the School of the Philharmonic Society with Konstantin Mostras (a student of Leopold Auer) and graduated in 1919. He was jailed at age fifteen by the Bolshevik government. The opera manager at the Bolshoi Theatre rescued Galamian; the manager argued that Galamian was a necessary part of the opera orchestra, and subsequently the government released him. Soon thereafter he moved to Paris and studied under Lucien Capet in 1922 and 1923. In 1924 he debuted in Paris. Due to a combination of nerves, health, and a fondness for teaching, Galamian eventually gave up the stage in order to teach full-time. He became a faculty member at the Conservatoire Rachmaninoff where he taught from 1925 to 1929. His earliest pupils in Paris include Vida Reynolds, the first woman in Philadelphia Orchestra's first- violin section, and Paul Makanowitzky. In 1937 Galamian moved permanently to the United States. In 1941 he married Judith Johnson in New York City. He taught violin at the Curtis Institute of Music beginning in 1944, and became the head of the violin department at the Juilliard School in 1946. He wrote two violin method books, Principles of Violin Playing and Teaching (1962) and Contemporary Violin Technique (1962). Galamian incorporated aspects of both the Russian and French schools of violin technique in his approach. In 1944 he founded the Meadowmount School of Music, a summer program in Westport, New York. The school has remained operational and has trained thousands of world class musicians. Galamian taught concurrently at Curtis, Juilliard, and Meadowmount schools. He did not retire and maintained an active full-time work schedule. He died at the age of 78 in 1981 in New York City. Following his passing, his wife took on an active role in managing the Meadowmount school. Galamian's most notable teaching assistants — later distinguished teachers in their own right — were Margaret Pardee, Dorothy DeLay, Sally Thomas, Pauline Scott, Robert Lipsett, Lewis Kaplan, David Cerone, and Elaine Richey. Galamian held honorary degrees from the Curtis Institute of Music, Oberlin College, and the Cleveland Institute of Music. He was an honorary member of the Royal Academy of Music, London. ==Notable pupils== Sando Shia *William Barbini * *Serge Blanc (violinist) *Anker Buch *Robert Canetti *Stuart Canin *Jonathan Carney *José Francisco del Castillo *Charles Martin Castleman *Kyung Wha Chung *Dorothy DeLay *Glenn Dicterow *Charles Avsharian *Michael Avsharian *Philippe Djokic *Eugene Fodor *Miriam Fried *Erick Friedman *Joseph Genualdi *Shirley Givens *Heimo Haitto *Daniel Heifetz *Ulf Hoelscher *Carmel Kaine *Kaoru Kakudo *Dong-Suk Kang *Martha Strongin Katz *Ani Kavafian *Ida Kavafian *Chin Kim *Young Uck Kim *Helen Kwalwasser *Fredell Lack *Jaime Laredo *Isidor Lateiner *Sergiu Luca * *Gil Morgenstern *David Nadien *Sally O'Reilly *Margaret Pardee *Itzhak Perlman *Michael Rabin *Gerardo Ribeiro *Berl Senofsky *Simon Standage *Arnold Steinhardt *Albert Stern *Eva Szekely *Arve Tellefsen *Sally Thomas *Gwen Thompson *Andor Toth *Charles Treger *Donald Weilerstein *Pinchas Zukerman *Simon Shaheen == Edited works == *Bach, Concerto No. 1 (A minor).

It was founded after they failed to establish a \\"Provincial Loan Office\\" in which farmers could borrow small sums guaranteed by their land holdings. The Bank of the People was the only bank in Upper Canada not to suspend payments during the financial panic of 1837-8. Many of the shareholders, however, took part in the Rebellion of 1837 and the Family Compact plotted to have it taken over by the Bank of Montreal in 1840. == Bank Wars 1835-1838 == === Chartered vs Joint Stock Banks === Until 1835, every bank in Upper Canada required a legislated charter which established it as a legal person able to sue, and be sued at law. Only two Banks had been chartered: the Bank of Upper Canada and the Commercial Bank of the Midland District. Both banks were controlled by the \\"Family Compact\\" who used their control of the currency supply and credit to control trade and ultimately, the farmers. They had a \\"licensed monopoly\\" to print paper money, which reduced competition. In 1835, Dr Charles Duncombe, a Reform politician in the Legislative Assembly, was part of a \\"Select Committee on Currency\\" that offered a template for the creation of joint stock banks based on several successful Scottish banks. The Scottish bank system had always differed from the English system. The difference between the English chartered banks and the Scottish joint stock banks lay almost entirely on the issue of stockholder liability and its implications for the issuance of bank notes. The joint stock banks lacked limited liability, hence every partner in the bank was responsible for the bank's debts to the full extent of their personal property. The chartered banks, in contrast, protected their shareholders with limited liability and hence from major loss; they thus encouraged speculation. The chartered banks would loan out many more banknotes (little more than bank issued I.O.U.s) than they had specie (legal tender) to exchange for those notes once redeemed. The more banknotes they loaned out the more interest they made, but at the increased risk of bankruptcy. Protected by limited liability, their shareholders put profit above risk. The Scottish joint-stock banks, in contrast, followed a \\"hard money policy\\", whereby they would issue a banknote only if they had enough specie to cover it. They avoided speculative risk because if they failed, their shareholders were responsible for the full loss. Since the banks did not require a legislated charter, many more banks could be founded, and they were more competitive, thereby endangering the solvency of the speculative chartered banks. === The Bank of the People === Eight dollar note issued by the Bank of the PeopleDr. Duncombe's report opened the legal door for new banks to be founded. The Reformers' abandoned their attempt to establish a \\"Provincial Loan Fund\\" for farmers in the Legislative Assembly, and instead turned their efforts to creating a new joint-stock bank. The first bank to be proposed was the Farmer's Bank. However, in a bitter shareholder proxy battle, control of the bank was won by the Hon. John Elmsley Jr., a member of the Family Compact. He was one of the largest shareholders in the Bank of Upper Canada. Sir Francis Hincks, Bank of the People Cashier and later premier of Canada West William Lyon Mackenzie argued that the Bank of Upper Canada \\"served the double purpose of keeping the merchants in chains of debt and bonds to the bank manager, and the Farmer's acres under the harrow of the storekeeper. You will be shewn how to break this degraded yoke of mortgages, ejectments, judgments and bonds. Money bound you - money shall loose you\\" (Correspondent & Advocate 30-7-1835). Inspired, the Reformers, led by James Lesslie, a prominent Toronto businessman and Reform city alderman, then founded the Bank of the People on Nov. 4, 1835, seeking to limit shareholders to known Reformers. Dr John Rolph was elected president, and James Lesslie the cashier (manager). Among its stockholders were David Willson and the Children of Peace who operated the first credit union in Canada in their village of Hope. Sir Francis Hincks, head cashier at the Farmer's Bank, later became cashier at the Bank of the People and Lesslie became president. One loan from the bank stood out: they gave William Lyon Mackenzie £200 to found the Constitution newspaper on July 4, 1836 to organize the democratic reformers of Upper Canada.https://www.archives.gov.on.ca/english/on-line-exhibits/sharon- temple/bank.aspx Archives of Ontario The new bank was soon to prove its distinctiveness. Despite offering 5% interest on deposits, it was able to deliver a 6% dividend in 1837, in spite of paying off £1,200 in start-up costs. It managed to do this despite the general economic downturn, and without resorting to widespread litigation. The Bank was located in a house on New (Jarvis) Street owned by James Beaty, a reform city councillor. During the financial panic of 1837-8, the Tory dominated Legislative Assembly banned all further joint-stock banks, even though it was the speculative chartered Bank of Upper Canada that was insolvent and required a government bailout. The Bank of the People survived the panic unscathed and without recourse to government protection. The bank was purchased by the Bank of Montreal in 1840. Like the other Canadian chartered banks, it issued its own paper money. The Bank of Canada was established through the Bank of Canada Act of 1934 and the banks relinquished their right to issue their own currency. === Related Banks === The name selected by the reformers, the Bank of the People, reflects their emerging strong ties and shared strategies with reformers in Lower Canada, who were founding a similarly named bank in Montreal at the same time, in an effort to break the Bank of Montreal's monopoly there. The Banque du Peuple was formed under the title of DeWitt, Viger and Company, organized as a société en commandite, the French form of joint stock company. The Montreal bank's founders were Louis-Michel Viger, a Montreal lawyer and popular Patriote politician, and Jacob DeWitt, a wealthy American-born hardware merchant, ship owner and reform politician. They drew their clientele from among the French farmers and artisans. ==References== Category:Defunct banks of Canada Category:Bank of Montreal Category:Banks established in 1835 Category:Banks disestablished in 1840 Category:1840 disestablishments in Canada Category:Canadian companies established in 1835 ","title":"Bank of the People"},{"id":"1275456","text":"Susan Werner (born 1965) is an American singer-songwriter. Much of Werner's work has been in the contemporary folk genre. ==Career== Werner was raised on her family's farm near Manchester, Iowa, about an hour west of Dubuque. She became interested in music at a young age and went on to receive a bachelor's degree in voice at the University of Iowa. In 1987, she moved to Philadelphia, and earned a master's degree in voice at Temple University. Werner initially wanted a career in opera, but after seeing a Nanci Griffith performance became inspired and began composing songs of her own on acoustic guitar. Performing around Philadelphia, Boston, and New York City, Susan began making a name for herself in the folk scene of the early 1990s. She recorded five albums from 1993 to 2001, and in 2001 she moved to Chicago. Her first five albums were all in the folk genre, but Werner's sixth album, I Can't Be New (2004), was a substantial departure, with original material in the vein of Tin Pan Alley, cabaret, and early jazz torch songs. Werner's seventh album, The Gospel Truth, was released in March 2007 and addresses themes of religion, faith, social responsibility, as well as religion from an agnostic's point of view. In 2010, Tom Jones recorded \\"Did Trouble Me\\", from Werner's The Gospel Truth, for his album Praise and Blame. Her eighth album, Live at Club Passim is collection of original songs (gospel, jazz & folk) recorded with her band: Colleen Sexton, Trina Hamlin & bassist Greg Holt. For her ninth album, Classics, she performs pop music from the 1960s and 1970s accompanied by chamber instruments. Her tenth album, entitled Kicking the Beehive, was released in March 2011. Produced by Rodney Crowell, it features guest appearances from Vince Gill, Keb' Mo and Paul Franklin. Her album Hayseed, a concept album about \\"farms, farmers, and the people who love them\\", was released in the summer of 2013. Werner branched out to write the music and lyrics for a musical based on the film Bull Durham, which premiered at Atlanta's Alliance Theatre on September 3, 2014. In 2017 Werner released An American In Havana, an EP featuring six songs written during two trips to Cuba in 2015 and 2016. ==Personal life== Werner was born into a musical family. Her mother was a singer, although her father's musical ability was limited to \\"whistling on pitch\\". All five of her siblings are musically talented. One brother is a professional stand-up comedian and another brother is a performing drag queen. ==Discography== * Midwestern Saturday Night (1993) * Live at Tin Angel (1993) * Last of the Good Straight Girls (1995) * Time Between Trains (1998) * New Non-Fiction (2001) * I Can't Be New (2004) * The Gospel Truth (2007) * Live at Passim (2008) * Classics (2009) * Kicking The Beehive (2011) * Live at The Center for Arts in Natick (2011) * Hayseed (2013) * An American in Havana (2017) * NOLA (2019) * Flyover Country (2020) ==References* Category:American folk singers Category:American folk guitarists Category:American singer-songwriters Category:American female singer- songwriters Category:Songwriters from Iowa Category:American women guitarists Category:Singers from Iowa Category:University of Iowa alumni Category:Temple University alumni Category:American agnostics Category:Living people Category:People from Delaware County, Iowa Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Private Music artists Category:Guitarists from Iowa Category:21st-century women singers ","title":"Susan Werner"},{"id":"1275458","text":"Nobody Lives for Ever (published in American editions as Nobody Lives Forever), first published in 1986, was the fifth novel by John Gardner featuring Ian Fleming's secret agent, James Bond.MI6 :: The Home Of James Bond 007 Carrying the Glidrose Publications copyright, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape and in the United States by Putnam. ==Plot summary== En route to retrieve his faithful housekeeper, May, from a European health clinic where she is recovering from an illness, Bond is warned by the British Secret Service that Tamil Rahani, the current leader of SPECTRE, now dying from wounds suffered due to his last encounter with Bond (as described in Role of Honour), has put a price on Bond's head. \\"Trust no one,\\" Bond is warned. Soon after, May and Miss Moneypenny, who had been visiting his housekeeper are reported missing, and Bond finds himself dodging would-be assassins while searching for his friends, assisted by a young débutante and her capable, yet mysterious, female bodyguard. The price on Bond's head is a competition orchestrated by Rahani and SPECTRE known as 'The Head Hunt', and is an open contest to anyone willing to capture, kill, or present Bond to Rahani, where he would be subsequently decapitated by guillotine. Along Bond's journey of attempting to rescue Moneypenny and May, Bond is betrayed and chased by a number of people and organisations, including his own British Secret Service ally, Steve Quinn who has defected to the KGB, corrupted police officers, and agents of SPECTRE in disguise. ==Characters== * James Bond * M * Miss Moneypenny * May * Principessa Sukie Tempesta is an Italian Princess whom Bond saves while driving to check up on his Scottish housekeeper, May.

She stays with Bond acting as a hostage and later refusing to leave his side in his moment of need. She is accompanied after her second meeting with Bond by her friend and bodyguard, Nannie. * Nannette 'Nannie' Norrich is the head of an all-female bodyguard organisation, NUB, tasked to protect Sukie. The two are good friends; however, Sukie is unaware that Nannie has entered the competition as a freelancer and has promised Rahani to deliver Bond to him. * Herr Doktor Kirchtum is the doctor who was overseeing May while she was at the clinic. After Moneypenny and May were kidnapped, Kirchtum was taken captive by Steve Quinn and forced to send instructions to Bond. Bond later frees Kirchtum only to learn later that Kirchtum was actually in league with Quinn.

He is sent by M to assist Bond in fleeing mainland Europe so that Bond can return to London. Unbeknownst to everyone, Quinn has defected to the KGB and currently works for SMERSH (now known as Department Eight). Quinn is assisted in capturing Bond by Doktor Kirchtum, and, like the latter, is killed by either Nannie or Sukie (the identity is never given). * Tamil Rahani is the leader of SPECTRE, previously in Role of Honour. After parachuting from an airship at the end of Role of Honour to escape capture by Bond, he landed badly and injured his spine, which led to terminal cancer. Throughout the book, Rahani is said to have only a short time left to live. Knowing the end is near, Rahani initiates the 'Head Hunt' to capture Bond. Rahani is killed by Bond after having his bed rigged to detonate upon pushing the adjustment control button. ==Cover Art== Nobody Lives for Ever is the last time (to date) the trademark 'wood grain' cover art has been used on a Bond novel. It was first seen on From Russia, with Love in 1957. ==Publication history== * UK first hardback edition: June 1986 Jonathan Cape * U.S. first hardback edition: May 1986 Putnam * Thai language first edition: December 1986 Kangaroo (Jing Jo) Press * UK first paperback edition: August 1987 Coronet Books * U.S. first paperback edition: July 1987 Charter Books ==Reception== Critics were generally more enthusiastic about this Gardner Bond novel than his previous entries. Publishers Weekly praised the book noting that on the basis of this entry Bond is likely to live forever. \\"In true comic-book fashion, the gory chapters detail the horrors that kill almost everyone except Bond who obviously won't die until he wants to.\\" Kirkus Reviews called this the \\"most deft\\" of Gardner's Bond novels thus far, though felt that it did not measure up to Gardner's own 1985 straight spy novel The Secret Generations. The anonymous reviewer praised the \\"fairly inspired\\" plot gimmick involving hunt for Bond's own head. \\"Gardner weaves swift, outrageous coincidences into a preposterous plot that is quite fun to follow as it hops from the Tyrolean Alps to Salzburg to Key West. All in all, Gardner avoids some of the giganticism of the Bond flicks but certain climactic cliches - granted Bond's megalomaniacal villains - by now seem unavoidable, Even so, one dismisses the cliches for the amusement.\\" Frank Stilley, in a review for the Associated Press syndicated throughout the United States, said Gardner \\"lacks nothing\\" of Ian Fleming's gift for \\"conveying agaonizing suspense\\" and that \\"the yarn is a cinch\\" to please \\"James Bond's countless fans\\". Don O'Briant, books editor for The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution, said the book was an \\"exciting adventure\\" and noted it in his roundup of the year's best books. Future Bond author Raymond Benson said \\"This is far and away John Gardner's best James Bond novel, and it is precisely because it is such a personal plot for the leading character. It's a plot reminiscent of From Russia, With Love, and it moves along excitingly! The chase idea was splendid indeed, and the reader is chased along with Bond throughout the book.\\" Benson praised the story's \\"many surprising turns\\" and believed that if it were a film it would \\"have much of the same tension that something like Hitchcock's North by Northwest had.\\" Benson's only complaint was the lack of a central villain, though he praised the \\"well-written female characters (Sukie Tempesta and Nannie Norrich)\\" who accompany Bond. ==See also== * Outline of James Bond ==References== Category:1986 British novels Category:James Bond books Category:Novels by John Gardner (British writer) Category:Jonathan Cape books Category:Novels set in Austria Category:Novels set in Florida Category:Novels set in France ","title":"Nobody Lives for Ever"},{"id":"1275468","text":"Nobody Lives Forever may refer to: *Nobody Lives for Ever, a James Bond novel, released as Nobody Lives Forever in the U.S. *Nobody Lives Forever (film), a 1946 film starring John Garfield *Nobody Lives Forever (1998 film), a TV film starring Brenda Bakke *\\"Nobody Lives Forever\\", an episode of the Miami Vice television series ==See also== *The Operative: No One Lives Forever, a 2000 video game ","title":"Nobody Lives Forever"},{"id":"1275469","text":"49er with a gennaker (yellow) A gennaker is a sail that was developed around 1990. Used when sailing downwind, it is a cross between a genoa and a spinnaker. It is not symmetric like a true spinnaker but is asymmetric like a genoa, but the gennaker is not attached to the forestay like a jib or genoa. The gennaker is rigged like a spinnaker but the tack is fastened to the hull or to a bowsprit. It has greater camber than a genoa (but significantly less camber than a spinnaker). This is optimal for generating lift at larger angles of attack. An early form of gennaker was the \\"gollywhomper\\", used briefly in the 1870s. The gennaker is a specialty sail primarily used on racing boats to bridge the performance gap between a genoa and a spinnaker. It is sometimes the only downwind sail on board because it is easier to use and less expensive than a spinnaker. Due to its geometry, the sail is less prone to collapsing than a spinnaker. A gennaker is optimal for a beam reach, while an asymmetrical spinnaker is optimal for a broad reach or run. ==References== Category:Sailing rigs and rigging ","title":"Gennaker"},{"id":"1275470","text":"Adventures of Captain Marvel, Republic Pictures, 1941 A superhero film, superhero movie or superhero motion picture is a film that is focused on the actions of one or more superheroes: individuals who usually possess extraordinary – generally superhuman – abilities relative to a normal person and are dedicated to protecting the public. These films typically feature action, adventure, fantasy or science fiction elements, with the first film of a particular character often including a focus on the origin of their special powers and their first confrontation with their most famous supervillain or archenemy. Most superhero films are based on superhero comics. By contrast, several films such as the RoboCop series, The Meteor Man, the Unbreakable film series, The Incredibles, Hancock and They Call Me Jeeg are original for the screen, while The Green Hornet is based primarily on the original radio series and its 1960s television adaptation, both Underdog and The Powerpuff Girls are based on animated television series, and Japanese tokusatsu and anime superhero films are based on manga and television shows. Beginning in the 2000s, the superhero film has become a dominant form worldwide. The most notable and successful superhero films since the year 1998 are Blade (franchise), 20th Century Fox's X-Men franchise, Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, Pixar's The Incredibles series, Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy, the films set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe starting with Iron Man and the films set in the DC Extended Universe starting with Man of Steel. This commercial dominance has largely been accompanied by positive critical notice for many of these films, which includes Academy Award recognition. Superhero films have been commercially successful in a wide variety of genres such as action, horror, fantasy, comedy etc. Production of superhero films has also begun outside Hollywood since the 21st century, such as the Spanish Faust: Love of the Damned, the Italian The Invisible Boy, the Finnish Rendel: Dark Vengeance (and its upcoming sequel), and the Russian Guardians. ==History== ===Early years=== Almost immediately after superheroes rose to prominence in comic books (see List of DC Comics Characters and List of Marvel Comics characters) adapted into Saturday film serials aimed at children, starting with Mandrake the Magician (1939). Serials such as The Shadow (1940), Adventures of Captain Marvel (1941), Batman (1943), The Phantom (1943), Captain America (1944), and Superman (1948) followed. In the following decades, the decline of Saturday serials and turmoil in the comic book industry put an end to superhero motion pictures, with the exception of Superman and the Mole Men, starring George Reeves, which was a trial balloon for the television series Adventures of Superman, compilations of episodes of that same series released theatrically, and Batman (1966) a big-screen extension of the Batman television series starring Adam West.The Staff of Scarecrow, 2004, pg. 536 In 1957 Japan, Shintoho produced the first film serial featuring the tokusatsu superhero character Super Giant, signaling a shift in Japanese popular culture towards tokusatsu masked superheroes over kaiju giant monsters. Along with Astro Boy, the Super Giant film serials had a profound effect on Japanese tokusatsu superhero films.Japan Pop!: Inside the World of Japanese Popular Culture, p. 262 Another early superhero film was Ōgon Bat (1966), a Japanese film starring Sonny Chiba based on the 1931 Kamishibai superhero Ōgon Bat. The kaiju monster Godzilla, originally a villain, began being portrayed as a superhero in the Godzilla films. He has been described as \\"the original radioactive superhero\\" due to his nuclear origin story predating Spider-Man (1962 debut), although Godzilla did not become a hero until Ghidorah (1964). By the 1970s, Godzilla came to be viewed as a superhero, with the magazine King of the Monsters in 1977 describing Godzilla as \\"Superhero of the '70s.\\" Godzilla was \\"the most universally popular superhero of 1977\\" according to Donald F. Glut. Original superhero characters emerged in other, more comedy oriented films such as the French political satire film Mr. Freedom (1969) and the American B movies Rat Pfink a Boo Boo (1966) and The Wild World of Batwoman (1966). ===1978–1990s=== Riding a wave of a new interest in fantasy and science fiction films with the success of Star Wars, Richard Donner's Superman (1978), the first major big-budget superhero feature film, proved a critical and commercial success. Other successful entries emerged throughout the 1980s, from Richard Lester's Superman II (1980) and Paul Verhoeven's Robocop (1987) to Tim Burton's Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992)Lichtenfeld, 2007, pg. 286 Other films were released during the 1980s and 1990s including Flash Gordon (1980), Swamp Thing (1982), Superman III (1983), Supergirl (1984), The Toxic Avenger (1985), Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987), Bollywood's Mr. India (1987), The Punisher (1989), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990) and two sequels, Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D. (1990), The Rocketeer (1991), Batman Returns (1992), the animated Batman: Mask of the Phantasm (1993), The Shadow (1994), Batman Forever (1995), Tank Girl (1995), Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie (1995) on Sky Movies and a sequel, The Phantom (1996), Steel (1997), and Mystery Men (1999).Lichtenfeld, 2007, pg. 287 Marvel Comics' Captain America (1991) did not have a theatrical release and Roger Corman's The Fantastic Four (1994) was released neither theatrically nor on home video. Alex Proyas' The Crow (1994) became the first independent comics superhero film that established a franchise. As Joel Schumacher's Batman & Robin (1997) was critically panned for being too jokey and tongue-in-cheek, The Crow brought in a new realm of violence absent in previous popular superhero films targeted at younger audiences and bridging a gap to the more modern action film.Lichtenfeld, 2007, pg. 289 The success of The Crow catalyzed the release of a film version of Spawn (1997), Image Comics' leading character. The success of the \\"darker\\" Image Comics characters shifted the direction of comic book movies. Marvel soon released their films to become franchises, Men in Black (1997) and Blade (1998). After Marvel bought Malibu Comics (The company owned \\"Men in Black\\"), Marvel and Columbia Pictures released the Men in Black film and comics in 1997. The film became the first Marvel property to win an Oscar and the then highest-grossing comic book adaptation until the release of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man in 2002. Blade was also a mix of a more traditional action film as well as darker superhero film with the title character having vampire powers as well as carrying an arsenal of weaponry. The success of Blade began Marvel's film success (which debuted in Marvel Comics) and set the stage for further comic book film adaptations. The Matrix (1999) had an impact on superhero films. Influenced by comic books, cyberpunk fiction, Japanese anime, and Hong Kong action films, The Matrix effectively \\"reinvented\\" the superhero film, according to Adam Sternbergh of Vulture.com, crediting The Matrix with setting the template for modern superhero blockbusters and inspiring the superhero renaissance in the early 21st century. John Kenneth Muir in The Encyclopedia of Superheroes on Film and Television called the film a \\"revolutionary\\" reimagination of movie visuals, paving the way for the visuals of later superhero films, and credits it with helping to \\"make comic- book superheroes] hip\\" and its bullet time effect effectively demonstrating the concept of \\"faster than a speeding bullet\\" on screen. ===The 2000s=== thumb After the comic book boom and the success of several comic book adaptation films (including superhero films) in the 1990s, the first decade of the 21st century brought increased interest in superhero films and some of their most profitable franchises, many from Marvel Enterprises. The success of the X-Men TV series had made 20th Century Fox license the film rights in 1994. After the success of Men in Black in 1997, Columbia Pictures licensed the film rights of Spider-Man in 1999. 20th Century Fox's X-Men (2000) became a film franchise by its surprise hit,Lichtenfeld, 2007, pg. 293 and M. Night Shyamalan's Unbreakable (2000) also succeeded and added an element of more urban naturalism. Later, one of the largest blockbusters of all time was released with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (2002). With high ticket and DVD sales, several new superhero films were released every year in the 2000s, including Daredevil (2003), The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003), Hulk (2003), Catwoman (2004), Hellboy (2004), The Punisher (2004), the semi-animated Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004), Batman Begins (2005), Fantastic Four (2005), Ghost Rider (2007), Transformers (2007), Iron Man (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008), and Watchmen (2009). Some media commentators have attributed the increased popularity of superhero franchises in the new millennium to the social and political climate in Western society since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, although others have argued advances in special effects technology have played a more significant role. Others have postulated that its box office dominance is in part due to its flexibility. For example, with the common element being that they all feature heroes with extraordinary abilities and typically in a distinctive costume, many successful superhero films have used a plethora of genres such as horror (Blade), thriller (Unbreakable), period drama (Captain America: The First Avenger), space opera (Guardians of the Galaxy), family film (The Incredibles), teen film (Spider-Man: Homecoming), heist film (Ant-Man), fantasy (Doctor Strange), neo-noir (The Dark Knight), political drama (Captain America: The Winter Soldier), and Western (Logan). Many sequels and spin-offs were also released throughout the decade, including Blade II (2002), X2: X-Men United (2003), Spider-Man 2 (2004), Blade: Trinity (2004), Elektra (2005), X-Men: The Last Stand (2006), TMNT (2007), Spider-Man 3 (2007), Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007), Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008), The Dark Knight (2008), X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009). Non-Hollywood superhero films were also released, including the American/Spanish production Faust: Love of the Damned (2001), Japan's tokusatsu films Ultraman (2004), Casshern (2004) and Gatchaman (2013), Chile's Mirageman (2007), Malaysia's Cicak Man (2006), India's Krrish (2006), Drona (2008), Ra.One (2011), Krrish 3 (2013), and Thailand's Mercury Man (2006). Several non-action film oriented superhero films were released in the 2000s with varying ranges of success. Brad Bird's The Incredibles (2004) for Pixar was a critically acclaimed computer-animated superhero film aimed towards families. Other hybrids include Sky High (2005) and Zoom (2006) which were fusions of superhero and family film, My Super Ex-Girlfriend (2006) a combination of superhero and romantic comedy. Some series from the current and previous decades were also re-released, such as Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut (2006). Other series discarded the continuities of previously released films and began a reboot, most notably Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins (2005) as well as Louis Leterrier's The Incredible Hulk (2008) and Lexi Alexander's Punisher: War Zone (2008). Bryan Singer's Superman Returns (2006) is unique due to the fact that it is a sequel to the first two Superman films, yet also a reboot to the third and fourth films. The Batman Begins sequel The Dark Knight (2008) is the most nominated superhero film in Academy Award history with 8 nominations with two wins for Best Sound Editing and Best Supporting Actor for Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker. ===The 2010s=== Marvel's The Avengers (2012), one of the most commercially successful superhero films The 2010s has generally continued the box-office success of superhero films seen in the previous decade. In 2010, Matthew Vaughn's adaptation of Kick-Ass was released, followed by Iron Man 2 a month later. 2011 releases included The Green Hornet (2011), Green Lantern (2011), and X-Men: First Class (2011). Following references to the \\"Avengers Initiative\\" in the Iron Man films and The Incredible Hulk, Marvel released Thor on May 6, 2011, followed by Captain America: The First Avenger on July 22, 2011. Although the film Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance was released on February 17, 2012, to little audience interest, superhero films dominated that year's lucrative summer film market with three superhero films occupying the top three positions of the box office chart. This includes the May 2012 release of Marvel's The Avengers, which broke the box office record as the highest- grossing superhero film of all time. The next Batman film from Christopher Nolan, The Dark Knight Rises, is the sequel to Christopher Nolan's film The Dark Knight, and was released on July 20, 2012 in the second position while the third was occupied by reboot of the Spider-Man franchise, The Amazing Spider-Man, directed by Marc Webb and produced for Columbia Pictures. A Superman Returns sequel was planned for 2009 but got delayed and later scrapped in favor of the reboot, Man of Steel (2013). In 2008, there were reports that DC Comics planned to release Green Arrow: Escape from Super Max.Adler, Shawn. \\"Green Arrow Plans Jail Break With Help From Joker, Lex Luthor In Upcoming Film\\". MTV. August 13, 2008. Other intended releases from Marvel included several new X-Men films, Silver Surfer, Ant-Man, and movies based on DC superheroes such as Wonder Woman and the Flash. * * At the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con, Marvel confirmed that an Ant-Man film was in development, as well as a film based on 2008 comic series Guardians of the Galaxy, which was released in August 2014. Iron Man 3 was released in May 2013, Thor: The Dark World in November 2013, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier in April 2014. The Amazing Spider-Man 2, the sequel to the 2012 reboot was also released in May 2014, which became the lowest grossing and poorest critically rated film in the Spider-Man film series. In 2013, a sequel to the 2009 film X-Men Origins: Wolverine, titled The Wolverine was released. In 2014, X-Men: Days of Future Past released to critical acclaim and financial success; the film became the highest-grossing film in the X-Men series, and effectively rebooted the franchise. In 2014, Italian filmmaker Gabriele Salvatores directed a superhero-fantasy film titled Il ragazzo invisibile, or The Invisible Boy, which won the Young Audience Award at the 2015 European Film Awards. An Avengers sequel, titled Avengers: Age of Ultron was released in May 2015. Following the success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, rival DC Comics also planned to make and produce their own shared film universe called the DC Extended Universe which began with the release of Man of Steel; a sequel titled Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was schedule for release in May 2016, though it was later moved up to March 2016. Nickelodeon's 2015 film The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water features the main characters transform into superheroes. 20th Century Fox rebooted the Fantastic Four series and released Fantastic Four in August 2015. On March 9, 2015, publishing house Valiant Comics reached an unprecedented nine-figures deal with Chinese company DMG Entertainment to produce their own series of superhero movies, set in their own cinematic universe. The series will be co-produced by Sony Pictures and will start with a movie adaptation of Bloodshot for a 2016 release, followed by Harbinger, both movies receiving a sequel and ending in a crossover movie based on the Harbinger Wars arc from the comic books. In 2015, Italian filmmaker Gabrielle Mainetti directed a superhero film, titled They Call Me Jeeg starring Claudio Santamaria. Its original title is Lo chiamavano Jeeg Robot, from the Italian name of the anime and manga series Steel Jeeg. It was released in Italy on February 25, 2016. In 2016, the eighth installment in the X-Men series Deadpool was released in February, which went on to become the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time when unadjusted for inflation, and the highest-grossing film of the series. The ninth installment, X-Men: Apocalypse also released. Warner Bros. released Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice in March, which is the first film to feature both Batman and Superman, also released. This film performed moderately well at the box office but received poor reviews. Suicide Squad in August, which features a team of anti- hero/supervillains, both of which take place in the DC Extended Universe. Marvel Studios, meanwhile, released Captain America: Civil War in May, in which the Avengers splits into two opposing factions, and Doctor Strange, which recounts the superheroic origin of Stephen Strange, in November, both of which take place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In October, based on the eponymous toy line by Mattel, Max Steel was released. January 2017 saw the release of M. Night Shyamalan's Split, which served as a standalone sequel to Unbreakable. The first Finnish superhero film, Rendel: Dark Vengeance, was released in September 2017 and it has won the Best Action Movie award at the Feratum Film Festival in Mexico.Finnish superhero film Rendel awarded in Mexico Power Rangers, a movie reboot of the TV series, was released in March, with Lionsgate planning a 7-film franchise, but proved a commercial disappointment. By contrast, the film Logan, which was Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart's last appearances as their characters in the X-Men film series, proved a major critical and commercial success. This film was the first ever canon X-Men movie to be rated-R as normally they were PG-13. In the summer movie season, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Wonder Woman and Spider- Man: Homecoming confirmed the superhero film dominance of the mainstream movie market. That dominance continued into the fall with the success of Thor: Ragnarok, but Warner Brothers' attempt to consummate its attempt to have its own shared universe media franchise, the DC Extended Universe, with Justice League proved a critical and financial disappointment. In 2018, Marvel Studios released Black Panther on February 16 featuring the solo film adaptation of the first mainstream African superhero, the Black Panther. It proved a spectacular artistic and commercial success in the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise, especially considering its predominately African-American cast and creative crew which many in Hollywood considered ill-suited for popular success and during a time of year when North American filmgoing interest is traditionally at its weakest no less. Furthermore, it became the first superhero film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. While no other Marvel Studios' movies have been nominated for any such award, they continuously break records at the box office and receive positive critical reviews. This MCU project was soon followed up by the successful Avengers: Infinity War, released on April 27, 2018 which earned both critical praise and worldwide financial success earning an excess of $2 billion. Soon after, 20th Century Fox released Deadpool 2 on May 18, 2018 which proved a major success in both regards itself. In addition, Incredibles 2, the long-awaited sequel for the Academy Award-winning animated film The Incredibles, had its wide release on June 15, 2018 met with considerable critical praise and earned $182.68 million on its premiere weekend. The next superhero film in the Marvel Universe Ant-Man and the Wasp was released on July 6, with competing studios declining to release major films on American Independence Day in the face of the reliably popular film franchise. The anti-hero film Venom based on the comic book character was released on October 5, 2018 to poor reviews, but massive box-office success. In December 2018 Warner Bros. released Aquaman, a film about the DC Comics superhero of the same name, which became the DCEU's most successful film. 2019 began with M. Night Shyamalan's Glass, the culmination of Unbreakable and Split, in January. In March, the MCU's Captain Marvel overcame online hostility, in part because of star Brie Larson's comments about lack of diversity in the film and film criticism industries, to become the next film in the franchise to earn over $1 billion worldwide amid largely positive reviews. Later in April, the DCEU's Shazam!, featuring the lead character who was previously known as Captain Marvel himself, opened to wide acclaim and decent box office success for its relatively low budget, which has been seen as further evidence of the revitalization of the Warner Bros. media franchise. That same month, Avengers: Endgame ended the Infinity Saga with positive reviews and broke numerous box office records and became the fastest film to exceed $1 billion worldwide, doing so in five days. This film became the fastest to hit $1 billion and was later re-released again in theaters with extra scenes for the first time in an MCU film. The re-release made Avengers: Endgame become the highest-grossing film of all time, surpassing the film Avatar. By contrast, the June X-Men film Dark Phoenix performed poorly upon release due in part to poor critical reception. In addition, it was observed that there was noticeable fan indifference for a concluding film series of a property that would be put in the complete control of Marvel Studios producer, Kevin Feige, along with the Fantastic Four, for integration into the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise in due time considering Disney's acquisition of 20th Century Fox. In July 2019, Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe was concluded with the Sony film, Spider-Man: Far From Home which was released to critical and commercial success. ==Animated== Outside of live action, animated superhero films have also achieved critical and financial success. Nearly all animated superhero films are direct-to-video (Marvel Animation films, DC Universe Animated Original Movies, others) though the 1993 film there are a countless number of these films creating different events in them from the “normal” ones as seen on the big screen. These animated films think outside the box with these superheroes where these as live action films could cost too much money to make with little to no benefit from making a more narrow audience to see these films. Batman: Mask of the Phantasm was released theatrically and was a critical success (though a box-office failure). In 1968 was released VIP my Brother Superman directed by Italian animator Bruno Bozzetto; it is a parody of superheroesRoberto Chiavini, Gian Filippo Pizzo, Michele Tetro, Il grande cinema di fantascienza: da \\"2001\\" al 2001. Gremese Editore, 2001, p.159 and enjoyed great success. In 2004, Pixar released The Incredibles, about a retired superhero couple and their children, which did extremely well both critically and financially and went on to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. In 2010 DreamWorks Animation released Megamind to middling success. In 2014, Walt Disney Animation Studios released an adaptation of the Marvel Comics superhero team Big Hero 6. The same year, Warner Bros. released The Lego Movie, which had Batman and other DC Comics superheroes in major and supporting roles. A significant box-office success, it was followed in 2017 by The Lego Batman Movie, as well as DreamWorks Animation's Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie. In 2018, three theatrical animated superhero films were released to considerable critical and commercial success: Pixar's Incredibles 2, Warner Bros.'s Teen Titans Go! To the Movies, and Sony Pictures Animation's Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Furthermore, the latter of the three swept that year's major film awards for animated features, including the Academy Award. ==Parody== *Kinka Usher's 1999 film Mystery Men features a group of inept amateur superheroes. *Kevin Smith's 2001 film Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, parodies film companies' seemingly compulsive purchase of comic book film rights with \\"Bluntman and Chronic\\".

This change in value does not imply that the value has reached a stable condition. The contamination delay only specifies that the output rises (or falls) to 50% of the voltage level for a logic high. The circuit is guaranteed not to show any output change in response to an input change before tcd time units (calculated for the whole circuit) have passed. The determination of the contamination delay of a combined circuit requires identifying the shortest path of contamination delays from input to output and by adding each tcd time along this path. For a sequential circuit such as two D-flip flops connected in series, the contamination delay of the first flip- flop must be factored in to avoid violating the hold-time constraint of the second flip-flop receiving the output from the first flip flop. Here, the contamination delay is the amount of time needed for a change in the flip-flop clock input to result in the initial change at the flip-flop output (Q). If there is insufficient delay from the output of the first flip-flop to the input of the second, the input may change before the hold time has passed. Because the second flip-flop is still unstable, its data would then be \\"contaminated.\\" Every path from an input to an output can be characterized with a particular contamination delay. Well-balanced circuits will have similar speeds for all paths through a combinational stage, so the minimum propagation time is close to the maximum.

It can reach this town Passing Through Rizal Province via Manila East Road or Slex. According to the , it has a population of people. Lumban is one of Laguna's oldest towns, located southeast of Manila. It got its name from Aleurites moluccanus, a tree locally named \\"lumbang\\". The province's capital town, Santa Cruz, as well as Cavinti and Pagsanjan, were once part of Lumban. The town is the location of the river, wherein the Laguna Copperplate Inscription was found. The copperplate is the oldest known document found in the Philippines, dating to 900AD. Indian cultural influence (by way of Srivijaya) present in the Philippines prior to European colonization in the 16th century. Lumban is the home of Lake Caliraya, a man-made lake often visited by nature lovers and sports people. It is known as the \\"Embroidery Capital of the Philippines\\". Fine Jusi and Piña cloth are embroidered by hand, and the finished product is worn by males as Barong Tagalog and by females as Saya (Filipiñana). These are export-quality items. Lumban is also known for its many designs of shoes, sandals, slippers, and step-ins - all made from local materials. They are usually sold in shopping malls in Metro Manila, albeit at slightly higher prices than what can be found in Laguna. ==Geography== ===Barangays=== Lumban is politically subdivided into 16 barangays. * Bagong Silang 501-7896 * Balimbingan (Poblacion) 501-7525 * Balubad 501-8456 * Caliraya 501-7894 * Concepcion 501-2456 * Lewin 501- 7896 * Maracta (Poblacion) 501-8474 * Maytalang I 501-4176 * Maytalang II 501-2546 * Primera Parang (Poblacion) 501-8632 * Primera Pulo (Poblacion) 501-2586 * Salac (Poblacion) 501-4442 * Segunda Parang (Poblacion) 501-9635 * Segunda Pulo (Poblacion) 501-7844 * Santo Niño (Pob) 501-1475 * Wawa 501-9966 ===Lake Caliraya=== Lumban is the home of Lake Caliraya, a man-made lake. Created in 1939, the lake has developed as a spot for water sports and outdoor recreation including fishing. Surrounding the lake are a number of resorts catering to tourists and vacation homes abound because of the local scenery and climate. ===Caliraya Dam=== Caliraya Dam is an embankment dam located in the town of Lumban province of Laguna, in the Sierra Madre Mountain Range of the Philippines. The reservoir created by the dam, Lake Caliraya, initially supplied one of the oldest hydroelectric plants in the Philippines, and later became a recreational area for water sports and fishing. The dam construction was started in 1939 and a small hydroelectric plant was operated in 1942. Lake Caliraya was later connected with another man-made lake, Lumot Lake, to provide more water through a 2.3 km (1.4 mi) underground penstock. Later still the dam and lake were used as the upper reservoir for the Kalayaan Pumped-Storage Hydroelectric plant located west of Lake Caliraya, with Laguna de Bay as the lower reservoir. ===Climate=== ==Demographics== In the , the population of Lumban, Laguna, was people, with a density of . ==Town Fiesta/Lupi== The town fiesta is held every 20'th of January in honor of San Sebastian, the town's patron saint. Lupi is held every last Sunday of January. ===Feast of San Sebastian=== The San Sebastian Festival is a procession held at the Lumban River, where the icon of the patron saint San Sebastian together with hundreds of devotees is afloat on “Kaskitos”, or a fleet of large boats. The San Sebastian Festival began after the people had adopted Saint Sebastian the Martyr as their patron saint during the 18th century when the Franciscans did their mission assignment in the town. On this annual celebration, observed every 4th Sunday of January at Lumban, which is the Embroidery Capital of the Philippines, boasts of two noteworthy events that take place side by side the town fiesta. The Moro-Moro or the “Komedya” is staged on the evening prior to the Festival. Local talents are tapped to perform the demanding roles that the comedia necessitates. Wearing colorful costumes, local actors and actresses showcase their acting prowess before spectators. The “Paligong Poon” takes place at the Lumban River, where the Icon of the Patron Saint, San Sebastian, together with hundreds of devotees are float on “Kaskitos” (a fleet of large boats), holding lit candles and performing rituals across the river, known as “Lupi”. Participating are civic and religious organizations and groups of bands in the locality. The icon is then paraded around the town while locals take turns in dousing the saint and devotees. Witnessed by spectators from the municipality and neighboring towns. On this feast, each barangays of Lumban has its own icon of the patron saint which was included on their respective float. It is also included in here the 9-days novena of the Hermanas of the town. On this feast, the people of the town make themselves totally wet in accordance to the ritual ceremony of the patron saint of Lumban. ===Burdang Lumban Festival=== Normally tranquil, Lumban bursts with sounds and colors every third week of September for its Burdang Lumban Festival. Aside from the fiesta in January, which has been celebrated for centuries, the town has added a festival. It has been a recent fashion in the Philippines to create festivals to attract tourism, provide citizens cause for merriment and honor and promote a unique product, industry or heritage. For Lumban, the festival promotes its centuries-old craft and industry of hand embroidery, burda in Tagalog. Fashion designers, prominent personalities and people in the know go all the way to Lumban for its barong Tagalog, wedding gowns and embroidery, which flourished only in this town in Laguna. Lumban wants to strengthen and further its reputation for hand embroidery, and establish itself as the Embroidery Capital of the Philippines. Embroidery remains to be the queen attraction of Lumban. And this was shown in the festival, whose highlight is the street dancing competition, in which school children dance in bright and colorful costumes inspired by the barong Tagalog and embellished with known embroidery designs. They started at the multi-purpose covered hall in front of the municipal building, marched in front of the church, through the narrow streets, and ended at the entrance of the barangay of Wawa with a showdown. Larger-than- life tambors and bastidors served as props. It was an amusing watch. Their zest and choreography led them to win a prize at the Anilag Festival, Laguna’s “festival of festivals.\\" ==Images== File:PagsanjanLumbanjf4468 11.JPG File:Lumban,Laguna,Church,TownHalljf4615 01.JPGPoblacion File:Lagunajf4360 18.JPGLumban Town Hall ==References== ==External links== * Lumban Profile at PhilAtlas.com * Lumban Web Site * [ Philippine Standard Geographic Code] * Philippine Census Information * Local Governance Performance Management System Category:Municipalities of Laguna (province) Category:Populated places on Laguna de Bay ","title":"Lumban"},{"id":"1275503","text":"City Bank of Montreal, Toronto office The City Bank of Montreal (known in French as \\"La Banque de la Cite\\") was an early bank founded in Montreal in 1833,Grawey p. 13 when it was part of Lower Canada.

The flag is a British red ensign, with the Union Flag in the canton, adorned with the shield of the coat of arms of Canada. The Canadian Red Ensign emerged as an informal flag to represent Canada as early as the 1870s and was used \\"on all public buildings throughout the provinces,\\"Despatch No. 311, 12 December 1891, GG's Office, file 290A, Vol. 1, 1865-1937. prior to becoming the country's civil ensign in 1892. The flag was adorned with the arms of the Canadian provinces until 1921, when the Arms of Canada replaced the amalgamation of provincial arms on the ensign. In 1945, an order in council named the Canadian Red Ensign a \\"distinctive Canadian flag\\" to fly on government buildings. However, the ensign was never formally adopted as a national flag of Canada, with the Union Flag used as the national flag of Canada until the Maple Leaf flag was adopted in 1965. The Maple Leaf flag also replaced the Canadian Red Ensign as the civil ensign of the country after it was adopted. ==Description== The ensign is the Red Ensign of the United Kingdom, embellished with the Arms of Canada as a shield in the bottom right quarter. The shield is divided into four quarters, consisting of the coats of arms of England, Scotland, Ireland and the Kingdom of France, the four founding nations of Canada. The first three quarters are the same as the Arms of the United Kingdom. At the base is a sprig of three maple leaves representing Canada. The leaves are described as proper, that is, the correct colour; it uses red and gold, the colour of the leaves in autumn, whereas earlier versions used green. ==History== Canadian Red Ensign used from 1868 to 1921. The emblem in the field during this period, dependent on the number of provinces at the time, and the whims of flag manufacturers The Red Ensign bearing some sort of a Canadian emblem was used by Canadians both on land and at sea beginning as early as 1868 (soon after Confederation) on an informal or extra-legal basis. As Prime Minister, Sir John A. Macdonald \\"constantly made use of it\\", promoting it throughout Canada \\"by precept and example.\\"George Stanley, The Flags of Canada An 1891 memo from the Governor General, Lord Stanley, stated: \\"the Dominion Government has encouraged by precept and example the use on all public buildings throughout the provinces of the Red Ensign with the Canadian badge on the 'Fly.'\\" In 1892, it was authorized by Admiralty Warrant for use on ships registered in Canada and this was enshrined in the Canada Shipping Act of 1934, yet the flag had no legal status on land (the Royal Union Flag remained the formal national flag of Canada until 1965). Despite its lack of any official status on land, the Red Ensign with Canadian arms was widely used on land, and flew over the Parliament Buildings until 1904 when it was replaced by the Union Flag. Various versions of the Red Ensign continued to be flown on land and the flag featured prominently in patriotic displays and recruiting efforts during the First World War. It can be seen in numerous photographs of Canadian troops, on the prime minister's car, and in victory parades. Canadian Red Ensign used from 1921 to 1957 The original Canadian Red Ensign had the arms of the four founding provinces on its shield. However, in the late 19th and early 20th century, flag manufacturers would often supplement this design with wreaths of laurel and oak leaves and crowns. The design was frequently placed on a white background square, circle or roughly following the outline of the arms in the flag's fly (right hand side assuming the flagpole to be on the left). There was no standard design for the Red Ensign until the early 1920s. In 1921, the Government of Canada asked King George V to order a new coat of arms for Canada. The College of Arms thus designed a suitable coat of arms of Canada. The new shield was displayed on the Red Ensign, thus producing a new version of the Canadian Red Ensign in 1922. In 1924, the Red Ensign was approved for use on Canadian government buildings outside Canada. The Canadian Red Ensign, through history, tradition and custom was finally formalized on 5 September 1945, when the Governor General of Canada signed an Order-in-Council (P.C. 5888) which stated that \\"The Red Ensign with the Shield of the Coat of arms in the fly (to be referred to as \\"The Canadian Red Ensign\\") may be flown from buildings owned or occupied by the Canadian federal Government within or without Canada shall be appropriate to fly as a distinctive Canadian flag.\\" The flag was thus approved for use by government buildings inside Canada as well, and once again flew over Parliament. The Red Ensign served as the country's civil ensign from 1892 to 1965 when it was replaced by today's Maple Leaf flag. The flag bore various forms of the shield from the Canadian coat of arms in its fly during the period of its use. From 1921 until 1957, the Canadian Red Ensign was virtually the same, except that the leaves in the coat of arms were green, and there was a slight alteration to the Irish harp (the earlier version having a woman's bust as part of the harp). A blue ensign, also bearing the shield of the Canadian coat of arms, was the jack flown by the Royal Canadian Navy and the ensign of other ships owned by the Canadian government until 1965. From 1865 until Canadian Confederation in 1867, the United Province of Canada could also have used a blue ensign, but there is little evidence such a flag was ever used. In Otto Reinhold Jacobi's painting of the new Parliament Buildings in 1866, a Red Ensign flies from the tower of the East Block. In 2007, the Canadian Red Ensign was formally recognized as a \\"national symbol of Canada,\\" by the Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada. ===Vimy Ridge Red Ensign=== From left to right: the Flag of France, the Maple Leaf Canadian flag, and the Canadian Red Ensign fly at the Canadian National Vimy Memorial in France The Red Ensign carried by the 5th Canadian Infantry Battalion (Western Cavalry) at the Battle of Vimy Ridge in 1917 survives to this day, and is possibly the oldest Canadian flag in existence. The battle was the first time all four divisions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force fought together during the First World War, and is viewed as a pivotal event in the history of Canadian national identity. The Red Ensign flown at Vimy Ridge in 1917 had the arms of Canada's first four provinces. In the Royal Warrant of 1868 assigning arms to the first four provinces of Canada, Queen Victoria authorized them to be quartered for use on the Great Seal of Canada and thus de facto they became the arms for Canada until 1921. After the battle, the flag was donated to the Imperial War Museum in the United Kingdom by Lieutenant Colonel Lorn Paulet Owen Tudor of the 5th Battalion, an Englishman who had emigrated to Canada before the war. The Imperial War Museum refused requests over the years to repatriate the Vimy Ridge Red Ensign to Canada, including a request in 2000 to acquire the flag for the ceremonies surrounding the dedication of Canada's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. David Penn, Keeper of Exhibits and Firearms at the Imperial War Museum, called the flag \\"our most important First World War Commonwealth artifact\\". Eventually, after months of negotiations involving the Royal Canadian Legion, the Imperial War Museum agreed to lend the flag to Canada to commemorate the opening of the new Canadian War Museum in Ottawa in 2005. The flag was returned to the United Kingdom in 2008. There is another Red Ensign in existence that was reportedly carried by Canadian troops at the Battle of Vimy Ridge, currently held by the Penticton Museum and Archives in Penticton, British Columbia. It is a simple red ensign, without a coat of arms. ==Usage today== The 1921-spec ensign being flown in Northern Ontario, August 2008 Though much less common than either the Maple Leaf or modern provincial flags, the several versions of the Canadian Red Ensign continue to be flown today both in official and unofficial capacities. In view of its association with the Canadian Army during the world wars, it is flown alongside the Maple Leaf flag at numerous war memorials, including the Canadian National Vimy Memorial in France. It is also used by veterans' groups, and is part of the official colour party (together with the Maple Leaf) of the Royal Canadian Legion. The flag is sometimes flown on vintage ships, and at heritage sites where it is historically accurate. In the 2010s, some far right or white supremacist groups have co-opted the red ensign, displaying it either alongside or instead of the Maple Leaf, erroneously as a symbol of a monoculturally white Canada. These include the Aryan Guard, the founder of the Canadian Nazi Party, white nationalist leader Paul Fromm, and the five members of the Proud Boys who disrupted an indigenous protest on Canada Day in July 2017. The flag's appropriation by white supremacists has produced an outcry from several groups, including the Royal Canadian Legion, the Canadian Centre for the Great War, and the editor of the history journal The Dorchester Review, who have expressed the view that \\"trivializing, or treating as a kind of talisman of defiance, a flag that has a much more venerable and mainstream role\\" is not right and \\"flies in the face of what the Red Ensign means\\". ==Variations== Before the design of the Red Ensign was standardized in 1921, flag makers made the badge larger each time a new province joined Confederation. This led to the creation of several unofficial but widely used flags. At the opening ceremony of the 1936 Olympic Games, a variant of the 1921–1957 red ensign with the arms inside a white disc was carried by Canadian Olympian and flag bearer James Worrall. However the normal version of the red ensign without the disc was hoisted alongside the other national flags that surrounded the perimeter of the stadium. Some of the variations are shown below.

File:Canadian Red Ensign 1870.svg1870: An early version of Manitoba's coat of arms was added to represent the new province. File:Flag of Canada (1870).svg1870: Until 1922, there were variations in displaying the shield on the flag: sometimes a white disk was added behind the shield, sometimes there would be a wreath of maple leaves or a wreath of roses, thistles, and shamrocks, and occasionally the shield was topped by a beaver or crown. File:Canadian Red Ensign 1871.svg1871: Symbols were added to represent British Columbia. This version was rarely used and was overshadowed heavily by the 1868, 70, and 73 versions, all three of which remained in use until the early 1900s, while the 1873 version was never particularly common. File:Canadian Red Ensign 1873.svg1873: The flag was modified to represent the new provinces of British Columbia and Prince Edward Island. The badge was always placed on a white disk in this edition.

The Liberal government of Lester Pearson promised to introduce a new flag to replace the Red Ensign, as a means of promoting national unity and a new Canadian identity, by replacing what was seen as a symbol of the British Empire and colonialism, with one that would be more inclusive of Canadians who are not of British descent, particularly French- Canadians. In 1965, after the Great Flag Debate in Parliament and throughout the country as a whole, the Maple Leaf flag was adopted. Groups such as the Royal Canadian Legion and others who had sympathies with maintaining Canada's links to the UK opposed the new flag as they saw it as a means of loosening that connection. The leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, John Diefenbaker, was especially passionate in his defence of the Red Ensign. In protest of the federal government's decision, Progressive Conservative governments in Ontario and Manitoba adopted red ensigns as their provincial flags in 1965 and 1966 respectively. ==Canadian Blue Ensign== Canadian Naval Jack used from 1957 to 1965 The Canadian Blue Ensign is similar to the Red Ensign. The flag was used as the jack of the Royal Canadian Navy from its inception until the adoption of the Maple Leaf flag in 1965. The Blue Ensign was approved by the British Admiralty in 1868 for use by ships owned by the Canadian government. Carr's Flags of the World says \\"The Blue Ensign is charged with the shield in the fly\\", and that the Blue Ensign \\"is worn 'as a Jack' for distinguishing purposes when at anchor, or under way and dressed with masthead flags\\".Carr, H. Gresham Flags of the World 1961 In 1937, the Canadian Government established that the Canadian Blue Ensign (\\"the Blue Ensign of the Dominion of Canada\\") would be used as a special ensign by the several Canadian yacht clubs which had prior to then used the British Blue Ensign (either plain or defaced) as their special ensign. This usage lasted until the 1965 introduction of the Maple Leaf flag. Today, some Canadian yacht clubs use the Canadian Blue Ensign to commemorate this usage. ==In art and culture== Otto Reinhold Jacobi included a red ensign flying from the East Block in his 1866 painting of the Parliament Buildings. During the early 1990s an urban myth developed claiming that the US flag was printed on the 1986 series of Canadian banknotes. The myth stated that the US flag could be seen flown on the Parliament buildings depicted behind Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier on the $5 banknote, Sir John A. Macdonald on the $10 note and William Lyon Mackenzie King on the $50 note. This flag was in fact the Canadian Red Ensign, which was contemporaneous with the three prime ministers, but in such a small size that it could be confused with the US flag. ==See also== *British ensigns *Canadian Forces Naval Jack *National symbols of Canada *Royal Canadian Air Force Ensign ==References== ==External links== *Red and Blue Ensigns, Canada History including chronology *The Flags of Canada by Alister B.

It is Virginia's only state facility solely dedicated to the evaluation and treatment of persons over the age of 65 . The 123-bed geriatric hospital is located in Burkeville on the site of the former Piedmont Sanatorium. Founded in 1967, the facility employs 320 staff members and is a training site for major universities, colleges, and vocational schools in geropsychiatry and other clinical specialties. ==History== The 300 acre site of PGH was originally Piedmont Sanatorium, a rest home for African Americans with tuberculosis. The Sanatorium was closed in 1965 and converted into a geriatric hospital in 1967. In 1985, PGH was accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. In 1999, word leaked out that PGH was slated to be closed under the 1999-2000 budget of Governor George Allen. The Legislature voted to keep PGH open with funding allocated through 2000. On November 25, 2000, the Richmond Times-Dispatch cited an administration leak that PGH would be closed by 2006. State Senator Frank Ruff speculated that the information was leaked on purpose in order to gauge the public's reaction . Local officials and the Piedmont Geriatric Association organized to oppose the closure, and the Legislature funded PGH for 2000. In 2002, Governor Mark R. Warner proposed budget amendments to shut down PGH and Delegate Robert McDonnell introduced House Bill 995 to close Piedmont by 2007 . Nottoway Supervisor Jack Green called it the facility's most serious closure threat to date. He noted the state's desire to save money and the attractiveness of the hospital's 300 acre estate for other building projects. The bill passed after it was amended to eliminate the provision to \\"close Piedmont Geriatric Hospital, opened in 1967 and located in Burkeville, no earlier than July 1, 2007\\". In 2004, the state Department of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse proposed building a facility to house 150 of Virginia's most dangerous sex offenders on PGH grounds. The facility would be self-contained and not occupy the same buildings as PGH. Reasons for selecting the Burkeville site included its proximity to Nottoway Correctional Center, which could provide backup security help, and the nearby temporary sex offenders unit in Dinwiddie, whose workers could easily transition to the new facility. The offenders in question fall under the control of the DMHMRS, rather than the prison system, because they have completed their prison sentences but still meet the criteria for civil commitment as sexually violent predators . ==Residents== PGH treats elderly persons (65+ years of age) who: *Are in need of inpatient treatment for mental illness, *Meet the requirements for voluntary or involuntary admission as determined by their mental health center, and *Do not have a medical condition that requires priority treatment in an acute care hospital. According to PGH's facility profile, \\"80-90% of PGH's admissions come from a complex combination of psychiatric and physical impairments whose needs are not met in traditional medical or psychiatric settings\\". Many hospital residents are transferred there because of complex behavior that nursing homes are not equipped to manage . Under Virginia law, patients must be transferred out of nursing homes if they : * Present an imminent physical threat or danger to self or others, * Require continuous licensed nursing care (seven-days-a-week, 24-hours-a-day), or * Have other medical and functional care needs of residents that cannot properly be met in an assisted living facility. ==Services== ===Music therapy=== Music therapy part of the Psychosocial-Rehabilitation Department. Music therapy is the prescribed use of music and musical interventions in order to restore, maintain, and improve emotional, physical, physiological, and spiritual health and well-being. Music therapy works towards specific therapeutic goals and objectives. Goal areas include communicative, academic, motor, emotional, and social skills. It is important to be aware that while clients may develop their musical skills during treatment, these skills are not the primary concern of the therapist. Rather it is the effect such musical development might have on the client's physical, psychological and socio-economical functioning. The credential Music Therapist - Board Certified (MT-BC) is granted by the Certification Board for Music Therapists (CBMT) to identify music therapists who have demonstrated the knowledge, skills and abilities necessary to practice music therapy at the current level of the profession. The purpose of board certification in music therapy is to provide an objective national standard that can be used as a measure of professionalism by interested agencies, groups, and individuals. ===Psychology=== The PGH Psychology Department provides evaluations and nonpharmacological interventions for all PGH patients. Evaluations provided include neurocognitive, emotional, personality, decision-making capacity, and forensic evaluations. Interventions include, among others, individual psychotherapy, group therapy, psychoeducational sessions, and behavior planning. PGH Psychologists are also active in hospital administration, program evaluation, performance improvement, and risk management activities. Hospital research efforts are also overseen by the Psychology Department. The Psychology Department utilizes the most current techniques available in current research literature. Department staff serve as leaders within and outside of the hospital regarding current knowledge in mental health and behavioral research, and have developed many innovative protocols and methods to optimally serve their clientele. Psychology is also involved in clinical teaching, serving as a practicum site for local doctoral and masters level programs and offering frequent seminars for community eldercare providers through Piedmont Geriatric Institute. PGH Psychology consists of four licensed clinical psychologists, one resident in clinical psychology, and an administrative assistant. ==Organization== ===Units=== PGH's 123 residents are divided into four units of approximately 30 residents each. The staff for each unit consists of Registered Nurses, Licensed Practical Nurses, and Direct Service Associates. ===Shifts=== The staff are organized into day, evening, and night shifts. During the day shift, members of the physical, recreational, occupational, Psychology, and Music Therapy staff, as well as social workers and the Chaplain visit each unit. During the evening and night shifts, unit nursing coordinators and the house-nursing supervisor make rounds. ===Inspectors=== The facility is inspected routinely by the Office of the Inspector General. Unannounced reviews conducted between 1999 and 2004 consistently reported clean, comfortable, and well-maintained surroundings. ==Notes== ==References== *PGH Facility Profile *OIG Report #75-03, Anita S.

He was also a painter and poet.\\"Lama Anagarika Govinda Papers,\\" in \\"Collection on Lama Govinda.\\" New York, New York: C.V. Starr East Asian Library, Columbia University Libraries, retrieved online June 24, 2018. == Life in Europe == Ernst Lothar Hoffmann was born in Waldheim, Germany, the son of a German father and a Bolivian mother. His father was quite well to do and owned a cigar factory. His mother died when he was three years old. While enrolled in the German army during World War I, he caught tuberculosis in Italy and was discharged. He recovered at a sanatorium and then studied philosophy, psychology and archaeology at Freiburg University. He did not finish his studies, but went to live in a German art colony on Capri in Italy, as a painter and poet. He studied at the Universities of Naples and Cagliari and made archeological research journeys in North Africa. He lived on Capri from 1920 until 1928.Hecker, 1990, p.84. During his time in Italy Hoffman became familiar with the work of German life-philosopher Ludwig Klages whose biocentric metaphysics greatly fascinated him and influenced his approach to and understanding of Buddhism.Volker Zotz, Ludwig Klages as reflected by Lama Anagarika Govinda, in: Gunnar Alksnis, Chthonic Gnosis - Ludwig Klages and his Quest for the Pandaemonic All, Theion Publishing, 2015. Already at the age of 16 he started to study philosophy and by way of Schopenhauer he encountered Buddhism. After having made a comparative study of the major religions, he became a convinced Buddhist at the age of 18. He joined the Bund für buddhistisches Leben (Association for Buddhist Living). On Capri he practiced meditation with an American Buddhist friend.Hecker, 1990, p.84. ==Sri Lanka== In December 1928, Hoffman moved from Capri to Sri Lanka and stayed as a celibate Buddhist layman (brahmacāri), and later as a celibate, homeless layman (anagarika), for nine weeks at the Island Hermitage with Nyanatiloka Thera, a teacher and scholar in the Theravada tradition. He was instrumental in founding the International Buddhist Union (IBU) in 1929, of which he made Nyanatiloka the president. The aim of the IBU was to unite all Buddhists worldwide and to promote Buddhism through the virtuous and exemplary conduct of practising Buddhists. As secretary of the IBU, he travelled to Burma and Europe to raise support. Although he came to Sri Lanka with the aim of becoming a Buddhist monk, he was discouraged to do so by Anagarika Dharmapala on the grounds that it would be difficult to travel as a Buddhist monk. In 1930 he founded the Variyagoda Hermitage in a tea-estate in the mountains near Gampola, but he only lived there for one year with his German stepmother Anne Habermann who had come with him from Europe. At Variyagoda Govinda studied Abhidhamma and Pali.Hecker, 1990, pp.84-85. Bhikkhu Nyanatusita and Hellmuth Hecker, 2008, pp. 105-107. ==Life and travels in India and Tibet before WWII== In April 1931 Govinda went to All-India Buddhist Conference in Darjeeling as the representative of the IBU, to propagate the \\"pure Buddhist teaching as preserved in Ceylon, in a country where it had degenerated into a system of demon worship and fantastic forms of belief.\\" However, in nearby Sikkim he met the Tibetan Gelugpa meditation teacher Tomo Geshe Rimpoche alias Lama Ngawang Kalzang (1866–1936),Hecker, 1990, p.85, Birgit Zotz, 'Tibetische Mystik, - nach Lama Anagarika Govinda Lama Anagarika Govinda' (retrieved 6.8.2011) who greatly impressed him and completely changed his views about Tibetan Buddhism. From then on he embraced Tibetan Buddhism, although he never abandoned his Theravada roots and stayed in contact with Nyanatiloka and later with Nyanaponika. Lama Ngawang Kalzang taught meditation to Govinda, who remained in contact with him until his death. During their 1947–1948 expeditions to Tibet, Govinda and Li Gotami met Ajo Repa Rinpoche, who, according to Govinda, initiated them into the Kagyüpa school of Tibetan Buddhism.Govinda, 1966, p.156. Donald S. Lopez, p.60. Birgit Zotz, 'Tibetische Mystik, - nach Lama Anagarika Govinda Lama Anagarika Govinda' (retrieved 6.8.2011) The scholar Donald Lopez questions whether the 'initiations' that Govinda received are to be understood in the traditional Tibetan way of the term, i.e., as an empowerment by a Lama to carry out Tantric rituals or meditations. When he first met Lama Ngawang Kalzang, Govinda spoke no Tibetan and his description of the initiation is vague. According to Lopez, no initiation into the Kagyu order or any other Tibetan order exists, and it is unclear what was the nature of the initiation ceremony and the teachings that Govinda and his wife received from Ajo Repa Rinpoche. Govinda himself wrote in Foundations of Tibetan Mysticism that he understood 'initiates' to mean 'individuals who, in virtue of their own sensitiveness, respond to the subtle vibrations of symbols which are presented to them either by tradition or intuition.'Donald S. Lopez, p.60. Govinda 1969, p.25. And in The Way of White Clouds, he wrote: \\"A real Guru's initiation is beyond the divisions of sects and creeds: it is the awakening to our own inner reality which, once glimpsed, determines our further course of development and our actions in life without the enforcement of outer rules.\\"Govinda, 1966, p.157. Govinda stayed on in India, teaching German and French at Rabindranath Tagore's Visva-Bharati University in Santinekan. He lost interest in the IBU, which caused it to collapse. In 1932 Govinda briefly visited Tibet from Sikkim (visiting Mount Kailash), and in 1933 from Ladakh. The summer months of 1932 and 1934 he and his stepmother, who had followed him to India, stayed at his hermitage at Variyagoda, where a German Buddhist nun, Uppalavaṇṇā (Else Buchholz), and a German monk, Vappo, were then also living. Uppalavaṇṇā acquired the property from Govinda in 1945 and stayed there until the 1970s.Hecker, 1990, p.86. Donald S. Lopez, p.61. Bhikkhu Nyanatusita and Hellmuth Hecker, 2008, pp. 107, 129. In a letter dated 1.9.1934 Govinda wrote that he had come to Sri Lanka accompanied by Rabindranath Tagore and had given a series of lectures on Tibetan Buddhism in various places in Sri Lanka, trying to raise support for the planned Buddhist university at Sarnath. The reception in Sri Lanka was poor and Govinda, who had run out of funds, was quite disappointed.Hecker, 1995, pp.170–171 On orders of Tomo Geshe Rimpoche Govinda founded his order, The Buddhist Order Arya Maitreya Mandala, on 14.10.1933. Fourteen people were then ordained. Govinda received the name Anangavajra Khamsung Wangchuk. In 1934, in Calcutta, he had the first exhibition of his paintings. From 1935 to 1945 he was the general secretary of the International Buddhist University Association (IBUA), for which he held lectures on Buddhist philosophy, history, archeology, etc., at the Buddhist academy at Sarnath. In 1936 he got a teaching position at the University of Patna, from where he gave guest lectures at the universities of Allahabad, Lucknow and Benares. His lectures on Buddhist psychology at the University of Patna were published in 1939 as The Psychological Attitude of Early Buddhist Philosophy, and his lectures at Shantinekan as Psycho-Cosmic Symbolism of the Buddhist Stupa in 1940. In 1938, after two failed attempts and on recommendation of the prime minister of Uttar Pradesh, he managed to become a full British citizen. In 1947 he became a citizen of India. From 1937 to 1940 he lived with his stepmother in a house in Darjeeling.Hecker, 1990, p.86-87. ==World War II== Although Govinda was now a British citizen, he was nevertheless interned by the British during WWII due to his associations with \\"persons of anti-British sympathies,\\" i.e. the Nehru family. First he was interned at Ahmednagar. Because he made no secret of being against Fascism, the Nazis in the prison camp bullied him, just as they did with other anti- fascists. This bullying compelled the British to open a special camp for anti- fascists at Dehra Dun, where he was transferred to in 1942. Nyanatiloka and other German Buddhist monks from Sri Lanka were also interned at Dehra Dun. In the camp Govinda stayed with the German monk Nyanaponika, with whom he studied languages, and formed a close friendship that lasted till the end of his life.Hellmuth Hecker, 1990, p.87. Bhikkhu Nyanatusita and Hellmuth Hecker, 2008, pp. 130. ==Life in Kasar Devi after WWII and travels to Tibet== Lama Govinda and Li Gotami after their wedding in 1947. In 1947 he married the Parsi artist Li Gotami (original name Ratti Petit, 22.4.1906 - 18.8.1988) from Bombay, who, as a painter, had been his student at Santinekan in 1934. Govinda and Li Gotami wore Tibetan styles robes and were initiates in the Drugpa Kagyu lineage.Hecker, 1990, p.87 The couple lived in a house rented from the writer Walter Evans-Wentz at Kasar Devi, near Almora in northern India.Donald S. Lopez, p.61. Kasar Devi, in hippie circles known as 'Crank's Ridge', was a bohemian colony home to artists, writers and spiritual seekers such as Earl Brewster, Alfred Sorensen and John Blofeld. Many spiritual seekers, including the Beat Poets Allen Ginsberg and Gary Snyder, the LSD Gurus Timothy Leary and Ralph Metzner, the psychiatrist R. D. Laing, and Tibetologist Robert Thurman came to visit Govinda at his ashram. The number of visitors became so great that the couple eventually put signs to keep unwanted visitors away.Donald S. Lopez, p.61. From Kasar Devi, Govinda and Li Gotami undertook journeys to Tibet in the late 1940s, making a large number of paintings, drawings and photographs. These travels are described in Govinda's book The Way of the White Clouds.Collection on Lama Govinda, C.V. Starr East Asian Library, Columbia University Libraries. While on the expedition to Tsaparang and Tholing in Western Tibet in 1948–49, sponsored by the Illustrated Weekly of India, Govinda received initiations in the Nyingma and Sakyapa lineages.Hecker, 1990, p.87 Pictures of the Tsaparang frescoes taken by Li Gotami, then, before the Cultural Revolution, still intact appear in Govinda's The Way of the White Clouds Foundations of Tibetan Mysticism and Tibet in Pictures (co-authored with Li Gotami).Donald S. Lopez, p.61. In The Way of the White Clouds Govinda writes that he was a reincarnation of the poet Novalis.Hecker, 1990, p.88 ==1960s and 1970s world tours== Li Gotami, Anagariki Govinda, Nyanaponika Thera, late 1960s or early 1970s The German Hans-Ulrich Rieker, who was ordained in the Arya Maitreya Mandala Order in 1952, was ordered by Govinda to set up a Western wing of the Order. The founding took place simultaneously in Berlin by Rieker, and in Sanchi by Govinda, on 30.11.1952. In 1960 Govinda went to Europe as a representative of Tibetan Buddhism at an international religious conference in Venice. Subsequently, he went to England, Germany, Switzerland, Austria and the Netherlands. In 1965 he went on a lecturing tour through Germany, France, and Switzerland. In 1968-69 through the US and Japan. In 1972–73, and 1974-76 he went on world tours. In 1977 he last visited Germany. On his journeys to the West Govinda made friends with the Swiss philosopher Jean Gebser, the Zen and Taoist teacher Alan Watts, the pioneer of transcendental psychotherapy Roberto Assagioli and the author Luise Rinser.Birgit Zotz, 'Tibetische Mystik, - nach Lama Anagarika Govinda Lama Anagarika Govinda' (retrieved 6.8.2011) ==Later years== For health reasons Govinda finally settled in the San Francisco Bay area, where he and his wife were taken care of by Alan Watts and Suzuki Roshi's San Francisco Zen Centre.Donald S. Lopez, p.61. In San Francisco he established a branch of his order, called \\"Home of Dhyan\\".\\"Lama Anagarika Govinda\\" , retrieved 6.8.2011. In 1980 he visited India for a last time and gave up his house in Almora. He remained mentally agile despite suffering from several strokes from 1975 onwards. During an evening discussion on 14.1.1985, he suddenly felt a sharp pain in his neck that traveled downwards. He lay down on his right side and died laughing.Hecker, 1990, p.87-88 His ashes were placed in the Nirvana-Stupa, which was erected in 1997 on the premises of Samten Choeling Monastery in Darjeeling.\\"Lama Anagarika Govinda\\" , retrieved 6.8.2011. ==Writings== Govinda wrote several books on a wide variety of Buddhist topics. His most well known books are The Way of the White Clouds and Foundations of Tibetan Mysticism, which were translated in many languages. Some of his works such as Foundations of Tibetan Mysticism were written in German and were subsequently translated to English. His articles were published in many Buddhist journals such as the Maha Bodhi, and the German journal Der KreisDer Kreis published by his Buddhist Order Arya Maitreya Mandala.Hecker, 1990, p.88-115 Govinda considered The Inner Structure of the I Ching, the Book of Transformation as his most important book.Donald S.

It was the last Bond novel to be published in Britain by Jonathan Cape, ending an association dating back to the first Bond novel, Casino Royale in 1953. No Deals, Mr. Bond has the minor distinction of being the first and, thus far, only non-novelisation James Bond novel to incorporate the agent's name into the title. ==Plot summary== No Deals, Mr. Bond begins with a mission in the Baltic Sea dubbed \\"Seahawk\\", which involves James Bond stealthily extracting two women that have completed an assignment in East Germany. After accomplishing his mission, the book continues five years later with Bond being called in by M to learn more background into what those women were doing there before being extracted. Their mission, dubbed Cream Cake, was a honey trap that involved getting close to top Soviet personnel as a means to not only spy for the British Secret Service, but to secure the defection of two high ranking Soviet officers, an act that the Soviets occasionally performed against countries of the West. Involving four women and a man, the operation was considered a complete debacle that ended with the members being found out. After being extracted and given new identities, however, two of the women were discovered to have been gruesomely murdered. Bond is subsequently sent by M, \\"off the record\\", to find the remaining members of Cream Cake before they suffer the same fate. During the adventure, Bond believes that Colonel Maxim Smolin, the primary target during operation Cream Cake, is systematically killing off the former members of the Cream Cake operation and leaving a signature of having their tongues removed. This, however, is not the case, and, in actuality, Smolin is a turncoat now working with the British Secret Service. Instead, the former members, in addition to Smolin and another Soviet turncoat, Captain Dietrich, are being targeted by General Chernov, an agent of a department formerly known as SMERSH. The situation is further complicated after M gets a message to Bond warning him that one of the surviving Cream Cake members is a double and that he wants Chernov brought in alive. ==Characters== * James Bond * M * Ebbie Heritage: Her real name is Emilie Nikolas and she was a member of operation Cream Cake and was one of the two women that were extracted by Bond during Seahawk. Ebbie was tasked with meeting and seducing a Major in the East German Army. * Colonel Maxim Smolin: Born in 1946, Smolin, codenamed \\"Basilisk\\", was the prime target during the operation known as Cream Cake. At the time Smolin was the second in command of the HVA (the East German Intelligence Service). Smolin is also employed by the Soviet GRU. Unknown to the intelligence agencies of the Soviet Union, Smolin is a turncoat secretly working with the British Secret Service. * General Konstantin Nikolaevich Chernov: Codenamed \\"Blackfriar\\", Chernov (also known as Koyla Chernov) is the Chief Investigating Officer of Department Eight, Directorate S of the KGB, a section formerly known as Department V (see Icebreaker), and, before that, SMERSH. Chernov is systematically targeting the former members of Cream Cake as well as Colonel Maxim Smolin and Captain Dietrich who have since defected. Chernov is arrested by Bond in Hong Kong on M's orders. * Heather Dare: Her real name is Irma Wagen and she was a member of operation Cream Cake. Dare was tasked with meeting and seducing Colonel Maxim Smolin. Dare was also one of the two women that was extracted by Bond during Seahawk. She is later discovered to be an agent of the KGB and working for General Chernov. Under orders by M that the Cream Cake double be eliminated, Dare is essentially executed by Bond after being disarmed, an act Bond performs without remorse. * Inspector Norman Murray: an inspector for the Republic of Ireland's Special Branch. He lends aid to Bond (known to Murray as \\"Jacko B\\") while Bond is in the Republic of Ireland. Secretly, however, Murray is on Chernov's payroll and eventually turns on Bond. He is later killed in Hong Kong by Bond. ==Publication history== Gardner states that he was opposed to this novel being given the title No Deals, Mr. Bond, a title he calls \\"dreadful\\" along with other titles suggested by his publishers including Oh No, Mr. Bond! and Bond Fights Back. Gardner originally suggested the title Tomorrow Always Comes.John Gardner The Bond Page * UK first hardback edition: May 1987 Jonathan Cape * U.S. first hardback edition: April 1987 Putnam * UK first paperback edition: 1987 Coronet Books * U.S. first paperback edition: April 1988 Charter Books ==Trivia== * At one point Gardner makes a reference to Kingsley Amis as an author of novels that some officers in the book are interested in.

Simpson opened the bank's first branch in Bowmanville in 1857. In 1861 the impressive Toronto branch was built and by 1868 a limestone and brick head office building had been built in Bowmanville. In 1875, the head office was moved to Toronto. The bank and its 30 branches across the province were absorbed into the Bank of Montreal in the fall of 1906, after its general manager Charles McGill was found to have been speculating in the U.S. stock markets with bank funds and sustained an estimated $1.25 million in losses from ill-timed short sales. McGill was convicted of filing false tax returns and sentenced to a five-year prison term early in 1907. ==References== * Mayers, Adam. The Ontario Bank's 1906 Collapse. The Toronto Star. 2008-02-19.

On the tourist side, the district of Kef El Melh (the mountain of salt) in the municipality of Tadjrouna is near the border with El Bayadh Province the most important tourist area in the state and there is the largest tourist headquarters for the state in the Kordan Palace or crown angle. There are also tourist areas and natural sights such as Al-Ghaisheh, Taouila, Lalmaya, Ein Sefsifah, Al- Huwaita and Madana. The Talemzane crater, with its nozzle resulting from the fall of the meteorite in ancient times, is the fourth age and the second largest in size in the world after which there is Arizona and is found in the municipality of Hassi Delaa to the south. The state is also famous for its production natural gas as it contains important fields in the region of Hassi R'Mel and has huge reserves of this vital material which qualified Algeria to occupy an important position globally in the field of energy. This material is pumped through several tubes to feed Europe. == Geography == === Location and Nature === Located at an altitude of 750 m, the Laghouat Province is part of the Saharan Atlas Mountains chain with some peaks above 2,000 m \\"Djebel Amour: 2,200 m\\" Laghouat is a Province in the south of Algeria and away from Algiers by about 400 km and its orchards and buildings and mosques span the antique through a vast steppe and mountains tall and green pastures, where the largest stream tributary of Wadi Al-Tawil Chelif River originates from its mountains,and M'zi River where a municipality is called by its name. The area is characterized by its pastoral, agricultural and mountainous steppe character, as it contains a region of a purely industrial nature, which is Hassi R'mel. As it is possible to classify the state from this side as an energy mandate in the first place. === Terrain === The Province of Laghouat is located between Tell and desert at the foothills of the Saharan Atlas chain with its two sides Amour Range west of the Province and the mountains of Ouled Nile east of it, and this can be divided The Province is divided into three main regions: ==== Saharan Atlas ==== It is located in the northwest of the state, specifically north of the mountains of Djebel Amour, and is characterized by a height between 1000 and 1700 meters from the surface of sea. We can distinguish them into two sub-regions: the High Highlands area in the north and a mountainous area in the south. The Districts of : Gueltet Sidi Saâd, Aflou District, Brida District, El Ghicha District and Oued Morra District. The most important characteristic of this region is that it is the source of the most important Rivers in Algeria like: Chelif River through its tributary, Wadi el-Taweel and Wadi Djedi through its tributary M'zi River. It is also distinguished by the presence of forests The Green Dam. ==== steppe ==== It is located in the middle, characterized by a height between 700 and 1000 AD. It is known as a grazing area, as it contains many steppe plants and herbs. This region includes most of the state's vegetation except for the green dam forests in the mountainous region. The district of Sidi Makhlouf; Laghouat District, the northern part of the district of Ain Madhi. ==== Desert ==== In the southern part of the state of Laghouat, it includes what is known as the desert plateau, and includes the Hassi R'Mel District, the south of the Ksar El Hirane District and the south of the Ain Madhi District. It is distinguished by its low vegetation cover, as it is confined to the plant Peganum, except for some hills here and there that are distinguished by the diversity of its plants Ziziphus spina-christi, Pistacia atlantica and the various herbs flowers in the spring. ==Administrative division== The province is divided into 10 districts (daïras), which are further divided into 24 communes or municipalities. ===Districts=== Districts of Laghouat Province # Aflou # Aïn Mahdi # Brida # El Ghicha # Gueltet Sidi Saâd # Hassi R'Mel # Ksar El Hirane # Laghouat # Oued Morra # Sidi Makhlouf ===Communes=== # Aflou # Aïn Madhi # Aïn Sidi Ali # Beidha # Brida # El Assafia # El Ghicha # El Houaita # Gueltat Sidi Saad # Hadj Mechri # Hassi Delaa # Hassi R'Mel # Kheneg # Ksar El Hirane # Laghouat # Mekhareg (Benacer Ben Chohra) # Oued Morra # Oued M'Zi # Sebgag # Sidi Bouzid # Sidi Makhlouf # Tadjemout # Tadjrouna # Taouila == Economy == === Transportation === {class = \\" center\\" style = \\"font- size: 90%; text-align: center\\" cellpadding = \\"3\\" width = \\"100%\\" Index The number Length - National Road 3 403 km -  Number of Airports 2 - Railways  - 0 km } Laghouat Airport Transportation is the most important economic sector for any country, so taking care of it and giving it its strategic position was necessary and vital. Laghouat Province contains three national methods: * The Trans-Saharan Road: The national road number one links Algiers to Lagos in the future, and it connects the city of Laghouat with the city of Djelfa in the north and the city of Ghardaia in the south. * National Road No. (23): connects Laghouat to Tiaret towards the West Algerian (Mostaganem). * Road National No. (47): connects Aflou with El Bayadh towards South West (Aïn Séfra). The state also has two airports, one of which is a local airport that is used mainly to transport pilgrims which is Laghouat Airport called by the martyr Moulay Ahmed Madgari. The second one is of an economic nature, and it is an airport Hassi R'mel that is used mainly by the National Fuel Company Sonatrach to transport its tires, experts, and businessmen contracting with it. { align = \\"center\\" class = \\" collapsible\\" style = \\"width: 100%; margin: auto;\\" ! colspan = \\" 14 \\" style = \\"text-align: center; font-size: 110%; background: # 00BA85;\\"  The distance in kilometers between Laghouat and some cities and villages /villes-a- proximit%C3%A9.html%C3%A9.html Les villes à proximité ''' - style = \\"font- size: 100%\\" } { border = \\"1\\" cellpadding = \\"3\\" cellspacing = \\"0\\" width = \\"100%\\" style = \\"border-collapse: collapse; border: 1px solid #aaa;\\" ! style = \\"background: #ccccff;\\" width = \`\` 20%  from - to''' ! style = \\"background: #ccccff;\\" width = \`\` 10%  Distance in km''' -  Laghouat - Masaad  80 -  Laghouat - Aflou  110 -  Laghouat - Hassi R'mel  120 -  Laghouat - Djelfa  100 -  Laghouat - Aïn Oussera  200 -  Laghouat - Ghardaia  200 -  Laghouat - El Bayadh  250 -  Laghouat - Tiaret  290 -  Laghouat - Blida  345 -  Laghouat - Algiers  400 -  Laghouat - Ouargla  400 -  Laghouat - Oran  500 -  Laghouat - Constantine  555 -  Laghouat - Adrar  1042 -  Laghouat - Tamanrasset  1600 -  Laghouat - Cape Town  13000 - } === Energy === Laghouat Province is considered the second most important energy mandate in Algeria after Ouargla Province because it contains one of the most important gas fields in Africa in the region of Hassi R'mel, and it contains many electricity production stations in the region Telegmat near Hassi R'mel and the area of Kheneg which contains the largest solar PV plant Algeria with a capacity of 60 MW. ==== CPV EKP solar power station definition ==== This station is located 5 km from the municipality of Kheneg and 10 km from Laghouat in Algeria.

Hook turns are commonly used by cyclists as a safer alternative to merging with motor vehicles, or having to cross multiple lanes of traffic to reach a turning lane. The legal use of hook turns by motor vehicles is relatively rare, but has been implemented in some jurisdictions (notably Melbourne, Australia) to keep the center of a road free from congestion for use by light rail transit such as trams or other dedicated road services. ==Performing a hook turn== Hook turn sign in Melbourne, Australia.The Australian Road Rules set out the procedure for performing a hook turn in Australia, as well as other jurisdictions with left-hand traffic. In jurisdictions with right-hand traffic the lane of the turning vehicle is reversed. #When the traffic light is green, the turning vehicle approaches and enters the intersection from as near as possible to the left. If there is insufficient room then it must wait for the next cycle of the lights. #The vehicle moves forward, keeping clear of any marked foot crossing, until it is as near as possible to parallel with the left-most lane of the road the vehicle is entering. #The vehicle remains at this position until the traffic lights on the road it is entering change to green. #The vehicle then turns right into the road and continues straight ahead. == History and usage == In many jurisdictions, lightweight vehicles, such as bicycles and mopeds, may make hook turns at any intersection regardless of signage. For instance, under the Australian Road Rules cyclists may legally perform a hook turn at any intersection unless otherwise signed. Hook turns were originally the standard right turn in Australia. Various jurisdictions phased them out at different times. For example Melbourne changed to centre turns in 1954 for all right turns except for certain CBD intersections, in order to maintain a clearway in the center of major roads for the city's extensive tram network. Sydney and Newcastle changed to centre turns in 1939. By requiring vehicles to turn from the far lane, rather than the middle of the road, the hook turn was able to avoid conflicts between vehicles and trams without the need for extra traffic lanes or altered signals. Hook turns have since been implemented in number of other jurisdictions, including Illinois, Beijing, Japan, Taiwan, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, and other States of Australia. There have been limited proposals for hook turns to be implemented as a more widespread replacement for conventional intersection turns. Computer modelling has indicated that hook turns have the potential to significantly reduce delays and congestion in most scenarios, and especially where overall traffic flow is high. In Denmark, a hook turn is mandatory for bicycles. == See also == * Protected intersection == References == == External links == * \\"Performing a Hook Turn\\" (VicRoads Guide) * \\"Hook Turns for Bikes\\" (Pamphlet from Adelaide City Council) Category:Trams in Melbourne Category:Traffic law Category:Road junction types ","title":"Hook turn"},{"id":"1275551","text":"Cheech and Chong's Next Movie is a 1980 American comedy film directed by Tommy Chong and the second feature-length project by Cheech & Chong, following Up in Smoke, released by Universal Pictures. ==Plot== Cheech & Chong are on a mission to siphon gasoline for their next door neighbor's car, which they apparently \\"borrowed,\\" and continue with their day; Cheech goes to work at a movie studio and Chong searches for something to smoke (a roach), followed by him revving up an indoor motorcycle and playing extremely loud rock music with an electric guitar that disturbs the entire neighborhood. Cheech gets fired from his job and they go to see Donna, a welfare officer and Cheech's girlfriend. Cheech successfully seduces Donna, under her objections, and gets her in trouble with her boss. The doped-up duo are expelled from the building and, in an attempt to find alternative means of income start writing songs like, \\"Mexican Americans\\" and \\"Beaners.\\" Cheech answers the phone call from Donna, sets up a date, and goes to tell Chong to get lost so he can clean the house and get ready for Donna. The phone rings again with Cheech thinking it's Donna and turns out to be Red, Cheech's \\"kinda\\" cousin, with money problems and a plea for help. Cheech asks Chong to pick up his cousin and hang out with him as Cheech informs him they have similar interests like \\"go to clubs,\\" \\"get plenty of chicks,\\" and \\"likes to get high.\\" Chong heads off to the hotel where Red is staying and arrives to find him in a dispute with the receptionist over how much the room is costing (\\"$37.50 a week, not a goddamned day!\\"). The receptionist is holding his luggage, consisting of a boom-box, a suitcase, and a 20-pound canvas bag full of high-grade marijuana, hostage and Red can't afford the bill. They break into the room around the back and Red retrieves his luggage and the receptionist is falsely arrested after calling the cops to arrest Chong and Red but accidentally assaults them and is taken away to jail. Later, on the corner, a roller-skater invites them to a \\"party,\\" which is in fact a brothel. They are kicked out of the place for causing too much commotion, sharing weed with the girls, and peeing in the Jacuzzi. They then play a recording from Red's boombox that Red recorded earlier when the police arrived at the hotel he was staying at over the dispute with his luggage, which scares everyone off. One of the girls from the brothel accompanies them and they all go onto Sunset Boulevard in search of adventure and more highness. After visiting the house of a girl's parents, whom they found at a music store on Ventura Boulevard, they all get into the parents' Rolls Royce, light up a spliff, and drive to a stand-up comedy club where they tell jokes and encounter the angry hotel receptionist who was falsely arrested earlier that day and begin a commotion with him and a large female bouncer leading to a rally fight. Later that night, they are chased by the cops as they check out Red's weed fields out in the countryside. They set off fireworks and are suddenly abducted by a UFO along with several of the cannabis plants. Cheech meanwhile gets so pumped and excited about the date that he wears himself out and ends up sleeping through it, while dreaming about what might have happened. He wakes up in the morning to find Chong (who was abducted by Aliens alongside Red) bursting in, dressed in what appears to be a cross between Genghis Khan and a Viking, holding a jar of \\"space coke\\", which Chong says, \\"It'll blow your head off.\\" The \\"space coke\\" causes Cheech to go berserk and starts trashing their next door neighbor's house with a surprised Chong following after. The film ends with the duo bursting through their neighbor's roof into outer space, achieving the ultimate high and Chong dropping the \\"space coke\\" back to Earth for others to try which leads to an animated sequence with Cheech and Chong ascending into a blunt which then takes off displaying the caption \\"That's It Man!\\" ==Cast== * Cheech Marin as Cheech/Dwayne 'Red' Mendoza * Tommy Chong as Chong * Evelyn Guerrero as Donna * Paul Reubens as Desk Clerk/Pee-Wee Herman * Betty Kennedy as Candy * Sy Kramer as Mr. Neatnik * Rikki Marin as Gloria * Edie McClurg as Gloria's mother * Bob McClurg as Chicken Charlie * John Paragon as Director * Jake Steinfeld as Wamba * Cassandra Peterson and Rita Wilson as Hostages * Michael Winslow as Welfare Comedian * John Steadman as Welfare Drunk * Ben Powers as Welfare Black * Carl Weintraub as Hotel Cop * Lupe M.

The edit adds in cut scenes such as an animated intro, their neighbor being revealed to be a transvestite, Cheech cleaning the house for his date, Chong and Red trashing the music store, footage on the spaceship and all drug-related scenes either cut or altered. Most notably is the contents of Red's duffel bag, which in the TV version contains not hundreds of Thai sticks, but diamonds. A novelization, also written by Cheech and Chong, features many photos of these omitted elements. The original theatrical release and early home video editions have Cheech singing \\"Ya-Ya\\" in the scene where he is ironing his clothes for his date. Current releases changed this audio to him humming a different song. Also in the theatrical release, the desk clerk (Reubens), in an attempt to convince the 9-1-1 operator to send help immediately, finally implores: \\"Look, I think they're Iranians!\\" The newer video releases have the line re-dubbed as: \\"Look, I think they're hippies!\\" The film was released on Blu-ray in 2017, containing the theatrical cut, trailer, radio spots and an interview with Cheech Marin.

It is co- owner of the Polish Library in Paris. ==History== The Academy traces its origins to Academy of Learning founded in 1871, itself a result of the transformation of the , in existence since 1815. Though formally limited to the Austrian Partition, the Academy served from the beginning as a learned and cultural society for the entire Polish nation. Its activities extended beyond the boundaries of the Austrian Partition, gathering scholars from all of Poland, and many other countries as well. Some indication of how the Academy's influence extended beyond the boundaries of the Partitions came in 1893, when the collection of the Polish Library in Paris, the largest collection of Polish materials amassed by the Great Emigration, was transferred to the ownership of the Academy, and a branch was founded in Paris, though this latter step had been preceded by the establishment of the Rome Expedition (annual trips to Roman archives). After World War I, the Academy was renamed \\"Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences,\\" (PAU) and become the official representative of Polish learning, which entailed its participation in works of international learned organizations. Among other things, the PAU was a founder member of the Union Académique Internationale (UAI). The period between the world wars was the time of greatest activity at the PAU, especially in the sphere of publications: over 100 publication series were then in print, among them the monumental Polish Biographical Dictionary (Polski Słownik Biograficzny). It was also in that period when the Scientific Station in Rome replaced the Rome Expedition. Initially, the PAU was organized into four sections: * Philological * Historical-Philosophical * Mathematical- Natural Sciences * Medical (from 1930) In 1942 a successor body of the Polish Academy of Learning, the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences, was established in New York City by Bronisław Malinowski, Oskar Halecki and other scholars associated with the Academy, which had been forcibly closed down by the occupying Germans. Following the collapse of communism in Poland, the Polish Academy of Learning was revived and became affiliated with the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences of America (as the latter had meanwhile been renamed). After the German Occupation, the PAU continued its activities in the same fields until 1952, when the authorities decided to take over its agencies and assets on behalf of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw, which was then being established. The PAU was never formally dissolved, however, and after two unsuccessful attempts at its reactivation in the years 1956–57 and 1980–81, it finally was able to resume its activity right after the systemic transformations of 1989. ===Presidents of the PAU=== # (1872–90) # Stanisław Tarnowski (1890–1917) # Kazimierz Morawski (1917–25) # Jan Michał Rozwadowski (1925–29) # Kazimierz Kostanecki (1929–34) # Stanisław Wróblewski (1934–38) # Stanisław Kutrzeba (1939–46) # (1946–57) # (1957–58) # Gerard Labuda (1989–94) # (1994–2001) # (from 2001) ===Secretaries general of the PAU=== # Józef Szujski (1872–83) # Stanisław Tarnowski (1883–90) # Stanisław Smolka (1890–1903) # (1903–19) # Kazimierz Kostanecki (1919–21) # Stanisław Wróblewski (1921–26) # Stanisław Kutrzeba (1926–39) # Tadeusz Jan Kowalski (1939–48) # (1948–57) # Adam Vetulani (1957–58) # (1989–94) # (1994–2015) # (from 2015) ===Honorary members=== Among the honorary members of the PAU were: * John Paul II * Jan Nowak-Jeziorański * Władysław Bartoszewski * Franciszek Macharski ==Structure of the PAU== At present, the Academy is organized into six distinct sections (Classes), consisting of multiple dedicated and interdisciplinary commissions and committees. ===Philology=== This section brings together scholars who represent philologies (Polish, Classical, English, Germanic, Romance, Slavic), including linguistics and literary studies (literary history and theory), as well as art historians. The primary fruits of the section's labors are its publications, presently consisting of three series: Papers in Philology, Library of Translations from Ancient Literature (including eight volumes published before World War II), and Old Polish Source Materials. The first series, Papers in Philology, includes several publications, such as a study by Stanisław Urbańczyk dealing with the history of linguistics in Poland, collection of essays by the Italian Slavicist Riccardo Picchio (translated into Polish) as well as the following works: by on national varieties of German language, by on the life and artistic works of Lisias, by Magdalena Sitarz on Jewish and Polish proverbs and by on the two-way Polish-Jewish influence in the field of language. There are now five more volumes in the classical translation series: two translated and edited by (Statius's Thebaid and Lucan's Bellum Civile), one translated and edited by Romuald Turasiewicz (Lysias's Speeches), one translated and edited by Michał Bednarski (Apollonius Dyscolus's Essay on Syntax) and one translated and edited by Ireneusz Ptaszek (Andocides's Speeches). In the series of source materials from the earliest history of Poland, Kazimierz Rymut and his co-authors have published a collection entitled Polish Letters from the 16th Century, in a critical edition by Marian Plezia. Some publications written by members of Class I have appeared in the publication series of Class II, such as the Latin text of Vincent Kadłubek's Chronicles, in a critical edition by Marian Plezia. ====Commission on Classical Philology==== The nature of the Commission's work is to bring together representatives of various humanistic disciplines who share an interest in the study of Greco-Roman antiquity, broadly conceived, and its reception in the culture of Medieval and modern Europe. It gathers Hellenists and Latinists, specialists in history and literature, as well as linguistics (classical linguistics): Byzantinists, neo-Latinists, ancient historians, historians of ancient culture and philosophy, Patristicists, archaeologists, numismatists, specialists in ancient law (especially Roman), and scholars interested in the reception of antiquity in the culture and literature of Europe, especially Poland. The thematic scope of the Commission's activities covers virtually all areas of knowledge about antiquity. The focus of scholarly attention has been on the study of: * the grammar, syntax, semantics, and stylistics of the classical languages; * the types and genres of Greek literature of the classical period, especially drama, historiography, and rhetoric; * Roman literature of the Augustan Age. The Commission publishes its Works, in which five volumes of assembled works on various topics have already appeared, as well as four monographs. The Commission is also actively engaged in the PAU series entitled Library of Translations from Ancient Literature, in which there have appeared so far editions of Statius's Thebais, Lucan's Bellum Civile, Lysias's Speeches and Apollonius Dyskolos's Essay on Syntax and Andocides's Speeches. The research issues presented at this Commission's meetings involve Polish and European art, from antiquity to the most recent times. Papers read before the Commission must display both a solid methodological base and a profound exploration of the subject matter, based on a thorough review of the secondary literature. Papers are often read by scholars who do not belong to the Commission, from various universities in Poland. (Papers by invited lecturers from abroad are anticipated.) The papers presented at the Commission's meetings have earned considerable respect among young art historians. Discussions have also been organized on the organizational framework of the Polish Committee on Art History. ====Commission on Art History==== The majority of the papers presented are published in the Commission's scholarly yearbook, Folia Historiae Artium, series nova. Seven volumes have been published since 1995, when the new series was commenced. Volume IV was devoted to the 100th anniversary of the birth of Karolina Lanckorońska, a person of inestimable importance for Polish learning, and especially for the PAU, of which she was a member. The publication series Cracovia Artificum continues to be produced by the Commission, with source materials in the history of craftsmanship, including artistic crafts; to date three volumes have appeared, edited by Bolesław Przybyszewski. ====Commission on Modern Philology==== This Commission was formed in the autumn of 1998, but due to the illness of its founder and first chairman, Przemysław Mroczkowski, it could not begin activities until early 2000, under the leadership of Olga Dobijanka-Witczakowa. The Commission's meetings bring together scholars in modern philology, with the goal of achieving integration in terms of research methodology and facilitating the exchange of experiences. The third volume of the Works of the Commission on Modern Philology has now appeared, featuring the best papers from the scholarly meetings held to date. ====Commission on Slavonic Culture PAU==== Attached to the PAU Class I (Philology), the Commission was formed in 2000. It is to some extent an interdisciplinary endeavor, including certain aspects of the field of interest of PAU Class II (History and Philosophy). Accordingly, the members of the Commission represent not only scholars in Slavonic philology, but also archaeologists, historians, and ethnographers. The Commission has published three volumes of its Works. ===History and Philosophy=== This section comprises historians, archaeologists, philosophers, lawyers, theologians, sociologists, and psychologists. The section holds monthly meetings, some of which are organized jointly with Class I. The section is involved in studies and publications on the following topics: * Sources for the history of the Polish Government-in- Exile: minutes of the meetings of the Council of Ministers. Eight volumes are planned; Volumes I-IV have already been published. * History of Poland in the two decades between the world wars. A book by Janusz Pajewski on this subject has already appeared, and two more volumes are anticipated. * The history and organization of Polish learning. This subject is treated in a broad program of publications and expositions. * Continuation of the re-edition of Jan Długosz's History of Poland (personal grant to Marian Plezia, now held by Jerzy Wyrozumski) – completed in 2007. * The publication of the acts of the Apostolic Nunciature in Poland, a project which is recommended by the Academy of Arts and Sciences (four large volumes were produced between 1915 and 1952), was being continued by the Polish Historical Institute in Rome, under the direction of Karolina Lanckorońska (20 volumes appeared). The PAU joined the project and now it is its only manager and executor, but the enterprise is still financed by the Lanckoroński Foundation (three volumes have appeared). * In keeping with tradition, the Class also publishes several series of source materials for Polish history: two volumes of Monumenta Poloniae Vaticana. A new series has been added: Monumenta Sacra Polonorum (two volumes have already appeared). The Class has organized three scholarly symposia: one devoted to the Senate of the Republic of Poland, its historical role and its present status; the second, to the anniversary of the Soviet attack on Poland on 17 September 1939; and the third, to research on the settlement of the first agricultural peoples on both sides of the Western Carpathians in the fifth millennium BC. The Class's most significant publications include a book by Gerard Labuda, Mieszko I król Polski 1025–1034 [Mieszko I, King of Poland, 1025–1034]; a book by Piotr Hübner, Siła przeciw rozumowi. Losy Polskiej Akademii Umiejętności 1939–1989 [Force against Reason: the Fate of the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences, 1939–1989]; Protokoły posiedzeń Władz RP na Uchodźstwie 1939–1945 [Minutes of the Meetings of the Authorities of the Republic of Poland in Exile, 1939–1945], Volumes I-IV; and Chrześcijaństwo Rusi Kijowskiej, Białorusi, Ukrainy i Rosji (X-XVII wiek) [Christianization of Kievan Ruthenia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia (10th–17th century)], edited by Jerzy Kłoczowski; Józef Gierowski The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 18th century. The Class cooperates with the Jagiellonian University in publishing the periodical Kwartalnik Filozoficzny [Philosophical Quarterly]. The section is also actively engaged in realizing the agreement with the Slovak Academy of Sciences, through such joint projects as coordinating archaeological research performed by the Kraków centre on both sides of the western Carpathians; studies on Polish-Slovak relations during World War II; and the preparation of a dictionary of the Oravian local dialect. Contracts are in preparation with the Slovenian Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Ukrainian Studies at the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine in Lviv, and the Czech Academy of Sciences. ====Commission on Central Europe==== This Commission was founded in 1991 on the initiative of , to assemble scholars interested in the archaeology, history, philology, and culture of the nations inhabiting Central and Eastern Europe. In 1993, the Commission on Eastern Europe was split off. Since that time, the Commission on Central Europe has covered the area between the Baltic and the Adriatic, and between the Elbe, Neman, and Bug rivers, as well as the lands on either side of the central Danube. At present, the primary focus on the Commission's research work is on national renascence; the history of state formations (including, among other things, the former Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, as well as Hungary); and the political history of regions inhabited by populations of mixed ethnic, cultural, and religious backgrounds, along with their mutual relations. The Commission's publication record is imposing. The effects of its work are reflected in the series Prace Komisji Środkowoeuropejskiej [Works of the Commission on Central Europe].\\" To date twelve volumes have been published. ====Commission on Eastern Europe==== This Commission was created in 1993, when the PAU Commission on Central Europe, founded two years earlier, was divided. The area of interest of this Commission extends to all the countries of Eastern Europe, though at the present moment, due to the research specializations of its associate members, this means primarily Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine. The Commission attempts to include in its research activity the broadest possible spectrum of issues involving the culture of this region, both its past and the present day: from archaeology, through history, literature, religion, art, and languages, to political and sociological problems. Learned symposia and conferences have been organized, including a conference on The Lemkos and Lemko Studies in Poland (June 1995), and five panel discussions. The Commission's publications include the Works of the Commission on Eastern Europe, of which four volumes have already appeared. Individual monographs have also been published, e.g.: * Metropolita Andrzej Szeptycki. Studia i materiały [Metropolitan Andrzej Szeptycki: Studies and Materials], edited by Andrzej A. Zięba Kraków, 1994); * Ryszard Łużny, Słowo o Bogu i człowieku. Myśl religijna Słowian Wschodnich doby staroruskiej [A Word about God and Man: The Religious Thought of the Eastern Slavs in the Old Ruthenian Period] (Kraków, 1995); * Łemkowie i łemkoznawstwo w Polsce [The Lemkos and Lemko Studies in Poland], edited by Andrzej A. Zięba (Kraków, 1997). ====Commission on the Prehistory of the Carpathians==== This Commission was founded in 1996. It brings together scientists interested in the history of the oldest settlements in the Carpathians: primarily archaeologists, and the paleobotanists and palaeogeographers who cooperate with them. The current primary research projects are: * the first farmers and herders in the Carpathians: problems of the Neolithization of the Carpathians; * adaptation of settlement from the late Neolithic and early Bronze Age to the environmental conditions of the Carpathians: the development of pastoral societies; * settlement processes in late prehistory and protohistory, with particular emphasis on the early Middle Ages. The Commission's works appear in the Works of the Commission on the Prehistory of the Carpathians, the first volume of which contains the results of joint Polish-Slovak research on the earliest Linear Pottery Culture in eastern Slovakia. The second volume deals with the archaeology and natural environment of the Low Beskids mountains in the Carpathians. ====Commission on the History and Culture of the Jews==== This Commission's activities are focused on Jewish history and culture in Poland and Europe. It brings together scholars from various specialties who share an interest in Jewish studies. In addition to regular meetings featuring lectures and discussion, the Commission also organizes scholarly symposia. The symposium entitled Jews and Judaism in Contemporary Polish Research was an occasion of particular significance, crowned by an impressive publication of symposium materials. The series entitled Works of the Commission on the History and Culture of the Jews publishes both collection of studies and monographs, as well as the materials from symposia. At present the Commission is concentrating its interests on Jewish associations, Jewish necropolises, and Jewish art. Plans call for the Commission's Bulletin to appear once every two years. ====Commission on Law PAU==== This Commission, reactivated in 1995, is the successor to a Commission that was an active part of the Academy prior to the year 1952. It is involved with current-day legal problems concerning the justice system (broadly understood), political reforms, the adaptation of Polish law to European norms, and the history of legal sciences in Poland. International cooperation is also being developed. The Commission is responsible for publishing the Kwartalnik Prawa Prywatnego [Quarterly of Private Law], edited by Stefan Grzybowski, with assistance from Andrzej Mączyński. The quarterly has appeared regularly for six years, and has won recognition among specialists involved in private law. The Commission has also created a periodical publication entitled Journal of Criminal Law and Penal Sciences, which has appeared since 1997. The Commission has regular scholarly meetings that include ample time for discussion. ====Commission on the History of Wars and Military Science==== Commission was formed in 2005 as the Commission for the Second World War History. In the beginning of 2006 changed its name to a current one: PAU Commission for War and Military History. Besides its monthly scientific sessions, the Commission support publication initiatives. So far the post-conference materials concerning the Polish Intelligence service activity during the Second World War has been published. Memoirs of general Antoni Szylling are to be issued soon; the colonel Mazaraki's relations about the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905 and a volume of the Commission's Works are being prepared. ====Commission on Economic Sciences==== The Commission was formed on 12 May 2004. The Commission's first aim is to create a forum for scientific discussion for the whole academic economic community, which is nowadays dispersed and divided into separate narrow specializations. One of the means for achieving this aim is the analysis of main research trends in economic sciences (both in theory and in practice), as well as the presentation of the scholarly achievements of their representatives. Another goal of the Commission, connected with the previous project, is a discussion on the current issues of the economy of the world, of the EU and of our country, showed against the background of scientific achievements. ====Ethnographic Commission==== ===Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry=== The section awards the Marian Mięsowicz Prize for outstanding achievements in the field of physics. This prize is funded by the Kraków scientific institutes involved with physics; the first prize winner was Władysław Wolter in 1997. ====Commission on Astrophysics==== his Commission is involved with observational astronomy in the areas of optical electromagnetic radiation of radio waves, infrared, X-rays and gamma rays, detection of loaded particles, and the astronomy of neutrinos. The Commission's interests also extend into the sphere of such fields of physics as the theory of relativity, atomic and molecular optics, nuclear physics, the physics of elementary particles, and the theory of phase transitions. One of the goals of the Commission's activities is to organize conferences. The first, in June 1996, was devoted to solar astrophysics, neutron stars, and gamma flashes. The conference materials, published in English with funding from the PAU, bear the title Solar Astrophysics, Structure of Neutron Stars, Gamma Flashes. The Commission undertakes publication initiatives, aimed at providing the Polish market with up-to-date textbooks and monographs. Work has begun on translating into Polish a modern textbook devoted to the structure of the Sun and the stars. The Commission actively supports educational initiatives associated with astrophysics. Among such initiatives was a master's level area studies program in astrophysics at the Jagiellonian University, established in 1997. ====Commission of Technical Sciences==== This Commission was founded in 2003 and comprises seven sections: of Civil Engineering; of Construction, Technology and Operation of Machines; of Engineering and Technology of Ceramic Materials; of Informatics, Automatics and Robotics; of Metallurgy and Materials Engineering; of Mining and Power Engineering; of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering. ===Natural Sciences=== The PAU's Natural Sciences section brings together representatives of the biological, agricultural, and geological sciences. The lectures at the section's meetings, typically held jointly with the PAU Mathematics Section, Physics, and Chemistry, and the Medical Section, have dealt with current interdisciplinary problems in biology and earth sciences. In addition to Polish members, the lecturers have included foreign members of the Academy, such as Andrzej Bartke (Carbondale, Illinois, USA), and Otton H. Walliser (Göttingen). The section has also taken part in organizing symposia, e.g. the National Conference on Cell Biology (1996) and the International School on the Biophysics of Membrane Transport (1997). Particularly noteworthy is the study by Andrzej Falniowski, Ways and Byways in the Evolution of Mollusks (2001), which appeared in the section's series of Papers. ====Commission on Agricultural, Forests, and Veterinary Sciences==== The Commission's activities are focused on the organization of scientific symposia, whose materials are published either in the form of separate single- topic volumes or in the series of Works. Currently, the Commission has been working on the issues connected with Polish agriculture, forestry and animal breeding in Europe united in EU. ====Commission on Quaternary Palaeogeography==== This Commission was founded in 1979 within the Kraków branch of the Polish Academy of Sciences, but since 1993 it has been a part of the PAU. Its roots can be traced back to the Committee for Palaeological Research, founded by the PAU in 1928, and to its official publication, Palaeology, in print since 1933. The Commission integrates various disciplines involved in the study of the Quaternary Period: geologists, geomorphologists, paleontologists, archaeologists, and others. The Commission's works are published in the Folia Quaternaria. To date, volumes 64—74 have appeared under the aegis of PAU publications; these have comprised collections of papers dealing with neotectonics, Paleolithic settlement on the loess uplands of the Kraków region, paleomalacology, and dendrochronology. The Commission's meetings have heard papers on the stratigraphy of Pleistocene and Holocene sediments in the light of malacological and palynological analyses, the age of shifts, the conditions for the deposition of lake chalks, and the formation of cave dripstones. Within the scope of the Commission's activities, Kazimierz Kowalski was pursuing a research project on Rodents of Pleistocene Europe (an individual grant from the Scientific Research Committee). The results of this research project are incorporated in volume 72 of Folia Quaternaria and was awarded the City of Kraków Prize. ====Commission on Embryology and Morphology==== This Commission, founded in 1996, serves to integrate research on the embryonal growth and morphology of plants and animals. The task it has established for itself is to organize annual national scientific conferences and regular meetings. The Commission is currently composed of scientists representing all the nation's leading scientific centers. To date it has organized or co-organized several national scientific conferences and meetings with single papers. The results are published in three periodicals: Acta Biologica Cracoviensia, Folia Histochemica et Cytobiologica, and Folia Morphologica. ====Commission on Geoinformation==== This Commission was founded in 1998. Its focus of interests, in keeping with the definition of geoinformation, is methodology of collecting, storing, analyzing, and presenting data pertaining to terrestrial time and space, using the appropriate information technology. This involves information regarding the Earth itself and the objects, phenomena, and processes encountered on and beneath the surface of the Earth. Research topics may include the physical environment and its properties, or natural and man-made resources, as well as the changes taking place in these resources. Due to the composite nature of the discipline, the Commission includes geologists, geophysicists, geodesists, photogrammetrists and experts in remote sensing, representatives of mining- related sciences, information specialists, and geographers. The main task of the Commission is to facilitate the exchange of experiences among specialists from different disciplines involved with geoinformation, to stimulate the development of this branch of science, and to promulgate its results. The Commission's basic forms of activity include holding monthly scientific meetings, as well as organizing or co-organizing national and international scientific conferences. The results are published in the periodical Geoinformatica Polonica. ====Commission on Geography==== ===Medicine=== The members of this section include physicians, pharmacists, and biologists whose scientific work is directly connected with medicine. The meetings of the section are regularly held jointly with the Mathematics and Natural Sciences sections, and have included papers on the general problems of medicine, presented both by members of the section and by foreign scientists visiting Kraków. Two scientific symposia in the medical sciences took place in 1995 under the auspices of the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences. One of them, organized in cooperation with the Medical Research Center of the Jagiellonian University and the Polish Physiological Association, dealt with the centennial of the discovery of adrenaline, which was made simultaneously by Polish and English researchers. The second symposium dealt with the problem of the role of infection by Helicobacter pylori in inflammations of the mucous membranes of the stomach. In this area a crucial role has been played by the research of Stanisław Konturek and Jerzy Stachura, members of our Academy who are also affiliated with the Polish Academy of Sciences. Within the Medical section there is the PAU Commission on Medical Ethics. The members of the section also take part in the work of the PAU Commission on Threats to Civilization. On the initiative and on behalf of the section, the Tadeusz Browicz Prize has been awarded since 1999 to recognize outstanding achievements in the field of medicine and pharmacology. Until recently the Prize was funded by the Pliva pharmaceutical company. The English Language School of Medicine at the Jagiellonian University's Collegium Medicum, previously the second sponsor, was the sole sponsor in 2001. The Tadeusz Browicz Prize is formally awarded to the winners at the June meeting of the PAU's General Assembly. ===Artistic Creativity=== This section was founded in 1994, after the PAU's charter was amended to allow for its creation. The goal of the new Section was to include persons from the world of art among the members of the Academy, outstanding creators whose careers have made a significant contribution to the development of culture. The areas of artistic creativity represented in the section include literature, music, architecture, painting, sculpture, theater, and film. The section's activities were inaugurated by two lectures, one delivered by Jerzy Nowosielski, \\"The Growth of Consciousness in Time: Truth or Illusion?\\" and the other by Jan Józef Szczepański, \\"The Concept of Morality in Literature\\". The speakers at the section's meetings in recent years have also included Andrzej Wajda, Witold Cęckiewicz, Jerzy Jarocki, Stanisław Lem, , and Bronisław Chromy. ===Independent Interdisciplinary Commissions=== ====Anthropological Commission of the PAU==== ====Commission on Threats to Civilization==== This Commission is interdisciplinary in character, and is composed of members of different PAU classes, from the History and Philosophy sections to the Creative Arts section. Threats to the harmonious development of humanity should be a subject of interest and research, not only for representatives of the exact sciences and engineering, biology, and medicine, but also for historians, philosophers, lawyers, and even literary scholars and creative artists from other areas of culture. Threats are associated in the public mind with the improper use of the results of scientific research and the development of technology and industrial operations that are hostile to the natural environment. Yet there are also dangers for the future of the human race lurking in climatic changes, population growth, and the appearance of new diseases. Other threats emerge from ideologies that generate fundamentalism, mendacity, and hatred, the primary causes of terrorism and war. We should bear in mind in this context that during the century now drawing to its close humanity achieved the capability of annihilating itself. Ethical evaluations are not applied to the results of scientific research. The criterion of scientific value as such is truth. Evil lurks in our very selves, and this is what causes the results of research to be exploited to the detriment of humanity. The multiplication of pseudo-sciences and the contradiction of rationalism are leading us into blind alleys, and for many people are replacing their lost faith in the value of scientific progress. The general public needs to be convinced that it is only through the further development of science and learning that the consequences of all these threats can be averted. Scientific truth and the love of one's neighbor are the basic principles that create the opportunity for humanity to survive and develop in harmony. The Commission discusses the threats that have arisen, and provides society at large with accurate information about their causes and the ways to avert their consequences. The scientific meetings are used to present and discuss selected issues involved with the threats that have already emerged, are just becoming apparent, or are expected, and to indicate the directions for scientific research and actions to avert these threats. Extensive summaries of the papers are published in a PAU periodical, Zagrożenia cywilizacyjne [Threats to Civilization], which in the future will occur periodically in the form of a quarterly. In addition, the Commission intends to organize public lectures for a broad spectrum of society, and will also attempt to reach public opinion through the mass media: the press, radio, and television. ====Commission on the History of Sciences==== This Commission was founded in 1998 on the initiative of the Natural Sciences section. Its task is to stimulate research on the history of particular scientific disciplines, conducted by representatives of those disciplines, rather than by historians, who lack the specialized education needed to fully comprehend the substance of highly specialized disciplines. This idea fell on fertile soil, since there had already been great interest within the PAU in the history of the organization of science and in the biographies of eminent scholars and scientists from the past. The Commission has been very active. It organizes monthly meetings with papers and discussions as well as scientific symposia. The results of the Commission's work are printed in the series Works of the Commission on the History of Science (reports presented at the Commission meetings) and in Monographs. The Commission initiated also a series devoted to the PAU and entitled Studies and Materials for the History of the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences. ====Commission on the Evaluation of Textbooks==== Out of a concern for the proper intellectual level of the textbooks used in public schools, the PAU Executive Board decided in late 2000 to found a Commission composed of specialists in the various subjects taught in the secondary school curriculum, to provide completely independent evaluations of the textbooks adopted for use in public schools. The work of such a Commission ought to be of considerable social benefit. The very existence of such an independent body should help make authors and publishers more sensitive to the intellectual level of the textbooks being introduced into the public school curriculum. Satisfactorily, the forecast have proved correct. The current activities of the Commission as well as the five published volumes of its Works have aroused intense interest. Following the Commission's motion, honorary diplomas were conferred on the authors and published of the best textbooks during June General Assembly of the PAU (five times so far). ====Commission on European Matters==== This Commission, formed in 2003, is engaged—as its name indicates—into the issues related to European matters and especially the Poland's, and Kraków's, place and role in Europe. Several ongoing works (and mainly open sessions) have been already organised and all of them focused on various aspects of Poland's participation in European Union. The exemplary subjects listed below (lectures or introductions to discussions during the Commission's meetings) are brief but accurate summary of the most important issues: Constitution Treaty of the European Union by Edmund Wittbrodt, Europe Seeking for its Symbols. History and Meaning of the European flag by Krzysztof Kowalski, Being a European – what does it mean? by Zdzisław Mach and Piotr Sztompka, Is it worth dying for Nice? by Wojciech Słomczyński and Karol Życzkowski. The Commission have worked on—and still is planning to do so—education and science matters (i.e. Polish studies on European Matters faculties, role of universities in today's Europe, scientific and educational policies in Poland and Europe, financing of scientific research works, various organisational aspects of scientific activities in a European scale, European scientific associations' undertakings etc.) Altogether with the Commission on the History of Science, the Commission for European Matters organised (on behalf of Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences) a conference of European Society for the History of Science that took place in Kraków on September 2006. ====Commission for the Development of the City of Kraków==== The Commission is composed of 20 founder members (members of the PAU and the PAN), prominent representatives of the humanities, mathematics and natural sciences, artistic disciplines, as well as 21 incorporated members who support the interdisciplinary aims of the Commission and represent such fields as town and country planning, archaeology, history of art, sociology, law, landscape architecture, botany, geography, civil engineering, water management, transport and communication. The Commission, depending on the undertaken tasks, intends to collaborate with appropriate specialists in related disciplines of science and to make them its members, if the need arises. ====Commission on the Philosophy of Natural Sciences==== PAU Commission for Natural Sciences Philosophy is a discussion panel for natural science scholars as 'philosophers' taking place with participation and under sui generis control of 'real' philosophers. The Commission is a group of representatives of Philosophy, Mathematics, Physics, Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Geology and Medicine. Its character is an interdisciplinary though, and focused on issues of an ontology aspect as well as issues concerning mutual influence Philosophy and other, more specialized, sciences. ====\\"Fides et Ratio\\" Commission==== ====Commission for the Studies on Polish Diaspora==== ====Commission for Ethics in Science==== ====Commission of Natural Sciences and Medicine==== Based in Wrocław. ==Contemporary activity== Currently, the PAU consists of six sections, each of which has its executive board, with a director, deputy director, and a secretary; in some cases, there is also a deputy secretary. Within each class there are commissions and committees, the latter standing or temporary, which, though, must be headed by a regular member of the PAU (with few exceptions), may include persons who are not PAU members. The sections hold monthly scientific meetings, where papers are read and discussed. The PAU's activities are described and documented in the \\"PAU Annual\\". Each of the classes issues its own \\"Papers\\" or other publication series, where they publish works that fall within the scientific purview of the section or other texts of scientific or scholarly value, especially historical sources. The commissions have their own series of \\"Works\\" or periodicals, according to their respective specialties. As of June 2009, the PAU had 476 members, including 146 regular members, 148 corresponding members and 182 foreign members, each of whom maintains active contacts with Polish science and learning. ===Seminars of the PAU=== Since 2002, monthly Seminars of the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences have been organized and attracted attendance up to ca. 200 participants. Currently, the leading topic is \\"Patriotism yesterday and today\\". To the group of speakers invited to deliver their lectures belong eminent representatives of science, culture, and public life, such as Władysław Bartoszewski, Bronisław Geremek, , Jan Nowak Jeziorański, Archbishop Archbishop Józef Życiński, Archbishop Henryk Muszyński and others. ===Science Café=== Since 2004, the PAU has organized, together with the daily \\"Dziennik Polski\\", a series of events called the Science Café. These are scientific meetings open for public. Each of the meetings is dedicated to a lecture on a scientific subject for general public and is followed by a discussion and conversations over a cup of coffee. ===\\"PAUza Akademicka\\" Weekly=== An online weekly PAUza Akademicka (Academic PAUse)A pun made on the Polish pronunciation of the acronym \\"PAU\\" and the word \\"pauza\\" [pause]. subsidized by the Municipality of Kraków, has been available since September 2008. On special occasions a paper version is printed. The weekly is devoted to the issues related to scientific life in Poland, with special attention paid to the scientific environment in Kraków. Andrzej Kobos PhD and Marian Nowy are the editors. ===Supporting Young Scholars and Junior Research Workers=== Since January 2009, the \\"PAUeczka Akademicka\\"Literally \\"Academic Baton,\\" a pun made on the Polish pronunciation of the acronym \\"PAU\\" and the word \\"pałeczka\\" [baton]. [Academy of the Young], has been working in the PAU. Directed by vice-president of the PAU Andrzej Szczeklik, it organizes monthly meeting of PhD students, assistant lectures and students representing various scientific disciplines from the academic environment in Kraków. The meetings are devoted to discussions aiming at humanization and integration of academic circles. The PAU co-finances the Winter School of Theoretical Physics of Wrocław University (for students in senior years, PhD students, and junior research workers), international workshops, and the Kraków School of Theoretical Physics (for junior research workers from Poland and abroad). ===The Academic Library of the PAU and PAN=== The Academic Library of the PAU and the PAN has been in the structure of the PAU since 1 January 2000. Its origins go back to the 19th century and to the Kraków Learned Society. Until 1952 it functioned as the Library of the Academy of Arts and Sciences (since 1872) and of the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences (since 1920), and starting from 1953 as an independent unit of the Polish Academy of Sciences. As a result of the agreement between the PAN and the PAU concluded on 20 October 1999, the Library became an institution managed by the PAU. The Library numbers ca. 660,000 volumes and inventory units, including nearly 144,250 volumes and inventory units of special collections, which comprise nearly 13,700 old prints, about 13,000 manuscripts and over 96,000 graphics and drawings. The Library exchanges publications with more than 1,000 institutions in 77 countries, publishes its \\"Annual\\" (of a volume of c.a. 50 publisher's sheets), prepares and successively issues catalogues of its collections, and is engaged in gathering and providing information, for instance on didactics in tertiary education institutions in Kraków. The Library has its own Council appointed (on a fifty-fifty basis) by the PAU and the PAN. ===The Archives of the Science of the PAN and PAU=== The activities of the PAU are closely connected with the Archives of the Science of the PAN and of the PAU. Besides the PAN's collection (starting from 1953) the Archives gather also files of the Kraków Learned Society and other Kraków societies, and, first of all, of the Academy of Arts and Sciences (since 1872) and the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences (1920–1952 and from 1989). The collection contains also numerous legacies of many scholars, not only those who were the PAU members. As a consequence of the agreement between the PAN and the PAU, since 1 April 2002, the former Warsaw Branch of the Archives of the Polish Academy of Sciences has been functioning under the name of the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences in Kraków. The Archives belong to the structure of the PAN Branch in Kraków but have their own Council appointed and financed by both the academies. Besides storing, working out the collected items and making them available for researches, the Archives systematically organize various exhibitions and scientific conferences. They also publish the PAU series entitled \\"In the Service of Science\\". The Archives work in close cooperation with the PAU's Commission on the History of Science. ===Polish Library in Paris=== The Polish Library in Paris has become an important PAU's department. The PAU exercised its former owner's rights (since 1893) and settled the issue by arbitration reaching an agreement with the Historical and Literary Society in Paris, the body currently managing the Library. Having agreed on the Society's co-ownership, the PAU has been co-financing (from the funds of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education) the Library and co-organizing its activities since 2004. ===Polish Biographical Dictionary=== The PAU collaborates with the Institute of History of the Polish Academy of Sciences in the preparation and publishing of \\"Polski Słownik Biograficzny [Polish Biographical Dictionary]\\". From 1935 until 1949, the Dictionary was published by the PAU. Then, because of ideological reasons, the publishing was discontinued. It was two years after the political breakthrough in October 1956 when the editing unit was reactivated in the structures of the PAN. Since then the Dictionary has been continuously published. Starting from 1999 the PAU has been also involved in making of the \\"Polish Biographical Dictionary\\" by rendering its rooms of a total area of 193 m2 available for the editorial staff. ===Scientific Scholarships=== The PAU controls the foreign research fellowships funded by the Lanckoroński Foundations. This involves a large number of scholarships for resident fellowships in Rome, Vienna, and London, and occasionally in other cities as well. The PAU Scholarship Commission, which also includes representatives from five Polish universities—Jagiellonian University, Warsaw University, Wrocław University, Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań and Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń—awards these scholarships each year. In 2005, the Maria Zdziarska-Zaleska Scholarship Fund was set up at the Historical and Literary Society in Paris to provide money for research in the Polish library in Paris. A commission attached to the PAU awards the scholarships. ===International Cooperation=== Since its foundation, the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences has been actively involved in cooperation with foreign institutions and activities on the international forum. Already in the 19th century the Academy initiated archival expeditions to study sources from the history of Poland (among other the so-called Roman Expedition to Vatican Archives connected with its opening in 1881), and sent its representatives to international congresses. In 1898, the Academy of Arts and Sciences became the owner of the Polish Library in Paris and opened a scientific station there. The Academy's library in Kraków carried on a broad exchange of publications from the very beginning. In 1921, the PAU became a founding member of the Union Académique Internationale (UAI). After its activities were resumed, the PAU's membership in the UAI was renewed in 1993, and the PAU began to take part in the research and publication projects of this organization. The publication of the Polish series of the \\"Corpus vasorum antiquorum\\" (CVA) was completed with volume 10, devoted to Cypriot pottery from the collection of the National Museum in Warsaw. The Kraków sheet in the \\"\\" (TIR) was worked out and published, and the material for sheet 12 of the \\"Atlas du Monde Grec et Romain\\" was prepared. Three volumes of the Polish series in the \\"Corpus antiquitatum Americanensium\\" (CAA) have been published; the first two volumes are devoted to the ceramics and Peruvian textiles in the collection of Kraków Archaeological Museum (the Kluger Collection, formerly the property of the PAU), and the third one deals with the materials of the Polish archaeological mission in Peru. The edition of the Polish series \\"Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum\\" (SNG) has been commenced; its first four volumes are devoted to the collection of Greek coins from the Archaeological Museum in Łódź. PAU members are also participating in the realization of such UAI projects as \\"Corpus philosophorum medii aevi, Civitas litteraria Europaea, Moravia Magna\\". The PAU has declared its intention of joining new UAI projects, such as the realization of the series \\"Monumenta palaeographica medii aevi\\" (volume 1 already worked out), \\"Mundus Scytho-Sarmaticus et Graeco-Romanus\\" (together with Ukraine). Thanks to the effective cooperation of the PAU and the UAI, the annual plenary meeting of the UAI (involving representative of 44 academies around the world assembled in the UAI) took place in Kraków in 1999, during which the PAU's representative, , was elected officer of the UAI; since 2007 he has been the vice-president of the organization. A cooperation agreement has been signed with the Slovak Academy of Sciences. This bore fruit especially in the field of archaeology, for instance in the realization of joint investigation of archaeological sites in eastern and south-western Slovakia as well as in the research into the archaeology and natural environment of the Low Beskids mountains (volume II). Cooperation was also initiated and contracts were signed with the Royal Flemish Academy for Science and the Arts in Belgium, with the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, with the Slovenian Academy of Sciences, with the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, with the Romanian Academy of Sciences, and with the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences. Somewhat looser forms of cooperation exist between the PAU and the Saxon Academy and Sciences, as well as the Austrian Academy of Sciences and with the Brandenburg Academy of Sciences in Berlin. Class II of the PAU has signed a cooperation agreement with the Institute of History in Vilnius. The PAU has also been engaged in scientific cooperation based on treaties negotiated by the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs with several countries, including France, Italy, the Czech Republic, Macedonia, and Egypt. Together with the universities in Rome (La Sapienza and LUMSA), in Lecce, in Angers, in Szeged, in Lublin (KUL), and in Tallinn, the PAU constitutes in accordance with the European Union requirements a scientific society named Centro Interuniversitario Internazionale per il Mediterraneo, l'Europa Centro-Orientale e l'Eurasia. In 1994 the PAU Scientific Station in New York was founded, based on the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences in America, which continued the PAU's traditions during the WWII and of the period of the compulsory suspension of the PAU activities, from 1952 until 1989. Its short-term activities could not be continued due to the lack of financial support. Currently, efforts have been made in order to revive this institution. Contacts have been established with the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences in Canada, founded in 1943 as a branch of the Polish Institute in New York, and since 1976 operating as an independent Canadian organization. It also acquired a status of the PAU Scientific Station. Three books have been jointly published, and the PAU supports the station with their lecturers. The PAU joined the project of the Polish Historical Institute in Rome, financed by the Lanckoronski Foundation. Recently, after the death of Karolina Lanckoronska, the institute was dissolved and its property, namely numerous publications and scientific projects, such as the publications of the acts of the Apostolic Nunciate in Poland, were taken over by the PAU. Harking back to an older tradition, the PAU is also co-organizing archaeological investigations in Ukraine, continuing the excavation of a large Scythian barrow in Ryzhanovka, among other projects. These investigations have brought one of the most outstanding archaeological discoveries of recent years: the discovery of richly accoutred burial of a Scythian ruler. Now, the works are carried out under the direction of Jan Machnik and the efforts are focused on the research into settlements located on the Dniestr River. It is possible thanks to the grants by the Committee for Scientific Research (KBN). Returning to its pre-war intentions, the PAU has also contributed to archaeological research being conducted in Greece. These investigations deal with the sequence of layers, unique in this part of Europe, in Cave No. 1 at Klisura (eastern Peloponnese), in which traces of habitation and palaeontological finds from the period of the last Ice Age occur. This research contributes to our understanding not only of the evolution of culture in Greece, but also of climatic and paleoecological changes over the last 100,000 years. The works are being conducted under the direction of Janusz Kozłowski, under research grants. They have borne fruit in the form of the publication of the results, jointly with the Greek Academy of Sciences and the PAU. Pursuant to the cultural cooperation treaty between Poland and Egypt, the PAU, in cooperation with the Institute of Archaeology of the Jagiellonian University, is participating in archaeological investigations in the Nile Delta. ===Prizes=== The PAU awards prizes for outstanding research achievements. These include the following: * The Nicholas Copernicus Prize, funded by the City of Kraków by a resolution of the City Council passed on 9 July 1993, in conjunction with the foundation act of the Municipal Commune of 18 February 1973. By tradition, the PAU awards this Prize every year in the fields of astronomy, earth sciences, economy, natural philosophy, medicine, military defense sciences, and law. In 1995, for the first time since the revival of the PAU, six Prizes were awarded. * The Marian Mięsowicz Prize awarded every two years for outstanding achievements in the field of physics. The Prize, funded by institutes of physics working in Kraków, was awarded for the first time in 1997. * The Tadeusz Browicz Prize, awarded annually since 1998 for outstanding achievements in the field of medicine. To date, the prizes have been funded by the Pliva pharmaceutical company in Kraków, Novartis Poland, and the School of Medicine in English at the Jagiellonian University's Collegium Medicum. * In June 2003, the Marian Kukieł Prize for outstanding achievements in the field of military history was awarded for the first time. Prof. Leszek Suski, Gen. Marian Kukie's copyright heir, and the PAU co-fund the prize. * In 2008, with an effort and will of the PAU, the Erazm and Anna Jerzmanowski Prize was revived under the auspices of the Lesser Poland Voivodeship. Called \\"the Polish Nobel Prize\\", it was funded by Erazm Jerzmanowski in 1912 and secured by his inheritance. The prize was awarded within the years 1915–1938 for scientific and charitable activity. Its revival was possible thanks to the funds for Lesser Poland Voivodeship distributed by the local authorities under the leadership of Marshal Marek Nawara. The prize is supposed to be awarded annually. The first prizewinner was Ms Janina Ochojska-Okońska. She received the prize on 9 February 2009, on the centenary of Erazm Jerzmanowski's death. * Every year, upon a motion of the Commission on the Evaluation of Textbooks, the PAU confers honorary diplomas on the authors and publishers of highest rated textbooks for intermediate schools and secondary schools. Additionally, the PAU actively participates in awarding the following prizes: * The City of Kraków Prize; the President of the PAU is the Chairperson of the Jury and several PAU members are the members of the Jury. * Jan Długosz Prize of the Kraków Book Fair; the Chairperson of the Jury is a PAU member (currently Prof. Władysław Stróżewski) and three other PAU members are the members of the Jury. * Allianz Insurance Company Prize; there are two PAU members in the Jury, including the PAU Secretary-General.

In 1974, it was reopened to deal in the wholesale banking market. In 1979, foreign banks were allowed to receive charters and London-based Barclays Bank established a new Canadian subsidiary, Barclays Bank of Canada ().

The population of the Kayan ethnic group may be around 27,000.Kayan in the Encyclopædia Britannica , retrieved on 12 August 2006, from Encyclopædia Britannica Premium Service. They are part of a larger grouping of people referred collectively as the Orang Ulu, or upriver people. Like some other Dayak people, they are known for being fierce warriors, former headhunters, adept in Upland rice cultivation, and having extensive tattoos and stretched earlobes amongst both sexes. ==History== A European man discussing with the leaders of the Kayan people in Sarawak, circa 1900 to 1940. They may have originated from along the Kayan river in the North Kalimantan province of Borneo. They live along the upper Kayan and the middle Kapuas and Mahakam rivers. They seem to have expanded to the south in Sarawak in historic times, generating some conflicts with the Iban that were expanding north at the same time. They have settled in Sarawak on the middle Baram River, the Bintulu River and along the Rajang River, having been pressed back a little during the late 19th century. In 1863 West Kalimantan, Iban people migrated to the upstreams of Saribas River and Rejang River and started to attack the Kayan people in those areas and continued doing so northwards and later eastwards. Wars and headhunting attacks have caused many other tribes to be displaced, including the Kayan people, who make up of 1.4% of the West Kutai Regency population. Significant expansion to the east Borneo also occurred during the historical times, the conversion of the Kayan people to Islam forming the ethnogenesis of the Bulungan people. ==Language== The Kayan language belongs to the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family. ==Main activities== A Kayan using rattan to \\"saw\\" a piece of firewood. Their basic culture is similar to the other Dayak people in Borneo. Their agriculture was based upon shifting cultivation techniques and the cultivation of Upland rice. Other farming such as sago, corn, yams, pumpkin and tobacco are also cultivated. During the years of famine, sago is mined. Fishing (killing fish with poisons) plays an important role, and a smaller role is played by hunting with a sumpitan. The Kayan people are engaged in breeding pigs and chickens, while dogs are kept for ritual purposes. The Kayan people are known as excellent blacksmiths (the Kayan Mandau swords are the main item of exchange), boat builders and carpenters. Loom, weaving, production of tans, arts, wood carving, making of masks and pottery are also developed. ==Social structure== Traditionally, they live in long houses on river banks. Their settlement consists of one or several long houses as long as 300 meters, which can accommodate up to 100 families (400–600 people) and consist of a common veranda and rooms. Residents of a long house constitute a tribal community. The Kayan people are divided into three endogamous caste-estate groups; \\"house owning group\\" or aristocrat (ipun uma or keta'u), community members or commoners (panyun) and slaves (lupau). Among the nobility, marriages are usually outside of the community, often with other tribes; while community members and slaves usually marry within the community. The leader is usually elected from the nobility class (in the 19th century, he also served as a military leader). The settlement is bi-localized, and the filiation is bilateral, while the system of kinship is of the English model. ==Religion== The Kayan people a developed religion and a complex cult (bounty hunting and human sacrifices that disappeared at the beginning of the 20th century, as well as shamanism). The core event was the feast of collected heads (mamat), during which warrior initiations and funeral ceremonies were held. In the 20th century, some Kayan people were converted to Christianity. ==Culture== ===Traditional Kayan song=== * Alam Lening (Dayak Kayaan Mendalam, Kalbar) * Lung Kayaan Mendalam ==Notable people== * Francisca Luhong James - Miss Universe Malaysia 2020 and a part-time model.

He received the Oslo International Poetry Festival Award in 1986. He describes his writing and speaking style as \\"mind-jazz on ancient texts\\". He is the founder of the Lindisfarne Association. ==Biography== Thompson was born in Chicago, Illinois, and grew up in Los Angeles, California. Thompson received his B.A. at Pomona College and his Ph.D. at Cornell University. He was a professor of humanities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then at York University in Toronto, Ontario. He has held visiting appointments at Syracuse University, the University of Hawaii, the University of Toronto and the California Institute of Integral Studies. In 1973, he left academia to found the Lindisfarne Association. The Association, which he led from 1972 to 2012, was a group of scientists, poets, and religious scholars who met in order to discuss and to participate in the emerging planetary culture.Philip Herrera, \\"Waiting For Godlings\\", Time Monday, April 08, 1974 Thompson lived in Switzerland for 17 years. He describes a recent work, Canticum Turicum in his 2009 book, Still Travels: Three Long Poems, as \\"a long poem on Western Civilization that begins with folktales and traces of Charlemagne in Zurich and ends with the completion of Western Civilization as expressed in Finnegans Wake and the traces of James Joyce in Zurich.\\" Thompson is a Founding Mentor to the private K-12 Ross School in East Hampton, New York. In 1995, with mathematician Ralph Abraham, he designed a new type of cultural history curriculum based on their theories about the evolution of consciousness.\\"Founding Mentor William Irwin Thompson Visits\\" Thompson has now retired and lives in Portland, Maine. ==Work== Thompson did his Master's Essay at Cornell on applying the process philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead to poetry; he did his doctoral dissertation on the Easter Rising in Dublin 1916. While serving on the faculty at MIT in the 1960s, Thompson met famed media ecologist Marshall McLuhan, who would influence Thompson's writings on cultural history. Thompson engages a diverse set of traditions, including the Swiss cultural historian Jean Gebser, the Vedic philosopher Sri Aurobindo Ghose, the autopoetic epistemology of Francisco Varela, the endosymbiotic theory of evolution of Lynn Margulis, the Gaia Theory of James Lovelock, the complex systems thought of Ralph Abraham, the novels of Thomas Pynchon, and the daimonic transmissions of mystic David Spangler. ===Style=== Performance is central to Thompson's approach. Performances either open new horizons for the future or close them down, and should be judged on that basis. Thompson thought that with the emergence of the integral era and its electronic media expressions that a new mode of discourse was required. He sought \\"to turn non- fiction into a work of art on its own terms. Rather than trying to be a scholar or a journalist writing on the political and cultural news of the day, I worked to become a poetic reporter on the evolutionary news of the epoch\\".Thompson, \\"The Cultural Phenomenology of Literature\\", 89 http://www.nald.ca/fulltext/ltonword/complete.pdf He espoused the notion that one must express an integral approach not just in content but in the very means of expressing it. Thompson did this in the way he approached teaching: \\"The traditional academic lecture also became for me an occasion to transform the genre, to present not an academic reading of a paper, but a form of Bardic performance–not stories of battles but of the new ideas that were emerging around the world...The course was meant to be a performance of the very reality it sought to describe\\".Thompson, \\"The Cultural Phenomenology of Literature\\", 89-90 http://www.nald.ca/fulltext/ltonword/complete.pdf \\"Wissenskunst\\" (literally, \\"knowledge-art\\") is a German term that Thompson coined to describe his own work. Contrasting it with Wissenschaft, the German term for science, Thompson defines Wissenskunst as \\"the play of knowledge in a world of serious data-processors.\\" > As fiction and music are coming closer to reorganizing knowledge, > scholarship is becoming closer to art. Our culture is changing, and so the > genres of literature and history are changing as well. In an agricultural- > warrior society, the genre is the epic, an Iliad. In an industrial-bourgeois > society, the genre is the novel, a Moll Flanders. In our electronic, > cybernetic society, the genre is Wissenkunst: the play of knowledge in a > world of serious data-processors. The scholarly fictions of Jorge Luis > Borges, or the reviews of non-existent books by Stanislaw Lem, are examples > of new art forms of a society in which humanity live, not innocently in > nature nor confidently in cities, but apocalyptically in a civilization > cracking up to the universe. At such a moment as this the novelist becomes a > prophet, the composer a magician, and the historian a bard, a voice > recalling ancient identities.The Time Falling Bodies Take to Light: > Mythology, Sexuality and the Origins of Culture, 4 ===Works=== ====The Time Falling Bodies Take to Light==== In his acclaimed 1981 work The Time Falling Bodies Take to Light: Mythology, Sexuality and the Origins of Culture, Thompson criticized what he considers the hubristic pretensions of E. O. Wilson's sociobiology, which attempted to subsume the humanities to evolutionary biology.Lehmann-Haupt, Christopher, The Time Falling Bodies take to Light: Mythology, sexuality and the Origins of Culture- review. New York Times. 1981. https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/22/books/books- of-the-times-books-of-the-times.html Thompson then reviewed and critiqued the scholarship on the emergence of civilization from the Paleolithic to the historical period. He analyzed the assumptions and prejudices of the various anthropologists and historians who have written on the subject, and attempted to paint a more balanced picture. He described the task of the historian as closer to that of the artist and poet than to that of the scientist. > Because we have separated humanity from nature, subject from object, values > from analysis, knowledge from myth, and universities from the universe, it > is enormously difficult for anyone but a poet or a mystic to understand what > is going on in the holistic and mythopoeic thought of Ice Age humanity. The > very language we use to discuss the past speaks of tools, hunters, and men, > when every statue and painting we discover cries out to us that this Ice Age > humanity was a culture of art, the love of animals, and women.The Time > Falling Bodies Take to Light, 102 Thompson sees the Stone Age religion expressed in the Venus figurines, Lascaux cave paintings, Çatal Hüyük, and other artifacts to be an early form of shamanism. He believes that as humanity spread across the globe and was divided into separate cultures, this universal shamanistic Mother Goddess religion became the various esoteric traditions and religions of the world. Using this model, he analyzed Egyptian mythology, Sumerian hymns, the Epic of Gilgamesh, the cult of Quetzalcoatl, and many other stories, myths, and traditions. Thompson often refers to Kriya yoga and Yoga Nidra throughout these analyses, and this seems to be the spiritual tradition with which he is most comfortable. ====Coming Into Being==== In his 1996 work Coming into Being: Artifacts and Texts in the Evolution of Consciousness, Thompson applied an approach that was similar to his 1981 book to many other artifacts, cultures and historical periods. A notable difference, however, is that the 1996 work was influenced by the work of cultural phenomenologist Jean Gebser. Works and authors analyzed include the Enuma Elish, Homer, Hesiod, Sappho, the Book of Judges, the Rig Veda, Ramayana, Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, and the Tao Te Ching. Thompson analyzed these works using the vocabulary of contemporary cognitive theory and chaos theory, as well as theories of history. An expanded paperback version was released in 1998. The phrase \\"Coming into being\\" is a translation of the Greek term gignesthai, from which the word genesis is derived.http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=g&p;=3 ====Self and Society==== In his 2004 book Self and Society: Studies in the Evolution of Consciousness, and in collaboration with the mathematician Ralph Abraham, Thompson related Gebser's structures to periods in the development of mathematics (arithmetic, geometric, algebraic, dynamical, chaotic) and in the history of music. ===Interests=== The Lindisfarne Fellows House in Crestone, Colorado Thompson considers James Joyce's stylistically experimental novel Finnegans Wake to be \\"the ultimate novel, indeed, the ultimate book,\\" and also to be the climactic artistic work of the modern period and of the rational mentality. Thompson is fascinated by Los Angeles, where he grew up, and Disneyland, which he considers to be LA's essence. He has also written a book-length treatment of the Easter Rising of 1916. Thompson has critiqued postmodern literary criticism, artificial intelligence, the technological futurism of Raymond Kurzweil, the contemporary philosophy of mind theories of Daniel Dennett and Paul Churchland, and the astrobiological cosmogony of Zecharia Sitchin. ===Reception=== Thompson's second book, At the Edge of History was reviewed in The New York Times by Christopher Lehmann-Haupt in March 1971.Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, \\"History as Science-Fiction\\", March 19, 1971 New York Times Thompson's 1974 Passages About Earth was reviewed in Time. The reviewer wrote: > From ample but largely gloomy evidence of rapid social change — future > shock, ecological disruption, population explosion, proliferation of > information — Thompson draws a startling conclusion: \\"We are the climactic > generation of human cultural evolution.\\" Man, he asserts, will now either > slide back into a new Dark Age or evolve into a higher, more spiritual > being. > Which way will we go?

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 30, 2003. ==Plot== Declan Desmond, an opinionated British documentary film producer, films a documentary at Springfield Elementary School on the students' lives. He interviews Bart as he gets hit by a ball of dirt thrown by Nelson and breaks down in tears. Later, Declan belittles Lisa as she talks about the multiplicity of her interests, insinuating that she could neither be happy nor successful juggling too many hobbies or passions. Hurt by his criticism, Lisa resolves to find a single passion to which she can devote herself; astronomy. She convinces Homer to buy her a telescope, but discovers that light pollution from the city is blocking her view of the sky. After a discussion with Professor Frink, Lisa starts a petition to reduce the city's light pollution. After gaining enough signatures, Mayor Quimby agrees to turn off the streetlights, leading to a clear view of the stars, at which many people from Springfield marvel. Meanwhile, Bart is looking for a way to regain his popularity after being humiliated. After seeing Nelson parading around with stolen car hood ornaments, he decides to steal one off Fat Tony's car. Milhouse and Bart are foiled on their first attempt because Quimby is pressured to switch the lights back on due to rising crime. Yet the light level is set too high which means that no one can sleep so Lisa, still wanting to see the light pollution reduced, and Bart, still wanting to steal Fat Tony's hood ornament, take a now sleep-deprived Homer to the power plant and overload the generators causing a power outage, which ends the light pollution, but before the angry citizens can attack, Lisa points out a meteor shower and the town looks on in wonderment while Bart sneaks off and steals Fat Tony's hood ornament, with Don McLean's song Vincent playing in the background . The show ends with a montage of clips from Declan's documentary. ==Production== By this time in the show's history, there had been an \\"ever- present fear that as the show ages it risks 'jumping the shark. The Simpsons writers satirised the term's namesake (an episode of Happy Days in which Fonzie jumps over a shark on water skis) in the episode, which has a couch gag where the Simpson family jump over a tank full of sharks in a similar fashion (the gag had previously been used in the episode \\"How I Spent My Strummer Vacation\\"). Executive producer Al Jean said, \\"We figured that if we said it first, then they couldn't say it\\". ==Critical reception== Director Steven Dean Moore won an Annie Award in the category of Best Directing in an Animated Television Production for this episode. The episode was also nominated for an Environmental Media Award for Best Television Episodic Comedy.

According to the , it has a population of people. ==History== Magdalena was formerly a barrio of Majayjay, Laguna. A petition from the residents of the barrio for the creation of a new town was presented on September 15, 1819. It was proclaimed a new town by Governor General Don Mariano Fernández de Folgueras on January 18, 1820, and was originally named \\"Magdalena de Ambling\\". The name was derived from its patron saint Maria Magdalena and the barrio of Ambling where it was established. The first Teniente Alcalde or Capitan (the highest political authority in a town) was Don Mauricio San Mateo. They first established a makeshift school in 1820, which was the very first requirement for it to be a town. The municipal hall was also constructed. A small chapel was also constructed and it gave way to the construction of a church in 1829. The church was made of stones and bricks and donations were solicited from the residents. The construction was finished in 1861. The construction of the concrete town hall and the church convent started in 1871, and was finished in 1884. The revolt against the Spaniards in this area started on November 13, 1896, when the male residents joined the revolutionaries from the province to form a bigger force. It was during one of the encounters that Emilio Jacinto was wounded and sought refuge at the Catholic Church. Emilio Aguinaldo, then, proclaimed the first Philippine Republic and the Spaniards finally surrendered on September 1, 1898, and celebrations followed. The arrival of the Americans, at the turn of the century, witnessed the evacuation of the townsfolk to the mountains for fear of being killed, later returned to the Poblacion seeing that the foreigners were well-intentioned.. The Americans enforced a new system of government. Election of government officials was conducted regularly. The first elected President Municipal was Don Victor Crisostomo. It was during this time that rebels, called tulisan, formed a force to oppose the foreign rule. They robbed the house of the residents. This made the Americans very strict on social life of the people, prohibiting them from leaving the Poblacion and talking to each other publicly. It was on June 15, 1929 that electricity was introduced in the municipality. Life continued under the American regime and to an extent, introduced their own culture to the Filipinos until the Second World War broke out in 1941. In 1945, Filipino troops of the 4th, 42nd, 43rd, 45th and 46th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 4th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary liberated the towns in Magdalena, Laguna. The Japanese surrendered to the Filipino soldiers and guerrillas on May 25, 1945, thus, Magdalena, as well as the Philippines, was liberated from the Japanese army. After the war, they returned to the Poblacion and started their lives from what was left of the war. Post-World War II, Magdalena became a preferred shooting location for numerous films, including The Ravagers (also known as Only the Brave Know Hell). ==Barangays== Magdalena is politically subdivided into 24 barangays. *AlipitAlipit *Malaking AmblingMalakingambling *Munting AmblingMuntingambling *BaananBaanan *BalanacBalanac *BucalBucal *BuenavistaBuenavista *BungkolBungkol *BuoBuo *BurlunganBurlungan *CigarasCigaras *Ibabang AtingayIbabangatingay *Ibabang ButnongIbabangbutnong *Ilayang AtingayIlayangatingay *Ilayang ButnongIlayangbutnong *IlogIlog *MalinaoMalinao *MaravillaMaravilla *PoblacionPoblacion *SabangSabang *SalasadSalasad *TanawanTanawan *TipunanTipunan *HalayhayinHalayhayin ==Climate== ==Demographics== In the , the population of Magdalena, Laguna, was people, with a density of . ==Local government== Municipal Hall *Municipal Mayor: David Aventurado *Municipal Vice Mayor: Pedro Bucal *Members of the municipal council: #Leovio Porcioncula #Larry Ibañez #Mj Palomique #Romel Lerum #Ariel Ungco #Ron Vincent Zaguirre #Mary Grace Reodica #Max Sotomayor ==Tourism== lKawayan Festival dance competition St. Mary Magdalene Parish Church The Bahay Laguna Emilio Jacinto Monument Some notable tourist attractions include: *St. Mary Magdalene Parish Church *Mali-Mali Bridge *Emilio Jacinto Shrine *The Rizal Park *The Bahay Laguna *The Pintong Kabag *The Pintong Pilak *Magdalena White Water River Rafting Adventure *Bahay ni Luz Bed & Breakfast Inn ===The Kawayan Festival=== Magdalena recently held its first Kawayan Festival to mark the town's 185th Foundation Day. The colorful festival celebrates the native bamboo and its role in the culture and livelihood of the town and to promote bamboo-based industries. Liga ng mga Barangay national president James Marty Lim was special guest at the festival, and together with Magdalena town officials led by Mayor David Aventurado Jr., congratulated the Magdaleños for their initiatives to promote the local bamboo industry. However, no such bamboo enterprise visibly exists in the town. ===St. Mary Magdalene Parish=== St. Mary Magdalene Church was constructed in 1851–1871, and made of stones and bricks with a sandstone facade. The church is located at the town center or plaza, just across the municipal town hall of Magdalena. In February 1898, after being wounded in a battle with the Spaniards at the Maimpis River, Philippine revolutionary hero Emilio Jacinto sought refuge in this church. His bloodstains were found on the floor of the church. ===The Bahay Laguna=== Bahay Laguna is a museum in Barangay Bungkol, Magdalena, that houses the memorabilia of Governor Felicisimo T. San Luis, who served as Governor of Laguna province for 33 years. During his time, he was known as the \\"Living Legend of Laguna.\\" Aside from the memorabilia of then governor, Bahay Laguna showcases the specialty crafts and signature products of Laguna towns such as woodcarving of Paete and bottled preserved fruits of Alaminos. The construction of Bahay Laguna was finished in December 1995. The Dr. Floro Brosas Foundation donated a piece of its land for this repository.http://www.lagunatravelguide.com/index.php?page=bahay-laguna-2 ==Schools== CCT-AMG Skilled Hands Technological College ;Elementary Public: *Ananias Laico Memorial Elementary School- ALMES(formerly Magdalena Elementary School) *Ricardo A.

Working under this belief, the Municipality of Magdalena successfully implemented the LGU Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Project (LGU-UWSSP) in their locality. In years past, the municipality operated the Magdalena Waterworks, a water supply system which covered ten barangays. The main water source was the Oples Spring in the nearby town of Liliw, Laguna, supplying a volume of four liters/second to 1,097 service connections. Tariff was Php 8.00 for the first 10 cubic meters and an additional Php 1.00 in excess of 10 cubic meters. However, the people were not keen on increasing the tariff, as the service was extremely poor. Believing that water is one of the basic services that the government should be able to provide to the people, the LGU consequently searched for a more permanent solution. Through the DILG and World Bank, the Local Government Unit Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Project (LGUUWSSP) was introduced to Magdalena officials. Through barangay meetings and consultations, the people came to know of the LGU water project and how it will help address their problems. With the creation of the Municipal Water Board on August 2004, the water system was also constructed and became fully operational within a period of one year and six months. The Water Board is at present focused in the expansion of the service area to provide quality water service to the nearby barangays. Moreover, the board is continuously producing policies to help the project be self-sufficient and be a profitable economic enterprise for the LGU. With the successful implementation of the LGU-UWSSP, there have been marked improvements in the water supply and living conditions of the people in the community. All stakeholders in the municipality benefitted from the improved water system. From the previous practice of rationing water, a 24/7 supply has been established, contributing to the improved health of the citizenry. However, up until now, the drinking water in town still smells like iron and cannot be drank straight from the faucet. ==References== ==External links== * Magdalena Profile at PhilAtlas.com * [ Philippine Standard Geographic Code] *Philippine Census Information *Local Governance Performance Management System Category:Municipalities of Laguna (province) ","title":"Magdalena, Laguna"},{"id":"1275611","text":"Fred Rouhling (born 24 January 1970) is a French rock climber, famed for his 1995 proposal of the grade 9b/5.15b for his unrepeated climb Akira.

He eventually built a large bamboo fort (Basher Kella in Bengali) in the village of Narikelberia, which passed onto Bengali folk legend. After the storming of the fort by British soldiers, Titumir died of his wounds on 19 November 1831. ==Early life== Titumir was born as Syed Mir Nisar Ali on 27 January 1782 (14 Magh 1182 in the Bengali calendar), in the village of Chandpur, Basirhat (currently in North 24 Parganas, West Bengal, India). His father was Syed Mir Hasan Ali and mother was Abida Ruqayyah Khatun. His ancestor Saiyid Shahadat Ali was an Arab who came to Bengal to propagate the religion of Islam. Shahadat's son, Saiyid Abdullah was appointed the chief qadi of Jafarpur by the emperor of Delhi and was invested with the title of \\"Mir Insaaf\\" (Prince of Justice). The family claimed descent from Ali, the fourth caliph of Islam. Titumir's education began in his village school, after which he moved to a local madrassa. By the time he was 18 years of age, he had become a hafiz of the Qur'an and a scholar of the hadith and Muslim traditions. He was also accomplished with the Bengali, Arabic, and Persian languages. According to John Russell Colvin, a British civil servant in India, Titumir had a varied career progressing from a peasant, to possibly a leader of a robber gang, to a wrestler in Kolkota, to an enforcer of a zamindar which landed him in the jail of the East India Company. Upon his release, in 1822, he visited Mecca for the Hajj pilgrimage, where he met Syed Ahmad Barelvi and returned as a Wahabi Islamic preacher with the Tariqah-i-Muhammadiya movement. ==Religious and political activism== Upon his return from Mecca in 1827, Titumir started preaching among the Muslims of 24 Parganas and Nadia. He preached against practicing shirk traditions (such as lighting candles or worshiping dargah), and engaging in bidah (innovation). He also preached the wearing of beards with trimmed moustaches for men, and burqas for women. At that time, he commenced organizing the people of his native village against the landlords or zamindars. === Confrontations with the zamindars === Titumir opposed a number of discriminatory measures in force at that time which included taxes on mosques and the wearing of beards. Titumir filed a complaint to the East India Company against the oppression by the zamindars, but to no result. This brought him into conflict with the zamindars Krishnadeva Rai of Purha, Kaliprasanna Mukhopadhyay of Gobardanga, Rajnarayan of Taragonia, Gauri Prasad Chowdhury of Nagpur and Devanath Rai of Gobra- Govindpur. Titumir had himself belonged to a \\"peyada\\" or martial family and himself had served under a zamindar as a or , a fighter with a quarterstaff or lathi, (which in Bengal is made of bamboo, not wood) and he trained his men in hand-to-hand combat and the use of the lathi. Titumir formed a \\"Mujahid\\" consisting of '. The increasing strength of Titumir alarmed the zamindars who attempted to involve the British in their fight against him. Being instigated by the Zamindar of Gobardanga, Davis, the English (factor) of Mollahati, advanced with his force against Titumir, but were routed. He fought against the local zamindar, Krishna Dev Roy, who fearing his growing forces, took help of the British to attack Titumir's followers. === Confrontations with the British === The followers of Titumir, believed to have grown to 15,000 by that time, readied themselves for armed conflict, and built a fort of bamboo at Narikelbaria, near the town of Barasat. This was surrounded by a high double curtain wall of bamboo stakes filled in with mud cladding and sun-baked bricks. Titumir declared independence from the British, and regions comprising the current districts of 24 Parganas, Nadia and Faridpur came under his control. The private armies of the zamindars and the forces of the British met with a series of defeats at the hands of his men as a result of his strike- and-retreat guerrilla tactics. Finally, the British forces, led by Lieutenant Colonel Stewart consisting of 100 cavalry, 300 native infantry and artillery with two cannons, mounted a concerted attacks on 19 November 1831, on Titumir and his followers. Armed with nothing more than the bamboo quarterstaff and lathi and a few swords and spears, Titumir and his forces could not withstand the might of modern weapons, and were overwhelmed. The bamboo castle was destroyed, and Titumir was killed along with several of his followers. The commanding officer of the British forces noted his opponent's bravery in dispatches, and also commented on the strength and resilience of bamboo as a material for fortification, since he had had to pound it with artillery for a surprisingly long time before it gave way. After a long-drawn trial, Golam Rasul, Titumir's nephew and second in command was hanged and some 350 others were sentenced to transportation for life. ==Legacy== Titumir has been a source of inspiration in the liberation for the people of Bangladesh. In 2004, Titumir was ranked number 11 in BBC's poll of the Greatest Bengali of all time.— — — In Dhaka, Jinnah College was renamed to Government Titumir College in 1971. Titu Mir Hall is also a dormitory of Dhaka's Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. Bangladesh Navy has its principal base in Khulna named after him as 'BNS Titumir'. An intercity train, Titumir Express runs between Rajshahi and Chilahati. On 19 November 1992, the Government of Bangladesh issued a commemorative stamp honouring Titumir on the 161st anniversary of his death. === In popular culture === Mahasweta Devi wrote a novella called Titumir. A play named Titu Mir-er Basher Kella has been made for TV in Bangladesh. It has also featured as a theme for Puja pandals which are often done up as historical tableaux. ==References== ==Further reading== * Titumirer Bansher Kella (Bamboo Fort of Titumir, 1981) by Rabeya Khatun Category:Indian revolutionaries Category:Rebellions in India Category:History of Bangladesh Category:Bengali people Category:Bengali Muslims Category:Indian Muslims Category:History of Bengal Category:People from North 24 Parganas district Category:1782 births Category:1831 deaths ","title":"Titumir"},{"id":"1275629","text":"The at the Battle of the Nile, by Louis Lebreton.

Battle ensign of the Imperial Japanese Navy. A battle ensign is the name given to a large war ensign (flag) hoisted on a warship's mast just before going into battle. In what could become a very confusing situation with thick clouds of gunsmoke the ensign gave additional identification, hence their large size, which for the Royal Navy in the 17th and 18th centuries was about . It was commonly accepted that so long as a ship flew its ensign it was an active participant in battle; prior to action it was an acceptable ruse to fly a false flag. If a ship surrendered then it would take down its ensign (which was known as striking the colors). This is also the origin of the phrase \\"To nail one's colours to the mast\\", showing a determination to fight on and never surrender. In practice, warships would fly more than one battle ensign, so that if the flag was destroyed or brought down during the fighting there would be no confusion. Conversely, keeping the flag flying even though the ship might appear to be past fighting was a sign of determination rather than foolishness. The German battleship Bismarck continued to fly its battle ensign even after all its gun batteries had been silenced by British shells, and sank with the ensign still flying. The battle ensign was seen as an important element for the morale of the crew and was held in high regard. If a warship was sinking and had to be abandoned, flags such as the battle ensigns would be taken off the ship before it sank and were entrusted to the senior (surviving) officer. Some countries use their national flag as the battle ensign, while others use their naval ensign. Sometimes unique flags were made and used as battle ensigns, for example the one flown by United States Naval Forces at the Battle of Lake Erie in the War of 1812. The battle ensign is sometimes also flown by U.S. Navy warships as a courtesy when entering or leaving foreign ports, or on national holidays when it is referred to as \\"Holiday Colors.\\"U.S. Navy Flag Usage and Ceremonies Seaflags.

According to the , it has a population of people. The town, is located at the north-eastern part of Laguna, From Manila it can reach Municipality of Paete Passing through Rizal Province via Manila East Road or Via Slex. Along the shores of picturesque Laguna de Bay. It was founded in 1580 by Spanish friars Juan de Plasencia and Diego de Oropesa of the Franciscan Order. It is believed that the earliest inhabitants were of Malay lineage, coming all the way from Borneo in their swift and sturdy boats called \\"Balangay\\". ==Etymology== The name of Paete is derived from the Tagalog word paet, which means chisel. The proper pronunciation of the town's name is believed to be \\"Pa-e-te\\", but the natives call it Pī-té, long i, short guttural ê, sound at the end. The town's residents use the first mentioned pronunciation rather than the second only when conversing with non-residents. The town was referred to as \\"Piety\\" by the American Maryknoll Missioners when they came to the town in the late 1950s. ==History== ===Pre-Spanish Era=== Before the Spaniards came, Paete was said to be a village under Gat Lakampawid, a native ruler from the ancient village of Lihan, a relative to Gatmaitim, Gat Silayan, Gat Pakil, the rulers of old town of Pakil. These native rulers from Old Lihan (now Malolos, Bulacan) was scattered along the suburbs of Kingdom of Tondo in the south and settled there. The Spanish friars had a tradition of naming towns they built in honor of saints. Paete was an exception. Legend has it that there was once a young Franciscan priest who was tasked by his superior to visit their newly founded settlements alongside Laguna de Bay. The priest knew little about the terrain so he asked a native the name of the place. The latter misinterpreted the young friar, thinking that the former wanted to know the name of the tool he was using. He answered, Paét (chisel), thus, the name Paete. Sargento Mayor Juan de Salcedo was the first Spaniard to set foot in Paete. He was on his way to explore the gold-rich region of Paracale in Bicol. His men first encountered some resistance from the settlers of what is now Cainta in Rizal Province, but as expected, easily defeated the lightly armed natives. Then he ventured to the lakeside barangays of Laguna de Bay on his way to Bicol. ===Spanish Colonial Era=== Around 1580, Paete was established as a pueblo by the Friars. Juan de Plasencia and Diego Oropesa. Due to a death of the prior of Paete at that time, Paete was annexed to the Convent of Lumban. Then in 1600, Paete became a barrio of Pangil. In 1602, Paete became independent town having its own convent and was christened Pueblo de San Lorenzo in honor of the town's first patron saint. The pueblo consisted not only of Paete, but included the neighboring towns of Pakil, San Antonio, Longos and Kalayaan. In 1671, Fray Francisco Soller reenacted the Via Crucis to resuscitate the people's waning faith. He carried a cross from the town proper up to Mt. Ping- as in Pakil. In 1676, when Pakil became a separate pueblo, the townspeople of Paete wanted crosses of their own, so they built and located them in sitio Santa Ana, and named the site Tatlong Krus (Three Crosses). Paete regained its full township status only in 1850. ===American Colonial Era=== In 1899, American forces launched the Laguna campaign to subjugate the whole province and squelch insurrection. On the last leg of the campaign on April 12, an American battalion of 200 men invaded Paete but met strong resistance from an inexperienced force of less than 50 men. The town was subdued but it proved to be a costly battle for the Americans. ===World War II and Japanese Occupation=== In 1942, Japanese troops occupied Paete, local recognized guerrillas and ongoing troops under the Philippine Commonwealth Army units were sieges and conflicts in Paete was fought against the Imperial Japanese military and local collaborators from 1942 to 1944 until retreat by local guerrillas from the Japanese hands. In 1945, combined Filipino and American soldiers, as well as recognized guerrillas liberated Paete and defeat by the Japanese and ended in World War II. ==Barangays== Paete is politically subdivided into 9 barangays: *Barangay 1 - Ibaba del Sur *Barangay 2 - Maytoong *Barangay 3 - Ermita *Barangay 4 - Quinale *Barangay 5 - Ilaya del Sur *Barangay 6 - Ilaya del Norte *Barangay 7 - Bagumbayan *Barangay 8 - Bangkusay *Barangay 9 - Ibaba del Norte ==Climate== ==Demographics== In the , the population of Paete was people, with a density of . ===Religion=== Saint James the Apostle Parish Church simply known as Paete Church The only Catholic Church in the town is the Saint James the Apostle Parish Church which was first built in 1646. Paete is also a pilgrimage site. One of the primary products of the town's woodcarving industry are carving of pu-on or images of saints. The town's patron saint is St. James the Apostle, also known as St. James the Great. Residents celebrate his feastday every 25 July. The 1st Patron Saint of Paete is St. Lawrence, the deacon. St. Anthony the Abbot is a secondary patron of the town and his feast is celebrated by the townsfolk every January 17. The patron has a stone chapel locally known as Ermita as a shrine dedicated to him. There is a town legend related to the saint where a town native sneaked in the chapel during a conflagration and took a statue the St. Anthony to bathe it in the river. Following this, it began to rain and the fire was extinguished, an event considered as a miracle by the townsfolk. ==Economy== Wood carving shop in Paete The town has had a long reputation for its craftsmen highly skilled in wood carving and its embellishment. In 1887, José Rizal described Paete as a town where \\"carpenter shops\\" were issuing images \\"even those more rudely carved\\" (chapter VI, Noli Me Tangere). Even now, its inhabitants (called Paeteños or Paetenians) continue with their centuries-old tradition in carving and painting. Its statues, pulpits, murals and bas relief are found in churches, palaces and museums all over the world, including the St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York, the Mission Dolorosa in San Francisco, the San Cayetano Church in Mexico, the St. Joseph's shrine in Santa Cruz, California, various churches in the Philippines and the Ayala Museum in Makati, Philippines. The official town hero is not a statesman nor a soldier but a woodcarver, the master artisan Mariano Madriñan, whose obra maestra, the lifelike Mater Dolorosa, was honored by the King of Spain with a prestigious award in Amsterdam in 1882. The town was proclaimed \\"the Carving Capital of the Philippines\\" on March 15, 2005 by Philippine President Arroyo. It is also believed that the modern yo-yo, which originated in the Philippines, was invented in Paete.Pruden, Marie Cagahastian Castillo. About Paete: April 1999 Many descendants of these artisans have found a niche in the culinary world. Ice sculptures and fruit and vegetable carvings done by Paeteños abound on buffet tables of cruise ships and world- class hotels and restaurants. Today the town thrives mainly on the sale and export of woodcarvings and taka (papier maché), tourism, poultry industry, farming and fishing. ==See also== * Battle of Paete * Tatlong Krus (Paete, Laguna) * J.

The village itself lies 1.5 miles (2.4 km) north from Uckfield; the nearby villages of Nutley and Fairwarp; and the smaller settlements of Duddleswell and Horney Common; and parts of Ashdown Forest all lie within Maresfield parish. ==History== The origin of name of the village is uncertain, but the first element may derive from the Old English word mere meaning 'pool'; the second element is certainly feld meaning 'open land' (A. Mawer, The place-names of Sussex volume 2, page 349). Iron has also played an important role in the history of the area, during the time when the Wealden iron industry was flourishing. Within 2 miles (3 km) of Maresfield Church in the 16th century were five iron furnaces: Oldlands, Hendall, Old Forge, Lower Marshalls and Maresfield (powder mills). The Levett family owned and worked Oldlands, and it probably controlled Hendall as well, before it passed into the hands of Ralph Hogge, who formerly worked for the Levett family. Among families long resident in the Maresfield area with historic ties to the old iron industry were the families of Levett, Pope and Chaloner, who had intermarried. William Levett of Buxted, a vicar who was a prime mover behind the iron industry in the Weald, had ties to the Maresfield area during his tenure as an ironmaster and supplier of armaments to Henry VIII. Eventually the vicar's former servant Ralph Hogge, who had become a major ironmaster after Levett's death, operated four furnaces and one or more forges within a couple of miles of Maresfield Church. The village has expanded in the past twenty years, and three substantial housing developments have helped to increase the village population. Maresfield is an old village (its church was founded in approx 1100; the present nave and tower were built between 1375 and 1415). Fairwarp and Nutley developed as offshoots from it. There was a Roman settlement, including a bloomery, and later a Norman village grew up around the church. In the 15th and 16th centuries ===Manor=== Maresfield Park, watercolour by Benjamin Dean Wyatt (1775–1850) Until 1926, it was a largely agricultural village, up to 1914 effectively in the ownership and control of the family in Maresfield Park House, initially the Shelley family and then Count Alexander Münster of Hanover, Germany. The estate was confiscated in 1914 by the government after the start of World War I and the Park and estate houses were sold off in 1924 as reparation for war damage, the Park being broken up into housing plots. In the First World War, a large army camp was developed, and later on parts of the village, at Queen's Drive and the southern part of Parklands, were developed as married quarters for soldiers. ==Development== There has been considerable recent development. Since approx 1990, substantial developments at the Cabin Café (now Mulberry Park), Park Farm (now The Paddock, Field End and Maple Close) and at Forest Park have increased the population of the village by about 1/3rd. New development of 80 dwellings is planned for Park Farm, which will further enlarge the village by about 1/6th. ==Governance== There are 14 members on the Maresfield Parish Council, which has its offices in Nutley. ==Geography== Maresfield is on the southern edge of Ashdown Forest which was a deer hunting reserve from the time of King Edward II of England. The Site of Special Scientific Interest Rock Wood falls within the parish. This woodland is of biological interest, with uncommon mosses and ferns growing alongside the stream which flows through the site. ===Nutley=== Nutley is a village on the main road (A22) north of Maresfield. It has its own church, dedicated to St James the Less, although the benefice is combined with Maresfield. ===Fairwarp=== Fairwarp is a small village directly north of Maresfield. The church is Christ Church. ==Transport== The parish lies at the junction of two main roads: the A22 Eastbourne road; and the A272 cross-country road, the main road being on a bypass to the west of the village. There are two local bus services 31, 256 that provide a local connection to surrounding areas. ==Sport and leisure== Maresfield has a local tennis club, cricket club, bowls club, football club and a gymnastics club all located in less than one mile radius of the Chequers Inn, Maresfield also has its own fishing lake 'Underhill Fishing Lake' and is managed by Crowborough and District Anglers Association. ==Education== Maresfield has its own primary school in Bonners CE Primary School, although some children travel to Manor Primary School in Uckfield. Secondary school children travel into Uckfield College or Chailey School. ==Conservation== The Constitution of Maresfield Conservation Group, which is a Registered Charity, has as its aims the promotion of the conservation, protection and improvement of the physical and natural environment in Maresfield and the surrounding area. Presently the Group is involved in a very wide range of projects. ==Amenities== At the centre of the village is the 17th century Chequers Inn. and Maresfield church founded in approx 1100. There is also the Maresfield recreation ground, which is home to the 'Maresfield Cricket Club', which was established in 1756. ==References== ==Further reading== *The Queen's Gunstonemaker: An Account of Ralph Hogge, Elizabethan Ironmaster & Gunfounder, Edmund Teesdale, Lindel Publishing Company, Seaford, Sussex, 1984 ==External links== Category:Villages in East Sussex Category:Civil parishes in East Sussex Category:Wealden ","title":"Maresfield"},{"id":"1275697","text":"Nottoway Correctional Center is an all-male state prison in Burkeville, Nottoway County, Virginia, USA.

He was famously the nephew of Maeda Toshiie and Maeda Matsu. In legends and fictions, he is one of the most celebrated kabukimono (wild men) of the time period who is known for his monstrous height and his peerless strength. Toshimasu's horse and companion, Matsukaze, was one of the most famous warhorses in Japan. ==Biography== Toshimasu was born in the village of Arako (present-day Nakagawa-ku, Nagoya), Toshimasu was born to the Takigawa Clan, originally the son of Takigawa Kazumasu. He was adopted by Maeda Toshihisa, the older brother of Maeda Toshiie. Toshimasu served under Oda Nobunaga along with his uncle. Toshimasu was originally intended to inherit Maeda family headship; however, after Oda Nobunaga replaced Toshihisa with Toshiie as Maeda family head, he lost this position. Perhaps because of this loss of inheritance, Toshimasu is well known for quarreling with his uncle. In 1581, Toshimasu was under the command of his uncle, and made a reputation for himself through conflicts within Noto Province and was rewarded with 5,000 koku. During the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute three years later, Toshimasu came to Sassa Narimasa's rescue when he was attacked at Suemori Castle. He continued to help his uncle in the Siege of Odawara Castle. When Maeda Toshihisa passed away in 1587, Toshimasu sent his son into the Maeda family's service. Either after Toshihisa's death or in 1590, relations between him and Toshiie grew sour. He fled from the Maeda family without taking his wife or child. After his escape, he resided in Kyoto. While in Kyoto, Toshimasu met and befriended Naoe Kanetsugu. The two became close friends, and Toshimasu agreed to join Kanetsugu at Sekigahara Campaign, in the Uesugi clan's invasion of Aizu, later in 1600, at Siege of Hasedō Uesugi failed and Toshimasu was appointed to lead the rear guard during the retreat. Riding his horse \\"Matsukaze\\" into battle and brandishing a two-pronged spear, he made a splendid show of force. Due in part to Toshimasu's actions, the Uesugi forces were able to retreat largely intact. After this, Toshimasu returned to the capital and devoted himself to arts and literature. Keiji was barred from Toyotomi's Kyushu campaign for his wild ways. When the Tokugawa challenged the Uesugi in 1600, he once again fought with Uesugi’s army. In the battle against the Mogami, legend says he broke through the enemy lines with only eight riders, and shattered their formation. After the Uesugi clan's move to the Yonezawa Domain, Toshimasu remained as a retainer and spent half retired life at Mukuan(Toshimasu\`s fortified residence). Toshimasu Maeda's armor Keiji's armor can still be seen today at the Miyasaka Museum. ==Matsukaze== Matsukaze (\\"wind in the pines\\") was Toshimasu's famous mount. According to the legend, he was bred of only the finest horses, but he refused to let anyone ride him and eventually ran away. Toshimasu managed to tame the wild horse, possibly due to Toshimasu's own wild personality. Since then, the two were never seen apart. Matsukaze was said to be a horse of immense strength, able to carry his master's large frame for days. Supposedly, Matsukaze ran away after his master's death, never seen again. == Depictions in fiction == Toshimasu is a playable character from the Western Army in the original Kessen and in the Samurai Warriors, Warriors Orochi under the name Keiji. He is also playable in Sengoku BASARA series, as Maeda Keiji. Keiji is voiced by Masakazu Morita in Japanese. In English, Matthew Mercer voiced Toshimasu in Sengoku Basara: Samurai Heroes while Eric Vale voiced him in the anime adaptions. He is a playable character in Pokémon Conquest (Pokémon + Nobunaga's Ambition in Japan), with his partner Pokémon being Bastiodon and Terrakion.

The company was founded in 2000 by former City of London options traders Robert Byrne and Kevin Griffiths. Sporting Options went into administration on 15 November 2004 amid allegations of criminal wrongdoing. Industry leader Betfair stepped in with a rescue package. ==Cause of collapse== Sporting Options appeared to be matching bets worth up to 15% of those matched at Betfair. But it was alleged the turnover was being financed by the owners of Sporting Options using their own funds to create the liquidity. By late 2004, it was alleged Sporting Options was in fact fraudulently financing its apparent liquidity by using funds from its own clients' account. On 15 November 2004 administrators were called in. By 8 December the administrators had determined that the company owed £3.6 million to its clients, but held only minimal funds in the clients' account. ==Betfair rescue package== Soon after Sporting Options went into administration, Betfair announced a rescue package to compensate the 5,342 Sporting Options clients who had lost money. The clients affected were required to register as customers of Betfair to be eligible. Each qualifying client owed less than £1,000 was compensated for the full amount owing (in the form of a credit to his or her Betfair account). Those owed more than £1,000 received either £1,000 or 20 per cent of their Sporting Options account balance, whichever was greater. Any amount owing over and above this payout could be earned back though a commission rebate program, valid through to 30 November 2006. Some speculated that Betfair's apparent act of generosity was a bid to protect the reputation of the betting exchange industry, while simultaneously securing exclusive access to Sporting Options' clients. Betfair and most other exchanges have stressed their clients' funds are ring-fenced to ensure the exchanges' financial integrity. ==References== *Silicon.com - WebWatch, November 16, 2004: Betfair to bail out Sporting Options punters - Rescue package launched after firm goes to the wall *BBC news, 15 June, 2003 The gamble that paid off *The Register, April 5, 2004: Extortionists take out UK gambling site * BBC News, 16 June, 2003, Internet betting cleans up its act *Daily Telegraph, 17 November 2004: Punters face bet exchange 'black hole'.

He was a Liberal member of the Victorian Legislative Council from 1992 until 2006, representing Waverley Province. A former teacher and trade unionist, he was a backbencher for about half of his career. The other half was spent as Chairman of the Drugs and Crime Prevention Committee 1996-99 and Chairman of the prestigious Road Safety Committee from 1999–2002. He served two years as Shadow Cabinet Secretary in an understaffed shadow ministry from 2002- 2004. He did not contest the 2006 state election, having a long-standing belief that political parties need to regenerate. Brideson was born in the Melbourne suburb of Brighton, and studied at Bentleigh and McKinnon High Schools. He studied teaching at Frankston Teachers College and the Hawthorn Institute of Education, and occupied teaching positions at various rural schools in the West Gippsland and Wimmera regions between 1964 and 1975. In 1976, he was promoted to the position of deputy principal, and worked in this position in a number of schools. During his teaching career, Brideson had been an active trade unionist in both the Teachers Association of Australia and Victorian Affiliated Teachers Federation, and at the end of the 1983 school year, took up positions heading both organisations. In a rare move for a unionist, Brideson acted as an advisor to several shadow ministers in the conservative Liberal Party state opposition of the time. He was an active participant in the Victorian Trades Hall Council and was a delegate at ACTU conferences. He led the Victorian organisation until his move into politics in October 1992. In the leadup to the 1992 state election, Brideson succeeded in obtaining Liberal preselection for the seat of Waverley Province which was held by the Labor Party. In his first six-year term, he served on the Public Bodies Review Committee (1992–1996).He also served as the parliamentary representative on the Monash University Council from 1997. However, he was overlooked for a ministerial position in Jeff Kennett's Liberal government. He was re-elected at the 1999 election, which saw the Liberal Party lose power to the Labor Party under Steve Bracks, but was subsequently appointed Chairman of the Road Safety Committee regardless. In this way, he headed an inquiry that aimed to bring down the number of road deaths, after it had reached its highest number for several years. Though his term was for the most part relatively uneventful, Brideson was involved in a minor scandal in 2001 when he was accused of plagiarising parts of a parliamentary report by taking slabs of material directly from the internet. Brideson did not face election in 2002, which saw the Liberal opposition defeated in a landslide, which saw the other Liberal member for Waverley Province lose their seat, as well as several shadow members. The devastating loss opened up numerous shadow ministerial positions, and Brideson was given the portfolios of scrutiny of government and waste watch and appointed as the Secretary to the Shadow Cabinet. He was a relatively low-profile figure in these roles, however, and received far less attention than his predecessor, David Davis. He subsequently lost the first two positions to younger MLC Richard Dalla-Riva in January 2004, though he remained Secretary to the Shadow Cabinet without portfolio for the remainder of his career. Brideson kept a particularly low profile after his demotion, and rumors of his impending retirement began circulating in late 2004. On 11 March 2005, Brideson became the second Liberal frontbencher to announce publicly that he would not be contesting his seat at the 2006 state election. He also suggested that other older Liberal MPs should consider stepping down at the election. ==References== # \\"MP defends report on $23,000 study trip.\\", Australian Associated Press, 7 December 2001. # \\"Fourth Vic Liberal announces retirement\\", ABC News, 18 March 2005.

He is referred to as a King, but makes it perfectly clear that he is a very minor king of a tiny kingdom at best, much less important than the High King who is the ruler of Prydain. His kingdom is described as being dreary and dull. As a result, he often leaves it to go wandering about as the world's most unofficial bard in the mystical land of Prydain. Though he returns from time to time to rule, he once mentions that he gets the feeling that the people of his country get along just fine even if he is not there. == Character description == Fflewddur is described as a tall, thin man with spiky blonde hair, although in the Disney film The Black Cauldron he is depicted as a white-haired older man, semi-lanky, with a bit of a pot belly. The Disney version of Fflewddur has apparently been stripped of his royalty, or at least it never gets mentioned, and is the object of intense, disturbing attraction from the overweight enchantress Orwen, one of the witches of Morva (especially when he repeatedly rejects the advances of Orwen the witch). However, Fflewddur stands up to the witches so that they can revive Gurgi at the end of the film. (The reason why Taran wants to trade the Cauldron for Gurgi is that he never needs a sword to be a hero.) He is voiced by Nigel Hawthorne. In the film and the novels, one of the witches of Morva, Orwen, has a soft spot for Fflewddur. Fflewddur becomes increasingly frustrated with Orwen's insistence they marry and repeatedly rejects her advances because he knows his companions Taran and Eilonwy are more important than being involved with the three witches of Morva. Fflewddur Fflam is a good-hearted soul, much less interested in the pomp and circumstance of his role than in doing right--if children wander into his throne room, he'd far rather play hide-and-seek with them than chase them out. Inside, though, he has the heart of a bard; he is restless and prone to wanderlust, and in fact he is mostly met more or less accidentally on one on his wanderings. His catchphrase is \\"Great Belin!\\" Alexander has indicated that he modeled Fflewddur Fflam partly after himself: \\"Rumor has is that we have very similar personalities. I will neither confirm nor deny that\\".\\"A Visit With Lloyd Alexander\\" Despite his bard training and the use of a magical harp, Fflewddur has a distinct manaphobia (fear of magic), and is especially fearful about what he considers \\"black magic\\". He steadfastly refuses even to look at magic things unless they have proven themselves to be harmless (like Eilonwy's Pelydryn) or are bardic in nature (his own harp and Adaon's brooch). == Character history == After obtaining a harp and practicing, Fflewddur set out for Caer Dathyl, the seat of the High King and Chief Bard Taliesin, hoping to be admitted. Unfortunately, his tests did not go at all well. However, the Chief Bard took pity on him and offered him a wonderful gift in the form of a magical harp that \\"almost plays itself,\\" in Fflewddur Fflam's delighted words. Unfortunately, the harp has a flaw: Every time Fflewddur Fflam stretches the truth, a string will snap on the harp. This happens often, for he is frequently inclined to \\"add a little color to the facts. They need them so badly.\\" Fflewddur's penchant for theatrical exaggeration ensures that he spends more time mending the harp than playing it; even so, he is able to make beautiful music when he is called upon to do so (or whenever he feels in the mood). Alexander has said that this property of Fflewddur's harp had been inspired by a harp in his possession whose strings kept breaking because of temperature changes.\\"A Visit With Lloyd Alexander\\" At the end of The Book of Three, Fflewddur is rewarded for his services with a single magical harp string that will not break, no matter how outrageously he lies.The Book of Three Fflewddur Fflam meets the hero of the series, Taran, and Princess Eilonwy at Spiral Castle, the home of Queen Achren. Purportedly having no ear for music, Achren imprisoned him in her dungeons, where Eilonwy mistakenly frees him on Taran's request. The three become good friends and end up sharing many adventures together. Besides his harp, Fflewddur Fflam has another unique possession, if it may be called that, in the form of a giant mountain cat named Llyan, easily big enough to ride as a horse. Llyan was enlarged by a series of potions force-fed to her by Glew, an unsuccessful would-be wizard turned giant by the same potion that made Llyan grow so large. Llyan loves Fflewddur Fflam's harp music; it is often the only thing that can calm her when she is agitated. In The High King, Fflewddur shows his courage by accompanying Taran, Eilonwy, Gurgi, Doli, and the Commot Folk to hold back the Cauldron Born and infiltrate Annuvin. When the group is in danger of death from the cold, he breaks his enchanted harp and has Doli set it on fire to warm them. Because of the magic of the harp, the fire burns long and warm. When it finally goes out, all that is left is the magical unbreakable string. At the end of The High King, Fflewddur is told he must leave Prydain for the Summer Country as he is (distantly) related to the Sons of Don. Though Fflewddur is reluctant to leave, he is assured that Llyan will remain with him and that he will be given a new harp, with strings that won't break. Before leaving, he gives the last piece of his enchanted harp to Taran: the unbreakable magical string he had received in The Book of Three.The High King As with many other characters in the Chronicles, Fflewddur Fflam is based on a character in the Mabinogion, a collection of Welsh legends. Fflewddur Fflam is mentioned in two of the legends as a prince at King Arthur's court, but little else is revealed about him.The Prydain companion: a reference guide to Lloyd Alexander's Prydain chronicles by Michael O.

More specifically, Prydain may refer to the Brittonic parts of the island; that is, the parts south of Caledonia. This distinction appears to derive from Roman times, when the island was divided into Roman Britain to the south and the land of the Caledonians to the North. The peoples north of the Roman borders eventually came to be known as the Picts (Welsh: Brithwyr); the Welsh term for Pictland was Prydyn, which caused some confusion in the texts with Prydain. In Middle Welsh texts, the related term Ynys Prydein (Island of Britain), or Ynys Brydein, can also refer to the island (ynys) itself but more often is a name for the Brittonic territories south of Caledonia. It is in this context that the name of the collection of traditional material arranged in triads known as Trioedd Ynys Prydein should be understood. In modern Welsh ynys means 'island', but in Middle Welsh it can also mean 'land' or 'realm' (cf. Latin insula).Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru, vol. IV, p. 3819. There are numerous other instances of the term Prydain in medieval Welsh texts. One of the best known is found in the title of the 10th century vaticinatory poem Armes Prydein ('The Prophecy of Britain').Ifor Williams (ed.), Armes Prydein (University of Wales Press, 1955). ==In popular culture== Prydain is also used by Lloyd Alexander as the name for the realm in which his fantasy book series The Chronicles of Prydain takes place.McNary, Dave. \\"'Chronicles of Prydain' Movie in the Works at Disney (EXCLUSIVE)\\", Variety, 17 March 2016.

Barbiturate comas are used to protect the brain during major neurosurgery, as a last line of treatment in certain cases of status epilepticus that have not responded to other treatments, and in refractory intracranial hypertension following traumatic brain injury. Induced coma was a feature of the Milwaukee protocol, a now-discredited method that was promoted as a means of treating rabies infection in people. Induced coma usually results in significant systemic adverse effects. The patient is likely to completely lose respiratory drive and require mechanical ventilation. Gut motility is reduced. Hypotension can complicate efforts to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure and often requires the use of vasopressor drugs. Hypokalemia often results. The completely immobile patient is at increased risk of bed sores as well as infection from indwelling lines. == Theory == Barbiturates reduce the metabolic rate of brain tissue, as well as the cerebral blood flow. With these reductions, the blood vessels in the brain narrow, decreasing the amount of space occupied by the brain, and hence the intracranial pressure. The hope is that, with the swelling relieved, the pressure decreases and some or all brain damage may be averted. Several studies have supported this theory by showing reduced mortality when treating refractory intracranial hypertension with a barbiturate coma. About 60% of the glucose and oxygen used by the brain is meant for its electrical activity and the rest for all other activities such as metabolism. When barbiturates are given to brain injured patients for induced coma, they act by reducing the electrical activity of the brain, which reduces the metabolic and oxygen demand. The infusion dose rate of barbiturates is increased under monitoring by electroencephalography until burst suppression or cortical electrical silence (isoelectric \\"flatline\\") is attained. Once there is improvement in the patient's general condition, the barbiturates are withdrawn gradually and the patient regains consciousness. Controversy exists over the benefits of using barbiturates to control intracranial hypertension. Some studies have shown that barbiturate-induced coma can reduce intracranial hypertension but does not necessarily prevent brain damage. Furthermore, the reduction in intracranial hypertension may not be sustained. Some randomized trials have failed to demonstrate any survival or morbidity benefit of induced coma in diverse conditions such as neurosurgical operations, head trauma, intracranial aneurysm rupture, intracranial hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, and status epilepticus. If the patient survives, cognitive impairment may also follow recovery from the coma. == See also == * Insulin shock therapy * Traumatic brain injury == References == Category:Neurology procedures Category:Intensive care medicine Category:Coma ","title":"Induced coma"},{"id":"1275751","text":"Blaine Lee Pardoe is an American author, known primarily for writing the Battletech and MechWarrior: Dark Age series of science fiction books, business management books, military history works on a number of Great War topics, and true crime works.

Its land area consists of two non-contiguous parts, separated by Laguna de Bay. ==History== The land from Punta Inuod to Guinabihan, Banilan is where the first settlers Gat Maitan and his wife Panumbalihan, and Gat Silayan Maginto and his wife Potongan first established themselves. After a series of raids by pirates and marauders, they moved to the present site of Poblacion, leaving behind Chief Maginoong Dalaga who ruled the place. This account explains why Pakil has two territories on the eastern and western sides of the lake. Gat Maitan and Gat Silayan are one of the borne-leaders from the ancient town of Malolos which was called by pre- colonial Chinese traders from Fujian as \\"Lihan\\" where Gats and Lacandolas abundantly reside along the shores of Manila Bay under the Kingdom of Tondo. Gat Silayan actually is one of the members of the ruling clan of Lihan whose names bearing prefix \\"gat\\" a royal title. Every member of the clan in Malolos called \\"Gat\\", and it became \\"Gatchalian\\", Gatmaitan, together with Lakandula and Gatbonton at the course of timehttp://www.elaput.org/pinsika3.htm When the Spaniard Conquistador together with the Augustinians stationed at Bay came to the place in 1571, this colony was under the leadership of Gat Paquil, a descendant of Gat Maitan whose name was used to name the settlement as \\"Paquil\\", which remained during the whole Spanish Regime and early part of the American period. It was changed to \\"Pakil\\" by Executive Order No. 77 in 1927. When the Franciscan missionaries came in 1578 Order of Friars Minor (OFM) Pakil was attached to Paete in 1602 as its \\"visita\\". Padre Francisco Barajas, made efforts to separate this town from Paete, and Don Diego Jorge became the first Capitan Municipal or Gobernadorcillo on May 12, 1676 and finally Pakil was named as an independent town with the administration of \\"Capitan Municipal\\" at the helm of the local colonial government, the last of whom was Capitan Municipal Don Nicolas Regalado. With the change of government from Spanish to American upon the total Occupation of the United States in the Philippines after the defeat of the Filipino Forces in Philippine -American War of 1898-1900, the Americans had to reorganize the pattern of the Civil Government in the country in 1901. It was Bernardo Gonzales was appointed the first Municipal President (Presidente Municipal) under American Period until November 25, 1903. Upon this reorganization, the Public Law No. 1009, of the Philippine Commission, the town of Pakil was merged with Pangil in order to reduce the number of existing towns whereas the weak towns to be merged with the stable one for the stabilization of local economy due to the damages of the previous wars. After nineteen years, On October 1, 1927, by virtue of Executive Order No. 77, Pakil was re-established into town thus the Municipality of Pakil was restored. ==Japanese occupation of the Philippines== The Japanese occupation of the Philippines (Filipino: Pananakop ng mga Hapones sa Pilipinas; Japanese: 日本のフィリピン占領; Hepburn: Nihon no Firipin Senryō) occurred between 1942 and 1945, when Imperial Japan occupied the Commonwealth of the Philippines during World War II. The invasion of the Philippines started on 8 December 1941, ten hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor. As at Pearl Harbor, American aircraft were severely damaged in the initial Japanese attack. Lacking air cover, the American Asiatic Fleet in the Philippines withdrew to Java on 12 December 1941. General Douglas MacArthur was ordered out, leaving his men at Corregidor on the night of 11 March 1942 for Australia, 4,000 km away. The 76,000 starving and sick American and Filipino defenders in Bataan surrendered on 9 April 1942, and were forced to endure the infamous Bataan Death March on which 7,000–10,000 died or were murdered. The 13,000 survivors on Corregidor surrendered on 6 May. Japan occupied the Philippines for over three years, until the surrender of Japan. A highly effective guerilla campaign by Philippine resistance forces controlled sixty percent of the islands, mostly jungle and mountain areas. MacArthur supplied them by submarine, and sent reinforcements and officers. Filipinos remained loyal to the United States, partly because of the American guarantee of independence, and also because the Japanese had pressed large numbers of Filipinos into work details and even put young Filipino women into brothels.[1] General MacArthur kept his promise to return to the Philippines on 20 October 1944. The landings on the island of Leyte were accompanied by a force of 700 vessels and 174,000 men. Through December 1944, the islands of Leyte and Mindoro were cleared of Japanese soldiers. During the campaign, the Imperial Japanese Army conducted a suicidal defense of the islands. Cities such as Manila were reduced to rubble. Around 500,000 Filipinos died during the Japanese Occupation Period.[2] In 1942, the Japanese troops occupied in Pakil, Laguna and in 1945, the liberated from the Philippine Commonwealth forces under the Philippine Army and Philippine Constabulary entering in Pakil, Laguna with the local recognized guerrillas against the Japanese forces during the Second World War. In 1954, the sitios known as Casa Real, Casinsin and Kabulusan were converted into barrios. Durado followed suit in 1957. ==Barangays== Pakil is politically subdivided into 13 barangays. * Baño (Poblacion) * Banilan * Burgos (Poblacion) * Casa Real * Casinsin * Dorado * Gonzales (Poblacion) * Kabulusan * Matikiw * Rizal (Poblacion) * Saray * Taft (Poblacion) * Tavera (Poblacion) ==Climate== ==Demographics== In the , the population of Pakil, Laguna, was people, with a density of . ==Cultural heritage== Music was formally initiated in the town of Pakil by San Pedro Bautista (1586) the Guardian of the Franciscan order. He established the only Music Academy in the country. The school started with 400 children from towns along the Laguna Bay. These students started as church choir members and were taught how to make musical instruments out of locally available materials like bamboo, cans, wood and coconut shells. These kids were called “Tiple” and they trained other younger children to become members of the church choir. The entire population became involved in teaching their youth to sing and play instruments. This tradition was handed down from generation to generation. The Adonay family influenced the spread of musical interest and helped form the first brass band in Pakil. The elderly Tacio Celis helped train children to read musical notes and play instruments. Since then, many young musicians finished college on scholarships by playing for their school bands. Currently Pakil Music Program is helping out young students to continue the rich musical heritage of the town. Pakil Music Program (PMP) is providing music education through note reading and instrument performances with the help of some retired musicians. The current executive director of the PMP is Mr. Roy Regalado. == St. Peter of Alcantara Parish == The St. Peter of Alcantara Parish, also the Diocesan Shrine of the Our Lady of Turumba is Pakil's Roman Catholic Church and home to the Our Lady of Sorrows de Turumba.

When the Maryknoll Fathers had to go to their mission in Davao, they ceded the leadership to the Maryknoll Sisters who subsequently changed the school's name into Maryknoll High School. Upon the termination of the mission of the Maryknoll Sisters in 1972, Bishop Pedro N. Bantigue invited the Augustinian Recollect Sisters to administer the school. The name was changed again to Mary Immaculate Academy by the Augustinian Recollect Sisters. In 1982, the school's name was changed to Liceo De Pakil by the Diocese of San Pablo. The first batch to graduate under Liceo de Pakil was the batch of 1983 graduating class. In 1986, the administration of the school was passed on to the Missionary Catechists of St. Therese (MCST). Liceo De Pakil is currently under the administration of the MCST and the Diocese of San Pablo.Citation needed ==Notable people== * Marcelo Adonay - major Philippine composer and church musician. * Danilo Echavaria Dalena - modern and contemporary painter. * Jun Regalado - one of the most prolific drummer in the Philippines. ==References== ==External links== * Pakil Profile at PhilAtlas.com * [ Philippine Standard Geographic Code] * Philippine Census Information * Local Governance Performance Management System Category:Municipalities of Laguna (province) Category:Populated places on Laguna de Bay Category:1676 establishments in the Spanish Empire Category:Populated places established in 1676 ","title":"Pakil"},{"id":"1275756","text":"Shiprock (, \\"rock with wings\\" or \\"winged rock\\") is a monadnock rising nearly above the high-desert plain of the Navajo Nation in San Juan County, New Mexico, United States. Its peak elevation is above sea level. It is about southwest of the town of Shiprock, which is named for the peak. Governed by the Navajo Nation, the formation is in the Four Corners region and plays a significant role in Navajo religion, myth, and tradition. It is located in the center of the area occupied by the Ancient Pueblo People, a prehistoric Native American culture of the Southwest United States often referred to as the Anasazi. Shiprock is a point of interest for rock climbers and photographers and has been featured in several film productions and novels. It is the most prominent landmark in northwestern New Mexico. In 1975, Shiprock was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service. ==Name== The Navajo name for the peak, , \\"rock with wings\\" or \\"winged rock\\", refers to the legend of the great bird that brought the Navajo from the north to their present lands. The name \\"Shiprock\\" or Shiprock Peak or Ship Rock derives from the peak's resemblance to an enormous 19th-century clipper ship. Americans first called the peak \\"The Needle\\", a name given to the topmost pinnacle by Captain J. F. McComb in 1860.Laurance D. Linford, Navajo Places: History, Legend, Landscape, University of Utah Press, Salt Lake City, 2000, , p. 264–265. United States Geological Survey maps indicate that the name \\"Ship Rock\\" dates from the 1870s.Butterfield, Mike, and Greene, Peter, Mike Butterfield's Guide to the Mountains of New Mexico, New Mexico Magazine Press, 2006, ==Geology== Shiprock is composed of fractured volcanic breccia and black dikes of igneous rock called minette, or lamprophyre. It is the erosional remnant of the throat of a volcano, and the volcanic breccia formed in a diatreme. The rock probably was originally formed 2,500–3,000 feet (750–1,000 meters) below the Earth's surface, but it was exposed after millions of years of erosion. Wall-like sheets of minette, known as dikes, radiate away from the central formation. Radiometric age determinations of the minette establish that these volcanic rocks solidified about 27 million years ago. Shiprock is in the northeastern part of the Navajo Volcanic Field—a field that includes intrusions and flows of minette and other unusual igneous rocks that formed about 30 million years ago. Agathla (El Capitan) in Monument Valley is another prominent volcanic neck in this volcanic field.Steven C. Semken, The Navajo Volcanic Field, in Volcanology in New Mexico, New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin 18, p. 79–83, 2001. Paul T. Delaney, Ship Rock, New Mexico: The vent of a violent volcanic eruption, Geological Society of America Centennial Field Guide—Rocky Mountain Section, pp. 411–415, 1987. Map of Navajo Volcanic Field with Shiprock ==Religious and cultural significance== Shiprock and the surrounding land have religious and historical significance to the Navajo people. It is mentioned in many of their myths and legends. Foremost is the peak's role as the agent that brought the Navajo to the southwest. According to one legend, after being transported from another place, the Navajos lived on the monolith, \\"coming down only to plant their fields and get water.\\" One day, the peak was struck by lightning, obliterating the trail and leaving only a sheer cliff, and stranding the women and children on top to starve. The presence of people on the peak is forbidden \\"for fear they might stir up the (ghosts), or rob their corpses.\\" Navajo legend puts the peak in a larger geographic context. Shiprock is said to be either a medicine pouch or a bow carried by the \\"Goods of Value Mountain\\", a large mythic male figure comprising several mountain features throughout the region. The Chuska Mountains comprise the body, Chuska Peak is the head, the Carrizo Mountains are the legs, and Beautiful Mountain is the feet. Navajo legend has it that Bird Monsters () nested on the peak and fed on human flesh. After Monster Slayer, elder of the Warrior Twins, destroyed at Red Mesa, he killed two adult Bird Monsters at Shiprock and changed two young ones into an eagle and an owl.Shiprock on Dark Isle The peak is mentioned in stories from the Enemy Side Ceremony and the Navajo Mountain Chant, and is associated with the Bead Chant and the Naayee'ee Ceremony. There are a number of other legends regarding what the Shiprock pinnacle might be. Some Navajo traditionalists argue that it is a geological anomaly that may have originated as a work of the 'star people'. ==Restrictions on the formation== An injury to a climber in April 1966 (American Alpine Journal 1966 accident report) caused the Navajo Nation to ban rock climbing not only on Shiprock but all over the Navajo Nation on monoliths, spires and within tribal parks under the jurisdiction of Navajo Parks & Recreation. The Navajo Nation announced that the ban was \\"absolute, final and unconditional\\". Due to \\"the Navajo's traditional fear of death and its aftermath, such accidents and especially fatalities often render the area where they occur as taboo, and the location is sometimes henceforth regarded as contaminated by evil spirits and is considered a place to be avoided.\\" The pinnacle is located on private property of Navajo grazing lease holders and is currently monitored and overseen by Shiprock tribal community advocates. Two Navajo chapter tribal government organizations claim jurisdiction over the formation. The Navajo tribal parks and recreation department does not have jurisdiction over the formation because it is not presently a tribal park. The formation is a highly sacred religious site to the Navajo people. Due to recent deaths, littering, and vandalism, the pinnacle has been under strict evaluation and observation by local Shiprock Pinnacle Tribal Advocates and by two Navajo Chapter organizations since early 2016, who oversee the area and encourage the public to not drive around the formation as if it had open access. Hiking, filming, and driving are all prohibited to the public due to its sacred nature and its sacred space. According to the Navajo traditionalists, an ecosystem of living and non-living matter needs to be protected and unharmed. In the Navajo traditional way, people are to respect the ecosystem and not disrupt its processes. It is recommended that the public respect the Navajo people who visit daily for religious activities and other miscellaneous purposes as it is Navajo trust land. A core/protection and buffer zones will be established soon. Local Shiprock Pinnacle Tribal Advocates and the two Navajo Chapter organizations also encourage visitors to use common sense etiquette and remember that the Navajo Nation is a sovereign, self-governed nation with rules and laws that must be followed. All areas near the formation are closed to non-Natives for the traditional religious purposes and for the safety of the formation and lava dike. It is recommended that the public stay at least away from the formation and from the lava dikes or wall when visiting. Navajo religious rights (the Fundamental Laws of the Dine' (Dine' Natural Law) from the Navajo Nation Title 1 Laws), Navajo grazing rights, boundaries, and private properties lines apply around and in the formation. The formation is a Navajo religious site. The restrictions were put in place in July 2016 by the delegated tribal authority (i.e., Navajo families and grazing holders who live around the formation, Shiprock Pinnacle Tribal Advocates, and members of the Navajo Chapters & Tribal Council). Visitors without any proper tribal authorization will be considered to be trespassing on Federal Indian Reservation land and are subject to legal sanctions. The tribal police at the formation monitor its use and visits. == Climate == ==Images== ==See also== * Rock formations in the United States * Volcanic plug * Diné Bahaneʼ ==References== ==External links== * Navajo.org: Shiprock * Shiprock.org: Shiprock * Shiprock @ discover-navajo * flickr: Shiprock photo gallery * 3D Movie tour of Shiprock Category:Rock formations of New Mexico Category:Religious places of the indigenous peoples of North America Category:Landmarks in New Mexico Category:Volcanic plugs of the United States Category:Diatremes of New Mexico Category:Landforms of San Juan County, New Mexico Category:Geography of the Navajo Nation Category:National Natural Landmarks in New Mexico Category:Oligocene volcanism Category:Oligocene North America Category:Neogene geology of New Mexico ","title":"Shiprock"},{"id":"1275767","text":"The Bught ( ; ) is an area of the Scottish city of Inverness.A \\"bught\\" is defined in the Dictionary of the Scots Language as follows \\"Bowcht, Bucht, n.

He spent over sixteen years as a Captain and Russian linguist in the United States Air Force. ==\\"Ler\\" books== He wrote a loosely connected trilogy about an offshoot of humanity called the Ler: The Warriors of Dawn (1975), The Gameplayers of Zan (1977), and The Day of The Klesh (1979). The Gameplayers of Zan takes place much earlier than the others, on Earth, and details the Ler's departure from Earth; the other two books cover two separate human-Ler encounters on other planets. The \\"game\\" from the title of The Gameplayers of Zan is based on cellular automata, a more intricate version of Conway's Game of Life. The Warriors of Dawn mostly concerns the relationship between a human man and a ler woman, and The Day of The Klesh represents the ler as a mostly inscrutable humanoid race. The Gameplayers of Zan, on the other hand, discusses the origins of the Ler as an engineered offshoot of humanity, and is as much about ler culture as their interactions with humanity. Most of the action in this book takes place in Unwharrie National Forest, North Carolina., March 01, 2005 Ler reproduce infrequently, generally becoming fertile only every ten years. Most ler females have only two children, but occasionally they have a third, and twins are not unknown. Ler family structure is organized around a \\"braid,\\" which they have designed to preserve maximum genetic diversity to offset their low initial population and small birth rate. A braid starts with two \\"fore- parents\\". They mate and produce the \\"elder outsibling\\". Then each of the fore- parents goes forth and brings back another ler of the appropriate gender, the \\"after-parents\\". The fore-parents each mate with an after-parent and produce the \\"insiblings\\", five years younger than the elder outsibling. Then the after-parents mate and produce the \\"younger outsibling\\", five years younger than the insiblings. The insiblings remain in the braid and become the fore- parents to the next generation; the outsiblings will leave to join other braids as after-parents. The rare surplus children tend to be given the responsibility of beginning completely new braids together. Alternation in the gender of children is enforced with pheromones. In rare cases, sometimes on purpose, two same-sex insiblings are born; the braid line ends there, as all four children must weave into other braids as after-parents. Ler communicate mainly using a verbal language called Singlespeech. Each ler has a name consisting of three syllables, e.g. \\"Maellenkleth\\", though their intimates sometimes use shortened versions of the name. Various categories of objects always have names with the same numbers of syllables, e.g. stars have four- syllable names. As in the Chinese language, each Singlespeech syllable has four possible meanings, but unlike Chinese, Singlespeech is not a tonal language. Instead, each Singlespeech word has four \\"modes\\" corresponding to the four classical Greek elements (Earth, Air, Fire, Water), with each mode having a symbolic meaning borrowed from the Divinatory tarot, and complex grammatical rules govern the allowed transitions from mode to mode. The meanings of Singlespeech words are therefore highly context-dependent, and careful attention must be paid to mode transitions during a conversation. Elemental symbolism extends also to the meanings of ler personal names, but each individual keeps their \\"governing element\\" a secret; this latter custom complicates ler marriage negotiations, since each foreparent must choose the other foreparents' second (afterparent) mate, and the governing elements of each foreparent/afterparent mating must be complementary: Earth with Air, and Fire with Water. There is also a less frequently used mode of communication called Multispeech, which uses all the available communication channels, verbal and nonverbal, to convey information in a much more detailed fashion than Singlespeech ever could. Since the completion of the Ler trilogy, Foster has continued to work on the development and explication of Singlespeech, which he has now renamed Layaklan (which name back-translates to 'Understanding' in English). A substantial Layaklan-to-English lexicon and an outline of a corresponding English-to-Layaklan lexicon (both of which were written by Foster), accompanied by supporting articles concerning Layaklan, are available online. ==The Morphodite Trilogy== This series consists of: The Morphodite (1981), Transformer (1983), and Preserver (1985). The title character is a reluctant assassin who can change forms, invariably alternating sex and decreasing in age as he/she does so. The stories themselves are centered on either a different planet or in space, with short segues that lead the reader from place to place. In The Morphodite, we discover the initial character, Rael, as a fearsome assassin who has never been unleashed upon the world. He (as he/she then is) is caged in \\"The Mask Factory\\", and his captors fear him much more than any of their other creations. Rael is not a bioengineered assassin: he/she instead initiates Change through a form of meditation. The process of Change is similar to a small death without the \\"ever after\\" aspects of it, and is quite painful—not something Rael does lightly. Additionally, Change involves a forced decrease in age of 10 to 20 years, limiting the number of Changes possible in a short period of time. We discover why Rael is so feared shortly after \\"his\\" introduction--\\"he\\" has evolved a scientific method of predicting or divining the future. Most particularly, this art can identify the single person whose death would precipitate a societal change. That art is elaborated in Transformer, but in brief it is likened to a version of the I Ching that is both scientifically rigorous and orders of magnitude more complex. This divination tool is referred to as \\"the art\\" through the books. The Morphodite depicts Rael's unleashing on the unchanging world of Oerlikon and the changes he/she thereby unleashes upon it. Oerlikon is an out-of-the way world that has gathered a group of people who desire to suppress change. In order to do so, they have a highly regimented society and the equivalent of a police state. This unchanging state is artificially enabled by an outside party that has stationed researchers throughout Oerlikon. Rael changes Oelikon by killing one of the observers using his/her assassin skills and his divination art. As the first domino begins to tumble, the observed suddenly become aware of the observers, and interrogations of captured observers lead society into a spiral of self-destruction. Rael then initiates Change and becomes Damistofina, a younger, female version of his then-current self. But Damistofina is eventually identified as the Morphodite and pursued, leading her to kill her pursuer and Change yet again, this time to Phaedrus, a yet-younger male. Eventually the upheaval grinds to a halt and Phaedrus gathers small groups of refugees to himself, becoming a sort of mind-healer. He does not go on to be king or gain immense power; instead, he is at peace. In The Transformer, we resume where Phaedrus left off. Content with his life, a few adopted children and a gather-woman. He is recognized as an adviser to the local ruler because of his efforts at providing peace. Unfortunately, there is more to the researchers than we originally supposed. Before Phaedrus was Rael, he was a woman named Jedily Tulily. Jedily was originally an observer who somehow displeased the Regents of Heliarctos and was dumped into The Mask Factory to be used up as a test subject. Upon discovering that Phaedrus still exists, they dispatch assassins to destroy him. Through a convenient quirk of fate, Phaedrus is summoned to the local ruler when the attempt occurs. His lover and adopted children are not so lucky. Initiating Change again, Phaedrus becomes Nazarine, a young woman who is barely out of her teens. Nazarine realizes both that she cannot Change again without becoming an infant and that the Regents (unknown to her at this point) won't stop trying to kill her. Following back through her past, she recovers some of the documents from The Mask Factory that lets her determine that Jedily was an off-world observer. After making that connection, Nazarine travels to the only spaceport, intent on traveling off-planet. She purchases a ticket on a ship while the Regents' assassins follow closely behind. One of her companions is killed by an assassin but gives up her new name in the process. Faren Kiricky, a ship tech, and Dorje, a ship security officer, befriend Nazarine and help her to identify the assassins. After using her art of divination, Nazarine confronts the data processor of the assassin pair and convinces her that Nazarine already knows how to win. In despair, the data processor commits suicide. The killer of the assassin pair evades capture by entering the bowels of the ship. Nazarine and Faren track and finally confront him. Nazarine tells him that no matter what he does, his actions will actually destroy the Regents - and then she lets him go. Nazarine discloses what she is to Faren and asks Faren to take care of her. Faren agrees, and Nazarine initiates Change resulting in a male infant. ==Others== Foster also wrote the standalone novel Waves (1980), and four novelettes collected in Owl Time (1985). He writes an occasional column for Acme Comics called Eyeless In Gaza. The archives appear to be offline, but some back columns are available through . The most recent column appears to be from April 2009. ==Bibliography== ===Ler=== # The Warriors of Dawn (1975) # The Gameplayers of Zan (1977) # The Day of the Klesh (1979) The Book of the Ler (2006) collects the Ler trilogy ===Transformer=== # The Morphodite (1981) # Transformer (1983) # Preserver (1985) The Transformer Trilogy (2006) collects the Transformer trilogy ===Stand-alone Novels=== * Waves (1980) ===Collections=== * Owl Time (1985) ==References== ==External links== * *Review of The Gameplayers of Zan by Jo Walton, with comments on the other Ler books.

He was married three times (his first two wives died). According to the preface of his 1571 publication of organ tablature he traveled to foreign lands to study, but he gave no specifics. Ammerbach developed a method of music notation for keyboard playing, known as tablature, which was specifically adapted for organ. His method became known as the \\"new German organ tablature\\" and involved letter notation for the pitches with rhythmic symbols placed above. It is not known if Ammerbach was himself a composer; if he was, he did not sign his music. His publications of music in tablature include arrangements of numerous composers popular in the mid-16th century, including Ludwig Senfl, Heinrich Isaac, Josquin des Prez, Clemens non Papa, Orlande de Lassus, and others; Lassus is particularly well represented, as can be expected both because of his extraordinary fame and his presence in Germany (he was in Munich between 1563 and 1594). Most of the secular music in Ammerbach's collections is printed with German titles, while sacred music retains Latin. In his last publication (1583) he includes a considerable quantity of Italian madrigals arranged for keyboard. ==References and further reading== * *Gustave Reese, Music in the Renaissance.

According to the , it has a population of people. ==Etymology== According to a paper entitled \\"Alamat ng Pangil, Laguna\\" written by Santiago T. Adre, there are three commonly believed and popular theories from which the name \\"Pangil\\" was derived. One theory reveals that the town derived its name from the peculiar shape of the land area of the town looked like especiallywhen viewed from a high place. The town's shape resmbles a wild boar's Fang. The second theory shows that the town's name was derived from the name of the pioneer settlers in this area who were known as \\"Panguilagan\\". The town was eventually given the name \\"Panguil\\" (this is the spelling which appears in moost Spanish Era documents) because most of the Spaniards had a hard time pronouncing the original term \\"Panguilagan\\". The last theory discloses that the town's first pre-Hispanic leader, a certain \\"Gat Paguil\\". When the Spaniards had reached the area, it was this leader whom they recognized and talked with. It was when the Americans came and took control of the Philippines in 1898, that the former name \\"Panguil\\" became what its present name \\"Pangil\\". ==History== The town is one of the oldest settlements in Laguna, rich in Hispanic, American and Japanese history. Discovered artifacts of the 12th century Ming and Sung Dynasty were attributed to Chinese immigrants and traders who settled in this place then. According to oral literature, the first leader of the area, which now encompasses four separate towns, was Gat Pangil, who united four ancient settlements to establish a Tagalog kingdom in the area. During the Hispanic period, Pangil became a staging ground of the Spanish missionaries in Christian Evangelization drive in 1578 in the provinces of Rizal, Laguna and Tayabas until it gained recognition as a town through the Franciscan friars in the year 1579. Pangil has a high advocacy for environmental protection and fast becoming a hub for ecotourism. Vested with all sorts of natural attributes, such as clean and pristine water included its natural falls, rivers, nature trails, forest, communities by the lake, cool breeze by the lake, Baguio-like microclimate in its upland, represents a wide array of highland, lowland and lake-ecosystems. It’s also holds a vast of natural attributes that a small and simple town can possibly be contented of and when these resources are sustainably developed. And can contribute to provide all its need to move forward as a very progressive yet an environment-friendly municipality. The municipality is strategically situated at the southern tip of Sierra Madre mountain range (six barangays) and along the eastern margin of Jalajala Peninsula and just west of the northwestern shore of the easternmost major embayment of Laguna de Bay (two barangays). Its narrow strip of territory traverses in its length by Pangil River (12.5 km long), valued for its pristine and abundant water contributing to its domestic, agricultural, ecotourism and other potential economic uses like bulk water and hydropower. Its topography is generally flat in between rolling and steep hills. Currently, based on the results of the Barangay Information Management System (BIMS) data, the municipality of Pangil has a total population of 27,711 consisting of 5,728 households, with about 4.84 average household size. Of the eight (8) barangays of Pangil, five (5) are classified as urban barangays which is actually the communities that compose the town proper, one (1) rural barangay in the upland and two (2) other rural barangays across the lake. ===King Charles III in Pangil=== The Nuestra Señora de la Natividad Parish Church with the statue of King Charles III One of the revered myths in the town of Pangil is the belief that in the year 1724, Prince Carlos, the son of King Philip V of Spain, was banished from his country and was sent to the Philippines. The young prince stayed in the town for three years and resided with the Franciscans in the adjoining convent of the Paroquia del Nuestra Señora de la Natividad Church considered then as the biggest in Laguna. The prince was a known hunter and he enjoyed his stay in the Sierra Madre mountain range that was known as a good hunting ground for wild animals and fowls. He was also very fond of the creek that branched out from the Pangil River and now called as the Bambang Hari or King’s Canal. By the year 1728, the King lifted the ban on the Prince and ordered the latter to return to their kingdom. With his ascension to the throne of Spain as King Charles III , he ordered his emissaries to send the statue of Nuestra Seńora de la O (Our Lady of Expectation) and the statue of Santo Nińo de la O (Holy Child of Expectation) as a sign of gratitude and appreciation to the Pangilenians for the hospitality and kindness that was accorded to him. Although this story is a source of pride among the Pangilenos, there is nothing in the historical records of the archives of the Franciscan Province in the Philippines or the Archdiocese of Manila, or the Ministerio del Ultramar in Madrid that could corroborate this folk history. ===Charles III of Spain=== Charles III of Spain (Charles Sebastian; Spanish: Carlos Sebastián; Italian and Neapolitan: Carlo Sebastiano; Sicilian: Carlu Bastianu; 20 January 1716 – 14 December 1788) ruled Spain (1759–1788), after ruling Naples as Charles of Bourbon (1734–1759) and Sicily, where he was known simply as Charles III, (1735–1759). He was the fifth son of Philip V of Spain, and the eldest son of Philip's second wife, Elisabeth Farnese. A proponent of enlightened absolutism and regalism, he succeeded to the Spanish throne on 10 August 1759, upon the death of his half- brother Ferdinand VI, who left no heirs. In 1731, the 15-year-old Charles became the Duke of Parma and Piacenza, as Charles I, following the death of his childless grand-uncle Antonio Farnese. In 1738 he married Princess Maria Amalia of Saxony, daughter of Augustus III of Poland, who was and an educated, cultured woman. The couple had birt 13 children, eight of whom reached adulthood, including Charles, heir to the Spanish throne. Charles and Maria Amalia resided in Naples for 19 years. He gained valuable experience in his 25-year rule in Italy, so that he was well prepared as monarch of the Spanish Empire. His policies in Italy prefiguring ones he put in place in his 30-year rule of Spain.[1] As King of Spain, Charles III made far-reaching reforms to increase the flow of funds to the crown and defend against foreign incursions on the empire. He facilitated trade and commerce, modernized agriculture and land tenure, and promoted science and university research,. He implemented regalist policies to increase the power of the state regarding the church. During his reign, he expelled the Jesuits from the Spanish Empire.[2] He strengthened the Spanish army and navy. Although he did not achieve complete control over Spain's finances, and was sometimes obliged to borrow to meet expenses, most of his reforms proved successful in providing increased revenue to the crown and expanding state power, leaving a lasting legacy.[3] In the Spanish Empire his regime enacted a series of sweeping reforms with the aim of bringing the overseas territories under firmer control by the central government, reversing the trend toward local autonomy, and gaining more control over the Church. Reforms including the establishment of two new viceroyalties, realignment of administration into intendancies, creating a standing military, establishing new monopolies, revitalizing silver mining, excluding American-born Spaniards (criollos) from high civil and ecclesiastical offices, and eliminating many privileges (fueros) of clergy.[4] Historian Stanley Payne writes that Charles III \\"was probably the most successful European ruler of his generation. He had provided firm, consistent, intelligent leadership. He had chosen capable ministers....[his] personal life had won the respect of the people.\\"[5] John Lynch's assessment is that in Bourbon Spain \\"Spaniards had to wait half a century before their government was rescued by Charles III, a giant among midgets.\\"[6] ==Barangays== Pangil is politically subdivided into 8 barangays: * Balian * Isla (Poblacion) * Natividad (Poblacion) * San Jose (Poblacion) * Sulib (Poblacion) * Galalan * Dambo * Mabato-Asufre ==Climate== ==Demographics== In the , the population of Pangil was people, with a density of . ==Municipal Mayors== Under the American Civil Government: * 1900-1905 Antonio A.

At its greatest extent, the colony of New South Wales included the present-day Australian states of New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania, and South Australia, the Northern Territory as well as New Zealand. The first \\"responsible\\" self-government of New South Wales was formed on 6 June 1856 with Sir Stuart Alexander Donaldson appointed by Governor Sir William Denison as its first Colonial Secretary.Government Gazette June 1856 ==History== ===Formation=== On 18 January 1788, the First Fleet led by Captain Arthur Phillip founded the first British settlement in Australian history as a penal colony. Having set sail on 13 May 1787, Captain Arthur Phillip assumed the role of governor of the settlement upon arrival. On 18 January 1788, the first ship of the First Fleet, HMS Supply, with Phillip aboard, reached Botany Bay. However, Botany Bay was found to be unsuitable by Phillip. After Phillip led the exploration of Port Jackson, he sailed and reached Sydney Cove on night of 25 January 1788. On the morning of 26 January, men on board this ship went ashore and started clearing land for a camp. In the afternoon-evening, they erected a flag pole, raised the Union Jack, and the officers ashore made toasts to the Royal Family and the success of the colony. Likely, some, or all, ships of the First Fleet were present for the flag raising. On the morning of 27 January, all the fit male convicts, marines, and likely some ships' crew went ashore to establish the camp and find food. The female convicts came ashore on 6 February 1788. About midday on 7 February 1788, the convicts, marines and others who were staying, were gathered by the Governor for the reading of the proclamation of New South Wales and a long reading of the rights of the convicts and others. Thus, the Colony of NSW was founded on 7 February 1788. Before that, British naval administration applied. However, at this time it was still a Penal Colony. It was not formally constituted as a Crown Colony until 11 August 1824. ===Separation of Van Diemen's Land=== Major-General Ralph Darling was appointed Governor of New South Wales in 1825, and in the same year he visited Hobart Town, and on 3 December proclaimed the establishment of the independent colony, of which he was actually Governor for three days. ===Separation of South Australia=== In 1834, the British Parliament passed the South Australia Act 1834, which enabled the province of South Australia to be established. ===Separation of New Zealand=== On 16 November 1840, the British government issued the Charter for Erecting the Colony of New Zealand. The Charter stated that the Colony of New Zealand would be established as a Crown colony separate from New South Wales on 1 July 1841. === Separation of Victoria === On 1 July 1851, writs were issued for the election of the first Victorian Legislative Council, and the absolute independence of Victoria from New South Wales was established proclaiming a new Colony of Victoria. ===Separation of Queensland=== A public meeting was held in 1851 to consider Queensland's proposed separation from New South Wales. On 6 June 1859, Queen Victoria signed Letters Patent to form the separate Colony of Queensland. Brisbane was named as the capital city. On 10 December 1859, a proclamation was read by British author George Bowen, whereby Queensland was formally separated from the state of New South Wales. As a result, Bowen became the first Governor of Queensland. On 22 May 1860 the first Queensland election was held and Robert Herbert, Bowen's private secretary, was appointed as the first Premier of Queensland. Queensland also became the first Australian colony to establish its own parliament rather than spending time as a Crown Colony. == Federation == The Federation of Australia was the process by which the six separate British self-governing colonies of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, and Western Australia agreed to unite and form the Commonwealth of Australia, establishing a system of federalism in Australia. This effectively changed New South Wales from being a colony to a state of Australia. === Australia Act === In the Australia Act 1986, Australia gained full independence from the United Kingdom, which includes that colonial laws – including those of New South Wales – would no longer be subject to disallowance or suspension by the Queen (section 8 of the Act) – a power that, anomalously, remains for Commonwealth legislation (Constitution sections 59 and 60). Thus the Australia Act represents the final stage of complete integration of the Former Colony of NSW into the jurisdiction of the Sovereign State of Australia. == See also == * History of New South Wales * History of Australia (1788–1850) * History of Australia (1851–1900) ==References== Category:Former British colonies and protectorates in Oceania Category:Former penal colonies Category:Australian penal colonies Category:1788 establishments in Australia Category:1901 disestablishments in Australia ","title":"Colony of New South Wales"},{"id":"1275861","text":"This is a list of school districts in Manitoba.

To the unaided eye, the text may appear as a solid line. Attempts to reproduce by methods of photocopy, image scanning, or pantograph typically translate as a dotted or solid line, unless the reproduction method can identify and recreate patterns to such scale. Microprint is predominantly used as an anti-counterfeiting technique, due to its inability to be easily reproduced by widespread digital methods. While microphotography precedes microprint, microprint was significantly influenced by Albert Boni in 1934 when he was inspired by his friend, writer and editor Manuel Komroff, who was showing his experimentations related to the enlarging of photographs. It occurred to Boni that if he could reduce rather than enlarge photographs, this technology might enable publication companies and libraries to access much greater quantities of data at a minimum cost of material and storage space. Over the following decade, Boni worked to develop microprint, a micro-opaque process in which pages were photographed using 35mm microfilm and printed on cards using offset lithography. (, ) This process proved to produce a 6\\" by 9\\" index card that stored 100 pages of text from the normal sized publications he was reproducing. Boni began the Readex Microprint company to produce and license this technology. He also published an article A Guide to the Literature of Photography and Related Subjects (1943), which appeared in a supplemental 18th issue of the Photo-Lab Index. ==Usage== Currency commonly exhibits the highest quality (smallest size) of microprint because it demands the highest level of counterfeiting deterrence. For example, on the series 2004 United States $20 bill, microprint is hidden within the border in the lower left corner of the obverse (front) side as well as the Twenty USA background. MP microprint commonly used on personal bank cheques Bank cheques as well as various other items of value may also commonly leverage microprinting methods, but generally not of such extreme size. For example, personal bank cheques commonly place the characters MP next to the signature line of the check; these characters represent microprint and indicate that the signature line or other check features are actually microprinted characters. The microprinted characters are used as an anti-counterfeiting feature due to their difficulty in being reproduced while the prominent MP serves as an overt deterrent warning that the item employs microprint. While microprinting at some scales may be readable to the human eye without microscopy, there is no differentiation between microprinting at these different scales. The first US postage stamp to incorporate microprinting was the American Wildflower Series introduced by The United States Postal Service in 1992. It was also the first commemorative stamp wholly produced by offset lithography. The USPS has since issued other stamps with more complex microprinting incorporated along with dates, words, and abbreviations such as USPS and even entire stamp designs composed of microprint letters. ==Production== Preparing a lithographic printing plate Microprint of the smallest scale is only producible by hand using engraved offset printing plates or some other method of Intaglio (printmaking). MICR Digital microtext printers utilize specially designed fonts and ink for the purpose. The ink used is most commonly MICR (Magnetic Ink Character Recognition) toner particles but may also be polyester based toners and styrene acrylate polymer based toners. The ink is not limited to grayscale only, but may also use color toners or even more specialized toners containing dyes sensitive to ultraviolet or infrared radiation and producing fluorescence when exposed to those radiations. ==Microtext and microfonts== Examples of several microfonts used in digital microprinting Microprint of the scale capable by other printing methods cannot be produced by a digital printer regardless of the resolution of the device. Some digital fonts are designed specifically for the purpose of microprinting. These pseudo-microprint fonts are referred to as microtext. Xerox was acclaimed for developing a microtext font they claimed could produce characters 1/100 of an inch tall; 1/100 of an inch is equivalent to 0.7227 points. In April 2015, Videojet Technologies released their 1650 High Resolution (HR) and 1620 HR Continuous Inkjet (CIJ) printers, said to be capable of printing sub-pixel size characters as small as 0.6 mm in height (equivalent to 1.7007 points). The printers use a 40-micron nozzle that outputs more than 100,000 drops per second of ink. While these printers make microprinting faster and easier to produce digitally, they still have not reached the true sub-pixel size of less than 1 point. The smallest scale microtext a laser printer can produce is 0.5 pt. ==Microstructures== Using gold nanoparticle inks on a glass substrate, scientists concluded that it was possible for them to control the production of print patterns to a scale of 2 microns. After printing, the nano-particle ink suspension was heated using a gaussian laser; as it heated, the glass would expand due to the thermal conductivity of the gold nano-ink. In further experiments, they were able to fuse the nano-particles together into a tighter formation a continuous conductive line. Such experiments did not directly include font characters but could translate to such usage. ==See also== * Machine Identification Code * Microdot * Microfilmer * Microform * Microphotograph * Point (typography) * Preservation (library and archival science) ==References== ==External links== *A Guide to the Literature of Photography and Related Subjects (1943) by Albert Boni Category:Documents Category:Archival science Category:Film formats Category:Storage media Category:Money forgery Category:Steganography Category:Typography Category:Packaging Category:Security Category:Authentication methods Category:Engraving ","title":"Microprinting"},{"id":"1275875","text":"Preserved part of the Jewish House of Religious Studies and Prayer at 57 Żelazna Street in Warsaw which housed the Yitzchak Meir Alter synagogue Yitzchak Meir Rotenberg-Alter (, , 1799 – 10 March 1866), was the first Rebbe of the Ger Hasidic dynasty, which he founded in the town of Góra Kalwaria (known as \\"Ger\\" in Yiddish), Poland. He headed the Kupath Rabbi Meir Baal Haness Kollel Polen (Poland) Varsha (Warsaw) (Hebrew ). He was also known as The Chiddushei HaRim () for his Torah writings, and was sometimes fondly called Reb Itche Meir (Yiddish) by his followers. ==Early life== Alter was born in Magnuszew, Poland, in late 1799. He came from a very distinguished family of rabbis, among the most prominent in Germany and Poland. He was a descendant of Rashi and of the Tosafist, Rabbi Meir ben Baruch of Rothenburg. He married Feigele Lipszyc, daughter of Moshe 'Halfon' Lipszyc, in 1811, and settled in Warsaw. They had fourteen children, according to most published sources, most of whom died in infancy. Alter became known as a Talmudic gaon. At first, he was close to the rebbes of Kozhnitz, however after some years, he was drawn to Rebbe Simcha Bunim of Prshischa, whose close adherent he became. After the demise of Simcha Bunim, Alter became a disciple of Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Kotzk, also known as the Kotzker Rebbe, who was famous for his acerbic wit and Talmudic brilliance. He was soon followed by a large number of Simcha Bunim's followers. Alter and the Kotzer Rebbe eventually became brothers-in-law, when the latter married Chaya Lipszyc, the sister of Alter's wife Feigele. In 1830 he was forced to change his name to Alter because of his support towards the Poles during the November Uprising. Alter was temporarily succeeded as the Rebbe of the Ger hasidim by his colleague and disciple, Rabbi Chanoch Henoch of Aleksander. One of his sons, Avraham Mordechai, and three daughters, Cyna Pesia, Leah Hudes, and Esther, survived to adulthood and married. However, by the time of Alter's death on 23 Adar 5626 (1866), only one child (Esther) remained alive. ==Works== Rabbi Alter is still well known for his talmudic commentary, though he wrote on many other areas.

There were construction cost overruns, with a total cost around $5,000,000.00, that led to financial trouble for the Erie and the cancellation of plans to build a new terminal along the Jersey City waterfront. The term \\"Bergen Arches\\" originally referred to the massive bridges over the cut, but the two terms have become synonymous. The last trains to the terminal ran in 1957. The line was abandoned that year. The adjacent tunnel (the Long Dock Tunnel) from the mid-19th century that the Erie Cut replaced is used for freight, and is being restored as part of Liberty Corridor Project as an extension of National Docks Secondary line. ==Future== Various projects have been proposed for the abandoned track bed: for a four-lane or six-lane highway that would connect the New Jersey Turnpike and U.S. Route 1/9 bypassing traffic headed along New Jersey Route 139 for the Holland Tunnel,http://www.nycroads.com/roads/NJ-139/ extension of the Hudson Bergen Light Rail, or in conjunction with the Harsimus Stem Embankment, a recreational greenway. A freeway proposed in 1989 by Governor Thomas Kean was strongly supported by then-Mayor Bret Schundler. In 1998, this project was allocated $26 million in the federal Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. During the 2001 mayoral race, candidates instead lobbied for a mass transit line, and in 2002 the plans were dropped during Mayor Cunningham's administration. In that year, Parsons Brinkerhoff, a consulting firm, released another report commissioned by New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) and describing the conditions and analyzing of various options. NJDOT has continued to fund studies for the project. In March 2011, an additional $13.4 million was allocated to advance the project. A Bergen Arches Preservation Coalition has propose to run the East Coast Greenway through the Arches. ==See also== *List of bridges, tunnels, and cuts in Hudson County, New Jersey *List of Erie Railroad structures documented by the Historic American Engineering Record *Timeline of Jersey City area railroads ==References== ==External links== *The Bergen Arches: A History - includes several photographs and classic postcards *Bergen Arches roadway project * * *State of New Jersey's study for possible other options for the Arches *History, summary of road and rail options with an aerial picture of the arches and the nearby highways and railroads *https://web.archive.org/web/20120929064726/http://www.njcu.edu/Programs/jchistory/Pages/B_Pages/Bergen_Arches.htm *https://www.nj.com/news/2019/12/abandoned-rail-line-is-a-strange-urban- paradise-and-some-want-to-keep-it-that-way.html *https://www.nj.com/hudson/2020/07/bergen-arches-preservation-coalition-joins- forces-with-high-line-network.html Category:Transportation in Jersey City, New Jersey Category:Geography of Hudson County, New Jersey Category:Historic American Engineering Record in New Jersey Category:Historic districts in Hudson County, New Jersey Category:Erie Railroad Category:Landforms of Hudson County, New Jersey Category:Railroad tunnels in New Jersey Category:Erie Railroad tunnels Category:Tunnels in Hudson County, New Jersey ","title":"Bergen Arches"},{"id":"1275884","text":"The Flin Flon School Division maintains and operates two elementary schools and two high schools in the city of Flin Flon, Manitoba, Canada.

The goal was to start a band that in two months would already have material ready to be presented in a first concert. For that he summoned friends, like L.A. Tilly who had already been on past musical ventures, on the drums, followed by Marcoz Ferraz on the bass, and lastly Alexandre França on lead guitar. In two months SILENT was ready and able to perform. Their first show was on April 25 of 1991, in the once renowned but now closed Babilônia (night club and concert hall). The concert brought in a crowd of about 900 people. Two months passed and they recorded their first demo, and in January of 92 SILENT shot their first music video (For the song Watching), that was selected to premier on MTV Brazil’s show called “Demo MTV” and was included in the regular channel programing. In 93 Marcoz left the band, being replaced by Federico Arana, on the bass and vocals. In the same year SILENT starred in the sound track of a Brazilian soap opera called “O Mapa da Mina”, produced by Rede Globo de Televisão. In the following years that would repeat itself, in 96 and 97, which finally lead to the release of the album “The Bright Side” in 2001, that received raved reviews from around the world, even scoring an 83 grade in the well-known Japanese magazine Burnn. That year also marked the leave of Gustavo Andriewiski from the band. From 2002 to 2005 the band tried to reinvent itself and release new material, but all of these efforts were in vain, and the band broke up. == Before The Comeback == In 2006 Gustavo, Alexandre França and Tilly rejoined in a modern Brazilian rock act called 'Repplica'. At first they had André Bighinzolli (Genoma, Metalmorphose) playing the bass, later replaced by Márcio Chicralla (Celso Blues Boy Band). This project ended in 2010. ==The Comeback== In December 2010, Gustavo, Alexandre, and Tilly, found themselves on a bar table throwing around ideas, when Alexandre suggested that they should give new life to the once forgotten idea of SILENT, and they decided to schedule their first come back rehearsal after the holidays, in January 2011. Destiny had a different plan, and, Alexandre França died alongside his wife and his son, in one of the worst natural disasters of Brazilian history. After one year of grieving, Gustavo and Tilly decided to carry on with their friend’s plan. 2012 and 2013 were dedicated to forming a new quartet, and rerecording old songs from the original repertoire of the first years of the band, and also composing new songs. ==Reborn== With a new formation defined in 2014, Gustavo Andriewiski on guitar and vocals, Alex Cavalcanti on guitar, Douglas Boiago on the bass, and Luiz “Tilly” Alexandre on the drums, they start recording their second album. In 2015, with their new album “Land Of Lightning” ready, videos from the beginning of their careers salvaged, and a new single/music video ready to be released, the band signed their first contract with the recording label Planet Music Brazil. The single \\"Around The Sun\\" was released in October 2015, followed by the Album \\"Land Of Lightning\\", released on November. Soon after that, the video clip for \\"Around The Sun\\" is released on Vevo and in their Silent Vevo YouTube channel. ==Line-up== === Members === * Vocals, guitar: Gustavo Andriewiski * Guitar: Alex Cavalcanti * Bass: Douglas Boiago * Drums: Luiz \\"Tilly\\" Alexandre === Former members === * Bass: Marcos Ferraz * Keyboards: Leandro Baliza * Guitar: Alexandre França * Bass: Federico Martin == Discography == * The Bright Side (2001) * Land Of Lightning (2015) == External links == *Silent Official Facebook *SilentVevo *Silent You Tube Channel * Repplica - Myspace site Category:Brazilian rock music groups Category:Musical groups established in 1991 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2005 Category:1991 establishments in Brazil Category:2005 disestablishments in Brazil ","title":"Silent (band)"},{"id":"1275907","text":"Central mosque in Marcory. Muslims make up about 43% of the population of Côte-d'Ivoire. In Côte-d'Ivoire, Muslims pray, fast, and give alms as required by tenets of Islam, and many perform the hajj. Most Ivoirian Muslims are Sunni, following the Maliki version of Islamic law. Sufism, involving the organization of mystical brotherhoods (Tariqa) for the purification and spread of Islam, is also widespread, laced with indigenous beliefs and practices. The four major Sufi brotherhoods are all represented in Ivory Coast, although the Qadiriya, founded in the eleventh century, and the Tidjaniya, founded in the eighteenth century, are most popular. The Qadiriya is prevalent in the west, and the Tidjaniya, in the east. The other two major Islamic brotherhoods have few adherents in Ivory Coast. The Senoussiya is identified with Libya, where its influence is substantial. Ahmadiyya movement is also present in Ivory Coast. The significant religious authority is the marabout. He is believed to be a miracle worker, a physician, and a mystic, who exercises both magical and moral authority. He is also respected as a dispenser of amulets, which protect the wearer—Muslim or non-Muslim—against evil. The influence of marabouts has produced a number of reactions in Ivoirian society, among them a series of reformist movements. These reform movements often condemn Sufism and marabouts as un-Islamic, but the poor see that marabouts often speak out on behalf of the downtrodden. Hamallism began as an Islamic reform movement in the French Sudan early in the twentieth century and has provided a channel for expressing political and religious discontent. Its founder, Hamallah, was exiled from the French Sudan to Ivory Coast during the 1930s. He preached Islamic reform tempered by tolerance of many local practices, but he condemned many aspects of Sufism. Orthodox brotherhoods were able to convince the French authorities in Ivory Coast that Hamallah had been responsible for earlier political uprisings in the French Sudan. Authorities then expelled Hamallah from Ivory Coast and banned his teachings. The massive immigration of Muslims from the Muslim majority countries Burkina Faso and Mali helped to increase the number of Muslims substantially. ==Gallery== File:Medersa Odienne.JPGIslamic School for children in Ivory Coast.

It is approximately east of Melbourne's central business district and both shopping centres are centrally located within the Box Hill shopping precinct and Whitehorse City Council's Principal Activity Centre. ==History== ===Box Hill Central - North=== Box Hill Central - North was originally constructed in the early 1970s. It was opened in 1975 as a three level regional shopping centre, called Whitehorse Plaza. It housed anchor tenants such as Coles, Kmart Australia, Venture, with other notable tenants being Sussans, Williams The Shoeman, Priceline, Lincraft, Medicare and more retailers, eateries, and services. Although, due to lack of tenants, it was closed down in 2000. The shopping centre was completely redeveloped, which consisted of demolition of all tenancies within the shopping centre, reconfigure of the main shopping centre layout & car parks as well as major refurbishment of the external as well as the internal facades. It was reopened on 1 July 2003 by Centro Properties Group as Centro Whitehorse (although called Whitehorse City while under redevelopment), now a two level regional shopping centre with Coles and Best & Less clothing store. In 2007 Centro Whitehorse was re branded as Centro Box Hill North and partially redeveloped, with Best & Less being closed down and expanded/renovated to a brand new Harris Scarfe store, now the flagship store in Victoria. In 2013 it was rebranded to Box Hill Central - North, as a result of an organisation wide rebranding of all centres owned by Federation Limited. On February 2nd, 2020, Harris Scarfe closed it store at Box Hill, as part of its restructure and downsizing of its store count. It is also common for faith groups to share tracks and cheerful Christmas music in the outdoor areas. Particularly, multi- cultural groups featuring a certain Tzar Maher have been found to be effective. With his ethnicity providing beautiful juxtaposition in the Asian- dominated demographics of the patrons, his voice, hair and even beard, have impacted observers and astonished on-lookers alike. Others have also proven effective. Andrew Llort (JCfan), \\"Go Chew a Bomb\\", Senpai Alicia, Vincent and Peking Duck have also been seen in the area. ===Box Hill Central - South=== Box Hill Central - South was originally constructed in the early 1980s, when the old Box Hill railway station, and level crossing was removed, and Market and Main Streets were closed to traffic. Box Hill Central opened in 1987, as a single level regional shopping centre. It housed anchor tenants of Target Australia and Safeway. The shopping centre was redeveloped in 1998 and in 2000 was acquired by the Centro Properties Group, who renamed it to Centro Box Hill South, though many still referred to it as Box Hill Central. In 2010, the shopping centre was again redeveloped, with Target converted into Big W, and Safeway being converted to Woolworths. In 2013, it was again rebranded, as Box Hill Central - South, as a result of an organisation wide rebranding of all centres owned by Federation Limited Unusually, the shopping centre has a large indoor fresh food market located along the eastern edge of the complex. The original market opened in 1895 which was incorporated into the shopping centre when it was developed. ==Tenants== Currently, The two shopping centres have a combined gross lettable area of . This is made up of 3 anchor tenants (Big W, Coles and Woolworths) and over 190 retailers, eateries and service providers. The shopping centres also has 2,537 parking spaces, as well as approximately 100 professional office suites in professional office towers. Previous tenants of Box Hill Central are Kmart, Kmart Food, Target, Venture, Harris Scarfe, Best & Less and more. The Box Hill region is well known for its large population of Hong Kong Chinese, with smaller groups of mainland China, Taiwanese and Vietnamese. This is reflected in the diversity of the produce in fresh food markets, medicinal herb retailers and clothing shops. In addition to the familiar European market offerings, the market area stocks an extensive range of traditional Asian foods. Box Hill Central (North and South) has an annual turnover in excess of A$150 million. ==Transport== Box Hill Central - was built above Box Hill station and the entrance is contained inside the shopping centre. The complex also has a major bus interchange, with tram route 109 terminating nearby on Whitehorse Road. It passes through the inner eastern suburbs en route to Port Melbourne via the Melbourne central business district. There are a few bus stops situated around both the shopping centres and they are both situated in Zone 2. Box Hill Central has 7 levels of undercover car parking. The shopping centre has bicycle racks located at most major entrances as well as an on-site taxi rank. == References == ==External links== * Category:Shopping centres in Melbourne Category:Shopping malls established in 1987 ","title":"Box Hill Central Shopping Centre"},{"id":"1275912","text":"Yehudah Aryeh Leib Alter (, 15 April 1847 – 11 January 1905), also known by the title of his main work, the Sfas Emes (Ashkenazic Pronunciation) or Sefat Emet (Modern Hebrew), was a Hasidic rabbi who succeeded his grandfather, Rabbi Yitzchak Meir Alter, as the Av beis din (head of the rabbinical court) and Rav of Góra Kalwaria, Poland (known in Yiddish as the town of Ger), and succeeded Rabbi Chanokh Heynekh HaKohen Levin of Aleksander as Rebbe of the Gerrer Hasidim. ==Biography== ===Early years=== He was born in 1847 (5608) and named Yehudah Leib; he was known to family and friends as Leybl. His father, Rabbi Avraham Mordechai Alter, died when Yehudah Leib was only eight years old, and his mother Mrs. Esther Alter (née Landsztajn) died before that.http://pinkasmenakemjustman.blogspot.com/2014/02/esther-alter- landsztajn-c1816-1849.html. Orphaned of both parents, he was brought up by his grandparents, Rabbi Yitzchak Meir Alter (known as the Chiddushei Harim) and his wife. When he was about ten years old, his grandfather took him to visit the Kotzker Rebbe, which left a lifelong impression on him. He married Yocheved Rivka, daughter of Yehuda Leib (\\"Yidl\\") Kaminer. In order not to have the same name as his father-in-law, his own name was changed to Yehudah Aryeh Leib. He is said to have been attached to the name Yehudah, and was upset at not being able to use it as his name any longer. ===Leadership=== When his grandfather, Rabbi Yitzchak Meir, died in 1866, many of the Gerrer Hasidim sought to bestow the mantle of leadership upon eighteen-year-old Yehudah Aryeh Leib. He refused that position, and leadership went to Rabbi Chanokh Heynekh HaKohen Levin of Aleksandrów Łódzki. However, after the death of the latter in 1870, the Hasidim succeeded in gaining Yehudah Aryeh Leib's assent to become their Rebbe.Deiah veHadibur. ===Death and burial=== During the Russo-Japanese War, many of his young followers were drafted into the Russian Army and sent to the battlefields in Manchuria. The Rebbe was very worried over these devotees and would constantly write to them. His health suffered, and he died at the age of 57 on 11 January 1905 (5 Shevat 5665). > \\"When news of the Admor's petirah (passing away) spread, so many people > rushed to Ger yesterday morning that although the railway dispatched extra > trains there was hardly any space in the cars and thousands of people were > still left without means to travel... > \\"One (tram) car with seating for 44 people held over 200, not even leaving > any standing room, and in another car some people fainted as a result of the > overcrowded conditions... > \\"When the time for tefillas Mincha arrived, all of the funeral-goers, 20,000 > in number, stood in a field and davened Minchah together... > \\"The brief words spoken by the Rav of Sochachov made a powerful impression.\\" > IN-DEPTH FEATURES: The Sefas Emes ===Succession=== He was succeeded as Gerrer Rebbe by his son, Rabbi Avraham Mordechai Alter. Most of Gerrer hasidim followed Rabbi Avraham Mordechai Alter, but some chasidim followed the brother-in-law of Rabbi Yehuda Aryeh Leib Alter - Rabbi Pinchas Menachem Justman of Piltz. ==Lasting influence== Rabbi Yehudah Aryeh Leib was one of the greatest Torah scholars of his generation, teaching students such as Rabbi Nachman Shlomo Greenspan and many others. His output was prodigious, and his works (all entitled Sfas Emes) deal with the Talmud, the ethics of the Midrash, and mysticism of the Zohar. His Torah homilies as delivered to his hasidim, and arranged according to the weekly parashah and the festivals, were the first to be published posthumously under the name Sfas Emes. The title was taken from the closing words of the final piece he wrote (Sfas Emes, Vayechi 5665). His chiddushim (original Torah thoughts) on many Talmudic tractates, and on Yoreh De'ah, have been published under the same name. The Sochatchover Rebbe, Rabbi Avrohom Bornsztain (known as the Avnei Nezer), a leading Torah scholar and posek in his own right, is said to have maintained two bookcases — one for Rishonim (earlier commentators) and another for Acharonim (later commentators). The volumes of the Sfas Emes, written in the late 1800s, were to be found in his bookcase containing the Rishonim. To study some portions of the Talmud without the Sfas Emes is unthinkable to the modern-day scholar.Rabbi Menachem Lubinsky, in the Jewish Observer. The Sfas Emes Yeshiva in Jerusalem is named after him and includes his teachings in the curriculum. ===His sayings=== > One of the greatest religious problems is that people fear having a > relationship with God and consequently distance themselves from Him.

The Council’s members are the engineering and surveying licensure boards from all 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. These boards are divided into four geographic zones: Central, Northeast, Southern, Western. It is headquartered in Greenville, South Carolina. == Engineering == NCEES develops and scores the FE, PE and SE exams for engineering licensure. The FE exam is generally the first step in the process to becoming a professional licensed engineer (PE). It is designed for recent graduates and students who are close to finishing an undergraduate engineering degree from an EAC/ABET- accredited program. The PE exam is designed to test for a minimum level of competency in a particular engineering discipline. It is designed for engineers who have gained a minimum of four years of work experience in their chosen engineering discipline. The SE exam is designed for engineers who practice in jurisdictions that license structural engineers separately from other professional engineers. * The Fundamentals of Engineering exam (FE exam) is generally the first step in the process to becoming a professional licensed engineer (PE). It is designed for recent graduates and students who are close to finishing an undergraduate engineering degree from an EAC/ABET-accredited program.

It is designed for engineers who have gained a minimum of four years’ post-college work experience in their chosen engineering discipline. * The Structural Engineering exam (SE exam) tests for a minimum level of competency in structural engineering. It is designed for engineers who practice in jurisdictions that license structural engineers separately from other professional engineers. This 16-hour exam uses separate vertical and lateral components to test one's ability to safely design buildings or bridges, especially in areas of high seismicity and high wind. == Land Surveying == NCEES also prepares examinations for land surveyor licensing in the United States. These exams consist of: * The Fundamentals of Surveying (FS) exam is generally the first step in the process to becoming a professional licensed surveyor (PS).

It is designed for surveyors who have gained at least four years of professional experience. == Records == The NCEES Records program is designed for currently licensed engineers and surveyors who are looking for an easier and faster way to complete the licensure process in multiple jurisdictions, including all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands. An established NCEES Record will include most—if not all—of the materials one needs to apply for comity licensure in additional states and territories. == Credentials evaluations == NCEES Credentials Evaluations is a service for state licensing boards and applicants. It is designed primarily for candidates who have earned their degrees outside the United States and are pursuing licensure through one of the member licensing boards of NCEES. == Exam preparation materials == NCEES exam preparation materials include questions that have been used on past exams and questions written to give examinees extra practice. ==See also== *Engineering *Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) *Glossary of engineering *Glossary of civil engineering *Glossary of electrical and electronics engineering *Glossary of mechanical engineering *Glossary of structural engineering *Glossary of biology *Glossary of chemistry *Glossary of economics *Glossary of physics *Glossary of probability and statistics *Washington Accord *Sydney Accord *Dublin Accord *Regulation and licensure in engineering *Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology (ABET) == References == == External links == * Category:Professional certification in engineering Category:American engineering organizations Category:Organizations based in South Carolina Category:Organizations established in 1920 Category:Surveying organizations Category:Geographic data and information organizations in the United States ","title":"National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying"},{"id":"1275916","text":"Pines are any coniferous tree of the genus Pinus.

He is a former Oxford Professor of Poetry. ==Life and career== Born in Lincoln, Fenton grew up in Lincolnshire and Staffordshire, the son of Canon John Fenton, a biblical scholar. He was educated at the Durham Choristers School, Repton and Magdalen College, Oxford. He graduated with a B.A. in 1970. Fenton acquired at school an enthusiasm for the work of W.H. Auden. At Oxford John Fuller, who happened to be writing A Reader's Guide to W.H. Auden at the time, further encouraged that enthusiasm. Auden became perhaps the most significant single influence on Fenton's own work. In his first year at university, Fenton won the Newdigate Prize for his sonnet sequence Our Western Furniture. Later published by Fuller's Sycamore Press, it largely concerns the cultural collision in the 19th century between the United States and Japan. It displays in embryo many of the characteristics that define Fenton's later work: technical mastery combined with a fascination with issues that arise from the Western interaction with other cultures. Our Western Furniture was followed by Exempla, notable for its frequent use of unfamiliar words, as well as commonplace words employed in an unfamiliar manner. Whilst studying at Oxford, Fenton became a close friend of Christopher Hitchens, whose memoir Hitch-22 is dedicated to Fenton and has a chapter on their friendship. Hitchens praised Fenton's extraordinary talent, stating that he too believed him to be the greatest poet of his generation. He also expounded on Fenton's modesty, describing him as infinitely more mature than himself and Martin Amis. Fenton and Hitchens shared a house together in their third year, and continued to be close friends until Hitchens's death. Fenton read his poem 'For Andrew Wood' at the Vanity Fair Hitchens memorial service. His first collection, Terminal Moraine (1972) won a Gregory Award. With the proceeds he traveled to East Asia, where he wrote of the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam, and the end of the Lon Nol regime in Cambodia which presaged the rise of Pol Pot. The Memory of War (1982) ensured his reputation as one of the greatest war poets of his time. Fenton returned to London in 1976. He was political correspondent of the New Statesman, where he worked alongside Christopher Hitchens, Julian Barnes and Martin Amis. He became the Assistant Literary Editor in 1971, and Editorial Assistant in 1972. Earlier in his journalistic career, like Hitchens, he had written for Socialist Worker, the weekly paper of the British trotskyist group then known as the International Socialists. Fenton was an occasional war reporter in Vietnam during the late phase of the Vietnam War which ended in 1975. His experiences in Vietnam and Cambodia from summer 1973 form a part of All the Wrong Places (1988).Barbara Korte Represented Reporters: Images of War Correspondents in Memoirs and ... 2009 - Page 17 \\"The poet James Fenton, for instance, was an occasional war reporter in Vietnam during the late phase of the war.

Am I wrong, or is All the Wrong Places also Fenton's journey to the end of the revolutionary socialist night\\" In 1983, Fenton accompanied his friend Redmond O'Hanlon to Borneo. A description of the voyage can be found in the book Into the Heart of Borneo. Fenton won the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize in 1984 for Children in Exile: Poems 1968-1984. He was appointed Oxford Professor of Poetry in 1994, a post he held till 1999. He was awarded the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry in 2007. The American composer Charles Wuorinen set several of his poems to music, and Fenton served as librettist for Wuorinen's opera Haroun and the Sea of Stories (2001, premiered in 2004), based on Salman Rushdie's novel. He has said, \\"The writing of a poem is like a child throwing stones into a mineshaft. You compose first, then you listen for the reverberation.\\" In response to criticisms of his comparatively slim Selected Poems (2006), Fenton warned against the notion of poets churning out poetry in a regular, automated fashion. Fenton has been a frequent contributor to The Guardian, The Independent and The New York Review of Books. He also writes the head column in the editorials of each Friday's Evening Standard. In 2007, he appeared in a list of the \\"100 most influential gay and lesbian people in Britain\\" published by The Independent on Sunday. Fenton's partner is Darryl Pinckney, the prize-winning novelist, playwright and essayist perhaps best known for the novel High Cotton (1992). In February 2019, The Guardian published an article criticising Fenton for his earlier stance on the conductor Robert King, who was convicted of sexually abusing five minors. The 2019 article was by one of the victims of King's repeated abuse; Fenton's earlier article concentrated entirely on the 'professional catastrophe' that King and to a lesser extent his record label would suffer, and made no mention of the harm to the boys, who were talented musicians being mentored by King. ===Musical theatre influence=== Fenton has been influenced in his writing by musical theatre, as evidenced in 'Here Come the Drum Majorettes' from Out of Danger: \\"Gleb meet Glubb. Glubb meet Glob. God that's glum, that glib Glob dig. 'Dig that bog!' 'Frag that frog.' Stap that chap, he snuck that cig.'\\"Quoted in Neil Corcoran ed., Do You, Mr Jones? (2002) p. 185–86 He was the original English librettist for the musical of Les Misérables but Cameron Mackintosh, finding his lyrics uninvolving, replaced him with Herbert Kretzmer; Kretzmer has credited him with creating the general structure of the adaptation. He nonetheless received credit for \\"additional lyrics\\" and considerable royalties. ==Awards and honours== ==Books== * 1968 Our Western Furniture, poetry * 1969 Put Thou Thy Tears Into My Bottle, poetry * 1972 Terminal Moraine * 1978 A Vacant Possession, TNR Publications * 1980 A German Requiem: A Poem, Salamander Press, a pamphlet * 1981 Dead Soldiers, Sycamore Press * 1982 The Memory of War: Poems 1968–1982, Salamander Press, 1982, * 1984 Children in Exile: Poems 1968–1984 Random House, 1984, These poems combined with those from The Memory of War made up the Penguin volume, The Memory of War and Children in Exile; published in the United States as Children in Exile; Salamander Press * 1983 You Were Marvellous, selected theatre reviews published 1979–1981 * 1986 The Snap Revolution * 1987 Partingtime Hall, co-author with John Fuller, Viking / Salamander Press, comical poems * 1988 All the Wrong Places: Adrift in the Politics of the Pacific Rim, reportage; Viking; Atlantic Monthly Press (1988); reissued with a new introduction by Granta (2005) * 1989 Manila Envelope, self-published book of poems * 1994 Out of Danger, Fenton considers this his second collection of poems.

It is one of few dwellings in the village built before the American Civil War to survive intact to this day. The house is notable because of the Civil War era graffiti on many of the walls. The graffiti found includes names, drawings, names of units, and inscriptions left by soldiers. ==History== Because of its location on the Orange & Alexandria Railroad and the Carolina Road, the house, which was less than from the train depot, is thought by the Foundation to have been a commercial building as well as a dwelling. The Foundation reports that some graffiti has been removed or destroyed but considerable graffiti still remain. New graffiti were discovered as recently as December 2010.http://www.brandystationfoundation.com/ \\"Brandy Station Foundation\\". Retrieved July 6, 2011 The house was owned by James Barbour (brother of the railroad's president John S. Barbour Jr.) during the Civil War but the Barbour family's main residence was on a ridge about to the south (and during the war was used by Confederate General J.E.B. Stuart). Barbour served on the staff of Lieutenant General Richard S. Ewell until January 1863. Because of its strategic location near the railroad, this house was used extensively by both the Union Army and Confederate States Army throughout the Civil War. Confederates used it as a field hospital during the Battle of Brandy Station and at other times when battles occurred in the area. It was probably used as a field hospital for wounded soldiers evacuated by train after the Battle of First Bull Run or First Manassas. The earliest known graffiti in the house date to the Second Manassas Campaign in August 1862, as the armies transited Culpeper County. At the outset of the Gettysburg Campaign, the Battle of Brandy Station, the largest cavalry battle ever to take place in North America occurred on June 9, 1863 in the fields adjacent to the Graffiti House and extended to the heights on which the main house stood. After the fighting ended, the lower house was used as a Confederate field hospital. Later that year, Federal troops occupied the building when the Army of the Potomac camped in Culpeper County during the winter of 1863-64. The house was headquarters to Brigadier General Henry Prince, a division commander in the Third Corps of the Army of the Potomac during the Union Army pursuit of the Army of Northern Virginia after its retreat from the Battle of Gettysburg, sometimes called the Rapidan campaign but this name could be confused with the beginning of the Overland Campaign, and during the Mine Run Campaign later in 1863.Warner, Ezra J. Generals in Blue: Lives of the Union Commanders. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1964. . pp. 386-387 The plaster walls on the house's second floor are covered with an outstanding and unique collection of charcoal and pencil graffiti left by soldiers from both armies. In addition to their autographs, the soldiers drew elaborate pictures of men and women, and wrote inscriptions commemorating their units and their battles. After the war, new paint and wallpaper led to their being forgotten. The graffiti were rediscovered during a renovation in 1993. The Brandy Station Foundation purchased the house in 2002, and its website lists the days it is open for viewing. The house includes a small museum and serves as a headquarters for the Brandy Station Foundation and the Foundation's visitor center for the Brandy Station battlefield. ==Graffiti that have been identified== Below is listed the names and units of those who have been identified in the Graffiti House: *Sergeant Allen Bowman, Co.

It had operations in forest management, woodchipping, sawmilling and veneer production. The company was placed into liquidation in March 2013. ==History== Founded in 1875 by brothers John and Thomas Gunn, it was one of Australia's oldest companies. It had over 900 square kilometres of plantations, mainly eucalyptus trees. In 2001 Gunns paid $335 million for Tasmania's biggest woodchip company, North Forest Products, making it Australia's biggest exporter of woodchips. At one stage it became Tasmania's largest private land- owner. The company employed over 1,200 people and had suffered a dramatic turnaround in revenue in its final years, going from a turnover in excess of A$600 million in 2006, to a loss of over $350 million in 2011. Gunns was one of the largest export woodchip operation in the Southern Hemisphere, and one of two chip export companies sourcing raw materials from Tasmanian forests, the other being Neville Smith Forest Products through their SmartFiber branch in Bell Bay. Gunns announced a $900 million loss for 2011–12 and debts of $3 billion. On 25 September 2012, Gunns announced to the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) that its board had decided to put the company into voluntary administration after its financier withdrew its support, and in March 2013 the company was placed into liquidation. New Forests purchased the assets and employed former staff of the old company. ==Operations== The move to expand its base into mainland operation began with the acquisition of Auspine in 2007. In September 2010, Gunns announced that it will end logging of old growth forests and move to plantation timber. In November 2011, the Gunns Mitre 10 stores were re-branded as Beck's Home Timber and Hardware, after being sold to Danks Brothers Hardware Group, a subsidiary of Woolworths Limited. Gunns was placed into voluntary administration on 25 September 2012, and later liquidated, after it was unable to raise further capital or restructure the business. ===Tasmania=== Gunns operated sawmills across the state, as well as three woodchipping mills: Longreach, near Bell Bay; Triabunna, on the east coast; and Hampshire, near Burnie. The company was forced to close all three woodchipping mills and most of its sawmills in 2011. After being placed into voluntary administration in 2012, the Longreach mill was reopened and began exporting woodchips for a time.http://www.examiner.com.au/story/1562987/woodchip-mill-reopens/ In 2008, operations at a sawmill in Scottsdale were restructured, resulting in the loss of 70 jobs. The sackings broke an agreement with the federal government, leading to the cancellation of substantial funding assistance. In the same year, around 135 workers at another Auspine sawmill at Tonganah lost their jobs after a softwood timber contract had gone to a competitor. ===Victoria=== In 2009, the company was awarded a contract to operate a new woodchip processing facility at Portland. The woodchipping mill was later sold off to Australian Bluegum Plantations in 2012, for $61.8 million. ===South Australia=== In South Australia the company managed blue gum plantations on Kangaroo Island. In Jamestown Gunns was a major customer of Morgan Sawmill. Gunns bought the Tarpeena softwood sawmill from the now failed Forest Enterprises Australia, and which was later sold on to Timberlink. ===Western Australia=== Gunns operated three hardwood sawmills in Western Australia. Their nationwide product line of timber flooring included the hardwood, Jarrah, found in the southwest of the state. The timber is reddish-brown when hewn and is, \\"renowned for its beauty, warmth and durability\\". Their environmental initiatives included achieving certification under International standard ISO 14001:2004. Gunns supplied local trade and retail markets from its distribution yard in Welshpool, near Perth. ==Criticism== Anti-pulpmill rally (April 2007) The company has been the focus of criticism from environmentalists, primarily for its four woodchip mills which produce 4 million tonnes of chips for export annually. Green groups claim that native forests are harvested specifically for woodchipping, whereas Gunns claim that the majority of their chips come from residue from their sawmilling and veneer operations. Gunns' major customers are paper producers in Northern Asia, mainly Japan, including Mitsubishi, Nippon and Oji Paper. Gunns has also been criticized for its logging operations in the Styx Valley and for its use of 1080 poison to kill wildlife including protected species (baiting and particularly aerial spraying of forest prior to clearfelling). In 1989, the chairman of Gunns, Edmund Rouse, unsuccessfully attempted to bribe a Labor Party member, Jim Cox, to cross the floor, which would have allowed the pro- logging Tasmanian government of premier Robin Gray and the Liberal Party to resume power. A Royal Commission followed and convicted Rouse. Robin Gray became director of Gunns Limited on 21 February 2000. He retired from the position in 2010. Further allegations of corruption appeared when Paul Lennon, Premier of Tasmania, had his heritage home renovated by a Gunns-owned company at the height of Gunns' push for the Bell Bay Pulp Mill. Lennon refused to disclose how much he paid for the renovations.The Australian. \\"Gunned down\\". John Lyons. 5 October 2007. ===Bell Bay Pulp Mill=== The proposed mill site taken from Kayena, Tasmania The company was planning to build a $2 billion pulp mill in the Tamar Valley, near Launceston. The proposed mill would have used the Kraft process, Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) bleaching, and been fed with plantation eucalypt forest timber. The project was supported by the State Government for the perceived economic and employment benefits which were said to include $6.7 billion in spending over 25 years and 2000 temporary jobs created during the construction phase,http://www.justice.tas.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/82282/Final_ITS_Global_Report.pdf ITS Global Report but was opposed by environmental and social activist groups. Federal Environment Minister Malcolm Turnbull gave approval for the project on Wednesday 3 October 2007.ABC News This decision was however challenged by The Wilderness Society and later overturned on appeal due to alleged flaws discovered in the approval process. ===Gunns 20=== In the 2005 Gunns Limited v Marr & Ors case, Gunns filed a writ in the Supreme Court of Victoria, against 20 individuals and organisations including Senator Bob Brown, for over A$7.8 million . The original list of defendants were: *Bob Brown - federal Greens senator (dropped December 2006) *Simon Leo Brown - settled following certain undertakings not to protest *Adam Burling - Huon Valley Environment Centre - dropped *Brian Dimmick *Doctors for Native Forests Inc. (Split off into separate action in November 2006 and settled as part of Nicklason apology) *Heidi Douglas - The Wilderness Society (TWS). Settled in 2009 following certain undertakings not to protest. *Neal Funnell. Settled in 2009 following self representation and limited undertakings not to protest. *Helen Gee (dropped November 2006) *Lou Geraghty *Russell Hanson - TWS. Settled in 2007 following certain undertakings not to protest. *the Huon Valley Environment Centre Inc. *Geoff Law - TWS. Settled in September 2008 with damages of $15,000 awarded to Gunns. *Alec Marr - TWS. Settled in May 2008 with damages of $45,000 and costs of $70,000 awarded to Gunns. *Leanne Minshull - Settled with TWS 2008 agreement *Louise Morris - Settled in 2009 following self representation limited undertakings not to protest. *Ben Morrow. Settled in May 2008 with damages of $45,000 and costs of $70,000 awarded to Gunns. *Frank Nicklason - Settled following written public apology from Nicklason withdrawing claims of legionella in woodchip piles. *Peter Pullinger (dropped November 2006) *Margaret (Peg) Putt - Greens MHA (dropped December 2006) *The Wilderness Society Inc.Settled in May 2008 with damages of $45,000 and costs of $70,000 awarded to Gunns. Some members of the \\"Gunns 20\\" at a protest rally, December 2004 (Bob Brown centre, Peg Putt right) Gunns claims that the defendants have sullied its reputation and caused it to lose jobs and profits. The defendants claim that they are protecting the environment. The defendants have become collectively known as the \\"Gunns 20\\".Gunns, greenies and the law by Andrew Darby, The Age, 29 August 2006. Accessed 10 June 2007 Opponents and critics of the case have suggested that the writ was filed with the intent to discourage public criticism of the company, in a similar vein to a Strategic lawsuit against public participation, commonly used in North America, and the English McLibel case of McDonald's Restaurants against environmental activists Helen Steel and David Morris over a pamphlet critical of the company. Gunns has maintained the position that they are merely trying to prevent parties enjoined to the writ from undertaking unlawful activities that disrupt their business. The statement of claim alleged incidents of assault against forestry workers and vandalism. At a hearing before the Supreme Court of Victoria, an amended statement of claim lodged by the company and served on defendants on 1 July 2005 was dismissed. However, the judge in the case granted the company leave to lodge a third version of their statement of claim with the court no later than 15 August 2005. The application continued before the court, before being brought to a close on 20 October 2006. In his ruling, The Honourable Justice Bongiorno, made an award of costs in favour of the respondents. In November 2006, Gunns dropped the case against Helen Gee, Peter Pullinger and Doctors for Forests. In December 2006, it abandoned the claim against Greens MPs Bob Brown and Peg Putt. The other matters were all settled. ===Redevelopment of Triabunna Woodchipping Mill=== In 2011, online travel entrepreneur Graeme Wood (Wotif.com) and outdoor wear entrepreneur Jan Cameron (Kathmandu) purchased the Triabunna Mill from Gunns for $10 million, out- maneuvering rival forest-related bids by providing prompt payment. Wood and Cameron, both wealthy environmentalists, planned to redevelop the site as an eco-friendly tourist resort or theme park. The instigator of the negotiations was Alec Marr, formerly head of the Wilderness Society. When Tony Abbott later became Prime Minister, he and Eric Abetz wanted to compulsorily acquire the mill for woodchipping. To forestall this plan, Alec Marr secretly recruited three ship welders and an electrician, and they smashed up the control room and other critical infrastructure, so that the mill could never be in operation again. ===Insider trading=== In August 2013, the former CEO John Gay, who had presided over much of Gunns' latter years (1986 to 2010) including its disastrous demise, was convicted of insider trading relating to his sale of company shares in December 2009 just prior to a shock announcement of a half-year profit collapse of 98%.https://www.examiner.com.au/story/4495574/the-rise-and-fall-of-gunns/ ==See also== *Bob Brown *Graeme Wood *Jan Cameron *Woodchipping in Australia == References == ==Further reading== * * * == External links == * Gunns Limited * Pulp Mill Project * Gunns on SourceWatch * Gunns Limited overview from The Wilderness Society.

According to the , it has a population of people. Pila is a third class municipality in the province of Laguna, Philippines. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 46,534 people. Pila has a total land area of 31.2 km². The town of Pila is the site for some well-preserved houses dating back to the Spanish period as well as the old Saint Anthony of Padua Parish Church, the first Antonine church in the Philippines. Don Felizardo Rivera, who donated his lands to the church and municipal government, is the recognized founder of Pila. He is the ancestor of prominent families in Pila surnamed Rivera, Relova, Agra and Álava. This also served as a location for the reality show, The Amazing Race Asia 2 and the ABS-CBN daytime drama hit series Be Careful With My Heart. ==History== ===Pre- Hispanic Pila=== Pila and adjacent towns along the shores of Laguna de Bay are considered by archaeologists as one of the oldest settlements in the Philippines. The community is one of three such concentrations of population known archaeologically to have been in place before A.D. 1000. Archaeologists recovered in Pinagbayanan potteries and artifacts that indicate considerable settlement in the area during the Late Tang Dynasty (900 A.D.). Archaeologists also recovered ancient horse bones ending the debate on whether the Spaniards brought them or not. The scientists were able to uncover Philippines’ oldest crematorium in the same area. It is worthwhile to note that the oldest Philippine document, the 900 A.D. Laguna Copperplate Inscription, mentioned Pila (as Pailah) twice and its ruler Jayadewa. Pre-Hispanic Pila was one of the biggest barangay domains in Southern Luzon. Its leader was not only the local chief but also the regional datu. The bards of the shore towns of the Morong Peninsula across the lake from Pila sang of the exploits of Gat Salyan Maguinto, the “gold-rich” datu of Pila who extended his kingdom far and wide into their settlements. In fact, the greater territory was also called Pila. Wary of concentrating power on a noble Indio, the conquistadors later dismantled his realm and to avoid confusion, they changed the name of the Pila dependencies to Pililla, which means “minor Pila.” The original territory had encompassed the present towns of Morong (from which the town of Pililla or Pilang Morong separated in 1583); Baras (separated from Morong in 1588); Tanay (separated from Pililla in 1606); Jala-jala whose old name was also Pila (separated from Pililla in 1786) and Talim Island, which until now, has a sitio Pila. The descendants of Gat Salyan were also regarded as the founders of the other towns of the present province of Rizal. Around 1375, due to some calamity of weather most probably flooding, the original seat of Pila had to be abandoned and the barangay transferred to Pagalangan, which signifies “the place of Reverence”. The Franciscan chronicler, Fray Juan Plasencia gathered that the datu of Pila, “ with his own gold” purchased the new site from another chief who had owned it and who thus moved to another place. The datu then farmed out the arable land among the nobles and the freemen who, in return, paid him an annual rent of a hundred ganta of rice Even before the coming of the Spaniards, Pila was already noted for its spiritual ambiance. The center of the town was known as Pagalangan, which means “The Place of Reverence.” ===Coming of the Franciscans=== In 1571, the Spanish conquistadors, led by Don Juan de Salcedo, “discovered” Pila in Pagalangan after the “pacification” of Manila. On 14 November of the same year Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, the first Spanish governor-general, awarded the encomienda (tributes) of Pagalangan and other Laguna villages to Don Francisco de Herrera, a regidor (councilman) of Manila. With the reorganization of the encomiendas in 1575, the tributes of Pila were granted to Don Hernando Ramirez on 29 July. The Franciscans arrived in 1578 to evangelize the people of Pila and soon afterward built a church dedicated to St. Anthony of Padua, the first Antonine house of worship in the Philippines. Due to the nobleness and mildness of the character of its inhabitants, the Spanish leadership honored the town with an exceptional title La Noble Villa de Pila, one of five villas named by the Spaniards in the 16th and 17th century in the Philippines. During this period, the demesne of Pila includes Victoria, Laguna, and Jala-Jala, Rizal. Church of Pila, built in 1849. The Franciscans established in Pila the second printing press in the Philippines in 1611 under the auspices of Tomas Pinpin and Domingo Loag. The press printed in 1613, Philippines’ oldest dictionary and the first book printed using the movable type, the Vocabulario de Lengua Tagala. The book was written and compiled by Fray Pedro de San Buenaventura and printed by Tomas Pinpin, the Prince of Filipino printers. The book is twenty-seven years older than the Bay Psalm Book, the first book printed in the United States in 1640. At the beginning of the 19th century, the town was transferred from Pagalangan to the present site of Santa Clara because of perennial flooding. ==Barangays== Pila is politically subdivided into 17 barangays. In 1957, the sitio of Pinagbayanan was converted into a barrio. * Aplaya * Bagong Pook * Bukal * Bulilan Norte (Poblacion) * Bulilan Sur (Poblacion) * Concepcion * Labuin * Linga * Masico * Mojon * Pansol * Pinagbayanan * San Antonio * San Miguel * Santa Clara Norte (Poblacion) * Santa Clara Sur (Poblacion) * Tubuan * Bukal ==Climate== ==Demographics== In the , the population of Pila, Laguna, was people, with a density of . ==Landmarks== The National Historical Institute of the Philippines (now National Historical Commission of the Philippines) declared the town plaza and surrounding ancestral houses a National Historical Landmark on May 17, 2000 by NHI Resolution no. 2, series of 2002. It cited Pila as an early pre-Hispanic center of culture and trade in Laguna known as La Noble Villa de Pila and has been recognized as one of the country's more important archeological sites where clay potteries were discovered in excavations made in Pinagbayanan in 1967. The historic town of Pila is bounded by General Luna Street in the north, M. H. del Pilar Street in the east, Mabini Street in the south, and Bonifacio Street in the west, and including the Pila Elementary School, and the Juan Fuentes and Santiago Fernandez house. Two years later, on July 9, 2002, the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Pablo proclaimed the parish church of San Antonio de Padua de Pila as the Diocesan Shrine of St. Anthony. According to Philippine historian, Dr. Luciano Santiago, it is the only town in the Philippines that is formally recognized as a historical site by both the church and the state. === San Antonio de Padua de Pila Parish Church === Facade of the San Antonio de Padua Parish in Pila, Laguna The original Pila church was built in Pagalangan in the 1578 with Rev. Juan de Florencia serving as its first priest. The whole structure, including the convent, was completed in 1618. The church was then transferred to its present location at the town square in 1800 due to frequent flooding in the original town center. Transfer and reconstruction of the church was finished along with the convent in 1849. Both however, were severely damaged by an earthquake in 1880. It was once more built in the early 19th century after the damage caused by the earthquake. The church was luckily spared from the ravages of WWII. Pila Church is among the oldest churches in Laguna. This is evident in its strong stone structure. Its red bell tower is one of its distinguishable features. The church is dedicated to Saint Anthony of Padua and it was declared by the Pontificate of Pope John Paul II as the Diocesan Shrine of the said saint on July 9, 2002. Inside, wood is prominently seen as the material of choice for the chairs and altar. The altar is a massive structure that holds a relic of St. Anthony's garment.Pila Museum === Pila Museum === Pila Museum is one of the Municipal Museums in Laguna—the other one being in Paete. The museum is under the direct jurisdiction of the office of the mayor of Pila. It was built through the efforts of the Pila Historical Society Foundation, a group of concerned citizens that seek to preserve the cultural heritage of Pila. The museum was built on November 10, 1993, from funds raised by the foundation. The foundation was also responsible for securing the declaration of the town as a National Historical Landmark, which was granted in the year 2000. The declaration was formalized by the installation of a landmark in the middle of the open field adjacent to the museum on December 4, 2007, with former President Ramos as the guest of honor. It occupies a part of the Pila Elementary School with an area of about 50 square meters. The majority of what is contained within are artifacts dating from the Chinese period like jars, plates and jugs. The rest of the exhibit consist of American period appliances like sewing machines, Bakelite telephones, and adding machines. Most of the Chinese period artifacts were dug from the Pinagbayanan Crematorium while others were donated by old families in the town. The Elizalde family donated 250–300 specimens to the Pila museum—with the museum also donated by them. The contents of the museum were transferred to a heritage building in 1994. Some of the specimens given are the following: * Celadon Dishes with fish motifs * Qingbai and blue and white jarlets * Lead-glazed water droppers and teapots * Carabao figurines * Brown wares * Iron and glass bracelets * Gold or copper colored beads and earrings === Old Ancestral Houses === Corazon Rivera House from Pila, Laguna It is a common misconception that the old ancestral houses are Hispanic in design. According to the town's curator and tourism officer however, these houses were built during the early American period. A number of them are still in pristine condition, preserved by the descendants of the original owners of the house while some are converted into shops and cafés. A majority of the houses within the site are derelict but the town officials are taking action to restore these architectural treasures. Some of the old ancestral houses: * Casto Maceda / Concha Monserrat house * Corazon Rivera House * Jose Agra / Rosario Villarica house * Teodora Alava House Pila Municipal Hall === Pila Municipal Hall === The Pila Municipal Hall is a small and quaint structure right in front of the Pila Church. It is distinguishable by its white paint scheme with red tiled roof and brown pillars. Outside is a statue of Rizal standing guard in memoriam to the national hero. The hall has been situated there since 1931 and has been renovated time and again. The open field in front of the hall serves as a waiting spots for those with appointments to the mayor or any public official. Parking space is adequate and tricycles parked near the hall can be easily hailed to go about town. As with any municipal hall, it houses the local post office, the assessor's office, the local internal revenue office, and health center. Unlike most municipal halls, the office of the Tourism officer is not located within but is stationed at the Pila Museum. == Archaeology == Esso Standard Philippines and Elizalde Family Project funded an archaeological project along Laguna de Bay. It was supervised by Dr. Robert Fox and Mr. Avelino Legaspi of the Anthropology Department of the National Museum.Valdes, C. (2005, September 12). Treasures of Pila. Retrieved December 7, 2015, from http://treasuresofpila.bayangpinagpala.org/2005/09/pila-in-ancient- times.html?m=1 In total, there were ten excavations from May to October 1967. Talim Island, Balibago, and Rizal were the first to be excavated. It was followed by Pinagbayanan and Bagong Pook. Pila and Lumban were the last site to be excavated. Three of the four sites mentioned exposed 153 graves aging from the 12th to 15th century. === Access to trade === As a place situated along the Laguna de Bay, Pila was an accessible area for foreign trade. Vessels filled with merchants carrying goods and services traded with the locals for their products. Since the Laguna de Bay is connected to the Manila Bay, the geographical area covered by the trade before was wide. The items retrieved from the area were of very good quality and expensive looking. This indicates that the people that once lived in Pila were wealthy. === Cremation activities === Professor Henry Otley Beyer pointed out that cremation was once practiced in Novaliches. In Pila's case, the team members found traces of cremation practice in the site. In their data, 40% of the cremated remains were found to be buried in soil and the remaining 60% were found in medium- sized jars. In Pinagbayanan, the cremation burials were secondary burials. In the first phase, the body is let alone to decompose. It is then followed by a ritual performance. The body is burned because, according to the belief of ancient people, the “spirit is as clean as though washed in gold\\" once the body is set on fire. ===Stratigraphy of the Pinagbayanan Excavation === Six major layers:Tenazas, R., & Locsin, L.

Italo disco evolved from the then-current underground dance, pop, and electronic music, both domestic and foreign (American hi-NRG, French Euro disco) and developed into a diverse genre. The genre employs electronic drums, drum machines, synthesizers, and occasionally vocoders. It is usually sung in English, and to a lesser extent in Italian and Spanish. The origin of the genre's name is strongly tied to marketing efforts of the ZYX record label, which began licensing and marketing the music outside Italy in 1982.Folklore that ZYX boss Bernhard Mikulski coined the term Italo-disco in 1983 was long published on Wikipedia, but is unsubstantiated; to date, reliable third-party documentation has not been found to support whether ZYX label boss Mikulski himself named it, or whether ZYX was even the first to publish the term; it could just as easily have been a descriptor people were already using before someone at ZYX picked up on it. Italo disco faded in the early 1990s and then split into many genres. (Eurobeat, Italo house, Italo dance) ==Terminology== The term \\"Italo\\", a generic prefix meaning Italian, had been used on pop music compilation albums in Germany as early as 1978, such as Italo Top Hits on the K-Tel label and the first volume of Italo Super Hits on the Ariola label. There is no documentation of where the term \\"Italo-Disco\\" first appeared, but its origins are generally traced to Italian and other European disco recordings released in the German market. Examples include the phrase \\"Original Italo-Disco\\" on the sleeve of the German edition of \\"Girls on Me\\" by Amin-Peck in 1982, and the 1983 compilation album The Best of Italo- Disco. These records, along with the Italo Boot Mix megamix, were released by Bernhard Mikulski on his ZYX label, who was therefore credited with coining the term \\"Italo disco\\". The Best of and Boot Mix compilations each became a 16-volume series that culminated in 1991. Both series primarily featured disco music of Italian origin, often licensed from independent Italian labels which had limited distribution outside Italy, as well as songs in a similar style by other European artists. The presenters of the Italian music show Discoring (produced by RAI) usually referred to Italo disco tracks as \\"rock elettronico\\" (electronic rock) or \\"balli da discoteca\\" (disco dance) before the term \\"Italo disco\\" came into existence. ==History== ===Origins: 1977–1983=== Italo disco originated in Europe in the late 1970s. After Disco Demolition Night in 1979, American interest in disco sharply declined, whereas in Europe the genre maintained a greater degree of mainstream popularity and survived into the 1980s. As the early 1980s proceeded and popular tastes changed, fewer and fewer English-speaking artists were producing new disco records. Italian disc jockeys who played disco therefore had to rely on imports, which proved prohibitively expensive in many cases. In response to these challenges, Italian producers and musicians began to create their own original productions in order to bridge the gap. As with many musical styles, Italo disco spawned multiple subgenres, overlapped with other styles, and evolved over time rather than distinctively appearing at one point and then disappearing at another. Therefore, there is no consensus regarding when the genre began or when the first Italo disco record was released. However, Italian producers had been creating disco music since at least 1977, and there is general agreement that Italo disco's roots lie in traditional disco. The adoption of synthesizers and other electronic instruments by disco artists led to electronic dance music, which spawned many subgenres such as hi-NRG in America and space disco in Europe. Italo disco's influences include Italian producer Giorgio Moroder, French musician Didier Marouani, French drummer Cerrone, and the San Francisco-based Hi-NRG producer Patrick Cowley, who worked with singers as Sylvester and Paul Parker. Italo disco often features electronic sounds, electronic drums, drum machines, catchy melodies, vocoders, overdubs, and heavily accented English lyrics. By 1983, Italo disco's instrumentation was predominantly electronic. Along with love, Italo disco themes deal with robots and space, sometimes combining all three in songs like \\"Robot Is Systematic\\" (1982) by 'Lectric Workers and \\"Spacer Woman\\" (1983) by Charlie.In 1983, there were frequent hit singles, and labels such as American Disco, Crash, Merak, Sensation and X-Energy appeared. The popular label Discomagic Records released more than thirty singles within the year. It was also the year that the term \\"Italo disco\\" became widely known outside Italy, with the release of the first volumes of The Best of Italo Disco compilation series on the German record label ZYX. After 1983, Italo disco was also produced outside Italy. Although Italo disco was successful in mainland Europe during the 1980s, it never gained mainstream popularity in the United Kingdom, although several individual songs did become hits there, such as Ryan Paris's \\"Dolce Vita\\", Laura Branigan's \\"Self Control\\", Baltimora's \\"Tarzan Boy\\", Spagna's \\"Call Me\\" and Sabrina's \\"Boys\\". Italo disco found greater success in underground music scenes in the UK, and the genre's influence can be heard in the music of several British electronic acts such as the Pet Shop Boys, Erasure and New Order. ===Derivative styles: 1982–1990=== Canada, particularly Quebec, produced several remarkable Italo disco acts, including Trans X (\\"Living on Video\\"), Lime (\\"Angel Eyes\\"), Rational Youth (\\"City of Night\\"), Pluton & the Humanoids (\\"World Invaders\\"), Purple Flash Orchestra (\\"We Can Make It\\"), and Tapps (\\"Forbidden Lover\\"). Those productions were called \\"Canadian disco\\" during 1980–1984 in Europe and hi-NRG disco in the U.S. In Germany, Italo disco is known as Euro disco and discofox. In English-speaking countries, it was called Italo disco and hi-NRG. German productions were sung in English and were characterized by an emphasis on melody, exaggerated production, and a more earnest approach to the themes of love; examples may be found in the works of Modern Talking, Fancy, American-born singer and Fancy protégé Grant Miller, Bad Boys Blue, Joy, Silent Circle, the Twins, Lian Ross, C. C. Catch, Blue System and London Boys. During the mid-1980s, spacesynth, a subgenre of Italo disco, developed. It was mostly instrumental, featured space sounds, and was exemplified by musicians such as Koto, Proxyon, Rofo, Cyber People, Hipnosis, Laserdance and Mike Mareen (whose music inhabited the spacesynth/hi- NRG overlap). ===Evolved and interrelated genres=== As Italo disco declined in Europe, Italian and German producers adapted the sound to Japanese tastes, creating \\"Eurobeat\\". Music produced in this style is sold exclusively in Japan due to the country's Para Para culture, produced by Italian producers for the Japanese market. The two most famous Eurobeat labels are A-Beat-C Records and Time Records. One traditional Italo disco label, S.A.I.F.A.M., still produces Eurobeat music for Japan. Around 1989 in Italy, Italo disco evolved into Italo house when Italian Italo disco artists experimented with harder beats and the \\"house\\" sound. ===Revival: 1998–present=== A big comeback of German disco began in 1998, when Modern Talking reunited. Rete 4 channel in Italy, Hits 24, Goldstar TV, and ProSieben channels in Germany, and the program Nostalgia on Spain's TVE channel started to broadcast Italo disco. Several online radio stations stream the genre. The renewed popularity has inspired re-releases and new mixes by many of the original Italo disco record labels. ZYX Records has released many new CD mixes since 2000. Panama Records and Radius Records have re-released Italo tracks on vinyl. Northern European labels I Venti d'Azzurro (The Netherlands) and Flashback Records (Finland) have produced unreleased demos, new versions of old hits, and new songs. ==Related styles and legacy== ===Spacesynth=== At least one modern history of \\"space disco\\" traces the genre's origins to science fiction themes (outer space, robots, and the future) in the titles, lyrics and cover artwork of dance music in the late 1970s. Plausible associations are drawn between the popularity of Star Wars (released mid-1977), the subsequent surge in interest in science fiction themes in popular culture, and the release of a number of science fiction themed and \\"futuristic\\"-sounding (synthesizer and arpeggiator-infused) disco music worldwide. ====Space disco==== Music at the crossroads of Italo disco, electro and synth-pop, characterized by \\"vocoderized harmony vocals\\" (Mr. Flagio's \\"Take a Chance\\") and \\"futuristic synth melodies\\" (Kano's \\"Cosmic Voyager\\"), was later dubbed space synth or space disco. In later years it was also influenced by Brazilian music, funk, and jazz fusion (See also: Afro/cosmic music). In modern histories, early examples of space disco usually include the music of the French band Space, and \\"I Feel Space\\" by Lindstrøm. Labels producing this type of music include * Whatever We Want Records (Brooklyn, NY, USA) * Lindstrøm's Feedelity (Europe) * Eskimo , Bear Entertainment/Bear Funk, Prins Thomas' Full Pupp (Belgium) * Tirk (UK) and D. C. Recordings (UK). ===Post-disco and house music=== New York City-based post- disco record label Emergency Records specialized in reissuing/selling records from Italy (e.g. Kano \\"I'm Ready\\"), since the 1970s. Kano, a moniker of Anglo- Caribbean DJ Glen White, is noted for incorporating American musical elements (\\"heavy funk\\" influences, \\"breakbeat\\" rhythm, the use of vocoder) with electronic music while using rudimentary synthesizers, constituting one of the earliest forms of Italo disco. This form of Americanized Italo disco, that also includes Klein + M.B.O. (\\"Dirty Talk\\", \\"Wonderful\\", \\"The M. B. O. Theme\\"), re-entered the States and was known to be influential on the development of house music. Doctor's Cat (\\"Feel the Drive\\"), likewise, was one of the earliest \\"house music\\" songs.

On each graph, the x-axis variable is the type of phenotypic trait and the y-axis variable is the amount of organisms. Group A is the original population and Group B is the population after selection. Graph 1 shows directional selection, in which a single extreme phenotype is favored. Graph 2 depicts stabilizing selection, where the intermediate phenotype is favored over the extreme traits. Graph 3 shows disruptive selection, in which the extreme phenotypes are favored over the intermediate. A chart showing three types of selection Disruptive selection, also called diversifying selection, describes changes in population genetics in which extreme values for a trait are favored over intermediate values. In this case, the variance of the trait increases and the population is divided into two distinct groups. In this more individuals acquire peripheral character value at both ends of the distribution curve.Sinervo, Barry. 1997. Disruptive Selection in Adaptation and Selection. 13 April 2010.Lemmon, Alan R. 2000. EvoTutor. Natural Selection: Modes of Selection . 13 April 2010. == Overview == Natural selection is known to be one of the most important biological processes behind evolution. There are many variations of traits, and some cause greater or lesser reproductive success of the individual. Selection's effect is to promote certain alleles, traits, and individuals that have a higher chance to survive and reproduce in their specific environment. Since the environment has a carrying capacity, nature acts on this mode of selection on individuals to let only the most fit offspring survive and reproduce to their full potential. The more advantageous the trait is the more common it will become in the population. Disruptive selection is a specific type of natural selection that actively selects against the intermediate in a population, favoring both extremes of the spectrum. Disruptive selection is inferred to oftentimes lead to sympatric speciation through a phyletic gradualism mode of evolution. Disruptive selection can be caused or influenced by multiple factors and also have multiple outcomes, in addition to speciation. Individuals within the same environment can develop a preference for extremes of a trait, against the intermediate. Selection can act on having divergent body morphologies in accessing food, such as beak and dental structure. It is seen that often this is more prevalent in environments where there is not a wide clinal range of resources, causing heterozygote disadvantage or selection against the average. Niche partitioning allows for selection of differential patterns of resource usage, which can drive speciation. To the contrast, niche conservation pulls individuals toward ancestral ecological traits in an evolutionary tug-of-war. Also, nature tends to have a 'jump on the band wagon' perspective when something beneficial is found. This can lead to the opposite occurring with disruptive selection eventually selecting against the average; when everyone starts taking advantage of that resource it will become depleted and the extremes will be favored. Furthermore, gradualism is a more realistic view when looking at speciation as compared to punctuated equilibrium. Disruptive selection can initially rapidly intensify divergence; this is because it is only manipulating alleles that already exist. Often it is not creating new ones by mutation which takes a long time. Usually complete reproductive isolation does not occur until many generations, but behavioral or morphological differences separate the species from reproducing generally. Furthermore, generally hybrids have reduced fitness which promotes reproductive isolation.Abrams, P.A., Leimar, O., Rueffler, C., Van Dooren, J.M. 2006. Disruptive selection and then what? Trends in Ecology & Evolution Vol. 21 Issue 5:238-245. == Example == Suppose there is a population of rabbits. The color of the rabbits is governed by two incompletely dominant traits: black fur, represented by \\"B\\", and white fur, represented by \\"b\\". A rabbit in this population with a genotype of \\"BB\\" would have a phenotype of black fur, a genotype of \\"Bb\\" would have grey fur (a display of both black and white), and a genotype of \\"bb\\" would have white fur. If this population of rabbits occurred in an environment that had areas of black rocks as well as areas of white rocks, the rabbits with black fur would be able to hide from predators amongst the black rocks, and the rabbits with white fur likewise amongst the white rocks. The rabbits with grey fur, however, would stand out in all areas of the habitat, and would thereby suffer greater predation. As a consequence of this type of selective pressure, our hypothetical rabbit population would be disruptively selected for extreme values of the fur color trait: white or black, but not grey. This is an example of underdominance (heterozygote disadvantage) leading to disruptive selection. ==Sympatric speciation== It is believed that disruptive selection is one of the main forces that drive sympatric speciation in natural populations. The pathways that lead from disruptive selection to sympatric speciation seldom are prone to deviation; such speciation is a domino effect that depends on the consistency of each distinct variable. These pathways are the result of disruptive selection in intraspecific competition; it may cause reproductive isolation, and finally culminate in sympatric speciation. It is important to keep in mind that disruptive selection does not always have to be based on intraspecific competition. It is also important to know that this type of natural selection is similar to the other ones. Where it is not the major factor, intraspecific competition can be discounted in assessing the operative aspects of the course of adaptation. For example, what may drive disruptive selection instead of intraspecific competition might be polymorphisms that lead to reproductive isolation, and thence to speciation. When disruptive selection is based on intraspecific competition, the resulting selection in turn promotes ecological niche diversification and polymorphisms. If multiple morphs (phenotypic forms) occupy different niches, such separation could be expected to promote reduced competition for resources. Disruptive selection is seen more often in high density populations rather than in low density populations because intraspecific competition tends to be more intense within higher density populations. This is because higher density populations often imply more competition for resources. The resulting competition drives polymorphisms to exploit different niches or changes in niches in order to avoid competition. If one morph has no need for resources used by another morph, then it is likely that neither would experience pressure to compete or interact, thereby supporting the persistence and possibly the intensification of the distinctness of the two morphs within the population. This theory does not necessarily have a lot of supporting evidence in natural populations, but it has been seen many times in experimental situations using existing populations. These experiments further support that, under the right situations (as described above), this theory could prove to be true in nature. When intraspecific competition is not at work disruptive selection can still lead to sympatric speciation and it does this through maintaining polymorphisms. Once the polymorphisms are maintained in the population, if assortative mating is taking place, then this is one way that disruptive selection can lead in the direction of sympatric speciation. If different morphs have different mating preferences then assortative mating can occur, especially if the polymorphic trait is a \\"magic trait\\", meaning a trait that is under ecological selection and in turn has a side effect on reproductive behavior. In a situation where the polymorphic trait is not a magic trait then there has to be some kind of fitness penalty for those individuals who do not mate assortatively and a mechanism that causes assortative mating has to evolve in the population. For example, if a species of butterflies develops two kinds of wing patterns, crucial to mimicry purposes in their preferred habitat, then mating between two butterflies of different wing patterns leads to an unfavorable heterozygote. Therefore, butterflies will tend to mate with others of the same wing pattern promoting increased fitness, eventually eliminating the heterozygote altogether. This unfavorable heterozygote generates pressure for a mechanism that cause assortative mating which will then lead to reproductive isolation due to the production of post-mating barriers. It is actually fairly common to see sympatric speciation when disruptive selection is supporting two morphs, specifically when the phenotypic trait affects fitness rather than mate choice. In both situations, one where intraspecific competition is at work and the other where it is not, if all these factors are in place, they will lead to reproductive isolation, which can lead to sympatric speciation. ==Other outcomes== * polymorphism * sexual dimorphism * phenotypic plasticity == Significance == Disruptive selection is of particular significance in the history of evolutionary study, as it is involved in one of evolution's \\"cardinal cases\\", namely the finch populations observed by Darwin in the Galápagos. He observed that the species of finches were similar enough to ostensibly have been descended from a single species. However, they exhibited disruptive variation in beak size. This variation appeared to be adaptively related to the seed size available on the respective islands (big beaks for big seeds, small beaks for small seeds). Medium beaks had difficulty retrieving small seeds and were also not tough enough for the bigger seeds, and were hence maladaptive. While it is true that disruptive selection can lead to speciation, this is not as quick or straightforward of a process as other types of speciation or evolutionary change. This introduces the topic of gradualism, which is a slow but continuous accumulation of changes over long periods of time. This is largely because the results of disruptive selection are less stable than the results of directional selection (directional selection favors individuals at only one end of the spectrum). For example, let us take the mathematically straightforward yet biologically improbable case of the rabbits: Suppose directional selection were taking place. The field only has dark rocks in it, so the darker the rabbit, the more effectively it can hide from predators. Eventually there will be a lot of black rabbits in the population (hence many \\"B\\" alleles) and a lesser amount of grey rabbits (who contribute 50% chromosomes with \\"B\\" allele and 50% chromosomes with \\"b\\" allele to the population). There will be few white rabbits (not very many contributors of chromosomes with \\"b\\" allele to the population). This could eventually lead to a situation in which chromosomes with \\"b\\" allele die out, making black the only possible color for all subsequent rabbits. The reason for this is that there is nothing \\"boosting\\" the level of \\"b\\" chromosomes in the population. They can only go down, and eventually die out. Consider now the case of disruptive selection. The result is equal numbers of black and white rabbits, and hence equal numbers of chromosomes with \\"B\\" or \\"b\\" allele, still floating around in that population. Every time a white rabbit mates with a black one, only gray rabbits results. So, in order for the results to \\"click\\", there needs to be a force causing white rabbits to choose other white rabbits, and black rabbits to choose other black ones. In the case of the finches, this \\"force\\" was geographic/niche isolation. ==See also== * Character displacement * Balancing selection * Directional selection * Negative selection (natural selection) * Stabilizing selection * Sympatric speciation * Fluctuating selection * Selection ==References== Category:Selection ","title":"Disruptive selection"},{"id":"1275984","text":"On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation (19 April 1817) is a book by David Ricardo on economics.See via Google Books The book concludes that land rent grows as population increases. It also presents the theory of comparative advantage, the theory that free trade between two or more countries can be mutually beneficial, even when one country has an absolute advantage over the other countries in all areas of production. During the Napoleonic Wars, Ricardo grew weary of the Corn Laws, a tax imposed on wheat by the British that made it impossible to import wheat from the rest of Europe. “Corn Meets Iron.” A Little History of Economics, by Niall Kishtainy, Yale University Press, 2018, pp. 37–42. Ricardo, despite his wealth, supported those who could no longer afford grains and bread once the price floor was in effect to support farmers. In his argument, for what is now free trade, Ricardo highlights the idea that if a country can get a good from another country at a lower cost, it would behoove a country to source that item from the cheaper producing country than to produce the good locally. “To produce the wine in Portugal, might require only the labour of 80 men for one year, and to produce the cloth in the same country, might require the labour of 90 men for the same time. It would therefore be advantageous for her to export wine in exchange for cloth.”Ricardo, David. On The Principles of Political Economy and Taxation. John Murray, 1817. Ricardo’s theory demonstrates that a country, when choosing between two goods to produce and trade, could still achieve an advantage by focusing on the good requiring fewer resources to produce, even if the country does not have an absolute advantage in that good. This allow countries with an absolute advantage in multiple goods, or with no absolute advantage at all, to still benefit from international trade. Ricardo claims in the preface that Turgot, James Steuart, Adam Smith, Jean-Baptiste Say, Sismondi, and others had not written enough \\"satisfactory information\\" on the topics of rent, profit, and wages. Principles of Political Economy is Ricardo's effort to fill that gap in the literature. Regardless of whether the book achieved that goal, it secured, according to Ronald Max Hartwell, Ricardo's position among the great classical economists Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus, John Stuart Mill, and Karl Marx. In his book Adam's Fallacy: A Guide to Economic Theology, economist Duncan K. Foley highlights that in the Principles Ricardo criticizes Adam Smith's treatment of the theory of value and distribution for circular reasoning, in particular as far as concerns rent, and that Ricardo considers the labor theory of value, properly understood, a more logically sound basis for political economic reasoning. Foley also discusses the chapter On Machinery, which Ricardo included in his third and final (1821) version of Principles. Here Ricardo famously analysed the impact of the adoption of machinery on the different classes of society, revising his earlier view that mechanization could be expected to be of benefit to each of the classes of the society. The increase in productivity due to mechanization lowers the production costs and thus also the real prices of commodities. Whereas the landowning class and capitalists benefit from the lower prices, workers in contrast do not reap such benefit from the lower prices if capitalists reduce the wage fund in order to finance the expensive machinery, causing technological unemployment among workers.

It has been known since ancient times and recorded by various cultures. The explanation of this illusion is still debated. ==Proof of illusion== The angle that the full Moon subtends at an observer's eye can be measured directly with a theodolite to show that it remains constant as the Moon rises or sinks in the sky. Photographs of the Moon at different elevations also show that its size remains the same. A simple way of demonstrating that the effect is an illusion is to hold a small pebble (say, wide) at arm's length () with one eye closed, positioning the pebble so that it covers (eclipses) the full Moon when high in the night sky. Then, when the seemingly very large Moon is on the horizon, the same pebble will also cover it, revealing that there has been no change in the size of the Moon, because the pebble will still cover the Moon. Between different full moons, the Moon's angular diameter can vary from 29.43 arcminutes at apogee to 33.5 arcminutes at perigee—an increase of around 14% in apparent diameter or 30% in apparent area. This is because of the eccentricity of the Moon's orbit. ==Possible explanations== The moon looks larger near distant buildings than nearby ones in this simulated skyline The size of a viewed object can be measured objectively either as an angular size (the visual angle that it subtends at the eye, corresponding to the proportion of the visual field that it occupies), or as physical size (its real size measured in, say, meters). Perceived size is only loosely related to these concepts, however. For example, if two identical, familiar objects are placed at distances of five and ten meters, respectively, then the more distant object subtends approximately half the visual angle of the nearer object, but it is normally perceived to be the same size (a phenomenon referred to as size constancy), not as half the size. Conversely, if the more distant object did subtend the same angle as the nearer object then it is normally perceived to be twice as big. One question concerning the Moon illusion, therefore, is whether the horizon Moon appears larger because its perceived angular size seems greater, or because its perceived physical size seems greater, or some combination of both. There is currently no consensus on this point. Most recent research on the Moon illusion has been conducted by psychologists specializing in human perception. The 1989 book The Moon Illusion, edited by Hershenson, offers about 24 chapters written by various illusion researchers reaching different conclusions. After reviewing the many different explanations in their 2002 book The Mystery of the Moon Illusion, Ross and Plug conclude \\"No single theory has emerged victorious\\". They argue that the size of the illusion is variable, but is usually an apparent increase in diameter of about 50 percent. The most important factor is the sight of the terrain, but there is a small contribution from other factors such as the angle of regard, posture and eye movements. ===Refraction and distance=== Ptolemy attempted to explain the Moon illusion through atmospheric refraction in the Almagest, and later (in the Optics) as an optical illusion due to apparent distance, or the difficulty of looking upwards, although interpretations of the account in the Optics are disputed. Similarly Cleomedes (about 200 A.D.), in his book on astronomy, ascribed the illusion both to refraction and to changes in apparent distance. In the Book of Optics (1011–1022 A.D.), Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) repeated refraction as an explanation, but also proposed a more detailed explanation based on intervening objects and apparent distance. Through additional works (by Roger Bacon, John Pecham, Witelo, and others) based on Ibn al-Haytham's explanation, the Moon illusion came to be accepted as a psychological phenomenon in the 17th century. ===Apparent distance hypothesis=== Clouds near the horizon are typically farther away from the viewer, while those high in the sky are closer, giving the impression of a flat, or gently curved, sky surface An apparent distance theory evidently was first clearly described by Cleomedes around 200 A.D. The theory proposes that the horizon Moon looks larger than the zenith Moon because it looks farther away. Ibn al-Haytham was more specific: his argument was that judging the distance of an object depends on there being an uninterrupted sequence of intervening bodies between the object and the observer; however, since there are no intervening objects between the Earth and the Moon, the perceived distance is too short and the Moon appears smaller than on the horizon. Researchers have argued that the apparent distance hypothesis is problematic scientifically because it explains perceptions as consequences of perceptions: the Moon looks farther away because it looks larger. However, there are probably complex internal processes behind this relationship. In 1813, Schopenhauer wrote about this, that the Moon illusion is \\"purely intellectual or cerebral and not optical or sensuous.\\"On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, § 21 [ist also rein intellektual, oder cerebral; nicht optisch oder sensual] The brain takes the sense data that is given to it from the eye and it apprehends a large Moon because \\"our intuitively perceiving understanding regards everything that is seen in a horizontal direction as being more distant and therefore as being larger than objects that are seen in a vertical direction.\\"On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, § 21 [... daß unser anschauender Verstand, nach dem Horizont hin, alles für entfernter, mithin für größer hält, als in der senkrechten Richtung] The brain is accustomed to seeing terrestrially-sized objects in a horizontal direction and also as they are affected by atmospheric perspective, according to Schopenhauer. A diagram of the Moon seen against a cloud of the same size, at different heights in the sky. When the Moon is high, the clouds it is against are closer to the viewer and appear larger. When the Moon is low in the sky, the same clouds are further away and appear smaller, giving the illusion of a larger Moon. If the Moon is perceived to be in the general vicinity of the other things seen in the sky, it would be expected to also recede as it approaches the horizon, which should result in a smaller retinal image. But since its retinal image is approximately the same size whether it is near the horizon or not, the brain, attempting to compensate for perspective, assume that a low Moon must be physically larger. Extensive experiments in 1962 by Kaufman and Rock showed that a crucial causative factor in the illusion is a change in the pattern of cues to distance, comparable to the Ponzo illusion. The horizon Moon is perceived to be at the end of a stretch of terrain receding into the distance, accompanied by distant trees, buildings and so forth, all of which indicate that it must be a long way away, while these cues are absent from the zenith moon. Experiments by many other researchers have found the same result; namely, when pictorial cues to a great distance are subtracted from the vista of the large-looking horizon Moon it looks smaller. When pictorial cues to an increased distance are added into the vista of the zenith Moon, it appears larger. A potential problem for the apparent distance theory has been that few people (perhaps about 5%) perceive the horizon Moon as being both larger and farther away. Indeed, most people (perhaps 90%) say the horizon Moon looks both larger and closer than the zenith Moon (Boring, 1962; Hershenson, 1982; McCready, 1965, 1986; Restle, 1970). Most of the rest say it looks larger and about the same distance away as the zenith Moon, with a few people reporting no Moon illusion at all. However, the response that the horizon Moon appears larger, but not closer than the zenith Moon could be because the viewer's logic confounds their perception; because the viewer knows that the Moon can't possibly be physically farther away, they are not consciously aware of the perception. This is reinforced by the idea that the brain does not consciously perceive distance and size, as spatial awareness is a subconscious, retino cortical cognition. In line with the possibility that the reported distance of the Moon is due to logic, rather than perception, is the finding that these varying reports--with some reporting closer distances and others not--are likely due to response biases. Nevertheless, the apparent distance explanation is the one most often found in textbooks. ===Relative size hypothesis=== The Ebbinghaus illusion. The lower central circle surrounded by small circles might represent the horizon Moon accompanied by objects of smaller visual extent, while the upper central circle represents the zenith Moon surrounded by expanses of sky of larger visual extent. Although both central circles are actually the same size, the lower one looks larger to many people. Historically, the best-known alternative to the \\"apparent distance\\" theory has been a \\"relative size\\" theory. This states that the perceived size of an object depends not only on its retinal size, but also on the size of objects in its immediate visual environment. In the case of the Moon illusion, objects in the vicinity of the horizon Moon (that is, objects on or near the horizon) exhibit a fine detail that makes the Moon appear larger, while the zenith Moon is surrounded by large expanses of empty sky that make it appear smaller. The effect is illustrated by the classic Ebbinghaus illusion, where a circle appears larger when surrounded by smaller circles, than it does when surrounded by larger circles. ===Angle of regard hypothesis=== According to the \\"angle of regard\\" hypothesis, the Moon illusion is produced by changes in the position of the eyes in the head accompanying changes in the angle of elevation of the Moon. Though once popular, this explanation no longer has much support. Looking through one's legs at the horizon Moon does reduce the illusion noticeably, but this may be because the image on the retina is inverted. Raising the eyes or tilting the head when in an upright posture gives only a very small reduction in the illusion. ==Historical references== Immanuel Kant refers to the Moon illusion in his 1781 text Critique of Pure Reason, when he writes that \\"the astronomer cannot prevent himself from seeing the moon larger at its rising than some time afterwards, although he is not deceived by this illusion\\". (B 354) Schopenhauer (1813) was cited above. Wade shortly summarizes historical references to the moon illusion starting with Aristotle; he lists quotes by Aristotle (~330 BC), Ptolemy (~142, 150), Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) (1083), John Pecham (~1280), Leonardo da Vinci (~1500), René Descartes (1637), Benedetto Castelli (1639), Pierre Gassendi (1642), Thomas Hobbes (1655), J.

He escaped from Poland during the Holocaust, and settled in Palestine during 1940. In 1945, he learned that the Nazi regime had murdered his wife, daughter, son, and grandchildren. He remarried, but had no children. Following the death of his father, Rabbi Avraham Mordechai Alter, the fourth Rebbe of Ger, in 1948, he became a forceful leader of his growing followers in the Ger Hasidic movement, as well as became very active in the political life of the nascent State of Israel. He would go around at night by himself to the various yeshivas, even the non-Hasidic ones, and check on the students. He would also have one of his agents call an especially good student to talk to him, thereby gaining many new and outstanding followers. He married Perl Weinfeld, daughter of Rabbi David. Rabbi Yisrael also known as the \\"Sharfer (sharp) Rebbe\\", left a great impression on people from all walks of life who came in contact with him, and was highly respected by all Hasidic circles. His idea was to elevate every person to somehow become one level higher than his present state. There are countless stories from individuals (Hasidim and non-Hasidim) who met the Rebbe, relating how he had a tremendous spiritual impact on them and how this strong impression will never leave them. What makes this even more impressive is that many of these encounters with the Rebbe were for a very short period of time. Rabbi Yisrael actively encouraged a strong competitive rivalry between the young man in his yeshivot - in particular, early morning learning, prayers, and Tischen (meals led by the Rebbe on Shabbat and Holidays). He was a charismatic leader with a dynamic personality, quick wit, and an unpredictable nature. Rabbi Yisrael became a powerful force within the Agudat Israel of Israel party, and guided its work in the Israeli Knesset, concluding alliances with various other political parties to further the causes of Haredi Judaism in the Jewish state. He died of bowel obstruction in 1977, leaving no heir. He was succeeded by his brother, Rabbi Simcha Bunim Alter. After his death, his widow performed chalitza on Rabbi Simcha Bunim, in accordance with halakah. ==Rebbes of Ger== #Yitzchak Meir Alter (1799–1866) #Chanokh Heynekh HaKohen Levin (1798–1870) #Yehudah Aryeh Leib Alter (1847–1905) #Avraham Mordechai Alter (1866–1948) #Yisrael Alter (1895–1977) #Simcha Bunim Alter (1898–1992) #Pinchas Menachem Alter (1926–1996) #Yaakov Aryeh Alter (b. 1939) ==External links== *Film of Rabbi Alter burning the leavened bread on the eve of the Jewish feast of Passover Category:Rebbes of Ger Category:1895 births Category:1977 deaths Category:Burials at the Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives Category:Israeli Hasidic rabbis Category:Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah Category:Polish Orthodox rabbis Category:20th-century rabbis ","title":"Yisrael Alter"},{"id":"1275989","text":"Chi-Lan Lieu is a Chinese-American author and television presenter.

Their works mainly comprised translation and adaptation of Sanskrit epics and Puranic works and were for devotional purposes. They lived between 1350 and 1450 C.E. It is believed that they all belonged to the same Kannassa family and that Madhava Panikkar and Sankara Panikkar were the uncles of Rama Panikkar, the youngest of the three. As Kannassa, they were probably akin to members of the Kaniyar caste, which makes their claim to mastery of Sanskrit a significant feature as Kaniyar, being adept in Astrology and Ayurveda, they were accepted by then the Kings Their works have been mostly assigned to the Pattu taxon. It revived the Bhakti school of literature and reasserted the seriousness of the poetic vocation in the place of the excessive sensuality and eroticism of the Manipravalam poets. Divergence from the Manipravalam school, through non-usage of Dravidian metre and Sanskrit grammatical forms, are noted. Madhava Panikkar's Bhasha Bhagavadgita, a condensed Malayalam translation of Bhagavad Gita was its first translation into any modern Indian language. Sankara Panikkar's main work is Bharatamala, a masterly condensation of Mahabharata. Perhaps the most important was Rama Panikkar, who is the author of Ramayanam, Bharatam, Bhagavatam, and Sivarathri Mahatmyam. Kannassa Ramayanam and Kannassa Bharatam are the most important of these Niranam works. The former is an important link between Cheeraman's Ramacharitam, Ayyappilli Asan's Ramakathapattu and Ezhuthachan's Adhyathmaramayanam.

The clade is not defined in the standard taxonomic hierarchy, but it is between superfamily and family. The Eumuroida are technically defined as the clade including all organisms descended from the most recent common ancestor of the Calomyscidae, Nesomyidae, Cricetidae, and Muridae. It specifically excludes the fossorial forms of mouse-like rodents in the family Spalacidae. It has yet to be determined if the Platacanthomyidae belong to the Eumuroida, but Norris et al. (2004) suggested they do not because of subtle features in the skull. Norris et al. (2004) noted that two characters can be used to define the Eumuroida: the infraorbital foramen is V-shaped and extends to the roof of the palate, and the incisive foramina are medium to large in size. The zygomatic plate is at least moderately developed in this group, producing the V shape. The common ancestors to the Eumuroida were probably not specialized as burrowing animals, whereas the spalacid ancestor may have been. Jansa and Weksler (2004) noted that the Eumuroid ancestors likely had hamster-like (cricetid) molars as opposed to mouse-like molars (murid). Essentially, the occlusal surface of the molars probably had two rows of cusps (cricetid) instead of three (murid). Early fossil muroids, such as cricetodontines, represent a possible ancestor to the Eumuroida. These rodents have the cricetid tooth, hence the name: cricetus = hamster + dont = tooth. The presence of these fossils in Eurasia is parsimonious, because most families of eumuroids (except the Nesomyidae) have representatives in Asia. Steppan et al. (2004) suggested the most recent common ancestor of the Eumuroida lived around the transition between the Oligocene and Miocene. This date only slightly precedes the first appearance of cricetodontines. ==Taxonomy== *Family Calomyscidae **Subfamily Calomyscinae (mouse-like hamsters) *Family Nesomyidae **Subfamily Cricetomyinae (pouched rats and mice) **Subfamily Dendromurinae (African climbing mice, gerbil mice, fat mice and forest mice) **Subfamily Mystromyinae (white-tailed rat) **Subfamily Nesomyinae (Malagasy rats and mice) **Subfamily Petromyscinae (rock mice and the climbing swamp mouse) *Family Cricetidae **Subfamily Arvicolinae (voles, lemmings and muskrat) **Subfamily Cricetinae (true hamsters) **Subfamily Neotominae (North American rats and mice) **Subfamily Sigmodontinae (New World rats and mice) **Subfamily Tylomyinae *Family Muridae **Subfamily Deomyinae (spiny mice, brush furred mice, link rat) **Subfamily Gerbillinae (gerbils, jirds and sand rats) **Subfamily Lophiomyinae (crested rat) **Subfamily Murinae (Old World rats and mice including vlei rats) ==References== *Jansa, S.

It is under the administration of the prefecture-level city of Zhengzhou, the provincial capital. The city has a population of 600,000 people and covers an area of , of which is urban. ==History== Xinzheng is considered as one of the birth places of Chinese nation. More than 8000 years ago, neolithic people of Peiligang culture lived in the vicinity. The legendary Yellow Emperor was said to have been born in Xinzheng 5000 years ago. During the Zhou Dynasty it was the capital of the state of Zheng and later, the state of Han, after the conquest of the former by the latter. It was the seat of government for the Qin Dynasty, from about 221 BCE, which is considered the beginning of a unified China. The word qin (), which is pronounced similar to \\"chin\\", is thought to be the basis for the word \\"China.\\" Historically, this prefecture was an integrated part of Zhengzhou. However, in 1994, the Henan Provincial Council authorized the incorporation of Xinzheng into a separate municipality.Xinzheng Municipal Government ==Education== Xinzheng has one of the largest concentrations of foreign teachers in central China due to the presence of Sias International University. The school has over 27,000 students and over 120 foreign teachers and their 40 dependent family members. Along with Sias University, the city is also home to another university: ShengDa.Shengda Foreign Affairs Office SIAS Website ==Economy== Xinzheng has a diversified economy, though agriculture and heavy industry dominate the economic landscape. ===Agriculture=== Xinzheng's agriculture involves the cultivation of maize, cotton, tobacco and other industrial crops. The city is well known for its jujube or Chinese Date. At harvest time, large quantities of these fruits are sold in markets, as well as on the side of the roads into the town.Xinzheng Municipal Government- Economy. ===Industry=== Xinzheng is home to several industrial factories, namely cigarette factories, which are located near the center of town. In 2006, more than US$2 billion was invested in a nearby industrial project,Life of Guangzhou- China U.S. Industrial Park Project in Henan although the status of this investment is currently unknown. Mining coal locally has also been an important source of income. ===Impact of educational institutions=== Two large private universities, ShengDa University and Sias International University play a major role in the local economy as well. ShengDa has 14,000 students, and Sias University has over 27,000 students. Service industries (restaurants, hotels, banks, retail shops, etc.) to accommodate the students have sprung out around the universities in abundance. At Sias, the administration tacitly allows students to live off campus, creating a large community of landlords around the university. The presence of 40,000 students has had an undeniable and long lasting impact on the community. ===Tourism=== Yellow Emperor Celebrations on the streets of Henan Due to limited accommodation, lack of infrastructure, pollution and other factors, tourism has been slow to take off in Xinzheng. Every Spring, the city hosts a ceremony honoring Yellow Emperor, the legendary ancestor of the Chinese nation. In 2009, this celebration attracted over 10,000 Chinese from within the People's Republic of China, as well as many Overseas ChineseBeijing Review- Cultural Industry in Henan However, many of these guests find accommodations in nearby Zhengzhou, and the economic impact to the city is minimal. Xinzheng is said to be an 'open-air' museum, and the nearby Shizu mountain is said to be the exact birthplace of Yellow Emperor. The Zhengzhou Dragon realization company began construction at the turn of the 21st century of a large concrete dragon that would straddle the mountain.The Standard- Battle for the Dragon's Lair A giant dragon was being constructed by private investors near the city out of concrete and marble with a 29.9m tall head and a body that will eventually stretch along the ridge line of Shizu Mountain. The hollow body of the dragon was slated to be 9m high and 6m wide and will contain a light rail system along with facilities for sight seeing and leisure, such as shops, restaurants and luxury clubs. The project was expected to be completed before October 1, 2009 to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China However, lack of funding, and a general lack of interest, left the project unfinished. ==Transportation== ===Air=== The airport that serves the provincial capital, Zhengzhou Xinzheng International Airport , is located in Xinzheng. This is of particular importance not only because it is an airport for a large urban center, but because it is the only international airport for the province of 100 million.World Aero Data- CGO Henan Provincial Government (Chinese) On February 8, 2009, a nonstop air route between Zhengzhou and Taipei-Taoyuan was launched; this route was initially operated by Shenzhen Airlines.\\"Direct air route launched between Henan and Taiwan\\" GOV.cn February 9, 2009 ===Rail=== As in the rest of China, rail transport in Xinzheng is handled by the China Railway Corporation. Xinzheng itself had a small railroad station, , at the edge of town that used to accommodate trains on the Beijing–Guangzhou railway, as well as to and from Zhengzhou. It is no longer open. Chinese Railway System website(Chinese) However, nearby Zhengzhou is a major railway hub, with services radiating in all directions nationally. As of 2007, high-speed rail service began between Zhengzhou and Beijing. Zhengzhou Railway Bureau(Chinese) To do any travel beyond the Zhengzhou immediate area, most residents travel to Zhengzhou, then onward. ===Mass transit=== The regional bus station to the north of the town's city center () serves buses destined for Zhengzhou, Xinmi, Kaifeng, and Luoyang. ===Taxi=== All Xinzheng taxis belong to the same local company, with a starting fare of 6 renminbi. ===Roads=== Xinzheng is well connected to Zhengzhou and points south by China National Highway 107. All inter-city roads are well maintained. Within the city limits, as in the rest of many small Chinese cities, many residential roads remain in a serious state of disrepair. ==Image gallery== File:Shizumountain.JPGConstruction of the Dragon on Shizu Mountain in Xinzheng File:xinzhengentrance.jpgEntrance into West Xinzheng File:CGOairport.JPGZhengzhou Xinzheng International Airport ==References== ==External links== *Official website of Xinzheng Government *Pictures of Xinzheng City, Henan Province Category:Cities in Henan Category:Districts of Zhengzhou Category:County-level divisions of Henan ","title":"Xinzheng"},{"id":"1276014","text":"The Nissan Vanette is a cabover van and pickup truck produced by the Japanese automaker Nissan from 1978 until 2011. The first two generations were engineered by Nissan's Aichi Manufacturing Division for private, personal ownership, with the last two generations built by Mazda, rebadged as Nissans and refocused as commercial vehicles, based on the Mazda Bongo. The van has also been sold as the Nissan Sunny-Vanette or Nissan Van. The private purchase passenger platform was replaced by the Nissan Serena in 1991, renamed Vanette in various international markets, and came equipped with multiple engine and drivetrain configurations. 2WD and 4WD versions were produced, with manual, automatic, floor and column shift options available. While no longer produced for the Japanese market, it was still available in other markets around the world such as Malaysia. Production ended around 2010, eventually being replaced by the Nissan NV200. ==History== The first appearance of a cabover truck/delivery van appeared in 1962 with the Datsun Cablight, rebadged Hajar vehicle an earlier vehicle Nissan acquired when they assumed operations from Kurogane. As the Cablight was reengineered, it was offered as a cab-over truck and van called the Datsun Sunny Cab/Nissan Cherry Cab (C20) introduced in 1969, and was one size smaller from the Prince Homer truck and the Prince Homy van. The cabover approach allowed the exterior dimensions to remain unchanged while increasing the length of the cargo area of the Nissan Sunny truck. The Sunny Cab Van/Cherry Cab Van passenger van could accommodate five passengers and an extended length coach that could carry eight people. Both Cab Vans didn't have sliding passenger doors, instead they had conventional front- hinged doors with extended lengths on the passenger side. The rear tailgate was a clamshell design where the door separated into two pieces that would extend up, with a tailgate on the lower half of the door. Datsun Sunny cab (C20) Nissan Cherry Cab (C20) The commercial model was basic, that kept the price low. The Sunny Truck continued to be built after the introduction of the second generation passenger version, and was only replaced in early 1971 by the new B120-series truck. The Cabover trucks were renamed the Nissan Vanette and the Nissan Cherry Cab/Vanette or Vonnate. == First generation (C20; 1978–1988)== Introduced by Fakhriah Audit off Nissan in October 1978 as a replacement for the 1969 Nissan Cherry Cab/Sunny Cab C20 and Nissan Sunny Cab Van/Nissan Cherry Cab Van, the first Vanette was exported as the Datsun C20 (later the Nissan C20) or as the Nissan Datsun Vanette (later the Nissan Vanette). In the home market it was initially marketed as either the 'Nissan Sunny Vanette' or the 'Nissan Cherry Vanette', depending on the distribution network, although in engineering terms it borrowed heavily from the rear-wheel drive generations of the Sunny line—in particular the B210 and B310 series models, with which it shared engines and transmissions. The Sunny Vanette was sold through Nissan Satio Store and the Cherry Vanette was sold through Nissan Cherry Store locations. These two models had somewhat differing front-end treatment. In March 1980 a Datsun Vanette version was also added, sold through the Nissan Bluebird Store dealer network. The Datsun Vanette received twin headlights, while its related models had single headlights. It was a junior model to the larger Nissan Caravan. Initially it was available in three lines: a truck version, vans (usually with passenger accommodation), and as a 9-seat minibus (Vanette Coach). The Coach received a A14 four cylinder, producing at 5,400 rpm. The van and truck versions originally had to make do with the lesser A12 of and at the same engine speed. Later, the 1400 engine became available in Van and Truck versions as well. In July 1979 a high-roof version was added, as well as a long wheelbase van and ten-seater Coach version. This was stretched by 33 cm between the front and side doors, LWB versions were never available with the A12 engine. Some versions received separate air conditioning outlets for the rear. Nissan Vanette (C120, Malaysia). In June 1980 the Coach version changed from the A14 to the larger (1,487 cc) A15 engine, offering . There was also a luxurious SGL version of the Vanette Coach added, with an available sunroof and swivelling captain's chairs in the rear – both firsts for the segment in Japan. To indicate its luxurious nature, the SGL received double square headlights for a more modern appearance. In June 1981 the LD20 diesel engine was added, as was a 2-litre gasoline version (Z20) for the top-of-the-line SGX version. In 1981, Nissan introduced a smaller passenger vehicle which had sliding passenger doors on both sides of the vehicle, with conventional front doors, called the Nissan Prairie, making the Vanette/Largo no longer the smallest cargo van offered. In October 1982, minor changes occurred (along with the introduction of the bigger \\"Largo\\"). The dashboard was redesigned, while the base 'CT' model received front disc brakes, the optional air conditioning system was modernized, and an inexpensive 'FL' Coach version was added. In October 1983 a DX-A version was added, followed by modifications to the transmission carried out in August 1985. The next month, production of Van and Coach models ended as they were replaced by the C22 Vanette. The truck versions of the C120 Vanette remained in production (with light modifications carried out in August 1986) until September 1988. === Vanette Largo === The Vanette Largo (GC120) was introduced in October 1982 and was a wider (by 90 mm, to stay just beneath the important Japanese 1,700 mm tax threshold) and somewhat longer version. This was then developed into a cargo version built in Spain (by Nissan Ibérica), called the Nissan/Datsun Vanette Cargo. This largely supplanted the smaller Vanette versions in European markets. Engines were the A15 and Z20 gasoline versions, accompanied by the diesel LD20 (also available turbocharged). The Spanish- built versions were originally intended to be built with a Spanish-made Perkins diesel motor but this did not materialize. There was a minibus 'Coach' version of the Largo as well, with a luxurious \\"Grand Saloon\\" version topping the range. Nissan Vanette Largo (C220, EU-spec) The Vanette Largo continued in production until a GC22 successor arrived, in May 1986. From this point the Vanette name was dropped and the Largo became a separate, more luxurious model in its own right. In the Japanese market, the C120 vehicle was either marketed as the Datsun Vanette Largo or as a Nissan with the Cherry and Sunny prefixes. The Spanish C220 received a facelift and continued to be built into the 1990s, and was mostly sold in markets which hindered the import of Japanese-built vehicles. == Second generation (C22; 1985–1994)== === Japan === Nissan Largo (GC22) Nissan Vanette Truck An enlarged version similar to the US market Nissan Van was again sold in Japan as the Largo, until 1992 when the Serena- based Nissan Largo was launched. === United States === The Nissan C22 was modified for the United States market to compete with the similar sized Toyota Van and Mitsubishi Van, and to join the growing minivan market in the US. This van was sold as the \\"Nissan Van\\" in the US from 1986–1989, where it was billed as a cheaper alternative to Chrysler's minivans. Most of the vans were sold in the Sun Belt states, particularly California, Texas, and Florida, and sales were strongest for the first two years. Nissan had to engineer its larger 2.4 liter Z24i engine into the C22 to handle American market requirements which included air conditioning and highway driving. The C22 was not originally designed for such a large engine, and the resulting tight quarters would later contribute to overheating and engine fire issues. In 1994, after four safety recalls did not end the engine fire problems, and with a class action lawsuit pending, Nissan took the unprecedented step of recalling every Nissan Van sold in the US.For MY 1987 recalls, see: Internet Autoguide 1987 Nissan Van Recalls For MY 1988 recalls, see: Internet Autoguide 1988 Nissan Van Recalls For MY 1990 recalls, see: Internet Autoguide 1990 Nissan Van Recalls Van owners were offered Kelly Blue Book value or more for their van,Internet Autoguide 1987 Nissan Van Recalls and most accepted, but a few opted to keep their vans. Critics argued that Nissan had been long aware of the problems with the vans (the first reports of fires appeared in 1987, shortly after they went on sale in the US), but did not take action for years, after which they had been replaced by the Nissan Quest. By the time of the recall in 1994, at least 135 fires had been reported, although none of them had resulted in deaths or injuries. The class-action settlement offered discounts on the purchase of a new Nissan vehicle. The vehicles which were recalled were crushed en masse. The Nissan Van was intended mainly as a stopgap for the North American market until a proper minivan could be introduced, and it was replaced by the Nissan Quest in 1993, a vehicle designed in a joint venture with Ford. ===Malaysia=== The C22 Nissan Vanette was built in Malaysia at the Tan Chong assembly plant in Segambut (Kuala Lumpur) until 2010. After 13 years in production, it was the longest running model built in Malaysia. There was a chassis cab, a truck, a panel van, and a window van version. Malaysian Vanettes have the venerable 1.5 liter pushrod A15 engine, with . While it has had a few facelifts over the years, the basic body was still the same. The 1980s interior is still intact. Malaysia was the only place where the Vanette was built for many years, being exported from there to many other markets. After a brief hiatus, it was replaced by the Nissan NV200, which retains the \\"Vanette\\" name in the Malaysian market. === Philippines === The Nissan Vanette was available in the Philippines until the end of 1999 as the Nissan Vanette Grand coach. In its final version it remains essentially the same Vanette as in previous years except for a different wheel design, upgraded seat materials and a faux wood trim dashboard. The sole engine available is the Z20 2.0 liter gasoline engine. Unlike in other Asian countries, no diesel variant was offered or available. That was an oversight on Nissan's part that could have made the difference in the van's popularity. === India === The C22 Vanette also provides the basis for Ashok Leyland's \\"Dost\\", the Indian truck manufacturer's first entry into this market segment. 1990 Nissan Nomad GX (Australia) == Third generation (S20, SE, SK; 1994–1999)== 1994–1999 Nissan Vanette (S20).

According to the , it has a population of people. Santa Cruz is situated on the banks of the Santa Cruz River which flows into the eastern part of Laguna de Bay. The town is bounded by the Bay on the north, by Lumban and Pagsanjan towns in the east, Pagsanjan and Magdalena towns in the south, and Pila in the west. It is from Manila via Calamba and Los Baños. It is accessible by land from Metro Manila passing through Rizal Province via Manila East Road or via South Luzon Expressway Santa Cruz is considered as the service and commercial center on the eastern part of the province. The town is composed of five barangays in the Poblacion area and 21 classified urban barangays. Although relatively far from the immediate urbanizing influence of Metropolitan Manila, Santa Cruz continues to progress. It is now classified as first class municipality. The present administration is headed by the Mayor Egay San Luis. Santa Cruz is also the seat of the provincial government since 1885, giving the municipality an additional administrative function over the entire province. It also functions as the service center for transportation, commerce, health, education, and other social services for the predominantly rural north-eastern municipalities of the province. Boosting the economy of the municipality are the incipient and fast-growing agribusiness industries such as livestock raising, horticulture and aquaculture. The town is composed of twenty-six (26) urban barangays. All barangays are being classified as urban. The development of Santa Cruz as the administrative, commercial, and service center of Laguna makes it accessible for all private/public vehicles going to nearby places particularly Pagsanjan, Lake Caliraya, Liliw, Paete and Nagcarlan. ==History== During the last decade of the 16th century, Santa Cruz was once a well populated barrio of the present municipality of Lumban, as well as other contemporary towns like Pagsanjan, Cavinti, Paete and Pangil. On June 4, 1602, Santa Cruz separated from Lumban and became a pueblo with its church and local government. Since its foundation in 1602, the town had been ravaged by calamitous forces such as fires, typhoons, floods and human vandalism during the Philippine Revolution of 1896–1899, the war of the Philippine Independence (1899–1902), Battle of Santa Cruz, the assault of the Tulisanes (bandits) during the Spanish times. The Filipino troops of the pre-war 4th and 42nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and recognized guerrillas also came from the town and was involved in the Second Battle of Santa Cruz on January 26, 1945. Characterized by fertile flat lands situated along the coastal plains of Laguna de Bay, the economic base of the town had been traditionally anchored on two primary industries, namely agriculture and fishing which still remain up to the present. In view of the strategic location of Santa Cruz relative to the other coastal settlements about the lake, trading activities have likewise rooted on the town during those early settlement days. The town proper which has always been the focal point of activities used to be accessible to the other lake-shore areas due to the navigable Santa Cruz River aside from the Laguna de Bay itself. Since those early days, water is the principal mode of transportation. Today, Santa Cruz serves as the capital of Laguna and is considered as the business and commercial center on the eastern part of the province. ==Geography== Pila in the foreground Situated at the central portion of Laguna province along the south-eastern coast of Laguna de Bay, Santa Cruz lies southeast of Metro Manila via Calamba and is geographically located at approximately 14 degrees 17' latitude and 121 degrees 25' longitude. The municipality is bounded on the north and north-west by Laguna de Bay, on the north-east by Lumban, on the east by Pagsanjan, on the southeast by Magdalena, on the south by Liliw, and on the south-west by Pila. It has 26 barangays and covers approximate land area of 3860 hectares which comprises about 2% of the total land area of Laguna Province. *Land Area: 3,860 hectares *Residential: 381.97 *Commercial: 35.96 *Institutional: 92.17 *Functional Open Space: 31.27 *Roads: 157.73 *Total Built-up: 696.10 *Agricultural: 3,048.57 *Special Use: 115.33 ===Geology=== The two types of rocks found in Santa Cruz are alluvium and clastic rocks. Clastic rocks are located at the eastern portion of the municipality specifically in Barangay Alipit, San Jose, Oogong, Jasaan, San Juan, Palasan, and portions of Barangays Pagsawitan, Patimbao, Bubukal, Labuin and Malinao. These rocks consist of inter-bedded shale and sandstone with occasional thin lenses of limestone, tuff, and reworked sandy tuffs, calcareous sandstone and partly tuffaceous shale. ===Climate=== Like most areas in the province of Laguna, the climate of Santa Cruz is characterized by two pronounced seasons: dry from January to April and wet during the rest of the year. The municipality has annual temperature of 27.2 degree Celsius and annual rainfall of 1962.7mm. Northeasterly winds with an average wind speed of 9 knots prevail in the municipality. ===Barangays=== Santa Cruz is politically subdivided into 26 barangays. * Alipit * Bagumbayan * Bubukal * Calios * Duhat * Gatid * Jasaan * Labuin * Malinao * Oogong * Pagsawitan * Palasan * Patimbao * Poblacion I * Poblacion II * Poblacion III * Poblacion IV * Poblacion V * San Jose * San Juan * San Pablo Norte * San Pablo Sur * Santisima Cruz * Santo Angel Central * Santo Angel Norte * Santo Angel Sur Santa Cruz Public Market viewed from Regidor Street near Santisima Elementary School ==Demographics== In the , the population of Santa Cruz, Laguna, was people, with a density of . alt= Pedro Guevara Avenue, in front of the Iglesia ni Cristo church.

Trade and commerce remain to be one of the primary economic activities in the locality. The presence of jeepney services plying Lumban, Paete, Siniloan, San Pablo, Pila, Victoria, Cavinti-Caliraya, Luisiana, Majayjay, Calumpang, Nagcarlan, Liliw, Magdalena, Pagsanjan, Lucban, Lucena and Calamba has further enhanced the municipality's role as a commerce and trade center. The center of business activities is in the poblacion specifically at Barangay V where the four (4) buildings of Public Market is situated. Santa Cruz has many establishment that contribute to its development. Development in this vicinity has been a quasi-residential commercial type as manifested by the proliferation of structures which are used both for business and residential purposes by the proprietors/owners. There is also a concentration of business establishments at the section of the national highway/expressway especially Barangay Gatid where a Mall is located, and the abandoned PNR Railway (road) while a strip pattern of commercial development is noticeable along the Quezon Avenue and along the old highway and Pedro Guevarra Avenue. Along P Guevarra Avenue, several establishments are also located such as Hospitals, Meralco office, PLDT office, Red Cross, several Banking Institutions, and Executive Eminent Lending Company.

Numbering only in the thousands in modern times, they were culturally suppressed in the Communist era, but have undergone a cultural revival since the Romanian Revolution of 1989. ==History== ===Danubian Principalities=== The earliest traces of Armenians in what was later Moldavia are dated by 967 (recorded presence in Cetatea Albă). Early Armenian Diasporas stemmed in the fall of the Bagratuni rule and other disasters, including the Mongol invasion. In 1572–1574, Ioan Vodă cel Cumplit was Hospodar (Prince) of Moldavia, grandson of Stephen the Great, son of Bogdan III and his Armenian concubine Serpega. Armenian expatriates were awarded tax exemptions at different times in the Danubian Principalities' history. Encouraged to settle as early as the 14th century, they became a familiar presence in towns, usually as the main entrepreneurs of the community – for this, in early modern Botoșani and several other places, Armenians as a guild were awarded political representation and degrees of self-rule. A considerable number of noble families in the Principalities were of Armenian descent. In Bucharest, an Armenian presence was first recorded in the second half of the 14th century – most likely, immigrants from the Ottoman-ruled Balkans, as well as from the area around Kamianets-Podilskyi and towns in Moldavia; throughout the 19th century, a large part of Armenian Bucharesters had arrived from Rousse, in present-day Bulgaria. The Gregorian Armenians were given the right to build a church around 1638 – it was rebuilt and expanded in 1685, but was damaged by the Russian attack during the 1768–1774 war with the Ottomans. Citizenship was bestowed on the community only with the decision taken by the international protectorate over the two countries (instituted after the Crimean War and the ensuing Treaty of Paris) to extend civil rights to all religious minorities. ===Transylvania=== Armenians of Transylvania (1850) Armenians were present from early on in Transylvania, clearly attested in a document issued by Hungarian King Ladislaus IV the Cuman (late 13th century). Here, they were even allowed to found their own trading towns, the most notable one being Gherla, called Armenopolis/Armenierstadt or Hayakaghak (Հայաքաղաք). The second important Armenian town in Transylvania is Dumbrăveni (Elisabethstadt). Despite their increasing autonomy, the townspeople's adherence to the Roman Catholic Church was nonetheless demanded (a conversion begun through the efforts of a Botoșani-born prelate, Oxendius Vărzărescu), and further submitted to forced integration by the Habsburg monarchy since the 18th century. The Ordinariate for Catholics of Armenian Rite in Romania is nowadays centered on Gherla, and is placed under the jurisdiction of the Romanian Roman-Catholic Church archbishops of Alba Iulia. Most Armenians from Transylvania were magyarized in the last half of the 19th century. ===Romania=== After the Armenian genocide of 1915, Romania was the first state to officially provide political asylum to refugees from the area. In 1940 about 40,000 Armenians lived in Romania. Under communist rule, Armenians started to leave the country, and Nicolae Ceaușescu's regime eventually closed all Armenian schools. ==Religion== The Armenian Apostolic community has a number of churches and a monastery in Romania.

As of 2002, there were 1,780 Armenians, many of them from mixed families, and the number of native speakers of the Armenian language is 721. There is one Armenian church in Bucharest on what is called Strada Armenească (\\"Armenian Street\\"). The origin of the church is from the 17th century. But the wooden building burnt in a fire in 1781. The newer structure was built starting 1911 through the efforts of Armenian immigrants from the Ottoman Empire. The new church opened in 1915. The church is run by bishop Datev Hagopian. The Armenian community exists since almost a thousand years, and the Armenian Apostolic Diocese has a history of at least 600 years. Also running is the Hagigadar Monastery established in 1512 with many visitors making it a tourist attraction. The community is celebrating the 500th anniversary of its establishment. Besides the church is a two-storey cultural center with the first floor being a library of Armenian old and new books and the second floor, a museum. The library was established by literary figure Hagop Sirouni (real family name Jololian). The collection suffered after the Soviet authorities exiled him to Siberia in the 1940s and the collection was confiscated only to be returned to the Armenian community in 1987 after suffering serious losses. The origin of the existing Armenian community is basically Western Armenian. But it suffered greatly with the establishment of communist regime, the emigration of many Armenian Romanians back to Soviet Armenia after the Second World War, the immigration waves to the West. However the present community is being reinforced by Eastern Armenians immigrating from Armenia and other countries or by Armenian students coming to study in Romania. The community presently publishes the periodicals Nor Ghiank (in Armenian), Ararat, and the state-sponsored Lăcașuri de cult. ==Notable Romanians of Armenian descent== Romanians of Armenian descent have been very active in Romanian political, cultural, academic and social life. Most worthy of mention would be Vazgen I, Catholicos of Armenia, and Iacob Zadig, a general in the Romanian Army during World War I.

The royal family of Jordan adheres to Sunni branch of Islamic religion. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is a majority Muslim country with 95% of the population following Sunni Islam while a small minority follow Shiite branches. There are also about 20,000 to 32,000 Druze living mostly in the north of Jordan. Many Jordanian Muslims practice Sufism. The 1952 Constitution grants freedom of religion while stipulating that the king and his successors must be Muslims and sons of Muslim parents. Religious minorities include Christians of various denominations (4%) and even fewer adherents of other faiths. Jordan is a religious and conservative country. ==Islam in Social Life pre-1980s== Despite a strong identification with and loyalty to Islam, religious practices varied among segments of Jordan's population. This unevenness in practice did not necessarily correlate with a rural-urban division or differing levels of education. The religious observance of some Jordanians was marked by beliefs and practices that were sometimes antithetical to the teachings of Islam. Authorities attributed at least some of these elements to pre-Islamic beliefs and customs common to the area. In daily life, neither rural dwellers nor urbanites were overly fatalistic. They did not directly hold God responsible for all occurrences; rather, they placed events in a religious context that imbued them with meaning. The expression in sha'a allah often accompanied statements of intention, and the term bismallah (in the name of allah) accompanied the performance of most important actions. Such pronouncements did not indicate a ceding of control over one's life or events. Jordanian Muslims generally believed that in matters that they could control, God expected them to work diligently. Muslims have other ways of invoking God's presence in daily life. Despite Islam's unequivocal teaching that God is one and that no being resembles him in sanctity, some people accepted the notion that certain persons (saints) have baraka, a special quality of personal holiness and affinity to God. The intercession of these beings was believed to help in all manner of trouble, and shrines to such people could be found in some localities. Devotees often visited the shrine of their patron, especially seeking relief from illness or inability to have children. Numerous spiritual creatures were believed to inhabit the world. Evil spirits known as jinn — fiery, intelligent beings that are capable of appearing in human and other forms — could cause all sorts of malicious mischief. For protection, villagers carried in their clothing bits of paper inscribed with Qur'anic verses (amulets), and they frequently pronounced the name of God. A copy of the Qur'an was said to keep a house safe from jinn. The \\"evil eye\\" also could be foiled by the same means. Although any literate Muslim was able to prepare amulets, some persons gained reputations as being particularly skilled in prescribing and preparing them. To underscore the difficulty in drawing a fine distinction between orthodox and popular Islam, one only need note that some religious shaykhs were sought for their ability to prepare successful amulets. For example, in the 1980s in a village in northern Jordan, two elderly shaykhs (who also were brothers) were famous for their abilities in specific areas: one was skilled in warding off illness among children; the other was sought for his skills in curing infertility. Their reverence for Islam notwithstanding, Muslims did not always practice strict adherence to the five pillars. Although most people tried to give the impression that they fulfilled their religious duties, many people did not fast during Ramadan. They generally avoided breaking the fast in public, however. In addition, most people did not contribute the required proportion of alms to support religious institutions, nor was pilgrimage to Mecca common. Attendance at public prayers and prayer in general increased during the 1980s as part of a regional concern with strengthening Islamic values and beliefs. Traditionally, social segregation of the sexes prevented women from participating in much of the formal religious life of the community. The 1980s brought several changes in women's religious practices. Younger women, particularly university students, were seen more often praying in the mosques and could be said to have carved a place for themselves in the public domain of Islam. Although some women in the late 1980s resorted to unorthodox practices and beliefs, women generally were considered more religiously observant than men. They fasted more than men and prayed more regularly in the home. Education, particularly of women, diminished the folk-religious component of belief and practice and probably enhanced observance of the more orthodox aspects of Islam. ==Islamic Revival 1980s onward== The 1980s witnessed a stronger and more visible adherence to Islamic customs and beliefs among significant segments of the population. The increased interest in incorporating Islam more fully into daily life was expressed in a variety of ways. Women wearing conservative Islamic dress and the head scarf were seen with greater frequency in the streets of urban as well as rural areas; men with beards also were more often seen. Attendance at Friday prayers rose, as did the number of people observing Ramadan. Women in the 1980s, particularly university students, were actively involved in expressions of Islamic revival. Women wearing Islamic garb were a common sight at the country's universities. For example, the mosque at Yarmouk University had a large women's section. The section was usually full, and women there formed groups to study Islam. By and large, women and girls who adopted Islamic dress apparently did so of their own volition, although it was not unusual for men to insist that their sisters, wives, and daughters cover their hair in public. The adoption of the Islamic form of dress did not signify a return to segregation of the sexes or female seclusion. Indeed, women who adopted Islamic clothing often were working women and students who interacted daily with men. They cited a lag in cultural attitudes as part of the reason for donning such dress. In other words, when dressed in Islamic garb they felt that they received more respect from and were taken more seriously by their fellow students and colleagues. Women also could move more readily in public if they were modestly attired. Increased religious observance also accounted for women's new style of dress. In the 1980s, Islamic dress did not indicate social status, particularly wealth, as it had in the past; Islamic dress was being worn by women of all classes, especially the lower and middle classes. Several factors gave rise to increased adherence to Islamic practices. During the 1970s and 1980s, the Middle East region saw a rise of Islamism in response to economic recession and to the failure of nationalist politics to solve regional problems. In this context, Islam was an idiom for expressing social discontent. In Jordan, opposition politics had long been forbidden, and since the 1950s the Muslim Brotherhood had been the only legal political party. These factors were exacerbated by King Hussein's public support for the shah of Iran in his confrontation with Ayatollah Khomeini and the forces of opposition, by continued relations with Egypt in the wake of the 1979 Treaty of Peace Between Egypt and Israel, and by the king's support for Iraq in the Iran–Iraq War. Although Islamic opposition politics never became as widespread in Jordan as in Iran and Egypt, they were pervasive enough for the regime to act swiftly to bring them under its supervision. By the close of the 1970s and throughout the 1980s, government-controlled television regularly showed the king and his brother Hasan attending Friday prayers. The media granted more time to religious programs and broadcasts. Aware that the Islamic movement might become a vehicle for expressing opposition to the regime and its policies, and in a move to repair relations with Syria, in the mid-1980s the government began to promote a moderate form of Islam, denouncing fanatical and intolerant forms. ==See also== *Islam by country *Jordanian Interfaith Coexistence Research Center *Religion in Jordan ==References== * ","title":"Islam in Jordan"},{"id":"1276030","text":"Swiss cheese plant may refer to: * Monstera deliciosa, a species of flowering plant native to tropical forests of southern Mexico, south to Panama * Monstera adansonii, a species of flowering plant widespread across much of South America and Central America ","title":"Swiss cheese plant"},{"id":"1276034","text":"Robert M. \\"Bob\\" Gordon (born July 3, 1950) is a Commissioner of the Board of Public Utilities in New Jersey.

Its local government area is the City of Maribyrnong. At the , Seddon had a population of 5,123. Formerly a semi-industrial, working-class suburb, in recent years Seddon has experienced rapid gentrification due to its close proximity to the Melbourne City Centre. ==History== Originally known as Belgravia, Seddon was officially declared a suburb in 1906, named after Richard Seddon, the New Zealand Prime Minister from 1893 to 1906, who resided there before he moved to Bendigo and later to New Zealand. Seddon was, on occasion, considered part of neighbouring Footscray. The Original State Bank of Victoria in Charles Street, Seddon used to stamp its Bank Account passbooks as Footscray South Vic. Not unusual, considering Seddon is south of Footscray. However, while central Footscray is one of the main shopping and transport hubs for Melbourne's western suburbs, Seddon, in contrast, is quiet, leafy and residential. The Main streets of Victoria, Charles & Gamon used to accommodate a tram line that ran through the middle of the Seddon Village. It has since been replaced with central garden beds and tree plantings in the middle of the streets. Seddon street names were named for monarchs. Reading from west to east, Charles intersects with Alfred, Edward, Henry, James, William, Victoria (which runs parallel to Windsor) and terminates at Albert. Seddon Post Office opened on 29 September 1908 and closed in 1976. Seddon West Post Office opened in 1924 and has since been renamed to the Seddon Post Office after its relocation further south on Victoria Street. Seddon shares its postcode with neighbouring Footscray - 3011. ==Community Organizations and Businesses== The Seddon Community Group with the assistance of the Maribyrnong Council puts on the Seddon Festival each year, closing all the main streets in the village to vehicles for exclusive pedestrian access. Several large band stages are erected on streets throughout the village and traders extend their seating onto the streets for the day. The Seddon Festival plays host to the Seddon Waiters Race, an event in which all of the local cafes and restaurants enter a waiter to compete carrying drinks and food through a short course on the street. The Snapshots of Seddon photography competition is also usually awarded judges prizes at the festival after entrants have had their photos displayed in the windows of the local business for the preceding month for judging of the peoples choice award. The Seddon Makers Market (formerly Maribyrnong Makers Market) operates throughout the year on the grounds of the Seddon Uniting Church on Gamon Street. Established in 2008, the market is a not-for-profit, community based designer market run by a local volunteer group. The group provides a forum for artists and crafts people to promote and sell handmade wares. Local businesses that have incorporated the suburb name into their own are: Seddon Deadly Sins cafe on Victoria Street, Sedonia homewares store on Gamon Street, Charles & Gamon restaurant and bar on the corner of Charles Street and Gamon Street (named after its prominent position on two of the major streets in the village) and the Est 1906 cafe on Charles Street (named thus because the suburb of Seddon was officially established in the year 1906). ==Sport and Activities== The Seddon Cricket Club has its home ground in the Yarraville Gardens. Seddon also shares its Australian Rules football team, Yarraville- Seddon, with neighbouring Yarraville. The team competes in the Western Region Football League. Opposite Seddon Station is the 5th Footscray Scout Group. With programs for children aged 6 to 15, the group is part of Scouts Australia, and meets in a historic hall built in the 1930s. Seddon is home to clubs for well-being, including My Mama Said and Westside Yoga, formally known as the Australian Yoga Academy Seddon. Cookery courses are held at Miss Biscuit, and the Spice Bazaar Cooking School. ==Local Landmarks== ===Residential Architecture=== Residential Seddon consists predominantly of single storey Victorian 'workers cottages' and Edwardian terrace houses, with some larger double storey early 20th century buildings in the village. ===Public Spaces=== Seddon features many small gardens, parks and playgrounds scattered throughout the suburb. Harris Reserve is on the corner of Gamon Street and Thomson Street. Bristow Reserve is a favorite among toddlers and barbecue masters alike and is located on the corner of Pilgrim Street and John Street.

The first character to assume the identity of Azrael is Jean-Paul Valley, who was introduced in Batman: Sword of Azrael #1 (October 1992) and was created by Denny O'Neil, Joe Quesada, and Peter Milligan. The second one is Michael Washington Lane, in Azrael: Death's Dark Knight #1 (May 2009). Both iterations are vigilantes and members of an assassin group created by the Order of St. Dumas, a secret organisation bent on restoring justice to Gotham City. Azrael is usually depicted as an antihero and ally of the superhero Batman, though the two have also been adversaries due to the former's violent nature and twisted sense of justice indoctrinated by the Order. The character appeared in the Batman: Arkham series of video games, voiced by Khary Payton. In the FOX television series Gotham, the Azrael alias is used by original character Theo Galavan, portrayed by James Frain. ==Publication history== The original character (Jean-Paul Valley) first appeared in the 1992 four-issue miniseries Batman: Sword of Azrael. Michael Lane was introduced as a character called Azrael as part of the Battle for the Cowl, a storyline told in a three-issue miniseries format written by Fabian Nicieza.\\"Batman: Battle for the Cowl - Enter Azrael\\", IGN, December 18, 2008\\"Fabian Nicieza Unleashes Azrael\\", Comic Book Resources, December 29, 2008 ==Characters== ===Jean-Paul Valley=== Jean-Paul Valley was the first character to assume the identity of Azrael, debuting in the four-issue miniseries Batman: Sword of Azrael in 1992. He later briefly assumed the identity of Batman in the Knightfall story arc (1993-1994), after Bruce Wayne was left paralyzed following a fight with Bane. ===Michael Washington Lane=== Michael Washington Lane originally appeared as Bat-Devil in Batman #665 (June 2007), before later taking on the identity of Azrael in Azrael: Death's Dark Knight #1, published in May 2009. ===Other characters=== A number of characters besides Valley and Lane have assumed the identity of Azrael in the DC Universe: * Valley's father (Jean-Paul/Ludovic Valley) was the previous Azrael, as seen in Batman: Sword of Azrael (referenced by his son as having the same name) and, with more detail, in Azrael Annual #1 (identified as just Ludovic Valley). * A Chinese man, supposedly given the same training as Valley and an identical costume, is briefly under the control of the Order. Also, the position of the Order of St. Dumas' enforcer has been passed on since medieval times. * Earlier on in the Azrael series, another man is supposedly selected and trained in the same way as Valley and the Chinese man to be Valley's replacement. He is defeated by Valley and supposedly falls to his death, only to resurface in Gotham early in the Underworld Unleashed crossover event wearing one of Valley's 'Batman' armors and engaging in underground fights after having made a deal with Abra Kadabra (acting on behalf of Neron) for his soul in return for his life. * In The Multiversity: The Just, which takes place on the alternate Earth-16 (where the grown sidekicks and children of superheroes live on an Earth free of crime), Damian Wayne, the new Batman, has a variation of Jean Paul's Azrael suit in a glass display in the Batcave. ==Powers and abilities== As Azrael, Jean-Paul has enhanced physical abilities. He has been shown to fight at heightened levels even when fatigued, a fact exemplified when Azrael was able to defeat Bane, despite suffering from both extreme exhaustion and Venom withdrawal.Azrael #39 He has also been shown to be able to resist an even more potent version of the Venom drug, having been able to break its vast addiction in only one night. Azrael is also a superior fighter; although he lacks technique and style in his fighting moves, he makes up for it with his inhuman speed, reflexes, and agility. Azrael has been able to match Deathstroke in a sword duel and has even defeated Batman in hand-to- hand combat.Azrael #99 This is not only due to his martial arts skills, but also due to his inhuman physical abilities. ===Equipment=== The original Azrael costume worn by Jean-Paul Valley consists of red and gold armor. After becoming an \\"Agent of the Bat\\", he dons silver and black armor with a red cape and a stylized red bat symbol on the chest. Later on, he dons red armor with golden gauntlets, boots, shoulder pads and a blue cape. He sometimes carries a flaming sword, and also uses two retractable daggers hidden in the gauntlets of his costume that can be charged with thermal energy to increase their destructive power. In Batman: The Ultimate Guide to the Dark Knight, Scott Beatty implied that Azrael's changing costumes were reflections of the changes in Azrael's life from an agent of St. Dumas to an agent of the Batman to his own man. The gauntlets were taken by Kate Spencer, the current Manhunter, and are used in her outfit. The New 52 version of Jean-Paul wears a similar costume, and his weapon is a flaming knight sword called Murasame. He also possesses the familiar gauntlet blades as well. ==Other versions== * In The Multiversity: The Just, which takes place on the alternate Earth-16 (where the grown sidekicks and children of superheroes live on an Earth free of crime), Damian Wayne, the new Batman, has a variation of Jean Paul's Azrael suit in a glass display in the Batcave. ==In other media== ===Television=== *Azrael made his live-action debut in the second season of Gotham, portrayed by James Frain. This incarnation's alter ego is Theo Galavan, a billionaire industrialist who is secretly the heir apparent of the Order of St. Dumas, and uncle of Silver St. Cloud. Galavan is the power behind a group of insane criminals called \\"The Maniax\\" who terrorize Gotham, but betrays them by killing their leader, Jerome Valeska, making him a public hero. He is elected Mayor of Gotham with the reluctant help of Oswald Cobblepot, whom he blackmails into killing the other mayoral candidates by holding his mother, Gertrude, hostage. When Galavan's assassin sister, Tabitha kills Gertrude anyway, Cobblepot swears revenge and enters a tenuous alliance with Detective Jim Gordon to bring Galavan down. The two of them eventually expose Galavan's corruption, prevent the Order of St. Dumas from sacrificing Bruce Wayne, destroy his criminal empire, and kill him. In \\"Wrath of the Villains: Pinewood\\", Galavan under the alias of \\"Patient 44\\" is revived by Hugo Strange, who gives him enhanced physical abilities. Strange's experiments warp Galavan's mind, however; he has no memory of his past life, and believes himself to be Azrael, an ancient immortal warrior who vanquished the Order's enemies. Strange takes advantage of Galavan's delusions by ordering \\"Azrael\\" to kill Gordon, gifting him a sword, mask and medieval armor. Galavan attacks the Gotham City Police Department, killing several police officers and wounding its captain, Nathaniel Barnes. In \\"Wrath of the Villains: Unleashed\\", Galavan is poised to finally kill Gordon, Alfred and Bruce Wayne at Wayne Manor, when Cobblepot and his henchman Butch Gilzean blow him up with a rocket-propelled grenade launcher.Gotham EP Promises Comics-Accurate Azrael in Second Half of Season 2 *Azrael's name is mentioned in Lucius Fox's journal in the Batwoman episode \\"A Secret Kept From All The Rest\\". ===Video games=== * Both the Jean-Paul Valley and Michael Lane versions of Azrael, as well as the Jean-Paul incarnation of Batman are playable characters in Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure. ==== Lego ==== *The Jean-Paul Valley version of Azrael is a playable character in the Nintendo DS version of Lego Batman: The Videogame, unlocked after achieving \\"True Hero\\" on all levels. Additionally, LEGO pieces can be unlocked and used to build Azrael in the character creation feature of the main version of the game. *The Michael Lane version of Azrael appears as a playable character in the handheld versions of Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes. *The Jean-Paul Valley version of Batman appears as a playable character in Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham, via the 75th Anniversary downloadable content. ====Batman: Arkham==== The Michael Lane incarnation of Azrael appears in the Batman Arkham series, where he is voiced by Khary Payton. *Azrael first appears in Batman: Arkham City, as the focus of the \\"Watcher in the Wings\\" side mission. After events in the game's main storyline, he can be seen on the rooftops of certain buildings within Arkham City's districts, watching over Batman. When approached, Azrael will disappear in a cloud of smoke, leaving a symbol for Batman to scan. After scanning all the symbols and combining them to reveal a location, Batman meets Azrael, who tells him about the Order of St. Dumas and warns him of their prophecy of future events and the Dark Knight's end. Though Batman doubts this, Azrael tells him that, regardless of his belief, there are parts of it that are becoming true and they will meet again, before disappearing into a cloud of smoke. *The PlayStation 3 edition of Batman: Arkham Origins features the Knightfall downloadable content, containing an alternate Batman costume based on Jean-Paul Valley's Batsuit, as well as challenge maps based on Batman: Knightfall. *Azrael returns in Batman: Arkham Knight as the focus of the Most Wanted side mission, \\"Heir to the Cowl\\", during which he is briefly playable. The character is fully playable in the game's challenge maps via downloadable content. During Scarecrow's takeover of Gotham, the Order of St. Dumas sends Azrael to Gotham on a mission to become Batman's successor. Azrael meets up with Batman once again, who puts him through several trials to test his abilities and see if he is a worthy successor, during which Batman takes away his sword and Azrael is monitored by Alfred Pennyworth, who then informs Batman that the vigilante uses the same fighting style as him, implying that Azrael has been watching Batman for years. After the final trial is completed, Azrael states that he is prepared to become Gotham's next protector, but Batman opts to wait until he says so, causing Azrael to depart. Afterwards, Alfred informs Batman of Azrael's secret identity as Michael Lane and that he has a microchip in his brain planted by that the Order of St. Dumas. Arriving at the hideout inside the old clock tower, Batman analyses the microchip and discovers that the Order have been subtly controlling Azrael's actions, as well as a secret encrypted message that reveals the Order's real plan: have Azrael kill Batman and replace him as Gotham's one and only protector, believing that his moral code against murdering criminals stands in the way of true justice. Azrael, having followed Batman here, then confronts the Dark Knight and prepares to kill him and complete his mission, but Batman tells him how the Order have been in control of his actions all along. He then allows Azrael to take back his sword and do as he wishes with it, which leaves the player with three possible options: ** If Azrael attempts to kill Batman with the sword, he is quickly subdued by the Dark Knight and subsequently incarcerated at the GCPD Headquarters, where Lane vows to escape and kill Batman one day. During this time, Azrael will begin arguing with Deacon Blackfire over who is the true champion of God. ** If Azrael picks up the sword and resists his orders, he breaks it in front of Batman to show that the Order no longer have control over him, before leaving to exact revenge on the Order for their actions. Batman tells him that he made the right choice and Azrael makes no further appearances in the story. ** If Azrael leaves without picking up the sword, the outcome will be the same as choosing to destroy it, the only difference being that his sword will remain on display in the clock tower for the rest of the game. ==Collected editions== * Batman: Contagion (Azrael #15) * Batman: No Man's Land Vol. 1 (Azrael: Agent of the Bat #51-55) * Batman: No Man's Land Vol. 2 (Azrael: Agent of the Bat #56) * Batman: No Man's Land Vol. 3 (Azrael: Agent of the Bat #58) * Batman: No Man's Land Vol. 4 (Azrael: Agent of the Bat #59-61) * Batman: Sword of Azrael (#1-4) [1993] - * Knightfall * Azrael: Angel in the Dark (Azrael vol. 2 #1-6) [2010] - * Batman: Gotham Shall Be Judged (Azrael vol. 2 #14-18) [2012] - * Azrael: Death's Dark Knight (#1-#3) * Azrael Vol. 1: Fallen Angel (Batman: Sword of Azrael #1-4, Showcase '94 #10, Azrael vol. 1 #1-7) ==References== ==External links== * World of Black Heroes: Azrael Michael Washington Lane Biography * Azrael (Jean-Paul Valley) at the DC Database Project * Azrael (Jean-Paul Ludovic Valley, the father) at the DC Database Project * Azrael (Michael Lane) at the DC Database Project * Azrael Biography at Batman Myth.com * * Category:DC Comics supervillains Category:DC Comics male supervillains Category:1992 comics debuts Category:Batman characters Category:Comics characters introduced in 1992 Category:DC Comics metahumans Category:DC Comics characters with superhuman strength Category:DC Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds Category:DC Comics martial artists Category:DC Comics titles Category:Fictional characters with multiple personalities Category:Fictional assassins Category:Fictional vigilantes Category:Fictional genetically engineered characters Category:Fictional African-American people Category:Fictional police officers in comics Category:Fictional victims of brainwashing and indoctrination Category:Characters created by Dennis O'Neil Category:Characters created by Joe Quesada Category:Characters created by Grant Morrison Category:Fictional knights ","title":"Azrael (DC Comics)"},{"id":"1276084","text":"', officially the ' (), is a in the province of , .. According to the , it has a population of people. Sinilóan is a center of education, commerce and transportation, serving towns in eastern Laguna and some towns from the provinces of Quezon and Rizal. The municipality has active business and trade activities. ==Etymology== From the early period of Spanish colonialisation, some female inhabitants of the place were milling their palay in their fields. While doing this, some Spaniards came and asked them, \\"Como se llama esta pueblo?\\" The natives, not knowing Spanish thought that they were asked what they were doing and one of them answered, \\"camí po ay gumiguiling\\". The Spaniards repeated, \\"Guiling-Guiling\\", to which the natives nodded. Some this place known as \\"Guiling-Guiling\\" from 1583 to 1604. Another story has it that during the later part of the year 1604, three brothers, namely, Juan Puno, Juan Pili, and Juan Puhuwan, migrated into this community. They selected a lot adjacent to the river Río Romelo and divided it equally among themselves. When the parish priest saw the ingenuity of the three brothers in equally dividing the land, he asked the natives how equally was expressed in Tagalog. The natives gave him the expression \\"Sinloan\\". Right then and there, the name Guiling-Guiling was changed to Siniloang which meant justice, equality and fairness. The word travelled from mouth to mouth with sound variations. Because of the difficulty of some Spaniards in pronouncing Siniloang, the name Siniloan struck and became the official name of this town. The name Siniloan is also believed to have been taken from a legendary story about Luis and Ana, a married couple who chased a wild boar from a place called Luisiana. They ran after that big boar from Luisiana to Cavinti (kapit sa Binti). The people along the way who saw Luis and Ana chasing the boar took pity on them and helped them to catch it.

She married him in 1956, and supported him throughout his prime ministership (1983–1991); they divorced in 1995. She worked in social policy areas, and was an amateur pianist and a patron of the arts. After she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, she made public appearances in order to raise awareness of the disease. ==Biography== Hazel Masterson was born in Perth, Western Australia in 1929. She met her future husband Bob Hawke at a church fellowship in Perth. They married on March 3, 1956. They lived in Melbourne from 1958 to 1983, including during his term as President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (1969-1980). Bob spent much of his time in Canberra after his election to Parliament in 1980. After he became Prime Minister on 11 March 1983, the family lived in The Lodge in Canberra, until Hawke was replaced as Prime Minister by Paul Keating in December 1991. During their marriage, Bob Hawke had an affair with Blanche d'Alpuget in the 1970s. Hawke proposed to his mistress in 1978, but later withdrew the offer saying that a divorce from Hazel could cost Hawke three percent (3%) of the vote to elect the latter to a safe seat. D'Alpuget was initially so upset at Hawke's decision not to leave Hazel that she considered either assassinating him or taking her own life, but they reconciled and remained friends; so much so that she became his official biographer. From 1980 to 1982 d'Alpuget worked closely with Hawke in preparing his 1982 biography. In 1988 Hawke and d'Alpuget resumed their affair but he remained ostensibly committed to his wife during his prime ministership. After he left office in 1991, he and Hazel announced their separation and later divorced. Hawke and d'Alpuget married in 1995. Bob Hawke formally apologized for the toll the divorce and subsequent remarriage took on the family. Hazel had four children with Bob Hawke: Susan Pieters-Hawke (born 1957), Stephen (born 1959), Rosslyn (born 1960) and Robert Jr, who died in his infancy. Hazel and Bob also had an illegal termination before they were married to allow Bob the best chance of getting his Rhodes scholarship, which was only conferred to unwed candidates. ==Views and interests== Hawke acted as a prominent pro-choice advocate in Australia, often drawing on her personal experience of having an illegal abortion in 1952 so that her future husband Bob Hawke could further his education at the University of Oxford. She wrote books, such as My Own Life: An Autobiography (copyright 1992) and A Little Bit Of Magic: Thoughts For Women (copyright 1994). Hawke was an excellent pianist. In 1990, she was one of the three soloists in Mozart's Concerto in F for Three Pianos and Orchestra, K. 242, the others being Duncan Gifford and Rebecca Chambers. They played at the Sydney Opera House with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra under John Hopkins.

Her family had noticed significant short-term memory loss, leading to the diagnosis in 2001. She had been reluctant to go public about the illness she called the 'Big A', but eventually did so to publicise a fund for supporting Alzheimer's sufferers that she had jointly set up with Alzheimer's Australia. In 2004, Hazel Flynn and Hawke's daughter Susan Pieters-Hawke published a book, Hazel's Journey: A personal experience of Alzheimer's, describing the previous decade of Hawke's life and the onset of Alzheimer's. At the book launch on 1 November 2004, Pieters-Hawke revealed that her mother had reached the mid-stages of the disease and was now suffering from quite severe short-term memory loss. That year the Hazel Hawke Dementia and Care Fund was established.ABC Radio Guestbook Hawke's granddaughter Sophie Pieters- Hawke launched an education kit for schoolchildren about Alzheimers in 2007.

The line runs through the commercial section of downtown Montreal underneath Boulevard de Maisonneuve, formerly Rue de Montigny. It runs mainly on a northeast to southwest axis with a connection to the Orange and Yellow Lines at Berri-UQAM, and with the Orange Line west of downtown at Lionel-Groulx. The section between Atwater and Frontenac was part of the initial network; the line was extended to Honoré- Beaugrand in 1976 to provide easy access to 1976 Summer Olympics sites. It was extended to Angrignon in 1978. All but three stations — De L'Église, Lionel- Groulx, and Charlevoix — are side platform stations. ==History== The first stations, found on the section between Atwater and Papineau, opened on October 14, 1966. Several smaller sections were delayed by several months. On December 19, 1966, the line was further extended from Papineau to Frontenac, and two days later came the stopover Beaudry between Berri-UQAM and Papineau. On December 20, 1967, Frédéric Back completed his art piece L'histoire de la musique à Montréal (The history of music in Montreal) in Place-des-Arts station. This commissioned piece was the first artwork completed in the Metro system. The construction of the second phase began in 1971, when Montreal was awarded the bid to host the 1976 Summer Olympics. The goal was to have the ability to transport visitors from downtown to the Olympic Park in the east end. The opening of the section between Frontenac and Honoré-Beaugrand took place on June 6, 1976, six weeks before the start of the Summer Olympics. Green Line trains inaugurated an autopilot feature on November 8, 1976. The third expansion phase, between Atwater and Angrignon, came into operation on September 3, 1978. == Rolling stock == From the line's opening in 1966, MR-63 cars were used on the Green Line. Upon the introduction of the MR-73 cars on the Green Line in 1976, the older MR-63 cars were used on the Orange Line. From the early-1980s until 2018, MR-63 cars were once again in use on the Green Line. With the introduction of the newer MPM-10 trains (also known as Azur) in 2016 on the Orange line, the Green Line is now primarily served by both the MR-73 and MPM-10 cars. The MR-63 trains were fully retired on June 21, 2018. As of August 2019, all 54 Azur train sets were delivered. Of these, nine are running on the Green Line.. ==List of stations== { class=\\" centre\\" - ! scope=col Station ! scope=col Inauguration date ! scope=col Odonym ! scope=col Namesake !scope=colTransfers/Connections !scope=colLocation - Angrignon rowspan=8September 3, 1978 Angrignon Boulevard Angrignon Park Jean-Baptiste Angrignon (Councillor of Montreal)  Terminus Angrignon rowspan=\\"3\\"Le Sud-Ouest - Monk Monk Boulevard James Monk (Attorney-General of Quebec)  - Jolicoeur Jolicœur Street Joseph-Moïse Jolicœur (parish priest)  - Verdun De Verdun Street Notre-Dame-de- Saverdun, France  rowspan=\\"3\\"Verdun - De l'Église De l'Église Avenue Église Saint-Paul  - LaSalle LaSalle Boulevard Robert Cavelier de La Salle (French explorer)  - Charlevoix  Charlevoix Street Pierre François Xavier de Charlevoix (French historian and explorer)  rowspan=\\"2\\"Le Sud-Ouest - Lionel-Groulx Lionel-Groulx Avenue Lionel Groulx (Quebec historian)  Orange Line - Atwater rowspan=7October 14, 1966 Atwater Avenue Edwin Atwater (Councillor of Montreal)  rowspan=\\"10\\"Ville-Marie - Guy-Concordia Guy Street Concordia University Étienne Guy (landowner) Concordia salus  - Peel Rue Peel Sir Robert Peel  - McGill McGill College Avenue McGill University James McGill (Scottish-Canadian businessman) Réseau express métropolitain (planned) - Place-des-Arts Place des Arts Cultural complex  - Saint-Laurent Saint Laurent Boulevard Saint Lawrence or Saint Lawrence River  - Berri-UQAM Berri Street Université du Québec à Montréal De Montigny Street Simon Després dit Le Berry Testard de Montigny family  - Beaudry December 21, 1966 Beaudry Street Pierre Beaudry (landowner) - Papineau October 14, 1966 Papineau Avenue Joseph Papineau  - Frontenac December 19, 1966 Frontenac Street Louis de Buade de Frontenac (Governor-General of New France)  - Préfontaine rowspan=9June 6, 1976 Préfontaine Street Raymond-Préfontaine Park Raymond-Fournier Préfontaine (mayor of Montreal)  rowspan=\\"10\\"Mercier– Hochelaga– Maisonneuve - Joliette Joliette Street Barthélemy Joliette (founder of Joliette, Quebec)  - Pie-IX Pie-IX Boulevard Pope Pius IX  - Viau Viau Street Charles-Théodore Viau  - Assomption De l'Assomption Boulevard Dogma of the Assumption of Mary (proclaimed by Pope Pius XII in 1950)  - Cadillac De Cadillac Street Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac (French explorer)  - Langelier Langelier Boulevard François-Charles- Stanislas Langelier  - Radisson Radisson Street Pierre-Esprit Radisson (French explorer)  Terminus Radisson - Honoré-Beaugrand Honoré-Beaugrand Street Honoré Beaugrand  } ==See also== * Orange Line * Yellow Line * Blue Line * Red Line (Line 3) * List of Montreal Metro stations ==References== == External links == * 2008 STM System Map Category:1966 establishments in Quebec Category:Rapid transit lines in Canada ","title":"Green Line (Montreal Metro)"},{"id":"1276114","text":"Kalonymus Haberkasten was a rabbi and Talmudist in sixteenth century Poland.

It was used as an illegal, secret detention center during the Dirty War of military dictatorship. The original ESMA was a complex located at 8151 Libertador Avenue, in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, in the barrio of Núñez. It was the seat of U.T.3.3.2—Unidad de Tareas (Task Unit) 2 of http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/arg/doc/perren1.html While most English language sources refer to the unit as a 'task force', the attached Spanish webpage gives what appears to the proper name of the unit, named according to the Task force#US Navy numbering systems.–which was responsible for thousands of instances of forced disappearance, torture and illegal execution. The military took the babies born to mothers imprisoned there, suppressed their true identities and allowed them to be illegally adopted by military families and associates of the regime. ESMA was the largest detention center of its kind during the Dirty War. The National Congress passed a law on 5 August 2004 that converted the ESMA complex into a museum, the Space for Memory and for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights (Espacio para la Memoria y para la Promoción y Defensa de los Derechos Humanos). Since 2014 plans are also made for the campus to house a second museum, this time, to honor the military personnel killed and wounded during the Falklands War, since several of its alumni and 230 students fought in the conflict. The School, once again legitimate, was renamed Escuela de Suboficiales de la Armada (acronym ESSA; English: Navy Petty-Officers' School) in 2001, and moved in 2005 to the Puerto Belgrano Naval Base,Web site of ESSA: History [in Spanish initials a plural is often indicated by a double letter, thus \\"SS\\" stands for \\"Suboficiales\\", plural] 28 km from the city of Bahía Blanca, and about 600 km southwest of Buenos Aires. ==Etymology and usage during the Dirty War== Almost 5,000 people were abducted and held in the original ESMA campus in its active participation in the Dirty War between 1976-1983; all except 150 were killed during or after interrogation and torture.\\"Argentina's dirty war: the museum of horrors\\", The Telegraph When announcements were made that prisoners were to be \\"transferred\\", people came to understand they were going to be executed. The prisoners were taken to the basement, sedated, and then killed, some by shooting, others in death flights: they were flown over the Atlantic Ocean or the Rio de la Plata and pushed out of the aircraft. These are only some examples of the many treatments that prisoners of the ESMA were forced to experience during the kidnappings that forced them into clandestine detention centers. === Who became los desaparecidos/the disappeared? === There were certain types of individuals within Argentinian society who were to be kidnapped and removed from it. Stories show, for example, that there was a disproportionate number of Jews taken in custody, shedding light on anti-Semitic victimization. Another group targeted included the people who potentially supported a different government, opposing the current junta and military dictatorship of Argentina. If there was any suspicion that Argentinians were meeting secretly and consistently to resist General Jorge Rafael Videla and his regime, the government would kidnap these people and place them in detention centers such as the ESMA. This would serve as a lesson to incite fear within other members of the community who were also against the current governmental structure of Argentina. Upon being kidnapped, for example, many kidnappers would interrogate the prisoners about why they were opposing the Argentinian dictatorship and spreading a new political ideology, disregarding the fact of whether or not this was actually the case. === Layout of the ESMA === Once kidnapped, it was very rare that these prisoners would return home, leaving loved ones wondering if they would ever see their family members or friends again. During the beginning stages of the Dirty War, Argentinians living in Buenos Aires were unaware that the building that once housed a school had been transformed into a center for punishing \\"subversion.\\" Once the prisoners had arrived to this new \\"renovation,\\" their basic human rights would be ignored. Instead, they were taken to certain floors depending on their status of punishment in an effort to dehumanize the victims. The basement contained interrogation rooms and a station meant for taking and maintaining photographs of each of the prisoners. These photos would allow victims to be recorded, providing an accurate count today as to the five thousand people who died due to the treatment within this camp. The first floor was staged as an operation room for the leaders of the torture to plan, execute, and continue their efforts to punish the prisoners. The second and third floors were adequately furnished and kept, as these were the floors where the officers lived and slept. These officers were committed to torturing the dissidents, contributing twenty four hours, seven days a week of fear for the victims who never knew when the next hit would happen. Also on the third floor, extending to the fourth floor, was an area known as the \\"capucha,\\" or hood. This was where prisoners were kept, and this was where conditions were purposefully kept dark and hopeless. === Survivor stories of the ESMA === A few victims that were able to survive and escape the ESMA have made it a priority to share their experiences of the torture and human rights infractions they faced while living in this center. One detainee who survived, Ana María Martí, has related some of the horrific treatment she faced while in the confines of the ESMA. By the time she was captured, information was out that this torture center was something to fear. When she was kidnapped, the officers who snatched her laughed at the fear she had at the mention of the ESMA. Once she arrived, her stories telling her torture resembled the other stories that have been told by those lucky enough to survive. The main goal of the ESMA officers was to inflict as much pain as was possible, testing every victim's capability of surviving amidst deathly circumstances. Just within the basement floor of the interrogation methods, victims were subjugated to electric shocks, humiliating treatments, and removal of genitalia and other organs of the human body. The \\"capucha\\" of the ESMA was another terrifying area within this clandestine detention center. After the initial torturing and interrogations, prisoners were chained on the third floor and left alone while hooded (hence the name of the \\"capucha\\"). They were left in complete darkness with no communication, forced to be isolated in another way to instigate panic and fear for the prisoners. Eventually, night and day turned into one continual nightmare once prisoners became more veteran members of this torture site. Ana María Martí was able to survive these horrid conditions, but she witnessed many other of her fellow victims die and suffer at the hands of the officers. She remarked that prisoners would begin to know when someone was about to be taken to the killing chambers; in order to prepare, the ESMA would properly feed and take care of the victims to bulk them up. This was in a concerted effort to make the eventual corpses seem more healthy and less connected to the operations of the ESMA. === Killing methods in the ESMA === The ESMA, because it killed approximately 4,850 prisoners, used a plethora of methods to kill their victims. Many popular techniques did not require that the prisoners left the confines of the ESMA. Inside the basement, interrogation methods such as drowning and electrocuting were common and an easy way to kill. The ESMA officers, in other manners, found more unique ways to commit human rights violations that led to the deaths of many. For example, as seen in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust, these officers would attempt scientific experiments to show how well the human body could handle the loss of limbs, the removal of organs, and the fluctuation of hot and cold temperatures. Victims were also taken outside of the ESMA in the custody of those in charge to promote a sense of entertainment on the way to their murders. They would leave the prisoners in the middle of the jungle, supervising them as they unsuccessfully attempted to escape. Eventually, the guards would shoot them until they were dead. The most cited killing method in the ESMA includes the murders of the prisoners off of moving planes. Officers would require that the ESMA residents took rides in these planes, only to push them off and watch them fall to their deaths. The victims were often still conscious, despite having been drugged. As a result, numerous bodies of victims washed up on beaches hundreds of kilometers south of Buenos Aires. Also known as death flights, this inhumane treatment contributed in a major way to the numerous deaths that came from this detention center. Overall, the ESMA committed approximately one-sixth of the total murders during the eight- year period of the Dirty War. ==Functions and authorities== ===Legitimate=== Under construction in 1928. According to the ESSA Web site, in 1897 the Escuela de Aprendices Mecánicos de la Armada (Navy Apprentice Mechanics School) was founded in premises that are now the Historical Naval Museum of Tigre, in Buenos Aires Province. In 1900 the School moved to naval workshops in Dársena Norte; in 1902 it became Escuela de Aprendices Mecánicos y Foguistas (Apprentice Mechanics and Stokers School). Two years later it became Escuela de Mecánicos de la Armada, and in 1911 Escuela de Mecánica de la Armada. In 1928 it moved to its later notorious premises, designed by the architect Raúl J. Álvarez, on Blandengues street (now Avenida del Libertador), between Arroyo Medrano and the extension of Deheza street. Once again a legitimate educational establishment, it was renamed Escuela de suboficiales de la Armada in 2001, and moved to Puerto Belgrano in 2005, merging the NCO schools of the Argentina Marines and the Argentine Naval Aviation in the process into one institution. Other sources say that the School was founded in 1924, on land granted that year by the Municipality of Buenos Aires to the Ministry of the Navy by a decree that year, during the presidency of Marcelo T. de Alvear. Under the terms of the decree it was to revert to the city if it ceased to be a military educational establishment. The School of Mechanics, Naval War School, and Officers' Mess were built on the land. Each year about 10,000 youths signed up to enter as regular students, of whom around half were admitted and given scholarships for courses of study such as electronics, aeronautics, management, marine engineering (mecánico naval), radio operation, meteorology, and oceanography. The students lived in the complex from Monday through Friday, taking 8 to 10 hours of classes per day. The degrees could be completed in up to three years of studies, with the students receiving the degree of técnico (\\"technician\\"), with the option of continuing in the military or working elsewhere. The main entrance opens onto the central pavilion, where the authorities' offices were located. A covered patio there was used to show movies to the student body. To the left of this building was petty officers' housing, and further off and separated, the officers' housing, where the clandestine detention center operated during the 1976-1983 military dictatorship. To the right of the central pavilion were the checkpoint, the military guard building, and the Naval War School (Escuela de Guerra Naval). Behind, at the rear, were the dormitories and, across Avenida Lugones, the institution's sports field. On the perimeter of the school were checkpoints which were manned by the students in rotating shifts, at least one week per year for each student. In 1982, 230 final-year students of the ESMA were drafted to fight in the Falklands War; some of them died in the sinking of the ARA Belgrano and the attack on ARA Sobral. In 1998, president Carlos Menem ordered the move of the School to the Puerto Belgrano base, and the use of the old campus as a museum.Armada admitió que la ESMA fue \\"un símbolo de barbarie\\" , Terra, 3 de marzo de 2004. ESSA continues to function in the Puerto Belgrano base. ===Extrajudicial detention centre=== The ESMA was used as a detention center from the very start of the 1976 dictatorship: on 24 March, the day of the coup d'état, several people kidnapped by the Armed Forces were taken there. Task Unit 3.2.2 was led by Rear-Admiral Rubén Jacinto Chamorro and Captain Carlos Acosta Ambone. Among its ranks were Jorge Eduardo Acosta, Alfredo Astiz, Ricardo Miguel Cavallo and Adolfo Scilingo, who became notorious as torturers. Astiz was known as the \\"Blond Angel of Death\\". Its chaplain during 1977 was Father Alberto Ángel Zanchetta. It was in charge of the city of Buenos Aires proper and the northern part of the metropolitan area (Gran Buenos Aires). Officers in charge were under strict orders not to reveal their identities or military affiliation when capturing prisoners. Between 1976 and 1978, the group was ultimately under the orders of Navy Commander-in- Chief Emilio Eduardo Massera. Massera had reportedly been present when the unit was set up, gave an opening speech to the officers, and personally participated in the first illegal detentions. ====Trials==== A major trial, nicknamed \\"the ESMA mega-trial\\", of 63 people accused of crimes against humanity (lesa humanidad) during the 1976-1983 dictatorship, including those involved in death flights, was reaching its close in July 2015. 830 witnesses and 789 victims were heard.starMedia: Trial for crimes against humanity in Argentina reaching its close, 7 July 2015 There had been two previous trials after the Supreme Court struck down an amnesty the military dictatorship had granted its members; in the first the one accused committed suicide before a verdict was reached; in a 2009 trial, twelve defendants were sentenced to life imprisonment.

His interests are wide-ranging. He studied mountain gorillas with Dian Fossey in Rwanda, he was the first to demonstrate the existence of \\"blindsight\\" after brain damage in monkeys, he proposed the celebrated theory of the \\"social function of intellect\\" and he is the only scientist ever to edit the literary journal Granta. Humphrey played a significant role in the anti-nuclear movement in the late 1970s and delivered the BBC Bronowski memorial lecture titled \\"Four Minutes to Midnight\\" in 1981. His ten books include Consciousness Regained, The Inner Eye, A History of the Mind, Leaps of Faith, The Mind Made Flesh, Seeing Red, and Soul Dust. He has been the recipient of several honours, including the Martin Luther King Memorial Prize, the Pufendorf Medal and the British Psychological Society's book award. He has been lecturer in psychology at Oxford, assistant director of the Subdepartment of Animal Behaviour at Cambridge, senior research fellow at Cambridge, professor of psychology at the New School for Social Research, New York, and school professor at the London School of Economics. ==Family== Humphrey is the son of the immunologist John H. Humphrey and his wife Janet Humphrey (née Hill), daughter of the Nobel Prize–winning physiologist Archibald Hill. His great uncle was the economist John Maynard Keynes. Humphrey married Caroline Waddington, daughter of C. H. Waddington, in 1967 (divorced 1977). From 1977 to 1984 he was the partner of the English actress Susannah York. in 1994 he married Ayla Kohn, with whom he has two children, Ada (born 1995) and Samuel (born 1997). ==Early career== Nicholas Humphrey was educated at Westminster School (1956–61) and Trinity College, Cambridge (1961–67). His doctoral research at Cambridge, supervised by Lawrence Weiskrantz, was on the neuropsychology of vision in primates. He made the first single cell recordings from the superior colliculus of monkeys, and discovered the existence of a previously unsuspected capacity for vision after total lesions of the striate cortex (a capacity which, when it was later confirmed in human beings, came to be called \\"blindsight\\"). On moving to Oxford, he turned his attention to evolutionary aesthetics. He did research on monkey visual preferences (especially colour preferences) and wrote the essay \\"The Illusion of beauty\\", which, as a radio broadcast, won the Glaxo Science Writers Prize in 1980. ==Work in evolutionary psychology and philosophy of mind== He returned to Cambridge, to the Sub Department of Animal Behaviour in 1970, and there met Dian Fossey, who invited him to spend three months at her gorilla study camp in Rwanda. His experience with the gorillas, and a subsequent visit to Richard Leakey's field-site on Lake Turkana, set Humphrey thinking about how cognitive skills – intelligence and consciousness – could have arisen as an adaption to social life. In 1976 he wrote an essay titled \\"The Social Function of Intellect\\", which is widely regarded as one of the foundational works of evolutionary psychology and the basis for Machiavellian intelligence theory. This paper formed the basis of his first book, Consciousness Regained: Chapters in the Development of Mind (1983). In 1984 Humphrey left his academic post at Cambridge to work on his Channel 4 television series The Inner Eye, on the development of the human mind. This series was finished in 1986 with the release of a book of the same name. In 1987, Daniel Dennett invited Humphrey to work with him at his Center for Cognitive Studies at Tufts University. They worked on developing an empirically based theory of consciousness, and undertook a study on Multiple Personality Disorder. Humphrey's next book, A History of the Mind (1992), put forward a theory on how consciousness as feeling rather than thinking may have evolved. This book won the inaugural British Psychological Society's annual Book of the Year Award in 1993. His writings on consciousness continued in The Mind Made Flesh: Essays from the Frontiers of Evolution and Psychology (2002), Seeing Red: A Study in Consciousness (2006), and most recently Soul Dust: the Magic of Consciousness (2011). In this last book he puts forward a radical new theory. Consciousness, he argues, is nothing less than a magical-mystery show that we stage inside our own heads – a show that paves the way for spirituality, and allows us to reap the rewards, and anxieties, of living in what he calls the \\"soul niche\\". ==Other work== Humphrey became active in the anti-nuclear movement in the late 1970s. This led to an invitation to deliver the Bronowski lecture on the BBC in 1981. He titled his lecture, on the dangers of the arms race, \\"Four Minutes to Midnight\\". With Robert Lifton he edited an anthology of writings on war and peace, In a Dark Time, which was released in 1984 and was awarded the Martin Luther King Memorial Prize. In 1992, Humphrey was appointed to a Senior Research Fellowship at Darwin College, Cambridge funded by the Perrott-Warwick Fellowship in parapsychology. He undertook a sceptical study of parapsychological phenomena such as extra- sensory perception and psychokinesis, resulting in his book Soul Searching: Human Nature and Supernatural Belief (1995) (in America this book was published under the title Leaps of Faith). Humphrey has worked on a number of TV and radio documentaries as well as The Inner Eye. The topics range from the psychology of paranormal belief to the psycho-history of mediaeval animal trials. In 2005, he visited the Ulas family of human quadrupeds in southern Turkey and published a report on them with John Skoyles and Roger Keynes. A documentary entitled The Family That Walks on All Fours based on this visit was broadcast on BBC2 in March 2006, and on NOVA in November 2006. Over the last ten years Humphrey has been investigating the placebo effect, and has put forward a novel theory of what he calls the \\"health management system\\" through which the brain has top-down control over the body's healing resources.

He was educated at Manchester Grammar School and King's College, Cambridge; he started on a legal career, but turned to writing in 1908, after a short spell as an actor. ==Career== Cannan worked first as a translator, and a reviewer in London publications. Many of his novels are in part autobiographical, and fit into a novel sequence the Lawrie Saga, around the character Stephen Lawrie. Samuel Butler was a major influence on his fiction. In 1914, the novelist Henry James in an article in The Times named Cannan as one of four significant up-and-coming authors, alongside D. H. Lawrence, Compton Mackenzie and Hugh Walpole.Haycock, A Crisis of Brilliance (2009), p. 182 He was employed as a secretary by J. M. Barrie, working with him in their efforts against censorship of the theatre by the Lord Chamberlain. A relationship developed in 1909 between Cannan and Barrie's wife Mary (née Ansell), a former actress who felt neglected in her marriage. Cannan had been wooing Kathleen Bruce, who at the same time was receiving advances from the explorer Robert Falcon Scott. When Bruce decided to marry Scott, Mary Barrie's sympathy for Cannan developed a momentum of its own. Her husband sought to be reconciled, but relented and divorced her in a high-profile case, and she and Cannan were married in 1910. Cannan was caricatured as Mr. Gunn, a minor character in George Bernard Shaw's 1911 drama Fanny's First Play. Mark Gertler During World War I he was a pacifist and then conscientious objector, and was involved in the National Council Against Conscription. He used his experiences in later novels, making the character Melian Stokes in Pugs and Peacocks a portrait of Bertrand Russell. He had known Ottoline Morrell from before the war. During it he moved in her circle, introducing her to D. H. Lawrence, and knew also Dora Carrington, Dorothy Brett and the artist Mark Gertler. Cannan's book Mendel was based on Gertler's early life (Mendel being his Yiddish given name), and explored his relationships with C. R. W. Nevinson and Carrington. Gertler painted Gilbert Cannan and his Mill; the picture is now in the Ashmolean Museum. The mill was at Cholesbury in Buckinghamshire, where Cannan was living in 1916, and which attracted a number of his intellectual circle (including Lawrence and his wife Frieda, and Katherine Mansfield and John Middleton Murry). The picture also shows the Cannans' two Newfoundland dogs, SammyAnsell, Mary, Dogs and Men, Duckworth & Co, 1924, ASIN: B00087Y2NG on the left and Luath, who was also Barrie's dog before his divorce from Mary Ansell and the inspiration for Nana, the Darling children's nurse in Peter Pan.Birkin, Andrew, J. M. Barrie and The Lost Boys, Constable & Co, 1979, In 1916, partly in response to the devastating effects of the war and the threat of conscription, Cannan suffered a mental breakdown, an experience which he vividly described in his book, The Release of the Soul.Haycock, A Crisis of Brilliance (2009), p. 254 His marriage ended in 1918 when he had an affair with Gwen Wilson who later married Henry Mond in 1920 while Cannan was lecturing in the United States. Unconventionally, Cannan lived with Wilson and her new husband in a ménage à trois in their home, Mulberry House, in Smith Square, Westminster. After the war Cannan devoted himself to writing, translation work and travel but another mental breakdown in 1923 proved untreatable. He became a mental patient at the Priory Hospital, Roehampton. He then spent the rest of his life confined to Holloway Sanatorium near Virginia Water where he died of cancer on 30 June 1955. ==Family== The poet May Wedderburn Cannan and her sister, writer Joanna Cannan, were cousins of his, daughters of the academic Charles Cannan (Dean of Trinity College, Oxford, and Secretary to the Delegates of Oxford University Press); as was Professor Edwin Cannan, the noted LSE economist (and brother of Charles Cannan); Joanna's daughter Diana Pullein-Thompson was his biographer. Joanna Cannan's son, Denis Cannan also followed in his footsteps, becoming a dramatist in his own right. ==Works== *Jean-Christophe by Romain Rolland (1910–1913) translator *Peter Homunculus (1909) first novel *Heinrich Heine's Memoirs, edited by Gustav Karpeles (1910) translator *Devious Ways (1910) novel *Little Brother (1912) novel *The Joy of the Theatre (1913) essays *Four Plays (1913) *Round The Corner (1913) novel *Love (1914) *Old Mole (1914) novel *Old Mole's Novel (1914) novel *Satire (1914) *Young Earnest – The Romance of a Bad Start in Life (1915) *Samuel Butler: A Critical Study (1915) *Windmills: A Book of Fables (1915) fantasy *The Right to Kill (1915) play *Adventurous Love and Other Verses (1916) *Three Pretty Men (1916) novel (Published in the US as Three Sons and a Mother) *Mendel: a story of youth (1916) novel, closely based on Mark Gertler's early life *Everybody's Husband (1917) play, performed at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre with incidental music by Maurice Besly *The House with the Mezzanine, and Other Stories by Anton Chekhov (1917) translator with S.

It was established by the British Hong Kong government on 1 May 1844. The 'Royal' title was bestowed upon the HKPF for their efforts in quelling communist riots in 1967. The Royal Hong Kong Police Force (RHKP) reverted to its former name after the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to People's Republic of China.Carroll, John M. (2007). A Concise History of Hong Kong. Rowman & Littlefield. . Pursuant to the one country, two systems principle, HKPF is officially independent of the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China, which may not interfere with Hong Kong's local law enforcement affairs. All HKPF officers are employed as civil servants and hence required to uphold their political neutrality. The HKPF consists of some 34,000 officers, including the Hong Kong Auxiliary Police Force, civil servants, and its Marine Region (3,000 officers and 143 vessels as of 2009). ==History== A police force has been serving Hong Kong since shortly after the island was established as a colony in 1841. On 30 April 1841, 12 weeks after the British landed in Hong Kong, Captain Charles Elliot established a policing authority in the new colony, empowering Captain William Caine to enforce Qing law in respect of local inhabitants and \\"British Police Law\\" for \\"non-natives\\". By October 1842, an organised police force (still under the direction of Caine who was also Chief Magistrate) was routinely bringing criminals before the courts for trial. Caine's role as head of the police force ended when its first Superintendent was appointed on 22 February 1844, Captain Haly of the 41st Madras Native Infantry. The formal establishment of the force was gazetted on 1 May 1844. During World War II, the Kempeitai recruited former Chinese and Indian officers in the Japanese military police unit from 1942 to 1945.Carroll, John Mark. [2007] (2007). A concise history of Hong Kong. , . p 123-125, p 129. The 1950s saw the commencement of Hong Kong's 40-year rise to global prominence, during which time the Hong Kong Police tackled many issues that have challenged Hong Kong's stability. Between 1949 and 1989, Hong Kong experienced several huge waves of immigration from mainland China, most notably 1958–62. In the 1970s and 1980s, large numbers of Vietnamese boat people arrived in Hong Kong, posing challenges first for marine police, secondly for officers who manned the dozens of camps in the territory and lastly for those who had to repatriate them. The force was granted the use of the title ‘royal’ in 1969 for its handling of the Hong Kong 1967 riots—renaming it the Royal Hong Kong Police Force (Traditional Chinese: ). In 1974, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) was created to give government wide-ranging powers to investigate corruption.\\"About ICAC: Brief History”, Hong Kong Independent Commission Against Corruption (http://www.icac.org.hk/en/about/history/index.html : retrieved 15 March 2017). At the turn of the 1980s, the Hong Kong Police Force began marketing itself as \\"Asia's Finest\\".Sinclair, Kevin. (1983). Asia's Finest: An Illustrated Account of the Royal Hong Kong police. Unicorn: London. The recruitment of Europeans to the force ceased in 1994, and in 1995 the Royal Hong Kong Police took responsibility for patrolling the boundary with China. Prior to 1995, the British Army had operated the border patrol. The force played a prominent role in the process of the handover of sovereignty in 1997 and continues to perform ceremonial flag-raising on each anniversary. With the handover of sovereignty, the police force dropped the prefix \\"Royal\\" from its name. In the 2010s, the police force played a prominent role in relation to the 2014 Hong Kong protests and 2019–20 Hong Kong protests. Following Chris Tang's appointment as the Commissioner of Police in November 2019, the police force changed its motto from \\"We serve with pride and care\\", which had been used for more than 20 years, to \\"Serving Hong Kong with honour, duty and loyalty.\\" The Economist suggested that this change would curry favour with the central government of China. ===Controversies=== During the 1940s, the HKPF faced a number of corruption scandals involving officers. During the 1950s and 1960s, the force struggled with corruption issues relating to bribes from syndicated drugs and illegal gambling operations.McCoy, Alfred (1980). Drug Traffic: Narcotics and Organised Crime in Australia. Sydney Australia: Harper & Row Pty Ltd. p. 33. Police corruption again emerged as a major concern in the early 1970s when the Commissioner ordered investigations to break the culture of corruption, causing forty-odd officers to flee Hong Kong with more than HK$80 million cash (about HK$2 million each).\\"Police chief who tore the mask of corruption from force\\", South China Morning Post (http://www.scmp.com/article/517892/police-chief-who-tore-mask-corruption- force : 27 September 2015). More recently, the Hong Kong Police Force has faced extensive allegations of misconduct during the 2019 protests including excessive force, brutality, torture, and falsified evidence. In particular, the police were criticized for their failure to respond during the mob attack at the Yuen Long MTR station in July 2019. Several lawsuits were filed in October 2019 against the HKPF for failure to refusal to show identification during protests. ==Organization and structure== The Commissioner of Police serves as the commander of the HKPF and reports directly to the Secretary for Security. The HKPF is divided into five primary departments: Operations and Support, Crime and Security, Personnel and Training, Management Services, and Finance, Administration & Planning. ==Remuneration== ===Salaries and fringe benefits=== Police officers enjoy remuneration far exceeding median incomes in the Special Administrative Region (HK$18,000 per month in 2019), the base rate for newly recruited police constables with minimal high school education being HK$24,110 per month and that for high school matriculants being HK$42,655. In addition, all officers enjoy extensive housing benefits, free medical and dental benefits (including coverage of family members), with substantial vacation, sick and maternity leave allowances exceeding statutory minimums. ===Police Welfare Fund=== In addition, officers and their families enjoy substantial fringe benefits through the statutorily entrenched Police Welfare Fund which has current assets exceeding HK$200 million. Attracting funds in excess of HK$50 million per annum, almost entirely donations, the fund trustee, the Commissioner of Police, has unfettered freedom to choose how the funds are to be expended. The Commissioner disburses the bulk of its annual expenditure in the form of cash grants to police officers and their families. A donation of HK$10 million by the pro-Beijing Friends of Hong Kong Association, which consists of National People’s Congress delegates and members of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference national committee, in 2019, raised concern, as did a 2017 donation of HK$15 million, that fringe benefits may be inadequate. ===Further fringe benefits=== Two trust funds established by statute in 1967 add further to the benefits enjoyed by members of the force. The Police Children's Education Trust and Police Education & Welfare Trust disburse funds by way of scholarships, bursaries and grants for education expenses and to assist officers with needy children or in financial difficulty. These funds were also the recipients of, in total, HK$10 million of largess in 2017 from an undisclosed donor. ==Police associations== Numerous associations of serving and retired police officers have been formed over the years. Currently, they include the: * Superintendents' Association * Hong Kong Police Inspectors' Association * Overseas Inspectors' Association * Junior Police Officers' Association * Royal Hong Kong Police Association The four serving officers' associations wield significant power, controlling half of the voting rights on the Police Force Council. Government consultations with Police Force staff are formally conducted through the council and the associations figure prominently at times of controversy. ==Ranks and insignia== The HKPF continues to use similar ranks and insignia to those used in British police forces. Until 1997, the St Edward's Crown was used in the insignia, when it was replaced with the Bauhinia flower crest of the Hong Kong government. Pips were modified with the Bauhinia flower in the middle replacing the insignia from the Order of the Bath. The crest of the force was modified in 1997. The rank structure, organisation and insignia are similar to those used by the Metropolitan Police Service until the mid-1970s. Gazetted *Commissioner of Police (CP) (Traditional Chinese: ): crest over pip over wreathed and crossed batons. *Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) (Traditional Chinese: ): crest over wreathed and crossed batons. *Senior Assistant Commissioner of Police (SACP) (Traditional Chinese: ): pip over wreathed and crossed batons. *Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) (Traditional Chinese: ): wreathed and crossed batons. *Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP) (Traditional Chinese: ): crest over two pips. *Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) (Traditional Chinese: ): crest over pip. *Superintendent of Police (SP) (Traditional Chinese: ): crest. Inspectorate *Chief Inspector of Police (CIP) (Traditional Chinese: ): three pips. *Senior Inspector of Police (SIP) (Traditional Chinese: ): two pips over bar. *Inspector of Police (IP) (Traditional Chinese: ): two pips. *Probationary Inspector of Police (PI) (Traditional Chinese: ): pip. Junior Police Officer (Rank and File) *Station Sergeant (SSGT) (Traditional Chinese: ): wreathed crest. *Sergeant (SGT) (Traditional Chinese: ): three downward-pointing chevrons. *Senior Constable (SPC) (Traditional Chinese: ): downward-pointing chevron. *Police Constable (PC) (Traditional Chinese: ): slide with ID number. Up until 1997, uniforms and hats had distinctions according to their rank. For example, senior constable and sergeant ranks are plastic ranks on the sleeve of the uniform. SDU, Marine Police, and the Counterterrorism Response Unit have their ranks at the back of the helmet or vest. Inspector to senior superintendent ranks have an insignia on the collar of the uniform. Chief Inspectors have a wide black stripe fitted on their police hats. Superintendents also have a small white stripe fitted on the police hat. Senior Superintendents and Chief Superintendents have a wide white stripe on their hats, Assistant and Senior Assistant Commissioners have 1 row of silver oak leaves on the edge of their hats while Deputy Commissioner and Commissioner has 2 rows of silver oak leaves, a slide with a silver vertical line on the collar of the uniform, a black baton, and a red whistle or a black and white whistle on the front right pocket. ==Uniforms== Current uniforms were changed in the mid 2000s. The older khaki uniforms were used for many decades. Hong Kong Police Force uniform currently comprises: Uniform Branch: Dark navy blue jacket with the words 'Police', in English and Chinese, in reflective white tape, on the front left breast and back. Light blue shirts are worn by most officers, whilst white shirts are worn by senior officers. Dark blue cargo trousers and black caps are worn by all officers. Tactical Units: these uniforms are identical to those of the Uniform Branch officers, although berets are worn rather than caps and trousers are tucked into boots. Riot helmets are worn for riot control. *Disruptive Pattern Material (e.g. SBD and SDU) *Battle Dress Uniform (e.g. SDU) Traffic branch: Reflective yellow jacket and navy blue riding trousers. In warmer weather, reflective vests with white sleeves are an alternative. From the return of HKPF, all patrol officers and inspectors had their whistle taken off. The same summer uniform and winter uniform was worn until 2005. Senior Constable, Sergeant and Station Sergeant ranks had their ranks moved to their shoulder slides. ===Ceremonial uniform=== They are white (similar to No.3 Warm weather ceremonial uniform) or dark tunic. Sword design was based on 1897 pattern British Army infantry officer's sword and used for formal occasions such as parade out or Legal Opening Day. They are fitted with a black whistle on the front right pocket and insignia on the collar for commissioned officers. A Sam Browne belt is worn too. ===Retired uniforms=== Summer Uniform: Green Khaki drill tropical shirts and trousers or Bermuda shorts, worn with black Sam Browne Belts. Females wore summer beige shirts with skirts. This uniform was worn until about 2005 when the force switched to a slightly modernized version of the Winter Uniform, to be worn all year round. The Green uniform can be seen in some of the older Hong Kong and Hollywood movies. Winter Uniform: Cornflower blue (or white, for commissioned officers) shirts with necktie, worn under a navy blue tunic and Sam Browne Belt, with navy blue uniform trousers. Tunic may be removed under warmer weather. Until 1998, all officers wore a whistle lanyard over the left shoulder running under the epaulet with the double cord attached to a whistle tucked in to the left breast tunic pocket. Uniform colour was black, however officers who had received a Commissioner of Police Commendation, or HE Governor's Commendation, were issued with and could wear a plaited black, yellow and red (Force colours) lanyard (for CP's Commendation) or red for Governor's. ==Vehicles== A police van HKPF Police Patrol Boat Most police vehicles in Hong Kong are white, with a blue and red 3M retroreflective stripe around on the sides of the vehicle with wording \\"警 Police 察\\" in white, the only exception being the armoured personnel carriers specially designed for the Police Tactical Unit, which are wholly dark blue and with wording \\"警 Police 察\\" on a light blue background in white on the sides of the vehicle. Most police vehicles in Hong Kong are equipped with both red and blue emergency vehicle lighting. The vehicles which are assigned to airport duties have additional yellow emergency vehicle lighting. All police vehicles are government property and so bear licence plates starting with \\"AM\\". Since 2008, the Hong Kong Police Force have brought in the use of Battenburg markings for new police vehicles of the Traffic Branch Headquarters.

He is best known for the work Noda Biyhudah (נודע ביהודה), by which title he is also known. ==Biography== Landau was born in Opatów, Poland, to a family that traced its lineage back to Rashi (and through Rashi, King David), and attended yeshiva at Ludmir and Brody. In Brody, he was appointed dayan (rabbinical judge) in 1734. In 1745 Landau became rabbi of Yampol. While in Yampol, he attempted to mediate between Jacob Emden and Jonathan Eybeschütz in a debate—\\"The Emden-Eybeschütz Controversy\\"—that \\"had disrupted Jewish communal life for many years\\". Emden had accused Eybeschuetz of being a crypto Sabbatean, primarily based on amulets Eybeschuetz had written, which Emden believed contained Sabbatean kabbalah. Landau proposed a compromise, in which all amulets allegedly written by Eybeschuetz would be hidden away, and Eybeschuetz would accept to refrain from producing any amulets in the future. Furthermore, all accusations against Eybeschuetz would stop, and no further polemics would be published. Landau's role in the Emden - Eybeschuetz controversy is described as \\"tactful\\" and brought him to the attention of the community of Prague—where, in 1755, he was appointed rabbi. He also established a yeshiva there; Avraham Danzig, author of Chayei Adam, is amongst his best known students. Landau was highly esteemed not only by the community, but also by others; and he stood high in favor in government circles. Thus, in addition to his rabbinical tasks, he was able to intercede with the government on various occasions when anti-Semitic measures had been introduced. Though not opposed to secular knowledge, he objected to \\"that culture which came from Berlin\\", in particular Moses Mendelssohn's translation of the Pentateuch. His son, Samuel Landau (1752 – 31 October 1834, Prague), was chief dayyan of Prague. Landau was the champion of Orthodox Rabbinism, and when, at the end of the eighteenth century, the Austrian emperor planned the establishment of Jewish theological seminaries, Landau was one of the rabbis that objected thereto. He had a controversy on this subject with Baruch Jeiteles (Phinehas Hananiah Argosi di Silva), who, under the title of Ha-Oreb, published (Vienna, 1795) Landau's letter to him and his own rejoinder. Landau published his responsa under the title of Shibat Ẓiyyon (Prague, 1827). He edited his father's Ahabat Ẓiyyon and Doresh le-Ẓiyyon (ib. 1827), adding to the former work four homilies of his own, and to the latter a number of halakic discourses. [Jewish Encyclopedia] ==Works== His main work of responsa, titled Noda Biyhudah (נודע ביהודה, \\"Known in Judah\\", a reference to Psalms 76:2 and his father's name), is one of the principal sources of Jewish law of his age. Famous decisions include those limiting autopsy to prevent a clear and present danger in known others. This collection was esteemed by rabbis and scholars, both for its logic and for its independence with regard to the rulings of other Acharonim as well as its simultaneous adherence to the writings of the Rishonim. ===Other works=== *Dagul Mervavah on the Shulkhan Arukh (cf. Song of Solomon 5:10) *Tziyun le-Nefesh Chayah (abbreviated as Tzelach, named in reference to his mother, whose name was Chayah) on the Talmud. *Drushei HaTzlach, a collection of sermons. *Ahavas Tzion *Doresh LeTzion ==Notable views== ===Returning to the Talmud=== Landau was disturbed by the increasing influence of non-Talmudic sources on the Jewish community. He believed that many kabbalistic concepts were being understood in a heretical fashion, and was especially concerned with the prospect of the kabbalistic ideology of the Sabbatean movement infiltrating the populace. Landau frequently spoke against teaching Kabbalah to the masses, and was echoed in this regard by his student, Elazar Fleckeles, who praised the government for instituting laws limiting the study of kabbalah. In his responsa, when asked about matters that had no source in the Talmud, Landau would often respond, \\"it is not my way to study any issue which is not discussed in the Talmud\\". He responded in such a manner to inquiries about the ethical will of Rabbi Yehuda haChasid, which contains various instructions not found in the Talmud, a question about the proper manner of writing certain letters in the Torah scroll according to kabbalistic literature, and other similar questions. ===Opinion on the Zohar=== In his sefer Derushei HaTzlach,In derush 25 which \\"had previously only appeared in a censored form\\" (Rabbi Dr. Marc Shapiro, Concerning the Zohar and Other Matters) in Derushei HaTzlach, Warsaw 1886 (Shapiro in Milin Havivin Volume 5 [2011], Is there an obligation to believe that Rebbe Shimon bar Yochai wrote the Zohar?, p. ה [PDF page 126], footnote 13 [Hebrew]). Landau argued that the Zohar can not be considered reliable, since it only came into the hands of the Jewish people many hundreds of years after Rashbi's death, and thus lacks an unbroken mesorah as to its authenticity, among other reasons.In a portion of derush 25 first published by Yehoshua Mondshine in Or Yisrael, Nisan 5766, על חיבור הזוה\\"ק ותוספות מאוחרות שנשתרבבו לתוכו (Hebrew), p. 202 (highlighted by Shapiro in Concerning the Zohar and Other Matters). This portion (along with the remainder) was later published, from manuscript, by Dr. Maoz Kahana and Michael K. Silber in Deists, Sabbatians and Kabbalists in Prague: A Censored Sermon of R. Ezekiel Landau, 1770, Kabbalah 21 (2010), p. 355 (Hebrew). ===Clashes with the haskalah movement=== Landau condemned the haskalah movement in harsh terms. In numerous public sermons, he campaigned against the study of heretical philosophy. He particularly singled out Hartwig Wessely for criticism after the publication of the latter's Divrei Shalom V'emes, which advocated abandoning the traditional Jewish educational system, in favor of one with an emphasis on secular studies. ===Opposition to Chasiddus=== Landau was a staunch opponent of the nascent Hasidic movement. In one response, he writes \\"...In this generation of ours [people] have abandoned God’s Torah and the source of living waters–the two Talmuds, Bavli and Yerushalmi–to dig for themselves broken cisterns. And in the haughtiness of their hearts they exalt themselves; each one says \\"I am the one who sees, to me the gates to heaven have opened, and on my account the world is sustained\\". These [people] are the destroyers of the generation and of this orphaned generation I say that God's ways are just, and the righteous shall walk in them, and the Chasidim shall stumble in them [This is an alteration of Hoshea 14:14, in which the prophet says that sinners will stumble in them.]...\\" ===Opposition to the Sabbatean movement=== According to Sid Z. Leiman and Maoz Kahana, although Landau was extremely active in combating the Sabbatean movement, he believed the most effective means of eradicating it would be to aggressively counter overt Sabbateanism, while ignoring those Sabbateans who stayed hidden. Simultaneously, Landau sought to weaken the appeal of kabbalah (the study of which often lured people to the Sabbatean movement). Thus, Landau aimed to deprive the Sabbateans of any platform, and cause the Sabbatean movement to wither on its own. Besides the specific debate over the status of Jonathan Eybeschuetz, Jacob Emden expressed strong disagreement with Landau's approach, advocating instead for a far more aggressive anti Sabbatean strategy. ==References== ==External links== * Ezekiel ben Judah Landau, jewishencyclopedia.com * Yechezkel Landau – The Nodah Biyehudah, jewishvirtuallibrary.org * Rabbi Ezkiel Landau (5473-5553; 1713-1793), chabad.org * * Dagul Mervavah * HaNoda Bihudah Umishnato * Noda Bihudah, Prague, 1776 * Noda Bihudah, Mahadura Kamma, New York, 1960 * Noda Bihudah, Mahadura Tinyana, New York, 1960 * Ziun L'nefesh Chaya on Brachot * Ziun L'nefesh Chaya on Beitza * Ziun L'nefesh Chaya on Psachim *Drushei HaTzlach *Ahavas Tziyon *Doresh Letziyon *Deists, Sabbatians and Kabbalists in Prague: A Censored Sermon of R.

The name Rosslare Strand is used to distinguish it from the nearby community of Rosslare Harbour, site of the Rosslare Europort. ==Tourism== Rosslare has been a tourist resort for at least 100 years. It is noted as the \\"sunniest spot in Ireland\\", and records bear this out: Rosslare receives 300 hours more sunshine each year than the average place in Ireland. The long sandy strand is a Blue Flag beach. The beach itself consists of sand and stone running the length of the southern peninsula which protrudes into Wexford Harbour. It is segmented by a series of timber breakwaters which are designed to retain sandy deposits along the beach. Groyne on Rosslare beach There are a number of golf courses in the vicinity. Rosslare also has several hotels, cafes and restaurants. As of the 1996 census, the village had a population of 929 people, increasing to 1,620 by the time of the 2016 census. According to the April 2016 census, of the 551 occupied private households in the village, 228 were built between 2001 and 2010. The village has seen an amount of building in recent years, as tax grants became available for building holiday homes in this region. As a result, there are large housing estates of holiday homes near the strand. A long sandspit stretching north from Rosslare separates Wexford Harbour from the Irish Sea. Until the early 1920s, this spit stretched for many miles north, almost touching the Raven Point and giving a very narrow mouth to Wexford Harbour. At the end of the spit was a small fort called Rosslare Fort. In the winter of 1924-25 a storm breached the spit and it was gradually washed away. The fort was abandoned and now all that is left is an island at low tide. Rosslare is commonly known in Ireland as being in the \\"Sunny South-East\\", and in 1959 Rosslare recorded 1,996.4 hours of sunshine, the highest recorded in Ireland. However, it is not the warmest or driest place in Ireland. ==Climate== Met Éireann operated a weather station at Rosslare until its closure in 2007. Sunshine duration for the county is now recorded at the Johnstown Castle weather station, which has been operational since 2009. However, due to its inland location, Johnstown Castle receives considerably less sunshine than Rosslare. ==Transport== Rosslare Strand station in 2007 Rosslare is served by a number of public transport options. ===Rail transport=== Rosslare Strand railway station opened on 24 June 1882. The Dublin to Rosslare Europort railway serves the village.http://www.irishrail.ie/fares-and-tickets/dublin-rosslare ===Bus transport=== Two main local bus services operate; 'Wexford Bus' and 'Local Link'.http://locallinkwexford.ie/387-timetable/ The village is also served by Bus Éireann routes 370 and 385. The 370 links it to Wellingtonbridge, New Ross and Waterford (this bus route replaces the train service to Waterford which ceased in September 2010). ==See also== * List of towns and villages in Ireland ==ReferencesCategory:Towns and villages in County Wexford Category:Beaches of County Wexford ","title":"Rosslare Strand"},{"id":"1276227","text":"Pinchas Menachem Alter (, June 9, 1926 – March 7, 1996), also known as the Pnei Menachem (Hebrew: ), after the works he authored, was the seventh Rebbe of the Hasidic dynasty of Ger, a position he held from 1992 until his death in 1996. ==Early years== Pinchas Menachem was born in Falenica, near Warsaw, Poland. He was the only offspring of the second marriage of his father, Rabbi Avraham Mordechai Alter, the fourth Rebbe of Ger, to Feyge Mintshe Biderman. Pinchas Menachem had four half-brothers and two half-sisters from his father's first marriage—including the fifth Rebbe of Ger, Rabbi Yisrael Alter, and Rabbi Simcha Bunim Alter, the sixth Rebbe of Ger. Pinchas Menachem's bar mitzva took place near Ludmir in Poland (now western Ukraine) not long before the outbreak of World War II in 1939. After the war, he married his cousin, Tzipora Alter. In the 1950s, he was appointed rosh yeshiva of Sfas Emes, the flagship yeshiva of Ger in Jerusalem, Israel. ==Succession as rebbe== Rabbi Pinchas Menachem succeeded his half-brother, Rabbi Simcha Bunim Alter, to become Rebbe in 1992. His position as rosh yeshiva of Sfas Emes Yeshiva was assumed by his son, Rabbi Shaul Alter, who is widely regarded as an eminent Talmudic scholar. During his tenure, Rabbi Pinchas Menachem continued the policies of his half-brothers, Rabbi Simcha Bunim and Rabbi Yisrael, by supporting the political work of the Agudat Israel of Israel party, promoting the interests of Haredi Judaism in the Israeli Knesset. He reached a rapprochement with his non-Hasidic Ashkenazi Haredi fellow-rabbis, in particular with Rabbi Elazar Shach, leader of the rival Degel HaTorah party. Together, they created the United Torah Judaism (Yahadut HaTorah) party in order not to lose residual votes in the Israeli proportional representation system, and thereby potentially obtain an extra seat for the newly united party in Knesset elections. ==Death and burial== The graves of Grand Rabbi Avraham Mordechai Alter (right) and his son, Grand Rabbi Pinchas Menachem Alter (left) in an ohel adjacent to the Sfas Emes Yeshiva in downtown Jerusalem. Rabbi Pinchas Menachem died in 1996 after less than four years at the helm of the Ger dynasty. He was buried beside his father, Rabbi Avraham Mordechai Alter, in the courtyard of the Sfas Emes Yeshiva. Unlike his father's grave, which was dug by hand under the cover of darkness during the British curfew in 1948, the Pnei Menachem's grave was dug with machinery; the latter grave is therefore lower than the former.Frankfurter, Rabbi Yitzchok. \\"A Riveting Visit to the Historic Home of the Pnei Menachem of Ger zt\\"l\\". Ami, February 17, 2016, pp. 60-73. A red-brick ohel was built over the two graves, which are visited frequently by students in the yeshiva.

It came into effect in 1988 and has since been developed and maintained by the World Customs Organization (WCO) (formerly the Customs Co-operation Council), an independent intergovernmental organization based in Brussels, Belgium, with over 200 member countries. ==Structure== The HS is organized logically by economic activity or component material. For example, animals and animal products are found in one section of the HS, while machinery and mechanical appliances are found in another. The HS is organized into 21 sections, which are subdivided into 99 chapters. The 99 HS chapters are further subdivided into 1,244 headings and 5224 subheadings. Section and Chapter titles describe broad categories of goods, while headings and subheadings describe products in more detail. Generally, HS sections and chapters are arranged in order of a product's degree of manufacture or in terms of its technological complexity. Natural commodities, such as live animals and vegetables, for example, are described in the early sections of the HS, whereas more evolved goods such as machinery and precision instruments are described in later sections. Chapters within the individual sections are also usually organized in order of complexity or degree of manufacture. For example, within Section X (Pulp of wood or of other fibrous cellulosic material; Recovered (waste and scrap) paper or paperboard; Paper and paperboard and articles thereof), Chapter 47 provides for pulp of wood or of other fibrous cellulosic materials, whereas Chapter 49 covers printed books, newspapers, and other printed matter. Finally, the headings within individual Chapters follow a similar order. For example, the first heading in Chapter 50 (Silk) provides for silk worm cocoons while articles made of silk are covered by the chapter's later headings. The HS code consists of 6-digits. The first two digits designate the HS Chapter. The second two digits designate the HS heading. The third two digits designate the HS subheading. HS code 1006.30, for example indicates Chapter 10 (Cereals), Heading 06 (Rice), and Subheading 30 (Semi-milled or wholly milled rice, whether or not polished or glazed). Example of the hierarchical structure of the Harmonized System In addition to the HS codes and commodity descriptions, each Section and Chapter of the HS is prefaced by Legal Notes, which are designed to clarify the proper classification of goods. To ensure harmonization, the contracting parties to the Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, have agreed to base their national tariff schedules on the HS nomenclature and Legal Notes. Parties are permitted to subdivide the HS nomenclature beyond 6-digits and add their own Legal Notes according to their own tariff and statistical requirements. Parties often set their customs duties at the 8-digit \\"tariff code\\" level. Statistical suffixes are often added to the 8-digit tariff code for a total of 10 digits. HS Chapter 77 is reserved for common use by the parties internationally. Chapters 98 and 99 are reserved for national use. Chapter 98 comprises special classification provisions, and chapter 99 contains temporary modifications pursuant to a parties' national directive or legislation. Since its creation, the HS has undergone several revisions - ostensibly, to either eliminate headings and subheadings describing commodities that are no longer traded, or to create headings and subheadings that address technological advancements and environmental concerns. The current version of the HS became effective on January 1, 2017. ==Classification== The process of assigning HS codes is known as \\"HS Classification\\". All products can be classified in the HS by using the General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System (\\"GRI\\"). HS codes can be determined by a variety of factors including a product's composition, its form and its function. An example of a product classified according to its form would be whole potatoes. The classification will also change depending on whether the potatoes are fresh or frozen. Fresh potatoes are classified in position 0701.90, under the Header Potatoes, fresh or chilled, Sub header Other, while frozen potatoes are classified in position 0710.10 under the Header Vegetables (uncooked or cooked by steaming or boiling in water), frozen, Subheader Potatoes. An example of a product classified according its material composition is a picture frame. Picture frames made of wood are classified under subheading 4414.00, which provides for Wooden frames for paintings, photographs, mirrors or similar objects. Picture frames made of plastic are classified under subheading 3924.90, which provides for Tableware, kitchenware, other household articles and hygienic or toilet articles, of plastics. Other. Picture frames made of glass are classified under subheading 7020.00, which provides for Other articles of glass. And so on. An example of a product classified according to its form is personal hygiene soap. When in the form of a bar, cake or moulded shape, such soap is classified under subheading 3401.11, which provides for Soap and organic surface-active products and preparations, in the form of bars, cakes, moulded pieces or shapes, and paper, wadding, felt and nonwovens, impregnated, coated or covered with soap or detergent: For toilet use (including medicated products). Conversely, liquid personal hygiene soap is classified under either 3401.20, which provides for Soap in other forms, or 3401.30, which provides for Organic surface-active products and preparations for washing the skin, in the form of liquid or cream and put up for retail sale, whether or not containing soap. An example of a product classified according to its function is a carbon monoxide (CO) detector. If the CO detector captures and displays gas measurements, then it is properly classified under subheading 9027.10, which provides for Instruments and apparatus for physical or chemical analysis (for example, polarimeters, refractometers, spectrometers, gas or smoke analysis apparatus; instruments and apparatus for measuring or checking viscosity, porosity, expansion, surface tension or the like; instruments and apparatus for measuring or checking quantities of heat, sound or light (including exposure meters); microtomes. Gas or smoke analysis apparatus. If the CO detector does not capture and display gas measurements, then it is properly classified under subheading 8531.10, which provides for Electric sound or visual signaling apparatus (for example, bells, sirens, indicator panels, burglar or fire alarms), other than those of heading 85.12 or 85.30. Burglar or fire alarms and similar apparatus. Although every product and every part of every product is classifiable in the HS, very few are explicitly described in the HS nomenclature. Any product for which there is no explicit description can be classified under a \\"residual\\" or \\"basket\\" heading or subheading, which provide for Other goods. Residual codes normally occur last in numerical order under their related headings and subheadings. An example of a product classified under a residual heading is a live dog, which must be classified under heading 01.06, which provides for Other live animals because dogs are not covered by headings 01.01 through 01.05, which explicitly provide for live equine, live bovine, live swine, live sheep and goats, and live poultry, respectively. ==Applications== As of 2015, there were 180 countries or territories applying the Harmonized System worldwide, HS code are used by Customs authorities, statistical agencies, and other government regulatory bodies, to monitor and control the import and export of commodities through: * Customs tariffs * Collection of international trade statistics * Rules of origin * Collection of internal taxes * Trade negotiations (e.g., the World Trade Organization schedules of tariff concessions) * Transport tariffs and statistics * Monitoring of controlled goods (e.g., wastes, narcotics, chemical weapons, ozone layer depleting substances, endangered species, wildlife trade) * Areas of Customs controls and procedures, including risk assessment, information technology and compliance. Companies use HS codes to calculate the total landed cost of imported products and parts, and to identify selling and sourcing opportunities abroad. ==Challenges in classification for companies== HS classification is not always straightforward. Many automotive parts, for example, are not classified under heading 87.08, which provides for Parts and accessories of the motor vehicles of headings 87.01 to 87.05. Automotive seats are classified as articles of furniture under heading 94.01, which provides for Seats (other than those of heading 94.02), whether or not convertible into beds, and parts thereof, and more specifically under subheading 9401.20, which provides for Seats of a kind used for motor vehicles. In many jurisdictions, traders alone bear the legal responsibility to accurately classify their goods. However, due to a lack of familiarity with the rules of HS Classification traders may inadvertently determine erroneous HS codes for their commodities. Depending on the severity of the infraction, incorrect classification can result in the imposition of non-compliance penalties, border delays or seizures, or denial of import privileges. There are several resources available to traders to assist in properly classifying their goods including: * The Official Explanatory Notes to the Harmonized System, published by the World Customs Organization * The US Census \\"Classify your Commodity\\" engine: https://uscensus.prod.3ceonline.com/ * Classify your Commodity video tutorial by US Census: https://www.census.gov/foreign- trade/data/video022.html * Explanatory notes to the Combined Nomenclature of the European Union by the European Commission * Customs Rulings Online Search System (CROSS), by U.S. Customs and Border Protection * Binding Tariff Information (BTI), by the European Commission * Informed compliance publications, by U.S. Customs and Border Protection * Classification Guides, by HM Revenue & Customs * Harmonized Tariff Schedule As the principal US page with updated info about Tariffs. Traders may sometimes resort to using HS code determination guides and other references to classify their traded commodities. These could include local databases published by authorities in other countries. However, such databases are not valid globally. Many Customs authorities around the world allow traders to apply for an advanced HS classification ruling. Such rulings are legally binding in the countries they are issued in and protect the trader from future Customs challenges concerning incorrect classification of their imports and exports. ==See also== * Automated Export System * Broad Economic Categories * Combined Nomenclature * Customs tariff * Harmonized Tariff Schedule for the United States * Standard International Trade Classification * TARIC Coding System * UNSPSC * World Customs Organization ==References== ==External links== * ITC's Product Conversion Table on Market Access Map, an online database of customs tariffs and market requirements.

The lake is technically a back-barrier seepage lagoon, one of only two in Ireland. The other is nearby Tacumshin Lake (Irish: Loch Theach Cuimsin). The lake has no outlet, but is separated from the Atlantic Ocean at the southern end by a sand and gravel bar 200 m wide. Salt water seeps through the barrier, while fresh water flows into the lake from run-off from the land around the lake. This means that the lake is neither fresh nor salt water but somewhere in between. Every so often, storms break through the sandbar and salt water flows in from the sea, increasing the salt levels considerably. Wildlife in the lake must therefore be able to cope with variable levels of salinity. The lake is an important breeding ground for terns. It is estimated that the lake is home to over 1,200 breeding pairs of Sandwich terns and, more importantly, to 150 breeding pairs of the rare roseate tern; this is the second largest colony in Europe.Annual Report of the Irish Rare Breeding Birds Panel 2013 At the north end of the lake is the village of Lady's Island.

The character was originally played by Andrew Burt from 1972 to 1973 with a brief return in 1976, when the character left for Italy to write a book. On his return in 1980 he was played by Clive Hornby. Hornby remained in the role until 2008 when he was forced to take a break from Emmerdale due to illness. His last on-screen appearance was on 21 February 2008, and his absence was explained by the character visiting his mother, Annie Sugden (Sheila Mercier) in Spain. Although Hornby was intended to return, he died from his illness in July 2008 since did not return to the programme. Jack was written out following Hornby's death, dying off-screen of a heart attack in February 2009. ==Creation== Jacob and Annie Sugden’s son Jack is one of the original characters in Emmerdale. The Sugden family were the owners of Emmerdale Farm from the programme's early days. Jack and his younger siblings, Peggy Skilbeck and Joe all worked on the farm. From the early days, Jack appeared to be a very rebellious and self-righteous character who cared little for others' views. He also has numerous flings with different women and failed marriages, due to his infidelity. Jack is an intelligent and articulate man but shown to keep secrets from his family. As time passed and Jack became a father, he has matured much more. He has firmly secured his roots in farming, which he originally tried so hard to escape from. Jack is still a man of principles and of pride, which can sometimes be his biggest weakness. ==Storylines== ===1972–1973=== Jack returns to Beckindale on the day of Jacob's funeral. He watches the procession from The Woolpack and wanders around the farm. Following the funeral, Jack meets Marian Wilks and then enters the farmhouse and is met with a frosty reception from his sister, Peggy who resents Jack as he has returned to the village for the first time in eight years without a word and has inherited the farm, which has caused bad feeling between her and their brother, Joe. Jack's mother Annie tells him he is welcome to stay but must help. Later, Jack quarrels with Marian when he finds out her father Henry was a partner in a company that poisoned local fish and suggests it may have been done deliberately. Jack agrees to surrender the farm to Peggy but Annie insists Jack makes the farm work. Jack then takes an interest in an old Millhouse which has a preservation order on it and plans to restore it and later reside there. He also has many a heated discussion with Henry over land access. Wallace, a friend of Jack arranges a meeting between him and a mystery woman named Lynn. Around this time, Marian and Jack become close much to Joe's chagrin. When Lynn arrives, everyone is intrigued. Jack reveals that Lynn is his common-law wife from his time in London. When Ruth, Tom and their children Jackie, Sandie and Tommy arrive in the village, Jack offers Tom a job as a farmhand but regrets it as Tom is proven to be lazy and fires him. Tom retaliates with blackmail, threatening to tell Marian that Jack is the biological father of his son, Jackie. Tom's suspicions come from Jackie's likeness to Jack, sharing the names John Jacob and knowing of Ruth's past relationship with Jack. Jack refuses to give in and fires Tom. Marian finds out and the Merricks leave. When Jack comes into some money, the family are suspicious of its source and discover Jack wrote a successful novel while in London. Marian is curious and enjoys the book but is ultimately unimpressed with the sexist views. Jack battles with Henry over a piece of land that Harry Jameson (John Glyn-Jones), an old friend of Jacob's, is selling. Harry tries to get them to increase their offers but Jack knows Harry is desperate and he accepts Jack's offer. . He consults a solicitor and has the farm shared between Annie, Joe, Peggy and their grandfather, Sam Pearson (Toke Townley) but Sam, not wanting the responsibility, sells his share to Henry.

Annie offers him some advice and he takes it onboard, before departing back to London on good terms with his family. ===1980–2008=== He returns in February 1980, vowing to stay for good as he wanted to settle down. Ruth, now calling herself \\"Pat\\", returns to the village with Jackie (now played by Ian Sharrock) and her daughter, Sandie Merrick (Jane Hutcheson) after leaving Tom for good and reunites with Jack. During this time, Jackie discovers that Jack is his biological father and takes the news badly and there is an unease between the two.

Jack is left bitter and angry when Jackie dies in a shooting accident in August 1989 and Sarah is there for him. The couple move in together in 1990, and Jack often proposes but she keeps turning him down.

The Sugdens adopt Andy Hopwood (Kelvin Fletcher) a school friend of Robert (now Christopher Smith). By the end of the 1990s, Jack and Sarah's marriage is in trouble again when Jack suggests Robert and Andy work on the farm rather than attend school and money problems worsen. They take in a lodger, Richie Carter (Glenn Lamont) and Sarah, feeling neglected, begins an affair with Richie and leaves Jack. Sarah gets custody of Victoria (now Hannah Midgley) and Jack gets custody of Robert and Andy. Andy sets the barn on fire to help Jack claim on the insurance but the plan goes wrong when Sarah is killed and Jack is arrested as the chief suspect. Andy comes clean to Richie about the fire and begs him to change his statement and he agrees, resulting in Jack's freedom. Jack later begins dating Woolpack landlady Diane Blackstock (Elizabeth Estensen). When Andy discovers Robert (now Karl Davies) is having an affair with his wife, Katie (Sammy Winward), he waits for Robert in his caravan with a shotgun, intending to shoot him but accidentally shoots Jack instead. Having almost died, Jack initially disowns Andy but they reconcile and Jack and Diane plan to marry but she reveals that she had colon cancer and undergoes chemotherapy. The couple married and enjoy a honeymoon in Las Vegas while Diane recovered. Further drama ensues when Jack learns Andy is the father of 15-year-old Debbie Dingle's (Charley Webb) daughter, Sarah, but supports Andy when he said he wanted to be a hands-on father, impressed with how responsible Andy had become. After a revenge attempt against Andy for killing Sarah backfires, resulting in the death of Max King (Charlie Kemp), Jack banishes Robert from the village. Jack and Diane assume responsibility for Andy's half-brother, Daz Eden (Luke Tittensor), as they did with Andy a decade earlier. Andy and Daz's father, Billy (David Crellin), is released from prison and returns to Emmerdale much to the ire of various residents, having robbed the Post Office and killed Vic Windsor (Alun Lewis) on Christmas Day 1998. During this time, Billy works to prove he has changed and begins an emotional affair with Diane. Diane, riddled with guilt, confesses and she and Jack separate but later reconcile following Victoria (now Isabel Hodgins) discovering of the truth about her mother's death. Jack visits Annie in Spain in 2008 and remains for several months until Annie informs the family of Jack's death of a heart attack on 5 February 2009, leaving them devastated. Diane brings Jack's body back from Spain, along with his mother Annie, making her first return to her old home in 13 years. Val (Charlie Hardwick) and Eric Pollard (Chris Chittell) arrange his funeral. Jack is buried in the village churchyard. Andy, Daz, Sam (James Hooton) and Zak Dingle (Steve Halliwell) are pallbearers. Just before the service, Alan Turner (Richard Thorp) recalls to Betty Eagleton (Paula Tilbrook) a conversation where Jack had told him about the events of Jacob's funeral. Diane reads a letter Jack had written for Andy, Victoria, Daz and Robert during the service, telling them that he loved them and wanted them to live together as a family and reveals that he knew in his last weeks that he would not live to see the village again. Andy breaks down in tears and flees the church. As Jack is laid to rest, Diane places his chequered cap onto the coffin. Andy sees Robert, who is watching from a distance and drives away. Robert leaves a flower on the grave before leaving again. That afternoon, Val put a framed photo of Jack up next to the pictures of Amos and Henry Wilks in the pub. Andy, Diane, Daz and Victoria visit the grave that night to say a last goodbye. As they walk away, Diane looks back and sees a vision of Jack next to the grave. He smiles at her and she smiles back and realises that Jack will always be with her and the children and would be looking down on them. In 2016, Robert (now Ryan Hawley) mentions this to his boyfriend Aaron Dingle (Danny Miller) and his half-sister Liv (Isobel Steele) about his father, how he almost managed to go to his funeral. In October, Robert reveals to Aaron that Jack was unsupportive in his attempt to reveal his sexuality as a teenager, beating him and forbidding him to mention it, leading to Robert's long term denial. In 2020, Annie dies peacefully in Spain and Victoria visits Jack's grave with Marlon Dingle to talk about her memories of Annie and Jack. ===Book Appearances=== ==External links== * Jack Sugden at itv.com * Official Emmerdale ITV site * ITV's tribute to Clive Hornby * ITV Local Yorkshire video tribute * Emmerdale Official News * BBC NEWS  Entertainment  Emmerdale actor Hornby dies at 63.

He lives in Israel, and has followers there and in the United States, Europe, and Canada. He is a member of the Presidium of the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah of Agudath Israel. ==Life== Yaakov Aryeh Alter was born on 29 Iyar 5699 in Lodz, Poland, in 1939, to Rabbi Simcha Bunim Alter, also known as the Lev Simcha, who later became the sixth Gerrer Rebbe, and Yuta Henya, daughter of Rabbi Nehemiah Alter, his grandfather's brother. In 1940, he immigrated with his father and grandfather (Rebbe Avraham Mordechai Alter) to Eretz Israel. He studied in the Talmud Torah Etz Chaim. For many years, he studied Torah at a synagogue known as Rashi Shtiebel in Bnei Brak. His full proficiency of all volumes of Sefer Mishnah Berura is well-known, and he describes himself as a student of the Chafetz Chaim, even though he never met him. He married Shoshana, daughter of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Weitz, one of the heads of Yeshivat Chiddushei HaRim.. Rebbi Alter is one of the wealthiest people in the ultra-Orthodox sector and in Israel in general, and is ranked third on the list of the richest rabbis in Israel, with a net worth of approximately NIS 350 million (as of 2012). His wealth came from his father, who invested in real estate before the establishment of the state. Among other things, he is one of the largest landowners in the settlement of Arsuf. Despite his wealth, he lived in an apartment in an ordinary residential building in the Chazon Ish neighborhood in Bnei Brak. In 2011, he moved to Jerusalem, in his apartment near the new synagogue, and his sons and son-in-law live in residential buildings, some of them sharing a common building in Bnei Brak. He has introduced significant innovations in the curriculum of the educational institutions operated by the Gerrer Hasidim in Israel and abroad — primarily broader knowledge of the expanse of the Talmud, while removing the learning of Iyun. He and his wife have five sons and four daughters. ==Opposition== Rabbi Shaul Alter, a first cousin of Rabbi Alter is a fierce opposition of the Rabbi. When the Rabbi enforced the learning of Bekious (learning the Talmud in more of a superficial manner, emphasizing on the quantity) instead of Iyun (learning the Talmud in more of a depth manner, emphasizing on the quality) in the yeshivos of Ger, Rabbi Shaul resisted and still gave shiurim, until he was quashed by the establishment. In 2019 Rabbi Shaul Alter broke off from the Ger Dynasty and opened his own Kehillah where the yeshivos went back to learn Iyun, like its olden days. == External links == * Rabi Yaakov Aryeh Alter, 7th Gerrer Rebbe.

The third—the most important of the councils—marked a temporary compromise between Arianism and the Western bishops of the Christian church. At least two of the other councils also dealt primarily with the Arian controversy. All of these councils were held under the rule of Constantius II, who was sympathetic to the Arians. ==Background== Arianism was first put forward early in the 4th century by the Alexandrian presbyter Arius. It held that the Father is uniquely self-existent and immutable: consequently, Christ could not be God. The opponents of Arianism led by Athanasius of Alexandria claimed that the doctrine reduced Jesus to a demigod thus restoring polytheism as Jesus would still be worshipped. Further, it appeared to undermine the concept of redemption as only one who was truly God could reconcile man and God. The First Council of Nicaea in 325 appeared to have settled the issue with Arius and his theology condemned and the Nicene Creed issued stating the Son was \\"of one substance with the father\\" (homoousion to Patri). However, Arians made a sustained effort to return to the church and to restore their beliefs after 325 with a prolonged theological dispute ensuing. ==First and Second Councils of Sirmium== Constantine the Great died in 337, leaving Constantius II, who favored Arianism, as emperor in the East and Constans, who favored Nicea, emperor in the West. A church council held at Antioch in 341 issued an affirmation of faith that excluded the homoousion clause; another council held at Serdica in 342 (now Sofia) achieved little. Constantius, who had a residence in Sirmium, convened the first Council of Sirmium in 347. It opposed Photinus, the bishop of Sirmium, an anti-Arian who held a belief similar to Marcellus. In 350, Constantius became the sole Emperor of both East and West, leading to a temporary strengthening of Arianism. At the second Council of Sirmium in 351, Basil, bishop of Ancyra (now Ankara) and leader of the semi-Arians, had Photinus deposed. The semi-Arians held that the Son was \\"of similar substance\\" (homoiousios) to the Father. Sirmium II also drafted the Sixth Arian Confession, which was an expanded version of the Fourth Arian Confession and was consistent with the strength of the semi-Arians. ==Third and Fourth Councils== Councils were held in Arles in 353 and Milan in 355, with Athanasius condemned at both. In 356, Athanasius began his third exile, and George was appointed bishop of Alexandria. The third Council of Sirmium, in 357, was the high point of Arianism. The Seventh Arian Confession (Second Sirmium Confession) held that both homoousios (of one substance) and homoiousios (of similar substance) were unbiblical and that the Father is greater than the Son.

But the fourth Council of Sirmium, also in 358, proposed a vague compromise: it said simply that the Son was homoios (\\"like\\") the Father. ==Recent Theory== T.D. Barnes suggests that the only extant reference to the \\"first Council of Sirmium\\" is in fact a wrongly-dated reference to the Council of Sirmium in 351. He then posits that the councils of 357 and 358 consisted of only a handful of participants and were not really councils. After examining the primary documents he concludes: \\"In sum, the only formal and well-attested Council of Sirmium during the reign of Constantius is the council of 351 which condemned Athanasius, Marcellus, and Photinus and promulgated the creed which was subsequently presented to the Councils of Arles and Milan.\\"Athanasius and Constantius: Theology and Politics in the Constantinian Empire

Beacon) is a radio and observation tower in Liverpool, England, built in 1969 and opened by Queen Elizabeth II. It was designed by James A. Roberts Associates in Birmingham. It is 125 metres (410 ft) tall, and is the second tallest free-standing building in Liverpool and the 32nd tallest in the United Kingdom. When considering the height of the building, it has a 10m long antenna on the roof, making it the tallest structure in Liverpool (including antennas). The Tower takes its name from the main radio station that operates from it, Radio City and its sister station Greatest Hits Radio Liverpool & The North West.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/liverpool-zipline-radio- city-tower-central-library-zip-world-a9585591.html == St. John's Beacon (1969 – 1999) == At the top of the tower was luxury 5 star revolving restaurant, the facade and floor of the restaurant revolving as one unit, while the roof of the restaurant was used as an observation platform for visitors. There are 558 stairs up to the top, and two lift shafts which reach the top in 30 seconds. The tower is structurally independent of the adjacent shopping centre, with a simple foundation onto sandstone. The foundation is 60 feet in diameter, 17 feet deep and begins 40 feet below Houghton Street. It has a tapering shaft that was built using slip-formed concrete. The crows nest structure at the top was then added after the shaft was formed. The original restaurant closed in 1979 for health and safety issues. It was re-opened, with a reduced capacity and additional fire prevention measures, during the early 1980s. The restaurant was eventually re-fitted as a \\"Buck Rogers\\" space-themed restaurant in 1983, but closed again due to lack of business. After this the observation deck and the restaurant remained closed. In the following years, the tower lay empty and derelict. Often dubbed an eyesore or a \\"White Elephant\\", an attempt to increase its attractiveness was made when blue \\"UFO style\\" neon strip lights were added to the perimeter of the tower in 1994 (later removed upon refurbishment). In late 1998, Radio City expressed interest in refurbishing the tower to house Radio City and Magic 1548, including their studios and required office space. The plan was announced and in the interim Radio City would regularly broadcast from the beacon along with its infamous lightshows. Work commenced in 1999 and was completed in the summer of 2000. == Radio City Tower (1999-present) == The tower was refurbished in 1999 at a cost of £5 million. It reopened as Radio City 96.7 (and Magic 1548) in August 2000. The outdoor observation deck which had been located on the roof of the restaurant was transformed into a second floor; this now holds offices and conference rooms for both radio stations. The studios are on the lower floor that used to be the restaurant. The original revolving structure and machinery were left intact during the refurbishment. Brackets were added to lock the moving structure in place. The Tower has been known to often sway in heavy winds. This is a design in construction within skyscrapers and tall building in order to prevent the building snapping at its base or cracking its shaft. During the refurbishment between the 1st and 2nd floor, the Radio City 96.7 lettering was added which illuminates yellow during nighttime. Several other lights were added into the base of the crows nest structure which illuminate all day and periodically change colour. During Christmas time a beam of light is fired at the base of the tower. The 2nd floors windows are often illuminated at night with a particular colour to mark certain events. A red aircraft warning light sits on top of the Beacons advertisement framework to warn planes of its height at night. The refurbishment added an advertising framework at the top of the tower designed for both a fabric banner and illuminated light boxes. Window cleaning must be performed by specialist teams who abseil down the side of the tower in order to clean the windows and often change light bulbs in the Radio City signage and the crows nest base lights. The roof is home to the local 10C Digital Audio Broadcasting multiplex for Liverpool, but Radio City and Greatest Hits Radio North West do not directly broadcast from the roof. Their FM signal is transmitted by the Allerton Park Transmitter along with BBC Radio Merseyside on 95.8FM and Capital Liverpool on 107.6FM In 2017 the Liverpool-based tech startup Scan And Make organised the first edition of the art contest exhibition Making Art 4.0 in the Radio offices. In 2018 an artwork banner was displayed on the beacon's advertisement framework which was titled, “Liverpool 2018” to celebrate 10 years after Liverpool's 2008 Capital Of Culture events. Radio City Talk ceased broadcasting on 31 May 2020 by Bauer Media deeming it as not financially viable to run due to low listening figures. As of September 2020, the tower houses the studios for the local programming of Radio City and Greatest Hits Radio North West. == St John's Beacon Viewing Gallery == St John's Beacon Viewing Gallery Logo In 2010, the Radio City Tower's (St John's Beacon) first floor was opened full-time to members of the public on paying an entrance fee. This fee is usually around £5-£6. Visitors can spend as long as they wish in the tower. The gallery gives the opportunity to view Liverpool from a 360* Panoramic view above Houghton Street. However, visitors cannot walk the full length of the building due to News offices for Radio City and Greatest Hits Radio North West occupying a quarter of the space. Although technically this still gives a 360* view. == Radio Stations == Initially Radio City and Magic 1548 started broadcasting from the tower but the tower was actually refurbished with 3 studios and a small recording and news studio. In 2008 the then City Talk 105.9 started broadcasting from studio 3. Radio City broadcast from Studio 2 and Magic from Studio 1. In 2015 with the revamp of local stations and the creation of Bauer City 1, Bauer City 2 and Bauer City 3, Magic 1548 became Radio City 2 and City Talk 105.9 became Radio City Talk and swapped frequencies with Radio City 2. A new station, Radio City 3 launched on 19 January 2015. This station did not need a dedicated studio as all output came from The Hits Radio in Manchester but contained local adverts and news. It was later dropped from the lineup in 2017 and eventually The Hits Radio became Hits Radio in 2018. Radio City 2 rebranded as Greatest Hits Radio Liverpool, North West and North Wales in January 2019. Radio City Talk ceased broadcasting on 31 May 2020 due to low listening figures. In September Radio City is now part of the Hits Radio Network and still broadcasts its 2 locally produced shows from Studio 2.https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/stunning-views-radio- city-tower-17379577 In September 2020 Greatest Hits Radio Liverpool & The North West was rebranded as Greatest Hits Radio North West, merging with several other stations across the north west. Studio 1 still broadcasts the National weekday breakfast and evening show, as well as weekend content. == Zip Wire Proposal == In late June 2020, a proposal was put up by ZipWorldUK for a new permanent £4M Zip Wire that would start from the second floor of the Beacon and end in Liverpool's Central Library. The project has had mixed public opinions, with most people claiming it would give Liverpool “A false sense of Disneyfication” and that it would be a permanent defacing of one of the city's world famous landmarks. Many library users also expressed concerns over the noise of the zip wire disturbing library users. The plan went before the City Council and on 30 June 2020 the plans were approved,https://twitter.com/RadioCityNews/status/1277908948461457408 however, on 2 September 2020 it was reported that Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson was withdrawing permission for this use of the Central Library, effectively vetoing the proposal. https://lbndaily.co.uk/exclusive-mayor-block-5m-zip- wire-plan == See also == *List of tallest buildings and structures in Liverpool *List of towers *Architecture of Liverpool ==References== ==External links== * Radio City Tower at Skyscraper News * Making Art 4.0 Making Art 4.0 Exhibition in the Radio City Tower 2017. * Category:Towers completed in 1969 Category:Buildings and structures in Liverpool Category:Towers in Merseyside Category:Observation towers in the United Kingdom Category:Towers with revolving restaurants ","title":"Radio City Tower"},{"id":"1276294","text":"Ashthalakshmi or Star of Lakshmi.

He was known for having acquired impressive Talmudic and Kabbalistic knowledge at an early age. He was a student of Reb Bunim of Peshischa, and upon the latter's death attracted many of his followers. Morgensztern was well known for his incisive and down-to-earth philosophies, and sharp-witted sayings. He appears to have had little patience for false piety or stupidity. From 1839 he lived in seclusion for the last twenty years of his life. == Students and legacy == The Kotzker Rebbe never published any works. He wrote many manuscripts, but he had them all burned before his death. Several collections of his sayings have been published, most notably Emes VeEmunah (Truth and Faith). The Kotzker Rebbe's disciple Rabbi Avrohom Bornsztain, author of Avnei Nezer and first Sochatchover Rebbe, was his son- in-law (having married Sara Tzina Morgenstern, the daughter of the Kotzker Rebbe). The Kotzker Rebbe is considered to be the spiritual founder upon which the Ger dynasty in Poland is based, through the teachings of its founder and first Rebbe Rabbi Yitzchak Meir Alter, known for his work as the Chidushei Harim, who was a preeminent disciple of the Kotzker Rebbe and his brother in law through his second wife. One of his major students was Rabbi Mordechai Yosef Leiner of Izbica. === Dynasty === * His eldest son, Rabbi Dovid Morgensztern, succeeded him as Kotzker Rebbe (1809–1893). * The third Kotzker Rebbe was Rabbi Chaim Yisrael Morgenstern (the Pilover Rebbe, 1840–1905). * The fourth Kotzker Rebbe was Rabbi Yitzchak Zelig Morgenstern (the Sokolover Rebbe, 1866–1940). * The fifth Kotzker Rebbe was Rabbi Jacob Mendel Morgenstern (the Węgrów Rebbe, 1887–1939). * The sixth Kotzker Rebbe was Rabbi David Solomon Morgenstern, who emigrated to London, England and then, Chicago, Illinois where he served the Chicago community. ==His sayings== \\"If I am I because I am I, and you are you because you are you, then I am I and you are you.

The story was inspired by actual events concerning the fate of the ocean liner carrying Jewish refugees from Germany to Cuba in 1939. It was based on a 1974 book written by Gordon Thomas and Max Morgan-Witts with the same title. The screenplay was written by David Butler and Steve Shagan. The film was produced by ITC Entertainment and released by Avco Embassy Pictures. ==Plot== Based on historic events, this dramatic film concerns the 1939 voyage of , which departed from Hamburg carrying 937 Jews from Germany, ostensibly bound for Havana, Cuba. The passengers, having seen and suffered rising anti-Semitism in Germany, realised this might be their only chance to escape. The film details the emotional journey of the passengers, who gradually become aware that their passage was planned as an exercise in propaganda, and that it had never been intended that they disembark in Cuba. Rather, they were to be set up as pariahs, to set an example before the world. As a Nazi official states in the film, when the whole world has refused to accept the Jews as refugees, no country can blame Germany for their fate. The Cuban government refuses entry to the passengers, and the liner heads to the United States. As it waits off the Florida coast, the passengers learn that the United States also has rejected them, leaving the captain no choice but to return to Europe. The captain tells a confidante that he has received a letter signed by 200 passengers saying they will join hands and jump into the sea rather than return to Germany. He states his intention to run the liner aground on a reef off the southern coast of England, to allow the passengers to be rescued and reach safety there. Shortly before the film's end, it is revealed that the governments of Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom have each agreed to accept a share of the passengers as refugees. As they cheer and clap at the news, footnotes disclose the fates of some of the main characters, suggesting that more than 600 of the 937 passengers, who did not resettle in the United Kingdom but in the other European nations, ultimately were deported and were murdered in Nazi concentration camps. ==Cast== * Faye Dunaway as Denise Kreisler * Max von Sydow as Captain Schroeder * Oskar Werner as Professor Egon Kreisler * Malcolm McDowell as Max Gunter * Orson Welles as José Estedes * James Mason as Dr. Juan Remos * Lee Grant as Lili Rosen * Katharine Ross as Mira Hauser * Ben Gazzara as Morris Troper * Luther Adler as Professor Weiler * Michael Constantine as Luis Clasing * Denholm Elliott as Admiral Canaris * José Ferrer as Manuel Benitez * Lynne Frederick as Anna Rosen * Helmut Griem as Otto Schiendick * Julie Harris as Alice Fienchild * Wendy Hiller as Rebecca Weiler * Paul Koslo as Aaron Pozner * Nehemiah Persoff as Mr. Hauser * Georgina Hale as Lotte Schulman * Brian Gilbert as Laurenz Schulman * Fernando Rey as President Bru * Günter Meisner as Robert Hoffman (credited as Guenter Meisner) * Leonard Rossiter as Commander Von Bonin * Maria Schell as Mrs. Hauser * Victor Spinetti as Dr. Erich Strauss * Janet Suzman as Leni Strauss * Sam Wanamaker as Carl Rosen * Jonathan Pryce as Joseph Manasse * Ina Skriver as Singer * Laura Gemser as Estedes' friend (uncredited) ==Production== The book was published in 1974.

By using statistical analysis of survival rates for Jews in various Nazi-occupied countries, Thomas and Morgan-Witts estimated the fate of the 621 St. Louis passengers who were not given refuge in Cuba or the United Kingdom (one died during the voyage): 44 (20%) of the 224 refugees that settled in France likely were murdered in the Holocaust, 62 (29%) Holocaust murders amongst the 214 that reached Belgium, and 121 (67%) Holocaust murders amongst the 181 that settled in the Netherlands, for a total of 227 (37%) of the refugees that came under occupation were likely murdered by the Nazis.Rosen, pp. 447, 567 citing Morgan-Witts and Thomas (1994) pp. 8, 238 In 1998, Scott Miller and Sarah Ogilvie of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum traced the survivors from the voyage, concluding that a total of 254 refugees were murdered by the Nazis. ==Release== The film opened on 22 December 1976 in four theatres in New York and Los Angeles. ===Box Office=== According to Lew Grade who helped finance the film, the movie \\"should have done better\\" at the box office.Alexander Walker, National Heroes: British Cinema in the Seventies and Eighties, 1985 p. 197 He wrote in his memoirs \\"I thought it was one of the most moving and important films I'd seen in a long time.

The exercise of those rights was combined with manorial administrative concerns, in his court baron. However this court had no power to deal with criminal acts. Criminal jurisdiction was held by the hundred courts; the country was divided into hundreds, and there was a hundred court for each of them. Each hundred comprised 100 hides, with each hide being an area of land of variable size that is enough to support one entire household. A tithing was an area of 10 hides, which therefore originally corresponded to about 10 households. The heads of each household were judicially bound to the others in their tithing by an arrangement called frankpledge, which created collective responsibility for behaviour within their tithing. The hundred court monitored this system, in a process called view of frankpledge, with the tithing reporting any wrongdoing in their area, and handing over the perpetrators among them. If the wrongdoing was minor, it would be dealt with by the hundred court, but serious crimes were passed up to the shire court. Before feudalism, hundred courts had also dealt with administrative matters within their area, such as bridge repairs, road conditions, and so forth, but the courts baron had largely superseded that in practice, and some manorial lords began claiming authority over criminal matters as well. Eventually, the king formally granted certain trusted lords with the legal authority that had been held by the hundred court over the tithings in the lord's manor, the most important of those being view of frankpledge.Ritson, J., The Jurisdiction of the Court Leet (1809): Introduction – Full text available on Google Books The group of tithings that were located within each manor had come to be called a leet, and hence, in the later Middle Ages these judicial powers came to be called court leet. The quo warranto proceedings of Edward I established a sharp distinction between the court baron, exercising strictly manorial rights, and the court leet, exercising the powers formerly held by the hundred court, emphasising that the ability to hold court leet depended upon a royally granted franchise. However in many areas it became customary for the court baron and court leet to meet together, as a single operation. ==Role== The court leet was a court of record, and its duty was not only to view the pledges, which were the freemen's oaths of peacekeeping and good practice in trade, but also to try with a jury, and punish, crimes committed within the jurisdiction; more serious crimes were committed to the King's Justices. Despite the presence of a jury, it was not trial by jury as understood today. The court leet had developed while the jury system was still evolving; the jury indicted wrongdoers, stood witness, and helped decide on punishment. It also developed as a means of proactively ensuring that standards in such matters as sales of food and drink, and agriculture, were adhered to. The Alcester Court Leet contained the following wording:Alcester Court Leet – retrieved 26 August 2018 The court generally sat only a few times each year, sometimes just annually. A matter was introduced into the court by means of a \\"presentment\\", from a local man or from the jury itself. Penalties were in the form of fines or imprisonment. ==The jury and officers== Attendance at the court leet was often compulsory for those under its jurisdiction, with fines being meted out for non-attendance. The ability of the court to levy a fine was always subject to limitations, but the limits were never updated to account for inflation over the centuries; for those courts leet that still exist, the fine has effectively become merely nominal – 2p for example in the case of Laxton. Courts leet generally had a jury formed from the freehold tenants, as bondsmen could not give an oath (jury means persons having taken an oath). The jury's role was similar to that of the doomsmen of the Anglo- Saxons and included electing the officers (other than the Steward who was appointed by the lord), bringing matters to the attention of the court and deciding on them. The officers of courts leet could include some or all of the following:The Court Leet of the Worshipful Town Mayor and Chief Burgesses of Warwick – retrieved Nov 2018The Court Leet and Court Baron of the Manor of Henley-in-Arden – retrieved 23 May 2009 * Steward, a stand-in for the lord of the manor, and hence his chief official. The steward thus acted as chairman of proceedings – in a comparable manner to a modern-day judge in a jury trialScriven, J., A Treatise on Copyholds, Customary Freeholds, Ancient Demesne and the Jurisdiction of Courts Baron and Courts Leet (1823): Part III, Chapter XVIII. * Bailiff, the servant of the court. He was responsible for ensuring that the decisions of the court were enacted, including being responsible for summoning the jury, and performing any arrests that had been ordered by the court * Reeve, the bailiff's deputy (originally the servant of the hundred court, from which the court leet had taken its jurisdiction) * Constable, to ensure order during court sessions * Bedel, the usher; typically referred to as mace bearer, in modern-day courts leet, since this is largely all he now does * Chapelayne, who provided prayers for the court * Crier or bellman, responsible for announcing of the court's decisions to the people of the manor in general * Affeerers, responsible for assessing amercements (setting the level of fines) * Specialist professional inspectors, in lieu of portions of the jury's responsibility: ** Ale taster or ale conner, to ensure the quality of ale, and to check that true measures are used ** Carniters or \\"flesh tasters\\", to ensure the freshness of meat and poultry ** Bread weighers, responsible for verifying the freshness and weight of bread sold in the manor ** Searcher and sealer of leather, to ensure the quality of leather goods ** Surveyor of the highways or overseer of pavements, and brook looker or ditch reeve, to ensure the proper condition of roads and waterways ** Chimney peeper, to ensure chimneys were swept clean ** Scavenger, to ensure standards of hygiene within the lanes and privies and to try and prevent the spread of infectious disease ** Overseer of the poor, to collect and distribute alms * Specialist enacting staff, in lieu of parts of the bailiff's responsibility ** The Hayward, responsible for enclosures and fences on common land ** The Woodward, responsible for patrolling woodlands and stopping poachers from hunting illegally ** The Pinherd, to impound stray animals in the pinfold ==Later history== The introduction of magistrates gradually rebalanced power away from manorial lords. Magistrates were later given authority over view of frankpledge, which effectively negated the remaining significance of the court leet, and they gradually ceased to be held, largely dying out. Following the collapse of the feudal system, and subsequent rise of the Reformation, civil parishes had largely taken over the remaining authority of courts baron, and tithings were seen as a parish sub-division. Nevertheless, courts leet technically survived into the late 20th century, though almost all of the small number which still operated had become merely ceremonial, simply forming a way of promoting or celebrating their local area. Despite this, their legal jurisdiction over crime was only abolished in 1977, by section 23 of the Administration of Justice Act 1977. However, one exception was allowed: the court leet for the manor of Laxton, Nottinghamshire,Laxton Court Leet, Dovecote Inn, Laxton – retrieved 23 May 2009 which had continued to operate judicially;Per the Lord Chancellor in the House of Lords Debate on the Administration of Justice Bill on 2 May 1977 vol 382 cc816-23 Laxton retains the open-field system of farming, which had been replaced everywhere else by the 18th century (as a result of the process of enclosure), and required the court in order to administer the field system. Although the Administration of Justice Act had abolished the legal jurisdiction of the other courts leet, it emphasised that \\"any such court may continue to sit and transact such other business, if any, as was customary for it\\". Schedule 4 to the Act specified the \\"business\\" which was to be considered customary, which included the taking of presentments relating to matters of local concern and – in some cases – the management of common land. ===Courts leet existing today=== The following courts leet were exempted from abolition by the Administration of Justice Act 1977, and were known to be still functioning in 2010: * Alcester (Warwickshire) Court Leet, Court Baron and View of Frankpledge * Ashburton Courts Leet and Baron * Bideford Manor Court (held by the Parish Council – the Town Council) * Court Leet and Court Baron of the Ancient Manor of Bowes in County of Durham * Ancient Court Leet and Court Baron of the Manor of Bromsgrove * Courts Leet and Baron of Barony of Cemaes in County of Dyfed (Pembrokeshire) * Manorial Court for Hundred and Borough of Cricklade * Danby (North Yorkshire) Court Leet and Court Baron * Manor of Fyling Court Leet in North YorkshireArchived website of Fyling Court Leet * Court Baron for the Manor of Heaton in City of Bradford * Court Leet and Court Baron of the Manor of Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire * Town and Manor of Hungerford and the Manor and Liberty of Sanden Fee Hocktide Court and Court Leet * Manor of Laxton Court Leet * Court Leet and Baron of the Manor of Mynachlogddu, Dyfed * The Norwich Court of Mayoralty (held by the Parish Council – the Town Council – to admit freemen) * Court Leet of the Island and Royal Manor of Portland * Southampton Court LeetCity Council Southampton Court Leet , City of Southampton Society – retrieved 23 May 2009 * Southwark Courts Leet and Views of Frankpledge for the three Manors of the City of London (the Guildable, King's, and Great Liberty). * Manor of Spaunton Court Leet and Court Baron with View of Frankpledge * Courts Leet and Baron of Stockbridge, Hampshire * Court Leet of the Manor and Borough of Wareham * Warwick Court Leet In addition, the following courts leet are in operation, having been re- established, or continued, but without statutory authority (not having been preserved by the 1977 act): * The Court Leet and Baron of Carrick Blacker at Portadown * Court Leet and Court Baron of the Manor of HatherleighReport of Hatherleigh Court Leet.

It is found in boar's saliva, celery cytoplasm, and truffle fungus. Androstenone was the first mammalian pheromone to be identified. It is found in high concentrations in the saliva of male pigs, and, when inhaled by a female pig that is in heat, results in the female assuming the mating stance. Androstenone is the active ingredient in 'Boarmate', a commercial product made by DuPont sold to pig farmers to test sows for timing of artificial insemination. ==Biosynthesis== Androstenone is synthesized from androstadienone by 5α-reductase, and can be converted into 3α-androstenol or 3β-androstenol by 3-ketosteroid reductase. ==Properties== Depending upon the subject, it is reported to be an unpleasant, sweaty, urinous smell, a woody smell, or even a pleasant floral smell. There are two different genotypes that allow an individual to smell androstenone. The first genotype, which consists of two fully functional copies of the gene, is the RT/RT allele, and the second is the RT/WM allele.http://web.ebscohost.com/src/pdf?vid=9&hid;=13&sid;=802c875e-0200-4687-8e68-25dd33572ceb%40sessionmgr10 The OR7D4 receptor has two non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms, which cause the gene to have two amino acid substitutions, which in turn cause the receptor to act differently. Those in possession of the two proper genes, (RT/RT) for OR7D4 tend to describe the odor for the steroid as the odor of stale urine. Those with only one gene (RT/WM) typically described the odor as weak or were not able to detect it. They can also find the smell 'pleasant', 'sweet' or 'similar to vanilla'. In small amounts, the odor is hardly detectable by most people. This may be due to a polymorphism in the receptor gene that codes for the androstenone receptor. However, the ability to detect the odor varies greatly. It has been shown that the odor can be detected by people down to levels of 0.2 parts per billion to 0.2 parts in 100 million. Several groups report, however, that some individuals who initially cannot smell androstenone can learn to smell it by repeated exposures to it. ===Detectability as a pheromone=== In humans, androstenone also has been suggested to be a pheromone; however, there is little scientific data to support this claim.Kirk-Smith, M.D., and Booth, D.A. (1980) \\"Effect of androstenone on choice of location in others' presence\\". In H. van der Starre (Ed.), Olfaction and Taste VII, London: Information Retrieval Ltd., pp.397-400. The vomeronasal organ is an auxiliary olfactory sense organ responsible for the detection of pheromones as more than just an odor. Most adult humans possess something resembling this organ, but there is no active function. Humans lack the sensory cells that exist in other mammals needed to detect pheromones beyond a smell. Humans also lack the genetic ability to produce these sensory cells actively. There is also a specific anosmia to the odor in some humans; they are unable to smell specific odors, but have, otherwise, a normal sense of smell. However, this should, by no means, be regarded as indicative for being labeled as a pheromone, as it is true of over 80 olfactory compounds. To animals, the smell of androstenone can act as a social sign of dominance, or it can be a way of attracting a mate. ===Commercial use=== Some commercially available products are advertised using claims that they contain human sexual pheromones, including androstenone, and that they can act as an aphrodisiac. These products are the subject of marketing by mass unsolicited e-mail ==See also== * List of neurosteroids § Pheromones and pherines ==References== Category:Androstanes Category:Human pheromones Category:Mammalian pheromones Category:Neurosteroids ","title":"Androstenone"},{"id":"1276346","text":"Miguel Ángel Moratinos Cuyaubé (born 8 June 1951) is a Spanish diplomat and politician, a member of the Socialist Workers' Party and was member of Congress, where he represented Córdoba.

Joshua ben Alexander HaCohen Falk (1555 – 29 March 1614) was a Polish Halakhist and Talmudist, best known as the author of the Beit Yisrael commentary on the Arba'ah Turim as well as Sefer Me'irat Enayim (סמ\\"ע) on Shulkhan Arukh. His name also occurs as the Hebrew acronym רפ\\"כ (\\"RaFaC\\") (\\"Rabbi Falk Cohen\\") and מהרו\\"כ (\\"Ma-HaRWaC\\") (\\"Morenu ha-Rab Walk Cohen\\"). == Biography == He was a pupil of his relative Moses Isserles and of Solomon Luria, and became the head of the yeshiva of Lemberg. Many celebrated rabbis were his pupils, among them being Joshua Höschel ben Joseph of Kraków, the author of Maginei Shlomo. Falk was a great authority on rabbinical matters. At the meeting of the Council of Four Lands in 1607, during the Kremenetz fair, many of his proposals were approved. In 1611 Falk and Enoch Hendel ben Shemariah issued a bill of divorce at Vienna which occasioned lengthy discussions among the celebrated rabbis of the time, including Meir Lublin and Mordecai Yoffe.see \\"She'elot uTeshuvot MaHaRaM\\", Nos. 123 et seq. He was Rosh Yeshiva in Lemberg and served on the Council of Four Lands. Falk was opposed to the reliance on law codes to the exclusion of study of the original sources. Towards this end he composed a series of commentaries on the most influential codes, Rabbi Jacob ben Asher's Tur and Rabbi Joseph Karo's Shulkhan Arukh. He spent his early life composing extensive analytical commentaries on the Talmud, which were later lost in a fire. Falk died at Lemberg, in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth on 29 March 1614. === Note on the name \\"Joshua Falk\\" === Until the early 19th century, the names of most Central European Jews consisted of a Hebrew first name, a German second name, the patronymic \\"ben ... \\" (son of ...) and, if an upper one, the class - HaCohen (or \\"Katz\\") or HaLevy. The German name was chosen to fit the Hebrew one: thus \\"Zvi\\" or \\"Naftali\\" went with \\"Hirsch\\", and \\"Zev\\" or \\"Binjamin\\" with \\"Wolf\\". Those whose given name was Yehoshua, Josua, or Joshua had the second name of Falk, Valk, Walk, Wallik or Wallich. (One theory is that \\"Falk\\", here, derives from the German for falcon: just as a falcon circles its prey, so Joshua circled and explored the Holy Land before swooping down on it. Some derive \\"Valk\\" from an acronym of Leviticus 19:18: \\"ve'ahavta lere'akha kamokha\\" - \\"Love thy neighbor as thyself\\"). The name Falk was thus not a family name until the 19th century, when it was adopted by those whose immediate ancestors had \\"Falk\\" as a second name. Encyclopedias will therefore have several entries under \\"Falk\\", where \\"Falk\\", strictly, is not a surname. References to Rabbi Falk are therefore often via \\"Yehoshua Falk ben Alexander HaCohen\\" or \\"Joshua Falk ben Alexander Katz\\" or \\"Joshua Falk Katz\\". == Works == Beit Yisrael is a twin commentary on the Tur, composed of the Perishah, a straightforward explanation, and the Derishah, deeper discussions on specific problems. The Perishah clarifies the rulings of the Tur, by tracing them to their sources in the Talmud and Rishonim. The Derishah is devoted to extensive analysis and comparison of the various interpretations and decisions proposed by various Talmudic authorities. Rabbi Falk also wrote: * Sefer Me'irat Einayim, a commentary to the Choshen Mishpat section of the Shulkhan Arukh, containing all the decisions of the Rishonim, with an index of their sources. * Sefer ha-Hosafah, a supplement to the Darhkei Mosheh of Moses Isserles, printed with the Choshen Mishpat, Dyhernfurth, 1796; * Kontres 'al Diney Ribbit, a discourse on the laws relating to the prohibition of usury, followed by some takkanot (ordinances by the Rabbis), Sulzbach, 1692; * Novellae on Talmudic treatises. == References == * Its bibliography: * Azulai, Shem ha- Gedolim, i.50, 70; * Giovanni Bernardo De Rossi, Dizionario, i.116; * Solomon Buber, Toledot Anshe Shem, No. 197. == External links == * Beit Israel (\\"Perishah\\" and \\"Derishah\\"), Prof. Eliezer Segal * Joshua Ben Alexander Ha- Kohen, jewishencyclopedia.com * History of Jewish family Names, jewishgen.org * Meir Wunder, Yehoshu‘a ben Aleksander ha-Kohen, in The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe.

The New International Encyclopedia of 1914 reports that Court de Gébelin, who adopted the surname of his grandmother, was a literary man of recognized rank, and rendered excellent service, first as his father's amanuensis and assistant and afterward as a scholar at the capital. He is remembered in connection with the case of Jean Calas, by his work Les Toulousaines, ou lettres historiques et apologétiques en faveur de la religion réformée (Lausanne, 1763). ==Early life== His father was Antoine Court, a famous religious leader of the Huguenots. Court de Gébelin had been ordained a pastor in 1754 before departing Switzerland and remained openly Protestant, a rational advocate for freedom of conscience in Enlightenment France. In Paris, he was initiated into Freemasonry at the lodge Les Amis Réunis, in 1771, and moved on to the lodge Les Neuf Sœurs where he welcomed Benjamin Franklin as a lodge-brother. ==Career== He was a supporter of American Independence who contributed to the massive Affaires de l'Angleterre et de l'Amérique, of the new theories of economics, and of the \\"animal magnetism\\" of Mesmer (he was found dead in a bath after undergoing Mesmer's magnetic treatment, apparently of an electrically induced heart attack). In a letter from the Reverend James Madison to James Madison dated 15 June 1782 he is spoken of with the words, \\"Mr. Gibelin of Paris, who is said tho’ to have a very great Reputation.\\" He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1781. His great project had for its goal to set out to reconstruct the high primeval civilization. Reinterpreting Classical and Renaissance evocation of the Golden Age in mankind's early history, Court de Gébelin asserted that the primitive worldwide civilization had been advanced and enlightened. He is the intellectual grandfather of much of modern occultism. His centers of focus are the familiar ones of universal origins of languages in deep time and the hermeneutics of symbolism. While his views on hermeneutics and religious matters were largely conservative, his original ideas and research on the origin of language earn him a place among pioneers of linguistics. Court de Gébelin presented dictionaries of etymology, what he called a universal grammar, and discourses on the origins of language. His volumes were so popular he republished them separately, as Histoire naturelle de la parole, ou Précis de l'Origine du Langage & de la Grammaire Universelle (\\"Natural History of Speech, or a Treatise on the Origins of Language and of Universal Grammar\\"), in Paris, 1776. With regard to mythology and symbology, he discussed the origins of allegory in antiquity and recreated a history of the calendar from civil, religious, and mythological perspectives. ==The tarot== De Gébelin wrote an essay included in his Le Monde primitif, analysé et comparé avec le monde moderne (\\"The Primeval World, Analyzed and Compared to the Modern World\\"), volume viii, 1781. The chapter on Tarot with which his name is indelibly associated is a single section in his vast compendium that he published in series from 1773, to a distinguished list of subscribers, headed by Louis XVI of France. It was his immediate perception, the first time he saw the Tarot deck, that it held the secrets of the Egyptians. Writing without the benefit of Champollion's deciphering of the Egyptian language, Court de Gébelin developed a reconstruction of Tarot history, without producing any historical evidence, which was that Egyptian priests had distilled the ancient Book of Thoth into these images. These they brought to Rome, where they were secretly known to the popes, who brought them to Avignon in the 14th century, whence they were introduced into France. An essay by the Comte de Mellet included in Court de Gebelin's Monde primitif is responsible for the mystical connection of the Tarot's 21 trumps and the fool with the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet. An essay appended to this gave suggestions for cartomancy; within two years the fortune-teller known as \\"Etteilla\\" published a technique for reading the tarot, and the practice of tarot reading was born. ==Notes== ==References== *Ronald Decker, Thierry Depaulis, Michael Dummett, A Wicked Pack of Cards: The Origins of the Occult Tarot 1996 * ==External links== * * Egyptomania of Antoine Court de Gébelin * James W.

From 1617 until his death in 1630, Yamada Nagamasa was head of the Thai village referred to as Ban Yipun ('Japanese village') in the Thai language. This village was within the city of Ayutthaya (the capital city of the Ayutthaya Kingdom). Ban Yipun was home to roughly 1,000 Japanese citizens and was headed by a Japanese chief who was nominated by Ayutthayan authorities. Its inhabitants were a combination of traders, Christian converts who had fled their home country following the persecutions of Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu and Rōnin (unemployed former samurai) who had been on the losing side at the battle of Sekigahara (1600) or the Siege of Osaka (1614–15). The Christian community seems to have been in the hundreds, as described by Padre António Francisco Cardim, who recounted having administered sacraments to around 400 Japanese Christians in 1627 in the city of Ayutthaya.Ishii Yoneo, Multicultural Japan Cambridge University Press, ==Early life== Yamada Nagamasa was born in Numazu, Shizuoka in 1590. He is said to have been a palanquin bearer for the lord of Numazu. He became involved in Japanese trade activities with Southeast Asia during the period of the Red seal ships and settled in the Ayutthaya Kingdom (modern-day Thailand) around 1612. ==Career== Yamada Nagamasa is alleged to have carried on the business of a privateer from the period of 1620, attacking and plundering Dutch ships in and around Batavia (present-day Jakarta). Stories of Yamada burying his treasure on the east coast of Australia (and in particular, Magnetic Island off Townsville) persist but it is highly unlikely that Yamada would have ventured into that area as there were no trade routes in this region and the only ships to venture to this region were the ones blown off course during the summer storms. Furthermore, Yamada would have passed thousands of islands in the Torres Strait and Coral Sea and these would have provided safekeeping for any treasure and avoided a very long recovery voyage in the future. The Ban Yipun colony was active in trade, particularly in the export of deer hide to Japan in exchange for Japanese silver and handicrafts (swords, lacquered boxes, high-quality papers). The Japanese were noted by the Dutch for challenging the trade monopoly of the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie). The colony also had an important military role in the Ayutthaya Kingdom. ==Military involvement and lordship== The army of Yamada Nagamasa in the Ayutthaya Kingdom The Japanese colony was highly valued for its military expertise, and was organized under a \\"Department of Japanese Volunteers\\" (Krom Asa Yipun) by the King of Ayutthaya. In the space of 15 years, Yamada Nagamasa rose from the low Thai nobility rank of Khun to the senior of Ok-ya, his title becoming Ok-ya Senaphimuk (Thai : ออกญาเสนาภิมุข). He became the head of the Japanese colony, and in this position supported the military campaigns of King Songtham, at the head of a Japanese army flying the Japanese flag. He fought successfully, and was finally nominated Ligor (modern Nakhon Si Thammarat), in the southern peninsula in 1630, accompanied by 300 samurai. ==Travels between Siam and Japan== Yamada Nagasama's fighting ship, 17th-century painting After more than 12 years in Siam, Yamada Nagamasa went to Japan in 1624 on board one of his ships, where he sold a cargo of Siamese deer hide in Nagasaki. He stayed in Japan for three years, trying to obtain a Red Seal permit, but finally left in 1627, with the simple status of a foreign ship. In 1626, Nagamasa offered a painting of one of his fighting ships to a temple of his hometown in Shizuoka. That painting was lost in a fire, but a copy of it remains to this day. It portrays a ship with Western-style rigging, 18 cannons, and sailors in samurai gear. He returned to Siam in 1627. In 1628, one of his ships transporting rice from Ayutthaya to Malacca was arrested by a Dutch warship blockading the city. The ship was released once the identity of the owner became clear, since the Dutch knew that Yamada was held in great respect by the King of Siam, and they did not wish to enter into a diplomatic conflict. Yamada was also valued by the Dutch as a supplier of deer hide, and they invited him to trade more with Batavia. Accounts of the castle of Batavia, March 1, 1628 ==Death== In 1629, Yamada Nagamasa visited Japan with a delegation from King Songtham. He soon travelled back to Siam, but became involved in a succession war following the death of the King Songtham by Prasat Thong. Prasat Thong had acted as \\"king- maker\\" before assuming the throne, by performing the double regicide of King Songtham's sons. Yamada or Okya Seniphimok, heard of the coup at Ayutthaya and rebelled. Prasat Thong had Praya Chaiya poison him in 1630, and then expelled the remaining Japanese.Chakrabongse, C., 1960, Lords of Life, London: Alvin Redman Limited ==End of relations between Siam and Japan== Following Yamada's death in 1630, the new ruler and usurper king of Siam Prasat Thong (1630–1655) sent an army of 4,000 soldiers to destroy the Japanese settlement in Ayutthaya, but many Japanese managed to flee to the Khmer Kingdom. A few years later in 1633, returnees (300–400 Japanese) from Indochina were able to re- establish the Japanese settlement in Ayutthaya . From 1634, the shōgun, informed of these troubles and what he perceived as attacks on his authority, refused to issue further Red Seal ship permits for Siam. Desirous to renew trade, however, the king of Siam sent a trading ship and an embassy to Japan in 1636, but the embassies were rejected by the shogun, thus putting an end to direct relations between Japan and Siam. Japan was concomitantly closing itself to the world at that time, a period known as Sakoku. The Dutch took advantage of the Japanese withdrawal, increasing their trade and offering naval support. Japan lost influence for 300 years after being expelled by Prasat Thong. ==Memorial== Yamada now rests in his hometown in the area of Otani. The remnants of the Japanese quarters in Ayutthuya are still visible to visitors, as well as a statue of Yamada in Siamese military uniform. ==Film adaptations of Yamada's life== * The Gaijin (山田長政 王者の剣) – 1959 * Southern Cross: The Strange Tale of Cornelia Oyuki and Nagamasa Yamada (南十字星 コルネリアお雪異聞 わたしの山田長政) (TV movie) \\\\- 1978 * Yamada: The Samurai of Ayothaya – 2010 ==See also== * Japan-Thailand relations ==References== ==Further reading== *Red Seal Ships.

A previous manor house on the site was demolished and the present building constructed between 1758 and 1766 for William Drake, Sr., the Member of Parliament for Amersham. Shardeloes is a Grade I listed building. ==Design and construction== The architect and builder was Stiff Leadbetter; designs for interior decorations were provided by Robert Adam from 1761.Shardeloes Papers of the 17th and 18th Centuries. G.Eland (ed). Oxford University Press 1947 Built in the Palladian style, of stuccoed brick, the mansion is nine bays long by seven bays deep. It was constructed with the piano nobile on the ground floor and a mezzanine above. The north facade has a large portico of Corinthian columns. The terminating windows of the piano nobile are pedimented and recessed into shallow niches, as are the end bays of the east front. The roof, typically for the palladian style, is hidden by a balustrade. The original plans of the house by Leadbetter show a design closer in appearance to Holkham Hall, with square end towers. Adam cancelled this idea, but embellished the front with the portico. The interior of the house has fine ornamental plaster work by Joseph Rose.Detailed existing bills from Joseph Rose, 1761-63, totalling £1,139 18s 0d, are noted by Geoffrey Beard, Decorative Plasterwork in Great Britain 1975:244 The entrance hall by Adam has fluted Doric pilasters and massive doorcases in the north and south walls. The dining room has stucco panels and an oval panel in the ceiling. The library was designed by James Wyatt in a classical style and has painted panels by Biagio Rebecca. Nikolaus Pevsner describes the staircase as \\"surprisingly small.\\"Pevsner, Buckinghamshire. Penguin Books, 1960. Pevsner, for once, rather misses the point: as the house was designed, all rooms of importance, including the bedrooms, were on the principal ground floor; thus, there was no need for a grand staircase, as no grandee would ever need to ascend to the secondary floor above. Blenheim Palace is another house with a small staircase for the same reason. The house is flanked to the west by a service block and stable yard of the same period as the mansion, complete with clock tower. The stable yard is entered through five archways; the rectangular building has projecting wings and a pitched roof. ==Grounds== Humphry Repton was commissioned to lay out the grounds in the classical English landscape fashion, in the lee of the hill upon which the mansion stands. Repton dammed the River Misbourne to form a lake. ===Cricket ground=== The grounds house a cricket ground, which is the home ground of Amersham Cricket Club, which has played at the ground in two periods from 1856 to 1886 and from 1905 to present. The ground has been used for minor counties matches by Buckinghamshire in both the Minor Counties Championship and the Minor Counties Twenty20. Buckinghamshire also played one List A one-day match when there when they were permitted to play List A cricket, playing against first-class opposition in the form of Glamorgan in the 1972 Gillette Cup. A combined Minor Counties South team also played five List A matches there in the Benson & Hedges Cup between 1973 and 1977. ==Recent history== The mansion remained the ancestral home of the Tyrwhitt-Drake family until the Second World War, when the house was requisitioned as a maternity hospital for evacuated pregnant women from London; some three thousand children were born there, including lyricist Sir Tim Rice in 1944. Following the war the house seemed destined to become one of the thousands of country houses being demolished, until a local conservation society, the Amersham Society,https://www.amershamsociety.org/ assisted by the Council for the Protection of Rural England fought a prolonged battle to save the house: eventually a preservation order was put on the building preventing its demolition. Although inhabited in parts, the building fell into a state of neglect through the 1960s and was eventually purchased in the early 1970s by local property developer Richard Watson. His company, Landstone Limited, completed a comprehensive renovation of the building and converted unused parts into further apartments. Shardeloes today is a complex of private flats; the principal reception rooms are preserved as common rooms for the residents. == References == == External links == * Further information Category:Houses completed in 1766 Category:Country houses in Buckinghamshire Category:Amersham Category:Grade I listed buildings in Buckinghamshire Category:Palladian architecture Category:Cricket grounds in Buckinghamshire Category:Grade I listed houses Category:Grade II* listed parks and gardens in Buckinghamshire Category:Buildings by Stiff Leadbetter ","title":"Shardeloes"},{"id":"1276403","text":"D0226 and D0227 were two prototype diesel shunting locomotives built in 1956 by English Electric at its Vulcan Foundry in Newton-le-Willows to demonstrate its wares to British Railways. They originally carried numbers D226 and D227, their Vulcan Foundry works numbers, but these were amended in August 1959 to avoid clashing with the numbers of new Class 40 locomotives. They were both of 0-6-0 wheel arrangement and were fitted with English Electric 6RKT engines of 500 hp. They were painted black with an orange stripe along the middle of the bodyside, which turned into a 'V' at the nose end. The major difference between the two locomotives was that D0226 had diesel-electric transmission and D0227 had diesel-hydraulic transmission.

It was originally produced by Freda Lingstrom and was presented over the years by Daphne Oxenford, Julia Lang, Eileen Browne, Dorothy Smith and others.Whirlygig nostalgia site - Accessed 25 Jan 2011 ==History== It was first broadcast on the BBC Light Programme in a fifteen-minute slot every weekday afternoon at 1.45, just before Woman's Hour. Consisting of stories, songs and nursery rhymes (often sung by Eileen Browne and George Dixon) for “mothers and children at home”, at its peak it had an audience of more than a million listeners. From 7 September 1964 the programme moved to the BBC Home Service (later BBC Radio 4). Listen with Mothers final week's programmes (widely reported in the press) featured Wriggly Worm stories, presented by Nerys Hughes and Tony Aitken and directed by David Bell. These stories were broadcast on the Listen with Mother programmes throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. Listening Corner, which replaced Listen with Mother on 10 September 1982, began with repeats of the Wriggly Worm stories. Collections of Listen with Mother stories have been published by Hutchinsons/Random House. Two collections of Wriggly Worm stories ('Wonderful Wriggly Worm' and 'Wonderful Wriggly Worm Rides Again'), by Eugenie Summerfield, have been published by Book Guild. Listening Corner continued until 24 August 1990, ending three days before the launch of BBC Radio 5. ==Theme music== At the start of each programme a short introduction on piano was played. The tune went to the rhythm of the words quarter to two, which of course was the time of the broadcast, and many children were helped in learning to tell the time by this ingenious device. A piece for piano duet, the Berceuse from Gabriel Fauré's Dolly Suite, Op. 56, was played at the conclusion of each broadcast and became synonymous with the programme. It was recorded for the programme by Eileen Browne and Roger Fiske, though Julia Lang in an Anglia Television interview in the 1990s said that during her tenure when she finished reading the story she had to get up (noiselessly), rush across to the piano in the studio and play the Berceuse live. == \\"Are you sitting comfortably?\\" == Each story on Listen with Mother opened with the phrase \\"Are you sitting comfortably? Then I'll begin\\" (sometimes \\"...Then we'll begin\\"). The question, originally an ad lib by Julia Lang on 16 January 1950, became so well known that it appears in The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations\\"January Anniversaries: Listen with Mother 16 January 1950\\".

He is originally from Mitcham, South London.Steve voted The X Factor winner BBC News ==Early and personal life== Brookstein was born in Dulwich, London, England, the son of Malle, a council worker, and Errol Brookstein, a lorry driver. His father is South African and his mother is of Estonian descent. He is a supporter of Crystal Palace F.C. In 1997, seven years before his breakthrough on The X Factor, Brookstein was a finalist on the ITV series The Big Big Talent Show, hosted by Jonathan Ross.Bushell on the box: ITV'S RECYCLED TALENT ==Career== ===2004–2005: The X Factor and Heart and Soul=== In early 2004, Brookstein auditioned for the first series of The X Factor, a talent series that aimed to discover new recording artists in the UK. His audition failed to impress two of the judges, Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh, who thought he lacked the motivation and confidence to succeed but the third, Simon Cowell, asked Brookstein to return the following day and sing again. At the second audition, Brookstein managed to impress the other judges and was put through to the next stage of the competition. He went on to reach the live shows, where contestants are put to the public vote, as one of three contestants in the Over 25s category mentored by Cowell. He reached the grand final on 11 December 2004 alongside G4 and won, despite him mixing up words and lines in his winner's song and a controversial outburst against him from Osbourne. However, according to Osbourne's subsequent autobiography, he had gained the most votes in every single one of the live shows. For five years, he held the record for the greatest number of votes ever received in the final - 6 million, but this is now held by series 6 winner Joe McElderry, who received over 6.1 million votes. After winning The X Factor, Brookstein was immediately signed to the Sony BMG record label through which he released his first single, a cover of Phil Collins' 1984 power ballad \\"Against All Odds\\", on 20 December 2004. The song debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number two and then climbed to number one on 2 January 2005, going one better than Collins' original and staying there for one week. In Ireland, the song peaked at number 11. The music video for the song was a montage of clips from his time on The X Factor, from his initial audition to his final performance after being declared the winner. Brookstein released his debut album Heart and Soul on 9 May 2005 through Sony BMG. Although Brookstein continued to perform tracks from the album on television shows such as CD:UK, a second single failed to materialise. In August 2005 it was announced that Sony BMG had dropped him from their line-up only eight months after his X Factor victory and despite the success of his debut single and album. Brookstein maintains that the decision to drop him reportedly came after he was offered a second album and to come back on the show, which he declined as it was to be another album of covers and he preferred a mix of old and new.Steve Brookstein: 'I turned down Simon Cowell's sloppy seconds' - The X Factor News - Reality TV - Digital Spy In August 2005, eight months after being dropped from his record label,Brookstein: X Factor is killing music  Showbiz.

It is defined as \\"knowing and willing cause over life, thought, matter, energy, space and time (MEST).\\"The State of Operating Thetan (Church of Scientology) According to religious scholar J. Gordon Melton, \\"[i]t's basically a variation of the Gnostic myth about souls falling into matter and the encumbrances that come with that\\". ==Description== OT Levels are part of \\"The Bridge\\", which is the set of ranks within Scientology. After having removed one's own \\"reactive mind\\" and thus attaining the state of \\"Clear\\", Scientologists may then go on to the OT levels.www.whatisscientology.org, Grade chart of Scientology courses, training and processing Scientology doctrine defines OT as the \\"highest state there is\\".Technical Dictionary of Dianetics and Scientology; L. Ron Hubbard; Bridge Publications; The Official Scientology and Dianetics Glossary definition of pre-OT levels; accessed 2008-02-03 (mirror ) Operating Thetan is described within Scientology as a state of godliness, and Scientologists are taught they will have godlike control over \\"matter, energy, space and time\\" (known in Scientology jargon as (MEST)). Hubbard claimed that thetans were tricked into following religions, which prevented them from using their own power to create and destroy universes. The Church claims that the OT is not dependent on the universe and Scientologists who are at the Operating Thetan level claim that they have control over their lives and can \\"go exterior\\" from their bodies. While there are fifteen levels listed in Scientology teaching, the Church only offers eight. According to former Scientologist and critic of the Church Mike Rinder, the promise of new levels has been used for decades to motivate church members to donate or repeat courses they have already taken in preparation. Rinder has said he doesn't believe these courses exist. The state of Operating Thetan is represented by a symbol consisting of the letters OT with the T inside the O and each of the points of the T ending at the O's circumference, which displays the level's initials, and is also intended to evoke the medieval O-T map representing the known world and, metaphorically, the entirety of the observable universe, over which a fully developed OT is believed to have immediate control. ==Levels== ===OT I=== \\"This Solo-audited level is the first step a Clear takes toward full OT abilities, and that first step is a fresh causative OT viewpoint of the MEST universe and other beings.\\"What is Scientology compiled by the staff of Church of Scientology International. c1998 published Bridge Publications Inc. pg. 840-841 The cost to move to level OT I was $2,750 as of 2013. ===OT II=== \\"By confronting hidden areas of one's existence on the whole track [that is, by confronting past incarnations], vast amounts of energy and attention are released. Those on this Solo-audited level experience a resurgence of self-determinism and native ability. OT II unlocks the aberrative factors on the whole track that have allowed the thetan to lose his innate freedom and ability and one achieves the ability to confront the whole track.\\" The cost to move from OT I to OT II was $5,225 as of 2013. ===OT III: The Wall of Fire=== Hubbard announced discovering an important breakthrough within less than a month of founding the Sea Org, the religious order of the church that consists of its most dedicated members. He described it as a \\"means of erasing those mental factors that stand in the way of peace and toleration of mankind.\\" The new material made up the new Operating Thetan III. \\"This Solo-audited level goes through what is called the 'Wall of Fire' that surrounds a previously impenetrable whole track mystery. What prevents a being from being himself? This level answers that question. Once complete, a being is free of the whole track overwhelm that has trapped him. Here he confronts and eradicates the fourth dynamic engram that has plagued this universe for millennia.\\" The cost to move from OT II to OT III was $8,910 as of 2013. Church dogma regards OT III as a dangerous process which can lead to pneumonia, to lack of sleep or even to death if not run correctly. In Church of Scientology of California v. Kaufman, it was noted that the defendant had been required to sign a waiver to the effect that \\"the Scientology Organization, its branches and members, and L. Ron Hubbard are not responsible for anything that might happen to my body or mind on OT III\\".Church of Scientology of California v. Kaufman, [1972] F.S.R. 591 per Goff J - in the Chancery Division of the High Court Within OT III is the secret doctrine of the church. Members must be invited to \\"do it\\", and they sign a contract of secrecy. ===OT IV: OT Drug Rundown=== \\"This level handles the hidden problems and stops in a being's universe caused by the effects of drugs and poisons on the whole track. This is the final polish that rids one of any last vestige of the effects of drugs on the spirit. Ministered at Advanced Organizations or Flag. Approximately 12½ to 25 hours.\\" ===OT V: New Era Dianetics for OTs=== \\"The Second Wall of Fire consists of 26 separate rundowns and has been described as dealing with 'living lightning, the very stuff of life itself.' This level addresses the last aspects of one's case that can prevent him from achieving total freedom on all dynamics. An audited level ministered at Advanced Organizations or Flag. Approximately 50 hours.\\" ===OT VI: Hubbard Solo New Era Dianetics for OTs (Solo NOTs) Auditing Course=== \\"The training one receives before starting to solo audit on New OT VII is so powerful that it actually constitutes an entire OT level. On Solo NOTs one is dealing with complexities intended to crush one's true power and abilities as a thetan. Solo NOTs auditors acquire a wide range of auditing skills to handle the vast phenomena that can occur on OT VIII. Approximately 3–4 weeks with the new Solo Auditor Course done.\\" ===OT VII: Hubbard Solo New Era Dianetics for OTs Auditing=== \\"On New OT VII one solo audits at home daily. This is a lengthy level, requiring a considerable amount of time to complete. It is the final pre-OT level, and culminates in attainment of the state of CAUSE OVER LIFE.\\" ===OT VIII: Truth Revealed=== OT VIII, the highest level in Scientology is offered only aboard the Freewinds.https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/03/world/scientology-cruise- ship/index.html \\"This Solo-audited level addresses the primary cause of amnesia on the whole track and lets one see the truth of his own existence. This is the first actual OT level and brings about a resurgence of power and native abilities for the being himself. This may be done at the Flag Ship Service Organization.\\" ==Beyond Operating Thetan== Beyond the attainment of the state of Operating Thetan is that of Cleared Theta Clear, which Hubbard describes as such: ==Criticism== A growing number of former Scientologists have made public allegations that the church encourages its members to complete very expensive courses and expect wonderful results; when the improvements fail to happen, further courses are then promoted to facilitate the anticipated changes. Criticism stems from a pattern of cycles wherein members continue to pay increasing amounts for these courses, while some even put their families into debt chasing the elusive life-changing results under the stewardship of the church.Atack, Jon [1990] A Piece of Blue Sky, Carol Pub. Group, Chap 3, ===Legal issues and copyright=== In March 2008 WikiLeaks leaked the Church of Scientology's Operating Thetan documents.wikinews:Church of Scientology's 'Operating Thetan' documents leaked online The Church of Scientology portrayed hosting the documentation as a copyright violation implying that the collection is Church doctrine. A court found that it was legal to download, use, read, and practice these teachings outside the Church. In 1997 Zenon Panoussis, a resident of Sweden, sent copies of NOTs documents to various government authorities, thereby making the documents public according to the Swedish principle of public access to official records. The Church of Scientology responded by ordering members to continuously borrow the available copies in order to prevent non-members from reading them. The Church of Scientology also sued Panoussis for copyright infringement, since he had made the documents available online without authorization. ==See also== * Body thetan ==References== ==Further reading== * * ==External links== * * Full documents * * Summary of Operating Thetan levels 1-8 * The Fishman Affidavit Category:Scientology beliefs and practices ","title":"Operating Thetan"},{"id":"1276426","text":"Hilferding is a surname.

However, he did not learn this until he was fifty years old, in 1997, when his adoption papers were discovered. When he was nearly three, his parents divorced and he was adopted out to another family, who renamed him. When he did not answer to the name Robert, they nicknamed him Sandy. They denied his former life and always told him his early childhood memories were the product of an overly fertile imagination. As an adult, he spent several years looking for traces of his family around Europe, before finding relatives living in New Zealand. In that search, he met for the first time his 30-year-old daughter Yvonne. He was aware that he had fathered a child in London when he was 20, but he knew nothing about her. He also discovered that his birth mother had been adopted. He moved to Australia in 1970 and now lives in Fez, Morocco where he owns a house with his wife, the photographer Suzanna Clarke. He is actively involved in the Woodford Folk Festival, The Festival of Sufi Culture (in Fez) and the Festival of World Sacred Music (in Fez). He has had four children from three marriages, as well as Yvonne. McCutcheon was till late 2006 the host of a popular talkback radio program Australia Talks Back, since renamed \\"Australia Talks\\" on ABC Radio National . Australia Talks Back was the only whole-continent talkback radio program. It has also gathered listeners from around the world through the internet and Radio Australia shortwave broadcasts. It ran for an hour every weekday and attracted a wide variety of audiences, who discuss a particular topic every day, reviewing the week's topics on Friday. Since leaving the ABC he has returned to his career as a writer and public speaker. Before Radio National, McCutcheon has been a presenter on ABC's Double Jay, later Triple J, now an Australia-wide radio station. Before that he worked at radio stations in Townsville and Hobart. McCutcheon has produced many documentaries for the radio in countries around the world, including Bosnia, China, Finland, Malaysia, Mozambique, Singapore, South Africa, Sudan (North and South) and Yugoslavia. McCutcheon is a very energetic radio presenter, having been awarded Australian radio awards and recognised at the New York International Radio Festival. McCutcheon has been awarded the International Kalevala Medal for services to Finnish culture (for his work on the Kalevala). He has worked in Finland on a scholarship, and in particular, at the Finnish Broadcasting Company. McCutcheon has written 22 plays (at least) for the theatre. He won the Samuel Weisberg Playwriting Award in 1991 for the best Jewish play of the year for Night Train, as he had for a long time believed himself to be Jewish, prior to finding out the truth about his ancestral past. McCutcheon founded the Illusion Farm, based in the Tasmania mountains. It is a Buddhist centre providing care for people in need, free of charge. It has accommodated more than 3000 people during its operation. The Illusion Circus Theatre Company has also been based on the farm. ==Bibliography== McCutcheon has written a number of bestselling novels. His first, In Wolf's Clothing (1997), was the runner-up in the 1995 HarperCollins National Fiction Prize out of 400 novels. His other novels include *Peace Crimes (1998) *Poison Tree (1999) *Safe Haven (2000) *Delicate Indecencies (2002) *The Haha Man (2003) *The Cobbler's Apprentice (to be published September 2006) *Black Widow (2006) Black Widow is based on events following the September 1, 2004 terrorist attack on a Russian school in the southern town of Beslan. Other books by McCutcheon are Blik! (2002), an illustrated book for children and Quirky Questions (2000) New edition of More Quirky Questions (2005). McCutcheon has also written many short stories and poems. His memoir, The Magician's Son, published in 2005 by Penguin, is an autobiographical work. The title comes from a dream he had, long before he had discovered his true parenthood, about finding his birth father, in which he discovered a magician's trunk in an attic. When he did find out who his birth parents were, he learned that his father had in fact been an amateur magician. ==Resources and external links== *Sandy McCutcheon's Moroccan web site *Australia Talks Back *ABC Radio National Australia Talks Back Presenter -- Sandy McCutcheon *Murray Waldren's article about Sandy McCutcheon * Lily Bragge, Finding Sandy, The Sunday Age, 17 July 2005.

It ran from February 10, 1957 to September 9, 1979, with the switch to the longer title in 1961. Some papers carried the strip under the shortened title Mary Perkins. ==Characters and story== Starr's scripts mixed soap opera, adventure and broad humor, while the art was characterized by a studied line and often innovative storytelling. The strip offered a Broadway backstage drama as it followed the career of actress Mary Perkins in New York, Hollywood and on various international film sets and locations. A host of supporting characters joined Mary, including (in early September 1957) her photographer beau, Pete Fletcher. The two married on December 13, 1959. The first On Stage Sunday strip was launched February 10, 1957. That is generally considered the start date for the strip, but in 1970, comics historian Raymond Miller wrote that internal evidence in the first Sunday page suggested the strip had at least a week's worth of prior daily strips.Miller, Raymond L., \\"Information Center\\" in Rocket's Blast and the ComicCollector #70 (1970), p. 37. ==Awards== On Stage comic book published by Dell.

Slope instability issues for a temporary flood control levee in North Dakota, 2009 Earthwork in Germany Fox Glacier, New Zealand: Soil produced and transported by intense weathering and erosion. Soil mechanics is a branch of soil physics and applied mechanics that describes the behavior of soils. It differs from fluid mechanics and solid mechanics in the sense that soils consist of a heterogeneous mixture of fluids (usually air and water) and particles (usually clay, silt, sand, and gravel) but soil may also contain organic solids and other matter.Mitchell, J.K., and Soga, K. (2005) Fundamentals of soil behavior, Third edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., .Powrie, W., Spon Press, 2004, Soil Mechanics – 2nd ed A Guide to Soil Mechanics, Bolton, Malcolm, Macmillan Press, 1979. Along with rock mechanics, soil mechanics provides the theoretical basis for analysis in geotechnical engineering, a subdiscipline of civil engineering, and engineering geology, a subdiscipline of geology. Soil mechanics is used to analyze the deformations of and flow of fluids within natural and man-made structures that are supported on or made of soil, or structures that are buried in soils.Lambe, T. William & Robert V. Whitman. Soil Mechanics. Wiley, 1991; p. 29. Example applications are building and bridge foundations, retaining walls, dams, and buried pipeline systems. Principles of soil mechanics are also used in related disciplines such as geophysical engineering, coastal engineering, agricultural engineering, hydrology and soil physics. This article describes the genesis and composition of soil, the distinction between pore water pressure and inter-granular effective stress, capillary action of fluids in the soil pore spaces, soil classification, seepage and permeability, time dependent change of volume due to squeezing water out of tiny pore spaces, also known as consolidation, shear strength and stiffness of soils. The shear strength of soils is primarily derived from friction between the particles and interlocking, which are very sensitive to the effective stress. The article concludes with some examples of applications of the principles of soil mechanics such as slope stability, lateral earth pressure on retaining walls, and bearing capacity of foundations. ==Genesis and composition of soils== ===Genesis=== The primary mechanism of soil creation is the weathering of rock. All rock types (igneous rock, metamorphic rock and sedimentary rock) may be broken down into small particles to create soil. Weathering mechanisms are physical weathering, chemical weathering, and biological weathering Human activities such as excavation, blasting, and waste disposal, may also create soil. Over geologic time, deeply buried soils may be altered by pressure and temperature to become metamorphic or sedimentary rock, and if melted and solidified again, they would complete the geologic cycle by becoming igneous rock. Physical weathering includes temperature effects, freeze and thaw of water in cracks, rain, wind, impact and other mechanisms. Chemical weathering includes dissolution of matter composing a rock and precipitation in the form of another mineral. Clay minerals, for example can be formed by weathering of feldspar, which is the most common mineral present in igneous rock. The most common mineral constituent of silt and sand is quartz, also called silica, which has the chemical name silicon dioxide. The reason that feldspar is most common in rocks but silica is more prevalent in soils is that feldspar is much more soluble than silica. Silt, Sand, and Gravel are basically little pieces of broken rocks. According to the Unified Soil Classification System, silt particle sizes are in the range of 0.002 mm to 0.075 mm and sand particles have sizes in the range of 0.075 mm to 4.75 mm. Gravel particles are broken pieces of rock in the size range 4.75 mm to 100 mm. Particles larger than gravel are called cobbles and boulders. ===Transport=== Example soil horizons. a) top soil and colluvium b) mature residual soil c) young residual soil d) weathered rock. Soil deposits are affected by the mechanism of transport and deposition to their location. Soils that are not transported are called residual soils—they exist at the same location as the rock from which they were generated. Decomposed granite is a common example of a residual soil. The common mechanisms of transport are the actions of gravity, ice, water, and wind. Wind blown soils include dune sands and loess. Water carries particles of different size depending on the speed of the water, thus soils transported by water are graded according to their size. Silt and clay may settle out in a lake, and gravel and sand collect at the bottom of a river bed. Wind blown soil deposits (aeolian soils) also tend to be sorted according to their grain size. Erosion at the base of glaciers is powerful enough to pick up large rocks and boulders as well as soil; soils dropped by melting ice can be a well graded mixture of widely varying particle sizes. Gravity on its own may also carry particles down from the top of a mountain to make a pile of soil and boulders at the base; soil deposits transported by gravity are called colluvium. The mechanism of transport also has a major effect on the particle shape. For example, low velocity grinding in a river bed will produce rounded particles. Freshly fractured colluvium particles often have a very angular shape. ===Soil composition=== ====Soil mineralogy==== Silts, sands and gravels are classified by their size, and hence they may consist of a variety of minerals. Owing to the stability of quartz compared to other rock minerals, quartz is the most common constituent of sand and silt. Mica, and feldspar are other common minerals present in sands and silts. The mineral constituents of gravel may be more similar to that of the parent rock. The common clay minerals are montmorillonite or smectite, illite, and kaolinite or kaolin. These minerals tend to form in sheet or plate like structures, with length typically ranging between 10−7 m and 4x10−6 m and thickness typically ranging between 10−9 m and 2x10−6 m, and they have a relatively large specific surface area. The specific surface area (SSA) is defined as the ratio of the surface area of particles to the mass of the particles. Clay minerals typically have specific surface areas in the range of 10 to 1,000 square meters per gram of solid. Due to the large surface area available for chemical, electrostatic, and van der Waals interaction, the mechanical behavior of clay minerals is very sensitive to the amount of pore fluid available and the type and amount of dissolved ions in the pore fluid. To anticipate the effect of clay on the way a soil will behave, it is necessary to know the kinds of clays as well as the amount present. As home builders and highway engineers know all too well, soils containing certain high-activity clays make very unstable material on which to build because they swell when wet and shrink when dry. This shrink- and-swell action can easily crack foundations and cause retaining walls to collapse. These clays also become extremely sticky and difficult to work with when they are wet. In contrast, low-activity clays, formed under different conditions, can be very stable and easy to work with. The minerals of soils are predominantly formed by atoms of oxygen, silicon, hydrogen, and aluminum, organized in various crystalline forms. These elements along with calcium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and carbon constitute over 99 per cent of the solid mass of soils. ====Grain size distribution==== Soils consist of a mixture of particles of different size, shape and mineralogy. Because the size of the particles obviously has a significant effect on the soil behavior, the grain size and grain size distribution are used to classify soils. The grain size distribution describes the relative proportions of particles of various sizes. The grain size is often visualized in a cumulative distribution graph which, for example, plots the percentage of particles finer than a given size as a function of size. The median grain size, D_{50} , is the size for which 50% of the particle mass consists of finer particles. Soil behavior, especially the hydraulic conductivity, tends to be dominated by the smaller particles, hence, the term \\"effective size\\", denoted by D_{10} , is defined as the size for which 10% of the particle mass consists of finer particles. Sands and gravels that possess a wide range of particle sizes with a smooth distribution of particle sizes are called well graded soils. If the soil particles in a sample are predominantly in a relatively narrow range of sizes, the sample is uniformly graded. If a soil sample has distinct gaps in the gradation curve, e.g., a mixture of gravel and fine sand, with no coarse sand, the sample may be gap graded. Uniformly graded and gap graded soils are both considered to be poorly graded. There are many methods for measuring particle- size distribution. The two traditional methods are sieve analysis and hydrometer analysis.  Sieve analysis  Sieve The size distribution of gravel and sand particles are typically measured using sieve analysis. The formal procedure is described in ASTM D6913-04(2009).ASTM Standard Test Methods of Particle-Size Distribution (Gradation) of Soils using Sieve Analysis. http://www.astm.org/Standards/D6913.htm A stack of sieves with accurately dimensioned holes between a mesh of wires is used to separate the particles into size bins. A known volume of dried soil, with clods broken down to individual particles, is put into the top of a stack of sieves arranged from coarse to fine. The stack of sieves is shaken for a standard period of time so that the particles are sorted into size bins. This method works reasonably well for particles in the sand and gravel size range. Fine particles tend to stick to each other, and hence the sieving process is not an effective method. If there are a lot of fines (silt and clay) present in the soil it may be necessary to run water through the sieves to wash the coarse particles and clods through. A variety of sieve sizes are available. The boundary between sand and silt is arbitrary. According to the Unified Soil Classification System, a #4 sieve (4 openings per inch) having 4.75mm opening size separates sand from gravel and a #200 sieve with an 0.075 mm opening separates sand from silt and clay. According to the British standard, 0.063 mm is the boundary between sand and silt, and 2 mm is the boundary between sand and gravel. Hydrometer analysis The classification of fine-grained soils, i.e., soils that are finer than sand, is determined primarily by their Atterberg limits, not by their grain size. If it is important to determine the grain size distribution of fine-grained soils, the hydrometer test may be performed. In the hydrometer tests, the soil particles are mixed with water and shaken to produce a dilute suspension in a glass cylinder, and then the cylinder is left to sit. A hydrometer is used to measure the density of the suspension as a function of time. Clay particles may take several hours to settle past the depth of measurement of the hydrometer. Sand particles may take less than a second. Stoke's law provides the theoretical basis to calculate the relationship between sedimentation velocity and particle size. ASTM provides the detailed procedures for performing the Hydrometer test. Clay particles can be sufficiently small that they never settle because they are kept in suspension by Brownian motion, in which case they may be classified as colloids. ====Mass-volume relations==== A phase diagram of soil indicating the masses and volumes of air, solid, water, and voids. There are a variety of parameters used to describe the relative proportions of air, water and solid in a soil. This section defines these parameters and some of their interrelationships. The basic notation is as follows: V_a, V_w, and V_s represent the volumes of air, water and solids in a soil mixture; W_a, W_w, and W_s represent the weights of air, water and solids in a soil mixture; M_a, M_w, and M_s represent the masses of air, water and solids in a soil mixture; \\\\rho_a, \\\\rho_w, and \\\\rho_s represent the densities of the constituents (air, water and solids) in a soil mixture; Note that the weights, W, can be obtained by multiplying the mass, M, by the acceleration due to gravity, g; e.g., W_s = M_s g Specific Gravity is the ratio of the density of one material compared to the density of pure water (\\\\rho_w = 1 g/cm^3). Specific gravity of solids, G_s = \\\\frac{\\\\rho_s} {\\\\rho_w} Note that specific weight, conventionally denoted by the symbol \\\\gamma may be obtained by multiplying the density ( \\\\rho ) of a material by the acceleration due to gravity, g. Density, Bulk Density, or Wet Density, \\\\rho, are different names for the density of the mixture, i.e., the total mass of air, water, solids divided by the total volume of air water and solids (the mass of air is assumed to be zero for practical purposes): :\\\\rho = \\\\frac{M_s + M_w}{V_s + V_w + V_a}= \\\\frac{M_t}{V_t} Dry Density, \\\\rho _d, is the mass of solids divided by the total volume of air water and solids: :\\\\rho_d = \\\\frac{M_s}{V_s + V_w + V_a}= \\\\frac{M_s}{V_t} Buoyant Density, \\\\rho ', defined as the density of the mixture minus the density of water is useful if the soil is submerged under water: :\\\\rho ' = \\\\rho\\\\ - \\\\rho _w where \\\\rho _w is the density of water Water Content, w is the ratio of mass of water to mass of solid. It is easily measured by weighing a sample of the soil, drying it out in an oven and re-weighing. Standard procedures are described by ASTM. :w = \\\\frac{M_w}{M_s} = \\\\frac{W_w}{W_s} Void ratio, e, is the ratio of the volume of voids to the volume of solids: :e = \\\\frac{V_v}{V_s} = \\\\frac{V_v}{V_T - V_V} = \\\\frac{n}{1 - n} Porosity, n, is the ratio of volume of voids to the total volume, and is related to the void ratio: :n = \\\\frac{V_v}{V_t} = \\\\frac{V_v}{V_s + V_v}= \\\\frac{e}{1 + e} Degree of saturation, S, is the ratio of the volume of water to the volume of voids: :S = \\\\frac{V_w}{V_v} From the above definitions, some useful relationships can be derived by use of basic algebra. :\\\\rho = \\\\frac{(G_s+Se)\\\\rho_w}{1+e} :\\\\rho = \\\\frac{(1+w)G_s\\\\rho_w}{1+e} :w = \\\\frac{S e}{G_s} ==Soil classification== Geotechnical engineers classify the soil particle types by performing tests on disturbed (dried, passed through sieves, and remolded) samples of the soil. This provides information about the characteristics of the soil grains themselves. Classification of the types of grains present in a soil does not account for important effects of the structure or fabric of the soil, terms that describe compactness of the particles and patterns in the arrangement of particles in a load carrying framework as well as the pore size and pore fluid distributions. Engineering geologists also classify soils based on their genesis and depositional history. ===Classification of soil grains=== In the US and other countries, the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) is often used for soil classification. Other classification systems include the British Standard BS 5930 and the AASHTO soil classification system. ====Classification of sands and gravels==== In the USCS, gravels (given the symbol G) and sands (given the symbol S) are classified according to their grain size distribution. For the USCS, gravels may be given the classification symbol GW (well-graded gravel), GP (poorly graded gravel), GM (gravel with a large amount of silt), or GC (gravel with a large amount of clay). Likewise sands may be classified as being SW, SP, SM or SC. Sands and gravels with a small but non-negligible amount of fines (5–12%) may be given a dual classification such as SW-SC. ====Atterberg limits==== Clays and Silts, often called 'fine-grained soils', are classified according to their Atterberg limits; the most commonly used Atterberg limits are the Liquid Limit (denoted by LL or w_l), Plastic Limit (denoted by PL or w_p), and Shrinkage Limit (denoted by SL). The Liquid Limit is the water content at which the soil behavior transitions from a plastic solid to a liquid. The Plastic Limit is the water content at which the soil behavior transitions from that of a plastic solid to a brittle solid. The Shrinkage Limit corresponds to a water content below which the soil will not shrink as it dries. The consistency of fine grained soil varies in proportional to the water content in a soil. As the transitions from one state to another are gradual, the tests have adopted arbitrary definitions to determine the boundaries of the states. The liquid limit is determined by measuring the water content for which a groove closes after 25 blows in a standard test. Alternatively, a fall cone test apparatus may be used to measure the liquid limit. The undrained shear strength of remolded soil at the liquid limit is approximately 2 kPa.Wood, David Muir, Soil Behavior and Critical State Soil Mechanics, Cambridge University Press, 1990, The Plastic Limit is the water content below which it is not possible to roll by hand the soil into 3 mm diameter cylinders. The soil cracks or breaks up as it is rolled down to this diameter. Remolded soil at the plastic limit is quite stiff, having an undrained shear strength of the order of about 200 kPa. The Plasticity Index of a particular soil specimen is defined as the difference between the Liquid Limit and the Plastic Limit of the specimen; it is an indicator of how much water the soil particles in the specimen can absorb, and correlates with many engineering properties like permeability, compressibility, shear strength and others. Generally, the clay having high plasticity have lower permeability and also they are also difficult to be compacted. ====Classification of silts and clays==== According to the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS), silts and clays are classified by plotting the values of their plasticity index and liquid limit on a plasticity chart. The A-Line on the chart separates clays (given the USCS symbol C) from silts (given the symbol M). LL=50% separates high plasticity soils (given the modifier symbol H) from low plasticity soils (given the modifier symbol L). A soil that plots above the A-line and has LL>50% would, for example, be classified as CH. Other possible classifications of silts and clays are ML, CL and MH. If the Atterberg limits plot in the\\"hatched\\" region on the graph near the origin, the soils are given the dual classification 'CL-ML'. ===Indices related to soil strength=== ====Liquidity index==== The effects of the water content on the strength of saturated remolded soils can be quantified by the use of the liquidity index, LI: : LI = \\\\frac{w-PL}{LL-PL} When the LI is 1, remolded soil is at the liquid limit and it has an undrained shear strength of about 2 kPa. When the soil is at the plastic limit, the LI is 0 and the undrained shear strength is about 200 kPa.Disturbed soil properties and geotechnical design, Schofield, Andrew N., Thomas Telford, 2006. ====Relative density==== The density of sands (cohesionless soils) is often characterized by the relative density, D_r : D_r= \\\\frac{e_{max} - e}{e_{max} - e_{min}} 100\\\\% where: e_{max} is the \\"maximum void ratio\\" corresponding to a very loose state, e_{min} is the \\"minimum void ratio\\" corresponding to a very dense state and e is the in situ void ratio. Methods used to calculate relative density are defined in ASTM D4254-00(2006).ASTM Standard Test Methods for Minimum Index Density and Unit Weight of Soils and Calculation of Relative Density. http://www.astm.org/Standards/D4254.htm Thus if D_r = 100\\\\% the sand or gravel is very dense, and if D_r = 0\\\\% the soil is extremely loose and unstable. ==Seepage: steady state flow of water== A cross section showing the water table varying with surface topography as well as a perched water table If fluid pressures in a soil deposit are uniformly increasing with depth according to u = \\\\rho_w g z_w then hydrostatic conditions will prevail and the fluids will not be flowing through the soil. z_w is the depth below the water table. However, if the water table is sloping or there is a perched water table as indicated in the accompanying sketch, then seepage will occur. For steady state seepage, the seepage velocities are not varying with time. If the water tables are changing levels with time, or if the soil is in the process of consolidation, then steady state conditions do not apply. ===Darcy's law=== Diagram showing definitions and directions for Darcy's law Darcy's law states that the volume of flow of the pore fluid through a porous medium per unit time is proportional to the rate of change of excess fluid pressure with distance. The constant of proportionality includes the viscosity of the fluid and the intrinsic permeability of the soil. For the simple case of a horizontal tube filled with soil :Q=\\\\frac{-K A}{\\\\mu}\\\\frac{(u_b-u_a)}{L} The total discharge, Q (having units of volume per time, e.g., ft³/s or m³/s), is proportional to the intrinsic permeability, K, the cross sectional area, A, and rate of pore pressure change with distance, \\\\frac{u_b-u_a}{L}, and inversely proportional to the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, \\\\mu. The negative sign is needed because fluids flow from high pressure to low pressure. So if the change in pressure is negative (in the x-direction) then the flow will be positive (in the x-direction). The above equation works well for a horizontal tube, but if the tube was inclined so that point b was a different elevation than point a, the equation would not work. The effect of elevation is accounted for by replacing the pore pressure by excess pore pressure, u_e defined as: u_e = u - \\\\rho_w g z where z is the depth measured from an arbitrary elevation reference (datum). Replacing u by u_e we obtain a more general equation for flow: :Q=\\\\frac{-K A}{\\\\mu}\\\\frac{(u_{e,b}-u_{e,a})}{L} Dividing both sides of the equation by A, and expressing the rate of change of excess pore pressure as a derivative, we obtain a more general equation for the apparent velocity in the x-direction: :v_x=\\\\frac{-K }{\\\\mu}\\\\frac{d u_e}{d x} where v_x = Q/A has units of velocity and is called the Darcy velocity (or the specific discharge, filtration velocity, or superficial velocity). The pore or interstitial velocity v_{px} is the average velocity of fluid molecules in the pores; it is related to the Darcy velocity and the porosity n through the Dupuit-Forchheimer relationship :v_{px}=\\\\frac{v_x}{n} (Some authors use the term seepage velocity to mean the Darcy velocity,Smith, I. (2013) Smith's Elements of Soil MechanicsSmith's elements of soil mechanics, 8th edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., while others use it to mean the pore velocity.Delleur, Jacques W. (2007) The handbook of groundwater engineering, Taylor & Francis, ) Civil engineers predominantly work on problems that involve water and predominantly work on problems on earth (in earth's gravity). For this class of problems, civil engineers will often write Darcy's law in a much simpler form: :v = k i where k is the hydraulic conductivity, defined as k = \\\\frac {K \\\\rho_w g} {\\\\mu_w}, and i is the hydraulic gradient. The hydraulic gradient is the rate of change of total head with distance. The total head, h at a point is defined as the height (measured relative to the datum) to which water would rise in a piezometer at that point. The total head is related to the excess water pressure by: :u_e = \\\\rho_w g h + Constant and the Constant is zero if the datum for head measurement is chosen at the same elevation as the origin for the depth, z used to calculate u_e . ===Typical values of hydraulic conductivity=== Values of hydraulic conductivity, k, can vary by many orders of magnitude depending on the soil type. Clays may have hydraulic conductivity as small as about 10^{-12}\\\\frac{m}{s}, gravels may have hydraulic conductivity up to about 10^{-1}\\\\frac{m}{s}. Layering and heterogeneity and disturbance during the sampling and testing process make the accurate measurement of soil hydraulic conductivity a very difficult problem. ===Flownets=== A plan flow net to estimate flow of water from a stream to a discharging well Darcy's Law applies in one, two or three dimensions. In two or three dimensions, steady state seepage is described by Laplace's equation. Computer programs are available to solve this equation. But traditionally two- dimensional seepage problems were solved using a graphical procedure known as flownet.Cedergren, Harry R. (1977), Seepage, Drainage, and Flow Nets, Wiley. One set of lines in the flownet are in the direction of the water flow (flow lines), and the other set of lines are in the direction of constant total head (equipotential lines). Flownets may be used to estimate the quantity of seepage under dams and sheet piling. ===Seepage forces and erosion=== When the seepage velocity is great enough, erosion can occur because of the frictional drag exerted on the soil particles. Vertically upwards seepage is a source of danger on the downstream side of sheet piling and beneath the toe of a dam or levee. Erosion of the soil, known as \\"soil piping\\", can lead to failure of the structure and to sinkhole formation. Seeping water removes soil, starting from the exit point of the seepage, and erosion advances upgradient. The term \\"sand boil\\" is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe. ===Seepage pressures=== Seepage in an upward direction reduces the effective stress within the soil. When the water pressure at a point in the soil is equal to the total vertical stress at that point, the effective stress is zero and the soil has no frictional resistance to deformation. For a surface layer, the vertical effective stress becomes zero within the layer when the upward hydraulic gradient is equal to the critical gradient. At zero effective stress soil has very little strength and layers of relatively impermeable soil may heave up due to the underlying water pressures. The loss in strength due to upward seepage is a common contributor to levee failures. The condition of zero effective stress associated with upward seepage is also called liquefaction, quicksand, or a boiling condition. Quicksand was so named because the soil particles move around and appear to be 'alive' (the biblical meaning of 'quick' – as opposed to 'dead'). (Note that it is not possible to be 'sucked down' into quicksand. On the contrary, you would float with about half your body out of the water.)Terzaghi, K., Peck, R.B., and Mesri, G. 1996. Soil Mechanics in Engineering Practice. Third Edition, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Article 18, page 135. ==Effective stress and capillarity: hydrostatic conditions== Spheres immersed in water, reducing effective stress. To understand the mechanics of soils it is necessary to understand how normal stresses and shear stresses are shared by the different phases. Neither gas nor liquid provide significant resistance to shear stress. The shear resistance of soil is provided by friction and interlocking of the particles. The friction depends on the intergranular contact stresses between solid particles. The normal stresses, on the other hand, are shared by the fluid and the particles. Although the pore air is relatively compressible, and hence takes little normal stress in most geotechnical problems, liquid water is relatively incompressible and if the voids are saturated with water, the pore water must be squeezed out in order to pack the particles closer together. The principle of effective stress, introduced by Karl Terzaghi, states that the effective stress σ' (i.e., the average intergranular stress between solid particles) may be calculated by a simple subtraction of the pore pressure from the total stress: :\\\\sigma' = \\\\sigma - u\\\\, where σ is the total stress and u is the pore pressure. It is not practical to measure σ' directly, so in practice the vertical effective stress is calculated from the pore pressure and vertical total stress. The distinction between the terms pressure and stress is also important. By definition, pressure at a point is equal in all directions but stresses at a point can be different in different directions. In soil mechanics, compressive stresses and pressures are considered to be positive and tensile stresses are considered to be negative, which is different from the solid mechanics sign convention for stress. ===Total stress=== For level ground conditions, the total vertical stress at a point, \\\\sigma_v, on average, is the weight of everything above that point per unit area. The vertical stress beneath a uniform surface layer with density \\\\rho, and thickness H is for example: :\\\\sigma_v = \\\\rho g H = \\\\gamma H where g is the acceleration due to gravity, and \\\\gamma is the unit weight of the overlying layer. If there are multiple layers of soil or water above the point of interest, the vertical stress may be calculated by summing the product of the unit weight and thickness of all of the overlying layers. Total stress increases with increasing depth in proportion to the density of the overlying soil. It is not possible to calculate the horizontal total stress in this way. Lateral earth pressures are addressed elsewhere. ===Pore water pressure=== ====Hydrostatic conditions==== Water is drawn into a small tube by surface tension. Water pressure, u, is negative above and positive below the free water surfaceIf there is no pore water flow occurring in the soil, the pore water pressures will be hydrostatic. The water table is located at the depth where the water pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure. For hydrostatic conditions, the water pressure increases linearly with depth below the water table: :u = \\\\rho_w g z_w where \\\\rho_w is the density of water, and z_w is the depth below the water table. ====Capillary action==== Due to surface tension, water will rise up in a small capillary tube above a free surface of water. Likewise, water will rise up above the water table into the small pore spaces around the soil particles. In fact the soil may be completely saturated for some distance above the water table. Above the height of capillary saturation, the soil may be wet but the water content will decrease with elevation. If the water in the capillary zone is not moving, the water pressure obeys the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium, u = \\\\rho_w g z_w , but note that z_w , is negative above the water table. Hence, hydrostatic water pressures are negative above the water table. The thickness of the zone of capillary saturation depends on the pore size, but typically, the heights vary between a centimeter or so for coarse sand to tens of meters for a silt or clay. In fact the pore space of soil is a uniform fractal e.g. a set of uniformly distributed D-dimensional fractals of average linear size L. For the clay soil it has been found that L=0.15 mm and D=2.7. The surface tension of water explains why the water does not drain out of a wet sand castle or a moist ball of clay. Negative water pressures make the water stick to the particles and pull the particles to each other, friction at the particle contacts make a sand castle stable. But as soon as a wet sand castle is submerged below a free water surface, the negative pressures are lost and the castle collapses. Considering the effective stress equation, \\\\sigma' = \\\\sigma - u,, if the water pressure is negative, the effective stress may be positive, even on a free surface (a surface where the total normal stress is zero). The negative pore pressure pulls the particles together and causes compressive particle to particle contact forces. Negative pore pressures in clayey soil can be much more powerful than those in sand. Negative pore pressures explain why clay soils shrink when they dry and swell as they are wetted. The swelling and shrinkage can cause major distress, especially to light structures and roads.Holtz, R.D, and Kovacs, W.D., 1981. An Introduction to Geotechnical Engineering. Prentice-Hall, Inc. page 448 Later sections of this article address the pore water pressures for seepage and consolidation problems. File:WetParticles.jpgWater at particle contacts File:WetParticlesFBD.jpgintergranular contact force due to surface tension File:Drymud-IMG 2920.JPGShrinkage caused by drying ==Consolidation: transient flow of water== center Consolidation is a process by which soils decrease in volume. It occurs when stress is applied to a soil that causes the soil particles to pack together more tightly, therefore reducing volume. When this occurs in a soil that is saturated with water, water will be squeezed out of the soil. The time required to squeeze the water out of a thick deposit of clayey soil layer might be years. For a layer of sand, the water may be squeezed out in a matter of seconds. A building foundation or construction of a new embankment will cause the soil below to consolidate and this will cause settlement which in turn may cause distress to the building or embankment. Karl Terzaghi developed the theory of consolidation which enables prediction of the amount of settlement and the time required for the settlement to occur.Terzaghi, K., 1943, Theoretical Soil Mechanics, John Wiley and Sons, New York Soils are tested with an oedometer test to determine their compression index and coefficient of consolidation. When stress is removed from a consolidated soil, the soil will rebound, drawing water back into the pores and regaining some of the volume it had lost in the consolidation process. If the stress is reapplied, the soil will re-consolidate again along a recompression curve, defined by the recompression index. Soil that has been consolidated to a large pressure and has been subsequently unloaded is considered to be overconsolidated. The maximum past vertical effective stress is termed the preconsolidation stress. A soil which is currently experiencing the maximum past vertical effective stress is said to be normally consolidated. The overconsolidation ratio, (OCR) is the ratio of the maximum past vertical effective stress to the current vertical effective stress. The OCR is significant for two reasons: firstly, because the compressibility of normally consolidated soil is significantly larger than that for overconsolidated soil, and secondly, the shear behavior and dilatancy of clayey soil are related to the OCR through critical state soil mechanics; highly overconsolidated clayey soils are dilatant, while normally consolidated soils tend to be contractive. ==Shear behavior: stiffness and strength== Typical stress strain curve for a drained dilatant soil The shear strength and stiffness of soil determines whether or not soil will be stable or how much it will deform. Knowledge of the strength is necessary to determine if a slope will be stable, if a building or bridge might settle too far into the ground, and the limiting pressures on a retaining wall. It is important to distinguish between failure of a soil element and the failure of a geotechnical structure (e.g., a building foundation, slope or retaining wall); some soil elements may reach their peak strength prior to failure of the structure. Different criteria can be used to define the \\"shear strength\\" and the \\"yield point\\" for a soil element from a stress–strain curve. One may define the peak shear strength as the peak of a stress–strain curve, or the shear strength at critical state as the value after large strains when the shear resistance levels off. If the stress–strain curve does not stabilize before the end of shear strength test, the \\"strength\\" is sometimes considered to be the shear resistance at 15–20% strain. The shear strength of soil depends on many factors including the effective stress and the void ratio. The shear stiffness is important, for example, for evaluation of the magnitude of deformations of foundations and slopes prior to failure and because it is related to the shear wave velocity. The slope of the initial, nearly linear, portion of a plot of shear stress as a function of shear strain is called the shear modulus ===Friction, interlocking and dilation=== Angle of repose Soil is an assemblage of particles that have little to no cementation while rock (such as sandstone) may consist of an assembly of particles that are strongly cemented together by chemical bonds. The shear strength of soil is primarily due to interparticle friction and therefore, the shear resistance on a plane is approximately proportional to the effective normal stress on that plane. The angle of internal friction is thus closely related to the maximum stable slope angle, often called the angle of repose. But in addition to friction, soil derives significant shear resistance from interlocking of grains. If the grains are densely packed, the grains tend to spread apart from each other as they are subject to shear strain. The expansion of the particle matrix due to shearing was called dilatancy by Osborne Reynolds. If one considers the energy required to shear an assembly of particles there is energy input by the shear force, T, moving a distance, x and there is also energy input by the normal force, N, as the sample expands a distance, y. Due to the extra energy required for the particles to dilate against the confining pressures, dilatant soils have a greater peak strength than contractive soils. Furthermore, as dilative soil grains dilate, they become looser (their void ratio increases), and their rate of dilation decreases until they reach a critical void ratio. Contractive soils become denser as they shear, and their rate of contraction decreases until they reach a critical void ratio. A critical state line separates the dilatant and contractive states for soil The tendency for a soil to dilate or contract depends primarily on the confining pressure and the void ratio of the soil. The rate of dilation is high if the confining pressure is small and the void ratio is small. The rate of contraction is high if the confining pressure is large and the void ratio is large. As a first approximation, the regions of contraction and dilation are separated by the critical state line. ===Failure criteria=== After a soil reaches the critical state, it is no longer contracting or dilating and the shear stress on the failure plane \\\\tau_{crit} is determined by the effective normal stress on the failure plane \\\\sigma_n ' and critical state friction angle \\\\phi_{crit} '\\\\ : : \\\\tau_{crit} = \\\\sigma_n ' \\\\tan \\\\phi_{crit} '\\\\ The peak strength of the soil may be greater, however, due to the interlocking (dilatancy) contribution. This may be stated: : \\\\tau_{peak} = \\\\sigma_n ' \\\\tan \\\\phi_{peak} '\\\\ Where \\\\phi_{peak}' > \\\\phi_{crit}' . However, use of a friction angle greater than the critical state value for design requires care. The peak strength will not be mobilized everywhere at the same time in a practical problem such as a foundation, slope or retaining wall. The critical state friction angle is not nearly as variable as the peak friction angle and hence it can be relied upon with confidence. Not recognizing the significance of dilatancy, Coulomb proposed that the shear strength of soil may be expressed as a combination of adhesion and friction components: : \\\\tau_f = c' + \\\\sigma_f ' \\\\tan \\\\phi '\\\\, It is now known that the c ' and \\\\phi' parameters in the last equation are not fundamental soil properties.Terzaghi, K., Peck, R.B., Mesri, G. (1996) Soil mechanics in Engineering Practice, Third Edition, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., In particular, c ' and \\\\phi ' are different depending on the magnitude of effective stress. According to Schofield (2006), the longstanding use of c' in practice has led many engineers to wrongly believe that c' is a fundamental parameter. This assumption that c ' and \\\\phi ' are constant can lead to overestimation of peak strengths. ===Structure, fabric, and chemistry=== In addition to the friction and interlocking (dilatancy) components of strength, the structure and fabric also play a significant role in the soil behavior. The structure and fabric include factors such as the spacing and arrangement of the solid particles or the amount and spatial distribution of pore water; in some cases cementitious material accumulates at particle-particle contacts. Mechanical behavior of soil is affected by the density of the particles and their structure or arrangement of the particles as well as the amount and spatial distribution of fluids present (e.g., water and air voids). Other factors include the electrical charge of the particles, chemistry of pore water, chemical bonds (i.e. cementation -particles connected through a solid substance such as recrystallized calcium carbonate) ===Drained and undrained shear=== Moist sand along the shoreline is originally densely packed by the draining water. Foot pressure on the sand causes it to dilate (see: Reynolds dilatancy), drawing water from the surface into the pores. The presence of nearly incompressible fluids such as water in the pore spaces affects the ability for the pores to dilate or contract. If the pores are saturated with water, water must be sucked into the dilating pore spaces to fill the expanding pores (this phenomenon is visible at the beach when apparently dry spots form around feet that press into the wet sand). Similarly, for contractive soil, water must be squeezed out of the pore spaces to allow contraction to take place. Dilation of the voids causes negative water pressures that draw fluid into the pores, and contraction of the voids causes positive pore pressures to push the water out of the pores. If the rate of shearing is very large compared to the rate that water can be sucked into or squeezed out of the dilating or contracting pore spaces, then the shearing is called undrained shear, if the shearing is slow enough that the water pressures are negligible, the shearing is called drained shear. During undrained shear, the water pressure u changes depending on volume change tendencies. From the effective stress equation, the change in u directly effects the effective stress by the equation: :\\\\sigma' = \\\\sigma - u\\\\, and the strength is very sensitive to the effective stress. It follows then that the undrained shear strength of a soil may be smaller or larger than the drained shear strength depending upon whether the soil is contractive or dilative. ===Shear tests=== Strength parameters can be measured in the laboratory using direct shear test, triaxial shear test, simple shear test, fall cone test and (hand) shear vane test; there are numerous other devices and variations on these devices used in practice today. Tests conducted to characterize the strength and stiffness of the soils in the ground include the Cone penetration test and the Standard penetration test. ===Other factors=== The stress–strain relationship of soils, and therefore the shearing strength, is affected by:Poulos, S. J. 1989. Advance Dam Engineering for Design, Construction, and Rehabilitation: Liquefaction Related Phenomena. Ed. Jansen, R.B, Van Nostrand Reinhold, pages 292–297. # soil composition (basic soil material): mineralogy, grain size and grain size distribution, shape of particles, pore fluid type and content, ions on grain and in pore fluid. # state (initial): Define by the initial void ratio, effective normal stress and shear stress (stress history). State can be describe by terms such as: loose, dense, overconsolidated, normally consolidated, stiff, soft, contractive, dilative, etc. # structure: Refers to the arrangement of particles within the soil mass; the manner in which the particles are packed or distributed. Features such as layers, joints, fissures, slickensides, voids, pockets, cementation, etc., are part of the structure. Structure of soils is described by terms such as: undisturbed, disturbed, remolded, compacted, cemented; flocculent, honey-combed, single- grained; flocculated, deflocculated; stratified, layered, laminated; isotropic and anisotropic. # Loading conditions: Effective stress path -drained, undrained, and type of loading -magnitude, rate (static, dynamic), and time history (monotonic, cyclic). ==Applications== ===Lateral earth pressure=== Lateral earth stress theory is used to estimate the amount of stress soil can exert perpendicular to gravity. This is the stress exerted on retaining walls. A lateral earth stress coefficient, K, is defined as the ratio of lateral (horizontal) effective stress to vertical effective stress for cohesionless soils (K=σ'h/σ'v). There are three coefficients: at-rest, active, and passive. At-rest stress is the lateral stress in the ground before any disturbance takes place. The active stress state is reached when a wall moves away from the soil under the influence of lateral stress, and results from shear failure due to reduction of lateral stress. The passive stress state is reached when a wall is pushed into the soil far enough to cause shear failure within the mass due to increase of lateral stress. There are many theories for estimating lateral earth stress; some are empirically based, and some are analytically derived. ===Bearing capacity=== The bearing capacity of soil is the average contact stress between a foundation and the soil which will cause shear failure in the soil. Allowable bearing stress is the bearing capacity divided by a factor of safety. Sometimes, on soft soil sites, large settlements may occur under loaded foundations without actual shear failure occurring; in such cases, the allowable bearing stress is determined with regard to the maximum allowable settlement. It is important during construction and design stage of a project to evaluate the subgrade strength. The California Bearing Ratio (CBR) test is commonly used to determine the suitability of a soil as a subgrade for design and construction. The field Plate Load Test is commonly used to predict the deformations and failure characteristics of the soil/subgrade and modulus of subgrade reaction (ks). The Modulus of subgrade reaction (ks) is used in foundation design, soil-structure interaction studies and design of highway pavements. ===Slope stability=== Simple slope slip section The field of slope stability encompasses the analysis of static and dynamic stability of slopes of earth and rock-fill dams, slopes of other types of embankments, excavated slopes, and natural slopes in soil and soft rock. As seen to the right, earthen slopes can develop a cut-spherical weakness zone. The probability of this happening can be calculated in advance using a simple 2-D circular analysis package... A primary difficulty with analysis is locating the most-probable slip plane for any given situation. Many landslides have been analyzed only after the fact. ==Recent developments== A recent finding in soil mechanics is that soil deformation can be described as the behavior of a dynamical system. This approach to soil mechanics is referred to as Dynamical Systems based Soil Mechanics (DSSM). DSSM holds simply that soil deformation is a Poisson process in which particles move to their final position at random shear strains. The basis of DSSM is that soils (including sands) can be sheared till they reach a steady-state condition at which, under conditions of constant strain-rate, there is no change in shear stress, effective confining stress, and void ratio. The steady-state was formally defined by Steve J. Poulos an associate professor at the Soil Mechanics Department of Harvard University, who built off a hypothesis that Arthur Casagrande was formulating towards the end of his career. The steady state condition is not the same as the \\"critical state\\" condition. It differs from the critical state in that it specifies a statistically constant structure at the steady state. The steady-state values are also very slightly dependent on the strain-rate. Many systems in nature reach steady-states and dynamical systems theory is used to describe such systems. Soil shear can also be described as a dynamical system. The physical basis of the soil shear dynamical system is a Poisson process in which particles move to the steady- state at random shear strains. Joseph generalized this—particles move to their final position (not just steady-state) at random shear-strains. Because of its origins in the steady state concept DSSM is sometimes informally called \\"Harvard soil mechanics.\\" DSSM provides for very close fits to stress–strain curves, including for sands. Because it tracks conditions on the failure plane, it also provides close fits for the post failure region of sensitive clays and silts something that other theories are not able to do. Additionally DSSM explains key relationships in soil mechanics that to date have simply been taken for granted, for example, why normalized undrained peak shear strengths vary with the log of the over consolidation ratio and why stress–strain curves normalize with the initial effective confining stress; and why in one-dimensional consolidation the void ratio must vary with the log of the effective vertical stress, why the end-of-primary curve is unique for static load increments, and why the ratio of the creep value Cα to the compression index Cc must be approximately constant for a wide range of soils. ==See also== * Critical state soil mechanics * Earthquake engineering * Engineering geology * Geotechnical centrifuge modeling * Geotechnical engineering * Geotechnical engineering (Offshore) * Geotechnics * Hydrogeology, aquifer characteristics closely related to soil characteristics * International Society for Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering * Rock mechanics * Slope stability analysis ==References== ","title":"Soil mechanics"},{"id":"1276439","text":"* Bono people, an Akan ethnic group of Ghana and Ivory Coast * Bono dialect, spoken by them * Bono state, an Akan state that existed from the 11th to the 18th century in what is now the Brong-Ahafo(Bono, Bono East and Ahafo) region of Ghana * Bono (born 1960) is an Irish musician, activist, and lead singer for the band U2.

The locomotive’s number was derived from its works number, DEL260. ==Specification== Lion was a private venture to meet a requirement from British Railways for a powerful locomotive of Co-Co wheel arrangement, as a substitute for the earlier 1Co-Co1 locomotives such as the Peak classes. The specifications were revealed by the British Transport Commission (BTC) at a meeting on 15 January 1960. Train heating was to be by both steam and electric train heating (ETH). Unlike the earlier Pilot Scheme, the BTC expected that these prototypes would be funded by the makers, rather than bulk orders being placed sight-unseen. For the Type 4, that gave rise to three prototypes: Falcon, DP2 and Lion, eventually leading to the Class 47 and Class 50. Lion used a more powerful development of the same engine as the Class 44 Peaks, but lighter overall and with a more reliable bogie design. It was of Co-Co wheel arrangement and was fitted with a twin-bank Sulzer 12LDA28C engine of . It was a development of the 12LDA28A used for the Peaks. At that time, the Sulzer engines were favoured over English Electric's V12 option, despite their greater cost of £45,000 vs. £26,000, and their weight of 22.3 tons vs 19.4 tons. The locomotive had a design maximum speed of and weight of . The design dimensions of both Lion and the Class 47 were the same, although the Class 47 ended up a few tons overweight. == Construction == === Body === Lion's overall construction was as a truss from bufferbeam to bufferbeam, using the full height of the body to cant rail level as the structure. It was built from welded thin steel sheet, as either sheet or pressings. This gave a structure which was stiff and strong, yet avoided the weight of heavy underfloor girder sections. Truss structures had been used previously for the Peaks, although with the channel underframe as well, but these had been the diagonally-braced Pratt truss, which limited access through the sides and made access for maintenance difficult, often requiring an overhead crane. Lion used the uncommon Vierendeel truss, which is characterised by its rectangular openings. Although an inefficient structure for bridges, owing to the restricted bracing, the openings allowed better access through the body sides and Lion had central access doors for servicing. The driver's doors were also openings in the truss, which could extend to the full length of the bodyshell and cabs. Engine cooling was performed entirely in the roof section above the cant rail, explaining the lack of large cooling grilles in the body sides. The cooling group was provided by Serck and used two radiators in a removable pack in the roof over the Nº1 end and the Spanner Swirlyflow steam heating boiler. Air was drawn in from the sides, through the panels, and exhausted upwards in the centre by two electric fans. The main roof section, above the engine, was unusual in that it was a translucent fibreglass moulding, which provided light into the engine room, despite the body's small windows. This lightweight moulding could be raised upwards by pneumatic cylinders when stationary, to act as an air vent before needing access to the engine. The roof could then be slid lengthways, allowing fairly major engine servicing such as piston replacement, without needing a large overhead crane to remove a metal roof. The oil-wetted engine air filters were also mounted in the roof section, leaving more space in the body. The external styling, particularly the cab design and its fibreglass roof panels, resembled the Class 35 Hymeks, as they shared the same designer. The outer cladding skin was a load-bearing steel sheet. As such skins otherwise tended to show uneven ripples, Lion had this stiffened by five lengthwise fluted ribs. The livery stood out from other locomotives, although also showed dirt, as it was painted white overall with the side ribs picked out in gold. ==Testing== BR tested it initially on Western Region services out of London Paddington based at Wolverhampton Stafford Road Shed. Later it moved to Finsbury Park on the Eastern Region for services London King's Cross. However, BR decided to purchase its new Type 4 fleet from Brush Traction (the Class 47) and so D0260 was withdrawn in February 1964. ==Disposal== Full details of Lion's final withdrawal have never been fully made public, and even the BRC&W; workforce were not informed of its fate. But at some time after withdrawal, Lion was moved to AEI's works at Attercliffe where AEI became responsible for stripping the locomotive, primarily to recover their electrical components. During this process Sulzer recovered their 12LDA28C power unit and radiators (the engine was sent to be reconditioned at Vickers in Barrow-in-Furness, and was subsequently installed into an unknown production Class 47). What remained, principally the body shell and bogies, were scrapped at the Attercliffe yard of scrap merchant Thos W Ward. The date on which Ward finally cut up the remains is unclear. One report puts it as late as 1965. == Models == The Heljan 00 gauge model of Lion, from the Nº1 end and the roof cooling group D0260 Lion available as a kit and ready-to-run in 00 gauge by Silver Fox Models.

The words \\"Maa\\" and \\"Mata\\" are commonly used in India for mother, and thus are often heavily used in connection with Vaishno Devi. Goddess Vaishnavi was formed from the combined energies of Goddess Parvati/Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, and Mahasaraswati. ==Temple== Vaishno Devi Mandir is a Hindu temple located in Katra at the Trikuta Mountains within the Indian State of Jammu.Vaishno Devi History The Temple is a Trek of 13Km from Base camp of Katra to Bhavan and various modes like Pony, Helecopter and ropeway are now available for the ease of devotees, however it is still recommended to climb the trek by foot. Ever since the inception of Shrine Board in 1986, the Holy Shrine of Mata Vaishno Devi has witnessed an ever-increasing number of devotees. The Yatra that stood at 13.96 Lakhs in the year 1986, increased to 104.95 lakhs (10.4 Million) in the year 2012, 93.24 Lakhs in the year 2013, 78.03 Lakhs in the year 2014, 77.76 Lakhs in the year 2015, 77.23 Lakhs in the year 2016 and 85.87 Lakhs in the year 2018. ==Legend== According to Hindu religion, in the Treta Yuga, when the earth was overburdened by the wicked and tyrannical rule of the demons, the Goddess Vaishnavi was created when Mahakali, Lakshmi and Saraswati decided to combine their energies to rid the earth of impending doom. From the collective energy of the three Goddesses, appeared an eight armed Goddess, who was riding upon a lion (or tiger). After destroying the demons that were burdening Mother Earth, Goddess Vaishnavi was requested to reside on Earth, so that she may forever keep all evil at bay. She chose to incarnate as a human, named Vaishnavi. As a child, Vaishnavi was immersed in the devotional service of Lord Vishnu, a habit she carried well into her adulthood. When she was of a marriageable age, she left home to perform intense austerities to please and win Lord Vishnu as her husband. Years passed, and as an answer to her prayers, Lord Vishnu appeared to her in the form of Lord Rama. She learned from him that he was already married and was searching for his wife, Sita, who was abducted by the demon king of Lanka, Ravana. Seeing his devotee distraught, Rama promised her that he would return to her one day, and if she recognized him, she could marry him. Rama went on to rescue Sita and become the king of Ayodhya, all while Vaishnavi waited for his return. One such day, she was approached by an old man who asked the beautiful Vaishnavi to be his wife. She however, refused his proposal, thinking of him as undesirable for his age and looks. She had failed to recognize the old man who was none other than Lord Rama, who had come to keep his end of the promise. However, the harsh penance of the goddess can't go unfulfilled, so Lord Rama granted her the boon that in his 10th incarnation of Lord Kalki during kaliyuga, he would marry her and asked her to wait for him till his 10th incarnation on the Trikuta mountain. He even gave her a Bow and two quivers of arrows and a troop of his monkey army for her protection. Rama left, and Vaishnavi continued to spend years in meditation, moving from place to place, solving the troubles of all who asked, with her Siddhis. This threatened the popularity of a local Tantrik who sent his disciple Bhairon Nath to find out more about her. But Bhairon Nath was stupefied by her beauty and lustfully stalked her wherever she went. In order to escape his unwanted attention, Vaishnavi entered a cave and continued her meditation there, for nine months, as a child rests in its mother's womb. When Bhairon Nath discovered her hiding spot and attempted to hunt her down again, with an intention of forcing himself upon her, Vaishnavi appeared as Goddess Mahakali, and severed off Bhairon Nath’s head with her sword. After she cut his head off, Bhairon Nath realized his mistake and begged her for forgiveness. His head had fallen far from his body, but the merciful Goddess Vaishno Devi promised him that he would forever be enshrined there and that he would be her guardian form then on. Vaishno Devi abandoned her rage and returned to the form of Vaishnavi, and reentered her cave, where she assumed the form of three rocks and resides there to date. Each rock is representative of Saraswati, Mahalakshmi and Mahakali. This shrine is lovingly called “Vaishno Devi”, where millions of devotees go every year, to get the blessings of their Mother Goddess.

It was written and performed almost entirely by a trio of Danish comedy musicians called De Nattergale with financial and technical assistance from TV2, a Danish television company. It was hugely successful at the time, causing many invented phrases from the series to enter popular culture and was later released on VHS, and recently, DVD. It had 24 episodes (one for each day of December until Christmas Eve), as has been typical of other TV \\"calendars\\" before and since The Julekalender. ==Plot== The premise of the show is fairly simple: long, long ago, the race of Nisser lived happily in Denmark getting up to mischief with the humans, drinking, and making merry. Then the \\"Nå-såere\\" came - evil, vampire-esque creatures with an unhealthy obsession for money and counting - and almost eradicated the Nisser. A few Nisser survived and escaped to America, among them good old Gammelnok (literally, \\"old enough\\", the one character not to be played by a member of De Nattergale), who is now on the brink of death, as the music box that plays his life tune needs to be wound up. Gammelnok gathers three of the remaining Nisser (Hansi, Günther, and Fritz (all distinctly German-sounding names)) and sends them off to Denmark, to find the old Nisse cave where the key to wind up the music box is. He gives them The Big Book to take with them, an ancient tome that contains the answer to any and all questions, warning them to take great care that it does not fall into the hands of a Nå-såer. If this were to happen, all would be lost. They are also warned to take care, as the Nå-såere nowadays have taken the appearance of normal humans, but when they consume alcohol, they regain their original appearance, with fangs, and thick-rimmed glasses. The three merrily set off, and this is where the first episode begins. One of the quirks of the series, and one which made up a good share of its appeal, is the strange language that the Nisser speak. They themselves call it English, but it is an odd mixture of both Danish and English vocabulary, grammar, and sentence structure, leading to some very humorous phrases and structures (at least, to anyone who speaks both English and Danish). This was likely a good-natured jest at the heavy Danish accent that many Danes speak with, and the (back then) fairly low level of English proficiency of Danes, especially outside of large cities. Examples of particularly interesting, odd, or funny phrases are listed here (without an understanding of Danish, the humour will likely be lost): *\\"He who first gets to the mill is he who first gets painted\\" *\\"Think you da lige a little about\\" *\\"Let us straks try to smake it!\\" *\\"That is der simpelthen overhead not noget to do with\\" Additionally, key characters, events, or items are also called by odd hybrid names: the music box, for example, is a play dåse, Father Christmas is the Christmas man and the act of wood-carving is called \\"snitting\\". Since De Nattergale are actually musicians (albeit comedy musicians), the Nisser often burst into song, or find excuses to work music into each episode. Another large part of the appeal are the highly stereotypical Danes that the same three actors also play: Oluf and Gertrud Sand, a country bumpkin couple that live and work on a potato farm in Jutland, and Benny Jensen, a travelling salesman (or so he claims) from Copenhagen (who turns out to be a Nå-såer). Oluf and Gertrud speak with a broad country dialect, often leading to Benny misunderstanding what they say. There is also a large clash between the two different ways of life (as Benny comes to move in with Oluf and Gertrud in an early episode, as his car runs out of petrol, punctures, breaks down completely, and then gets stolen, supposedly by the \\"Polish Mafia\\"). Benny also thinks Oluf's father's name, Anders Sand, is funny, because it closely resembles Anders And, the Danish name for Donald Duck. ==Characters== *Oluf Sand (Viggo Sommer) is a potato farmer who lives on a farm in Jutland. He has a wife named Gertrud who lives along with him. He is very silent, likes reading the newspaper in his armchair while smoking with his smoking pipe. He often receives a call from someone (possibly the same all the time) who wants to buy potatoes, to which Oluf often increases the price and says a receipt is no use. He often compliments that the quiet when Gertrud leaves, often breaking the fourth wall, but when Benny Jensen insults her he is very quick to protect her. His Christmas wishes, according to Gertrud, never seems to be renewed, meaning that he wishes for a smoking pipe, tobacco or a pipe-cleaner. He has a father named Anders Sand, which Benny think is funny, mixing him with Anders And. He secretly saves money enough to buy a foodprocessor for Gertrud, but tells her that they can't afford it. For Christmas he receives a smoking pipe from Gertrud. *Gertrud Sand (Carsten Knudsen) is a farmer who lives on a farm in Jutland, who farms with potatoes. She has a husband named Oluf who lives along with her. She is very loud, often talking non-stop about how nice everything would be if this and that etc. She spends the entire series asking for the big crate with Christmas stuff. She also spends most episodes talking about her wish for a foodprocessor, but is told that they can't afford it. When Oluf doesn't listen to what she says she shakes her head, while breaking the fourth wall. When Oluf talks in the telephone about his potato-selling, Gertrud is told that it was wrong number when she asks. When she accidentally gives The Book away to some scouts for charity, she is confronted by Benny Jensen who screams and yells at her. She has a sister (known simply as Sister) and a brother-in-law named Kaj. When her sister calls her on the telephone she can talk for hours. She likes to listen to the radio. For Christmas she receives a foodprocessor from Oluf. *Benny Jensen (Uffe Rørbæk Madsen) is a nåsåer who has taken the appearance of a human and visits the Sands. He claims that his car has run out of petrol, soon punctures, later breaks down completely, and then gets stolen, supposedly by the \\"Polish Mafia\\" (which is doubtful), and he comes to live with the farmers for the rest of the series, searching for nisse-life. He soon finds out about a cave in which three nisser lives in and spends the rest of the series making excuses to leave in order to find the cave. When he finally manages to make his way inside, knock out Günther, the youngest nisse, and steal The Big Book. After that he spends all the time reading the book at Sands, making the life a menace to the humans and the nisser. He angers when the book disappears, yelling at Gertrud. He gets pressed into taking alcohol when he claims it's his birthday and after that he can't stop it again. He never manages, however being close, to kill the nisser. For Christmas he receives a book about nisser from Oluf and Gertrud, having made many nisse-related references. *Gynter (Carsten Knudsen) is a nisse who spends the majority of the series carving a new propeller for their plane after the last one broke. *Hansi (Uffe Rørbæk Madsen) is a nisse who does most of the work for the trio. He has a running gag of asking why he has to do all the work, to which Fritz replies \\"Because you're the one with the biggest teeth and the ugliest clothes\\" which because of the mixed language is actually spoken as \\"Because you're the one with the biggest tænder and the grimmest' tøj\\". *Fritz (Viggo Sommer) is the apparent leader of the trio of nisser. ==Soundtrack== In 1991 the same year The Julekalender was made and shown first time, a music album was published called Songs From The Julekalender which have all the songs from The Julekalender in it. *\\"The Støvle Dance\\" (episode 4) (\\"The Boot Dance\\") *\\"It's hard to be a nissemand\\" (episode 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 14, 16, 18 and 20) (only one episode contains the full song) (\\"It's hard to be a nisse-man\\") *\\"It's hard to be a snittermand\\" (episode 7) (\\"It's hard to be a carving-man\\") *\\"It's good to be a nissemand\\" (episode 24) (\\"It's good to be a nisse-man\\") *\\"The Blues\\" (episode 18) *\\"Will She Mon Wait For Me\\" (episode 21) (\\"I Wonder If She Will Wait For Me\\") *\\"Thousands of Vendings\\" (episode 23) (\\"Thousands of Lines\\") *\\"Knokkel Pukkel Man\\" (episode 22) (\\"Working Slaved Man\\") *\\"Jäger-Lied\\" (episode 12) (\\"Hunter- Song\\") [German song] *\\"Snit a Little Bittle\\" (episode 10) (\\"Carve a Little Bit\\") *\\"De Kære Minder\\" (various) (\\"The Dear Memories\\") [heard on radio] *\\"Rosita og Carlo\\" (various) (\\"Rosita and Carlo\\") [heard on radio] *\\"The Dæjlig News Blues\\" (episode 16) (\\"The Splendid News Blues\\") *\\"Long Time ago in Bethlehem\\" (episode 6) == See also == * Tomte * The Julekalender (Norwegian TV series) * The Joulukalenteri == External links == * Category:Danish comedy television series Category:1991 Danish television series debuts Category:1991 Danish television series endings Category:1990s Danish television series Category:Danish children's television series ","title":"The Julekalender"},{"id":"1276476","text":"Moratinos may refer to *Moratinos, Palencia, a municipality in the province of Palencia, Spain *José Lebrún Moratinos (1919-2001), Archbishop of Caracas, Venezuela in 1980-1995 *Miguel Ángel Moratinos (born 1951), Spanish diplomat and politician ","title":"Moratinos"},{"id":"1276493","text":"María Cristina Narbona Ruiz (born 29 July 1951) is a Spanish politician who currently serves as First Vice President of the Senate.

The local bishop or branch president is responsible for the use of the fast offering resources, and is usually assisted by other local church leaders to identify individuals and families to receive assistance and to disburse the resources.\\"Fasting and Fast Offerings\\", churchofjesuschrist.org.Church Welfare Resources . ==Background== Members are encouraged to fast once a month on Fast Sunday and to give the money they save by not eating two meals to the church; those who can afford to be more generous are encouraged to give more than simply the money saved as a fast offering. Members may also choose to fast and donate fast offerings more than once per month. When the Mormon pioneers first settled in the western United States in 1847, LDS Church leaders encouraged members to perform their fast on the first Thursday of each month, and to donate the food thus saved to their bishop. This food was collected in small buildings called \\"Bishop's Storehouses\\", and were held until needed by other members. Over time, this practice was changed: the members, who were primarily farmers and laborers, had difficulty fasting on a day of regular labor, so the day of observance was changed to Sunday. When money, in the form of specie instead of barter, became more available in Utah Territory, members were encouraged to make their donations in cash, which could better be held until needed to purchase food. ==Purposes== Donations from fast offerings are not used for the same purposes as those monies given through tithes. Specifically, fast offerings are used to provide food, shelter, clothing, medical care, and other necessities for those who are in need, fulfilling the meaning conveyed in Isaiah 58:6–11, with attendant blessings to the giver and the receiver. Tithing funds are used to build and maintain meetinghouses, temples, and educational facilities; for the general maintenance of church operations; and for costs of missionary and genealogical and family history work. ==Collection methods== Church members are encouraged to make regular financial contributions to the church through the leader of the local church unit, usually a bishop. The combined contribution can include tithing, fast offerings, and other humanitarian donations, and is delivered to the leader on a \\"convenience\\" basis (i.e., there is no set time either in or outside of a formal meeting where the funds are requested). Young men (deacons or teachers in the Aaronic Priesthood) are often assigned to pass by members' residences to inquire if they can convey any fast offerings to the bishop.LDS Church, Aaronic Priesthood Manual I, Lesson 4: \\"The Law of the Fast\\". In some areas, members may also pay fast offerings on the Internet. There is no requirement to make any financial donation to fast offerings or any of the church's other funds in order to maintain one's membership; such donations are encouraged but are not mandatory. ==Distribution== No publicly available accounting of fast offerings exists. (The LDS Church does disclose its financials in the United Kingdom,THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS (GREAT BRITAIN), provided by the Charity Commission based on the Charities Act Canada,Charities Listings.

However, it is claimed by the church that fast offering funds are primarily available to the bishop to distribute to those in need in the area where they were collected, but that any excess (or deficiency) is shared with the rest of the church, first on a stake level, then on wider levels.\\"Fast Offerings\\", Encyclopedia of Mormonism. Bishops are instructed by church guidelines that they have \\"a divine mandate to seek out and care for the poor (see D&C; 84:112). It is not enough to assist [with fast offerings] only when asked.\\"LDS Church, Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2010) §5.2.3. ==Purpose of fast offerings, and financial prudence== While administering to the needs of the poor through use of the fast offering funds, each bishop is also counseled to encourage individuals and families to become self-reliant through reducing debt, seeking work opportunities or improved income through education if needed, and paying tithes and offerings to receive temporal blessings from the Lord as promised in Malachi 3:8–12.\\"Questions about Coping Financially: Welfare Services Suggests Some Answers\\", Ensign June 1980, p. 12. ==References== Category:Latter Day Saint doctrines, beliefs, and practices Category:Latter Day Saint terms Category:Christian fasting Category:Worship services of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Category:Alms in Christianity ","title":"Fast offering"},{"id":"1276566","text":"Bathycles of Magnesia () was an Ionian sculptor of Magnesia on the Maeander.

For the Board in the Philippines, see National Seamen Board. The National Maritime Board (NMB) was a bilateral board governing wages and working practices in the British shipping industry. It was founded in November 1917 against a backdrop of strike action amongst seafarers and was originally intended as a purely wartime measure to facilitate wage negotiations in a period of rapid inflation. It built upon the union-employer relationship that had emerged during the war years and brought together representatives of the Shipping Federation, the National Union of Seamen and the National Union of Ship's Stewards, as well as some smaller unions in the industry, but allowing the British Seafarers' Union only local representation. In 1919 the board was re- established as a permanent body and set about establishing national wage rates for all grades, the first time such rates had been enforced. Aylmer Vallance was appointed as the board's General Secretary.Geoffrey Cox, \\"The editor who made love - and great news\\", British Journalism Review 1996 7: 16 In the 1920s, the board imposed a series of wage reductions with the support of the National Union of Seamen. The Ship's Stewards Union opposed the first of these reductions in 1921, and its members were locked out. At this time, the board also became embroiled in controversies over the policy of Joint Control introduced by the NUS and Shipping Federation. This arrangement aimed to ensure that seafarers could only gain employment if in possession of a form endorsed by both the union and the employers' organisation. It was allegedly widely used to force out of employment members of rival unions, communists, and other 'agitators'.

Stanley Moss to investigate a mystery of the final days of the Third Reich. In April and May 1945, the remaining reserves of the Reichsbank – gold (730 bars), cash (6 large sacks), and precious stones and metals such as platinum (25 sealed boxes) – were dispatched by Walther Funk to be buried on the Klausenhof Mountain at Einsiedl in Bavaria, where the final German resistance was to be concentrated. Similarly the Abwehr cash reserves were hidden nearby in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Shortly after the American forces overran the area, the reserves and money disappeared.Moss, W.

It was established on July 3, 1993, pursuant to the provision of Republic Act 7653 or the New Central Bank Act of 1993 as amended by Republic Act 11211 or the New Central Act of 2019. ==History== === American era and World War II === In 1900, the First Philippine Commission passed Act No. 52, which placed all banks under the Bureau of the Treasury and authorizing the Insular Treasurer to supervise and examine banks and all banking activity. In 1929, the Department of Finance, through the Bureau of Banking, took over bank supervision. By 1933, a group of Filipinos had conceptualized a central bank for the Philippine Islands. It came up with the rudiments of a bill for the establishment of a central bank after a careful study of the economic provisions of the Hare–Hawes–Cutting Act, which would grant Philippine independence after 12 years, but reserving military and naval bases for the United States and imposing tariffs and quotas on Philippine exports. However, the Hare–Hawes–Cutting Act would be rejected by the Senate of the Philippines at the urging of Commonwealth President Manuel L. Quezon. This Senate then advocated a new bill that won United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt's support, this would be the Tydings–McDuffie Act, which would grant Philippine independence on July 4, 1946. Under the Commonwealth, discussions continued regarding the idea of a Philippine central bank that would promote price stability and economic growth. The country's monetary system then was administered by the Department of Finance and the National Treasury, and the Philippine piso was on the exchange standard using the United States dollar, which was backed by 100 percent gold reserve, as the standard currency. As required by the Tydings–McDuffie Act, the National Assembly of the Philippines in 1939 passed a law establishing a central bank. As it was a monetary law, it required the approval of the President of the United States; Franklin D. Roosevelt did not give his. A second law was passed in 1944 under the Japanese-controlled Second Republic during the Second World War, but the 1945 arrival of American liberation forces, aided by Philippine Commonwealth troops and recognised guerrillas, aborted its implementation. === Third Republic and martial law === Shortly after President Manuel Roxas assumed office in 1946, he instructed then-Finance Secretary Miguel Cuaderno, Sr. to draw up a charter for a central bank. The establishment of a monetary authority became imperative a year later as a result of the findings of the Joint Philippine- American Finance Commission chaired by Cuaderno. The Commission, which studied Philippine financial, monetary, and fiscal problems in 1947, recommended a shift from the dollar exchange standard to a managed currency system. A central bank was necessary to implement the proposed shift to the new system. Roxas then created the Central Bank Council to prepare the charter of a proposed monetary authority. It was submitted to Congress in February 1948. By June of the same year, the newly proclaimed President Elpidio Quirino, who succeeded President Roxas, affixed his signature on Republic Act (RA) No. 265, the Central Bank Act of 1948. On January 3, 1949, the Central Bank of the Philippines was formally inaugurated with Miguel Cuaderno, Sr. as the first governor. The main duties and responsibilities of the Central Bank were to promote economic development and maintain internal and external monetary stability. Over the years, changes were introduced to make the charter more responsive to the needs of the economy. On November 29, 1972, President Ferdinand Marcos' Presidential Decree No. 72 amended Republic Act No. 265, emphasizing the maintenance of domestic and international monetary stability as the primary objective of the Central Bank. The Bank's authority was also expanded to include regulation of the entire financial system of the Philippines and not just supervision of the banking system. In 1981, RA 265, as amended, was further improved to strengthen the financial system, among the changes was the increase in the capitalization of the Central Bank from Php10 million to Php 10 billion.Philippine Presidential Decree No. 72 The LawPhil Project (www.lawphil.net). Retrieved on March 26, 2013. By 2019, President Duterte signs R.A. 11211 further increasing the capitalization to Php 200 billion. In the 1973 Constitution, the interim Batasang Pambansa (National Assembly) was mandated to establish an independent central monetary authority. Presidential Decree No. 1801 designated the Central Bank of the Philippines as the central monetary authority (CMA). According to a confidential October 19, 1984 Monetary Board report, the Central bank overstated the country's dollar reserves $600 million. The 1987 Constitution adopted the CMA provisions from the 1973 Constitution that were aimed essentially at establishing an independent monetary authority through increased capitalization and greater private sector representation in the Monetary Board.Philippine Presidential Decree No. 1801 The LawPhil Project (www.lawphil.net).

In the same year, the BSP declared microfinance as its flagship program for poverty alleviation. The BSP has become the prime advocate for the development of microfinance. To this end, the Bangko Sentral aims to: # Provide the enabling policy and regulatory environment; # Increase the capacity of the BSP and banking sector on microfinance operations; and # Promote and advocate for the development of sound and sustainable microfinance operations. The Bank is active in promoting a financial inclusion policy and is a leading member of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion. It is also one of the original 17 regulatory institutions to make specific national commitments to financial inclusion under the Maya Declaration during the 2011 Global Policy Forum held in Mexico. ==Anti-money laundering== With money laundering being one of the problems of the Philippines, the BSP has issued a number of measures to bring the Philippines' regulatory regime on money laundering closer to international standards. In September 2001, the Anti-Money Laundering Act, or AMLA, was made into law. The AMLA defined money laundering a criminal offense, and prescribed corresponding penalties. It also provided the foundation for a central monitoring and implementing council called the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC). The AMLC is composed of the Governor of the Bangko Sentral as Chair, and the Commissioner of the Insurance Commission and the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission as members, all acting unanimously in the discharge of the group's mandate. In February 2013, Philippine President Benigno Aquino III signed \\"R.A. No. 10365\\" known as An act further strengthening the Anti-Money Laundering Law, which aims to strengthen the AMLC by requiring that any suspicious transaction in foreign exchange, real estate, and jewelry and precious metal trading be reported. ==Governors== == Museum == Within the Manila complex of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is the Museo ng Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (English: Museum of the Central Bank of the Philippines). Inaugurated on January 3, 1999, as part of the celebration of the 50 years of central banking in the Philippines, the museum showcases the Bank's collection of currencies. As repository and custodian of the country's numismatic heritage, the Museo collects, studies and preserves coins, paper notes, medals, artifacts and monetary items found in the Philippines during its different historical periods. These collections have been placed on permanent display at the Museo. Designed to \\"walk\\" the visitor through a number of galleries dedicated to a specific historical period of the country, the Museo visually narrates the development of the Philippine economy, parallel to the evolution of its currency. Complementary paintings from the BSP art collection, together with chosen artifacts, enhance each gallery. A panoramic memorabilia of 50 years of central banking in the Philippines, showcases the strides made in bringing about price stability, to sustain economic growth in the country. The exhibition hall also carries the busts of the governors of the Central Bank/Bangko Sentral. ==Security Plant Complex== The Security Plant Complex, or SPC, was formally established on September 7, 1978 to safeguard the printing, minting, refining, issuance, distribution and durability of coins, banknotes, gold bars, government official receipts, lottery tickets, internal revenue stamps, passports, seaman identification record books, strip stamps, official documents, registration certificates, Torrens titles, treasury warrants, stocks and bonds, government contracts, ration coupons, official ballots, election return forms, checks and other security printing or minting jobs of the Philippine government. Printing of official ballots and other public documents was later transferred to the National Printing Office pursuant to Executive Order No. 285 issued on July 25, 1987. On August 4, 2003, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo issued \\"Administrative Order No. 79\\", which designated the SPC as the sole manufacturer of presidential medals and decorations. The BSP will relocate its security plant complex from East Avenue, Quezon City to the National Government Administrative Center district of New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac after it signed a memorandum of agreement with the Bases Conversion and Development Authority in September 2019. The new currency production facility will be located at the 29-hectare land near the access road connecting New Clark City to the Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway and it is expected to be completed within two years.

Until 2010, it was widely marketed and prescribed as an adjunct in the treatment of obesity along with diet and exercise. It has been associated with increased cardiovascular events and strokes and has been withdrawn from the market in several countries and regions including Australia, Canada,Health Canada Endorsed Important Safety Information on MERIDIA (Sibutramine Hydrochloride Monohydrate): Subject: Voluntary withdrawal of Meridia (sibutramine) capsules from the Canadian market.

Retrieved 2010-01-27 Hong Kong, India, Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. However, the drug remains available in some countries. Sibutramine was originally developed in 1988 by Boots in Nottingham, U.K., and marketed by Knoll Pharmaceuticals after BASF/Knoll AG purchased the Boots Research Division in 1995, and was most recently manufactured and marketed by Abbott Laboratories before its withdrawal from most markets. It has been sold under a variety of brand names including Reductil, Meridia, Siredia, and Sibutrex. It is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance in the United States. ==Medical uses== Sibutramine has been used to produce appetite suppression for the purpose of attaining weight loss in the treatment of patients with obesity. ==Contraindications== Sibutramine is contraindicated in patients with: * Psychiatric conditions as bulimia nervosa, anorexia nervosa, serious depression or pre-existing mania * Patients with a history of or a predisposition to drug or alcohol abuse * Hypersensitivity to the drug or any of the inactive ingredients * Patients below 18 and above 65 years of age * Concomitant treatment with a MAO inhibitor, antidepressant or other centrally active drugs, particularly other anoretics * History of peripheral arterial disease * Hypertension that is not sufficiently controlled (e.g., >145/90 mmHg), caution in controlled hypertension * Existing pulmonary hypertension * Existing damage on heart valves, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, serious arrhythmias, previous myocardial infarction * A history of coronary artery disease (e.g., angina, history of myocardial infarction), congestive heart failure, tachycardia, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, arrhythmia or cerebrovascular disease (stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)) * Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) * Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland) * Closed angle glaucoma * Seizure disorders * Enlargement of the prostate gland with urinary retention (relative contraindication) * Pheochromocytoma * Pregnant and lactating women (relative contraindication) ==Side effects== A higher number of cardiovascular events has been observed in people taking sibutramine versus control (11.4% vs. 10.0%). In 2010 the FDA noted the concerns that sibutramine increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. Frequently encountered side effects are: dry mouth, paradoxically increased appetite, nausea, strange taste in the mouth, upset stomach, constipation, trouble sleeping, dizziness, drowsiness, menstrual cramps/pain, headache, flushing, or joint/muscle pain. Sibutramine can substantially increase blood pressure and heart rate in some patients. Therefore, regular monitoring needs to be performed. The following side effects are infrequent but serious and require immediate medical attention: cardiac arrhythmias, paresthesia, mental/mood changes (e.g., excitement, restlessness, confusion, depression, rare thoughts of suicide). Symptoms that require urgent medical attention are seizures, problems urinating, abnormal bruising or bleeding, melena, hematemesis, jaundice, fever and rigors, chest pain, hemiplegia, abnormal vision, dyspnea and edema. Currently, no case of pulmonary hypertension has been noted. (Fenfluramine, of the 1990s \\"Fen-Phen\\" combo, forced excess release of neurotransmitters—a different action. Phentermine was uninvolved in the rare—but clinically significant—heart issues of fenfluramine.) ==Interactions== Sibutramine has a number of clinically significant interactions. The concomitant use of sibutramine and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs, such as selegiline) is not indicated, as it may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, a somewhat rare but serious adverse drug reaction. Sibutramine should not be taken within two weeks of stopping or starting an MAOI. Taking both sibutramine and certain medications used in the treatment of migraines—such as ergolines and triptans—as well as opioids, may also increase the risk for serotonin syndrome, as may the use of more than one serotonin reuptake inhibitor at the same time. The concomitant use of sibutramine and drugs which inhibit CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole and erythromycin, may increase plasma levels of sibutramine. Cloridrato de sibutramina monoidratado. Bula.

Older anorectic agents such as amphetamine and fenfluramine force the release of these neurotransmitters rather than affecting their reuptake. Despite having a mechanism of action similar to tricyclic antidepressants, sibutramine has failed to demonstrate antidepressant properties in animal studies. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 1997 for the treatment of obesity. Sibutramine is reported to be a prodrug to two active metabolites, desmethylsibutramine (M1; BTS-54354) and didesmethylsibutramine (M2; BTS-54505), with much greater potency as MRIs. Unlike other serotonergic appetite suppressants like fenfluramine, sibutramine and its metabolites have only low and likely inconsequential affinity for the 5-HT2B receptor. ===Pharmacokinetics=== Sibutramine is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (77%), but undergoes considerable first-pass metabolism, reducing its bioavailability. The drug itself reaches its peak plasma level after 1 hour and has also a half-life of 1 hour. Sibutramine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP3A4 into two pharmacologically- active primary and secondary amines (called active metabolites 1 and 2) with half-lives of 14 and 16 hours, respectively. Peak plasma concentrations of active metabolites 1 and 2 are reached after three to four hours. The following metabolic pathway mainly results in two inactive conjugated and hydroxylated metabolites (called metabolites 5 and 6). Metabolites 5 and 6 are mainly excreted in the urine. ==Chemistry== Sibutramine has usually been used in the form of the hydrochloride monohydrate salt. ===Detection in body fluids=== Sibutramine and its two active N-demethylated metabolites may be measured in biofluids by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Plasma levels of these three species are usually in the 1–10 μg/L range in persons undergoing therapy with the drug. The parent compound and norsibutramine are often not detectable in urine, but dinorsibutramine is generally present at concentrations of >200 μg/L.Jain DS, Subbaiah G, Sanyal M, et al.

Despite a 2002 petition by Ralph Nader-founded NGO Public Citizen, the FDA made no attempts to withdraw the drug, but was part of a Senate hearing in 2005. Similarly, David Graham, FDA \\"whistleblower\\", testified before a Senate Finance Committee hearing that sibutramine may be more dangerous than the conditions it is used for.Hearing of 17 November 2004. Related CBS news item 19 November 2004. Between January 2003 and November 2005, a large randomized-controlled \\"Sibutramine Cardiovascular OUTcomes\\" (SCOUT) study with 10,742 patients examined whether or not sibutramine administered within a weight management program reduces the risk for cardiovascular complications in people at high risk for heart disease and concluded that use of silbutramine had a RR 1.16 for the primary outcome (composit of nonfatal MI, nonfatal CVA, cardiac arrest, and CV death). In a dissenting article, \\"Sibutramine: gone, but not forgotten\\", David Haslam (chairman of the National Obesity Forum) says that the SCOUT study is flawed as it only covered high-risk patients and did not consider obese patients who do not have cardiovascular complications or similar contraindications On January 21, 2010, the European Medicines Agency recommended suspension of marketing authorizations for sibutramine based on the SCOUT study results. In August 2010 the FDA added a new contraindication for patients over 65 years of age due to the fact that clinical studies of sibutramine did not include sufficient numbers of such patients. Abbott Laboratories announced on October 8, 2010 that it is withdrawing sibutramine from the US market under pressure from the FDA, citing concerns over minimal efficacy coupled with increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. ===Counterfeit weight-loss products=== On December 22, 2008, the United States Food and Drug Administration issued an alert to consumers naming 27 different products marketed as “dietary supplements” for weight loss, that illegally contain undisclosed amounts of sibutramine. In March 2009, Dieter Müller et al. published a study of sibutramine poisoning cases from similar Chinese \\"herbal supplements\\" sold in Europe, containing as much as twice the dosage of the legally licensed drug. An additional 34 products were recalled by the FDA on April 22, 2009, further underscoring the risks associated with unregulated \\"herbal supplements\\" to unsuspecting persons. This concern is especially relevant to those with underlying medical conditions incompatible with undeclared pharmaceutical adulterants.34 weight loss products recalled, WebMD, 22 April 2009. In January 2010, a similar alert was issued for counterfeit versions of the over-the- counter weight loss drug Alli sold over the Internet. Instead of the active ingredient orlistat, the counterfeit drugs contain sibutramine, and at concentrations at least twice the amount recommended for weight loss. In March 2010 Health Canada advised the public that illegal \\"Herbal Diet Natural\\" had been found on the market, containing sibutramine, which is a prescription drug in Canada, without listing sibutramine as an ingredient. In October 2010 FDA notified consumers that \\"Slimming Beauty Bitter Orange Slimming Capsules contain the active pharmaceutical ingredient sibutramine, a prescription-only drug which is a stimulant. Sibutramine is not listed on the product label.\\" In October 2010 the MHRA in the UK issued a warning regarding \\"Payouji tea\\" and \\"Pai You Guo Slim Capsules\\" which were found to contain undeclared quantities of sibutramine. On December 30, 2010 the FDA released a warning regarding \\"Fruta Planta\\" dietary products, which were found to contain undeclared amounts of sibutramine. The recall stated that \\"there is NO SAFE formula on the US market and that all versions of Fruta Planta contain sibutramine. All versions of the formula are UNSAFE and should not be purchased from any source.\\" Some illegal weight loss products imported into Ireland have been found to contain sibutramine. Similar concerns have been raised in Australia, where illegal imported supplements have been found to contain sibutramine, resulting in public alerts from Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration. In October 2011, the FDA warned that 20 brands of dietary supplements were tainted with sibutramine. In a 2018 study FDA has found synthetic additives including sibutramine in over 700 diet supplements marketed as \\"natural\\", \\"traditional\\" or \\"herbal remedies\\". ==References== == External links == *Abbott Press Release on Meridia Withdrawal *Sibutramine drug information from Merck Manual.

Previously owned by the Sara Lee Corporation since 1984, it was sold in 2011 to S. C. Johnson. It is the dominant shoe polish in some countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States, where it has about two-thirds of the market. In Malaysia and Singapore, Kiwi has become such a household brand for shoe polish that the word \\"kiwi\\" has been genericized into a verb in the Malay language, meaning \\"to polish one's shoes\\". The polish was developed in Australia by William Ramsay who named it Kiwi after the flightless bird endemic to New Zealand, the home country of his wife, Annie Elizabeth Meek Ramsay. Its success in Australia expanded overseas when it was adopted by both the British and American armies in World War I. In the UK, Kiwi was for many years manufactured at its British headquarters in Ealing (Brumwill Road, London W5 1DT). From here the factory manufactured for the UK market and exported the Kiwi brand to much of Europe and the Middle East. In the mid-1970s, as part of a major streamlining, the UK factory was closed with production switched to France. The UK operation moved to Surrey (Yately) becoming, effectively, a sales and marketing office, with distribution contracted to a third party. In 1980, production for the UK market moved back to the UK, and was housed in a factory near Huddersfield. The UK head office was relocated to Maidstone, Kent, where Kiwi had other product interests. Following the global merger with Nicholas Laboratories, the UK head office was again relocated to Slough at the Nicholas building on the Bath Road. ==Development== While a number of older leather preserving products existed (including the Irish brand Punch, which was first made in 1851, and the German brand, Erdal, which went on sale in 1901), Kiwi's invention in 1906 made it the first shoe polish to resemble the modern varieties, aimed primarily at inducing shine. Ramsay and fellow Scottish expatriate Hamilton McKellar began making boot polish in a small factory in 1904 in Melbourne, Australia. They developed and improved their new formula and Ramsay launched the product in 1906 and began marketing it in Melbourne. Ramsay loaded boxes of the polish on his horse and cart and sold it to farmers to protect their boots. Kiwi was a major improvement on previous brands. It preserved shoe leather, made it shine, and restored colour. By the time Kiwi Dark Tan was released in 1908, it incorporated agents that added suppleness and water resistance. Australian-made boot polish was then considered the world's best. A range of colours became available, and exports to Britain, continental Europe, and New Zealand began. A rival brand of the time was Cobra Boot Polish, based in Sydney. Cobra was noted for a series of cartoon advertisements in The Sydney Bulletin, starting in 1909, using a character called \\"Chunder Loo of Akim Foo\\". (The word chunder, meaning \\"to vomit\\", possibly originated through the rhyming slang of Chunder Loo and spew.) The spread of Kiwi shoe polish around the world enhanced the popular appeal of the kiwi as New Zealand's national symbol. ==Corporate history== A can of Kiwi shoe polish Over the years, Kiwi has been owned by a variety of corporations. For the first six decades of its existence, it was part of iterations of an Australian corporation with Kiwi in its name, all based in the state of Victoria, including Kiwi Boot Polish Co. (1913–1916) and Kiwi Polish Co. (1916–1971). The company then joined with Nicholas International Ltd., a Melbourne-based pharmaceutical company producing international brands such as Aspro and Rennie. The new company was renamed Nicholas Kiwi. In 1984, it was acquired by American-based Sara Lee, at the time known as Consolidated Foods Corporation, who eventually sold off the Nicholas pharmaceutical products to Roche of Switzerland and kept the Kiwi range. In 1991 a subsidiary of the Sara Lee Corporation (Sara Lee) acquired part of the shoe care business of Reckitt & Colman plc (Reckitt & Colman), including the Cherry Blossom and Meltonian brands. Sara Lee already possessed the Kiwi brand, among others. The Federal Trade Commission ruled that Sara Lee had to divest its ownership of these companies in 1994 to prevent it from becoming a monopoly. Since this ruling, Sara Lee has been prevented from acquiring any further assets or firms associated with chemical shoe care products in the United States without prior commission approval. The Competition Commission in the United Kingdom also investigated the potential monopoly of Sara Lee in the shoe care industry. On April 4, 2011, Sara Lee announced that it had completed its sale of its global shoe care business, in a majority of countries, to S. C. Johnson. Kiwi remains the predominant shoe polish brand in most of the world, being sold in over 180 countries and holding a 53% market share worldwide. \\"World War I led to an enormous demand for 'Kiwi' polish for use by Australian, British and, later, American forces.\\" Today, it is manufactured in Australia, Canada, Honduras, France, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Peru, South Africa, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Other leading brands include Shinola, Lincoln Shoe Polish, Meltonian, and Cherry Blossom. ==See also== *Kiwi (people) ==References== ==Notes== # Australian Government article on Kiwi shoe polish - PDF file, taken from Imagination - 100 Years of Bright Ideas in Australia Available in print form - (). # KiwiPhile - how Kiwi shoe polish helped choose a national symbol # Competition Commission - Introduction to a report on Sara Lee (owners of Kiwi shoe polish) and the shoe polish market in general. # Federal Trade Commission on Sara Lee's potential monopoly # https://web.archive.org/web/20110807090057/http://www.saralee.com/en/NewsAndMedia/News/2011/SaraLeeCompletesSaleofGlobalShoeCareBusinesstoScJohnson.aspx ==External links== *www.kiwicare.com — Kiwi site *www.kiwishoeshine.com — Kiwi retail site *www.quimicashandal.com — Kiwi Central America Kiwi Category:Shoe polish Category:Products introduced in 1906 Category:Australian brands Category:2011 mergers and acquisitions ","title":"Kiwi (shoe polish)"},{"id":"1276634","text":"Maharam () is an acronym of the words (Morenu Ha-Rav rabi M..., Our teacher the Rabbi M...), a pattern also used for other names.

The first MPV marketed by Ford outside of North America, three generations of the Galaxy have been produced. Since 2006, the Galaxy has been developed alongside the Ford S-MAX, sharing its platform architecture with the Ford Mondeo. In contrast to the Ford Aerostar and Chrysler Voyager (both exported), the Galaxy was configured with forward-hinged rear doors in place of sliding doors (adopting the layout of the Renault Espace). == First generation (V191, 1995) == The first Galaxy was designed as a joint venture product between Ford and the Volkswagen Group. Produced at the joint-venture AutoEuropa plant in Palmela, Portugal, the vehicle was badge-engineered to create three vehicles: the Ford Galaxy; by Volkswagen as the Volkswagen Sharan; and by SEAT as the Alhambra. Production started in May 1995. The Galaxy used predominantly Volkswagen Group mechanicals, most notably the 2.8 litre VR6 petrol engine from the top versions of the Volkswagen Golf, as well as Volkswagen Group's 1.9 litre Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) turbodiesel unit. Initially only the 2.0 litre inline-four petrol version used a Ford powerplant – this derived from the Ford I4 DOHC engine. In later years, this unit was supplemented by a 2.3 litre 16 valve version first seen in the facelifted Ford Scorpio. This engine was transversely mounted as opposed to longitudinal mounting like in the Scorpio. The 2.8 litre VR6 model was also available with an optional four-wheel-drive system, however this did not reappear on the second generation. All of the VW Group sourced engines were supplied with \\"Ford\\" badges on the rocker covers, despite being VW Group designs. All automatic transmissions were VW Group AG4 boxes, but manual gearboxes on all engines were VXT75 five speeds (modified versions of the trusted Ford MTX-75 five speed set-up to suit the transverse engine layout). The original interior used a mix of both Ford and VW Group components, using a Volkswagen Golf-derived instrument pack, and most of the switchgear, while the curved fascia moulding was of Ford design, heavily reminiscent of that used in the Ford Mondeo. Originally there were three trim levels; the Aspen, the Ghia and the GLX. However, in 1999, Ford introduced the new LX and Zetec trim styles which replaced the Aspen and GLX models. In August 2000, the Galaxy received a facelift with new exterior (incorporating New Edge) and interior styling including a new dashboard.https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/car- reviews/ford/galaxy/galaxy-1995-2000/ ===Public reaction=== In 1999, the MkI Ford Galaxy was rated in a Top Gear magazine survey as the least satisfying car in the United Kingdom, though 12,233 people bought a Galaxy in the previous year, which was twice the market share of its nearest rival, according to a Ford's spokesman.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ford- galaxy-is-voted-least-satisfying-car-1085833.html In the UK, Ford Galaxy sold more than Volkswagen Sharan and was the best selling MPV.https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/car- reviews/volkswagen/sharan/sharan-1995-2000/ ===Gallery=== File:Ford Galaxy rear 20080331.jpgGalaxy Mk I (1995−2000) File:Ford Galaxy front 20071109.jpgGalaxy Mk II (2000−2006) File:Ford Galaxy rear 20071109.jpgGalaxy Mk II (2000−2006) ==Second generation (2006)== Galaxy (2006−2010) Galaxy (2010-2015) Galaxy (2010-2015) The second generation Galaxy was introduced at the 2006 Geneva Motor Show, and went on sale alongside the Ford S-Max (which had a lower rear roofline, external cosmetic differences and only child seats in the third row) in June 2006. The new Galaxy is larger than its predecessor, and is a four pillar vehicle of Ford design, with no Volkswagen Group content (Ford sold its stake in AutoEuropa back to the Volkswagen Group the year before). No longer produced at the AutoEuropa plant in Portugal, Europe's replacement Galaxy is assembled at a newly re equipped plant alongside the Mondeo in Genk, Belgium. With the S-Max catering to customers who require a sport oriented multi-purpose vehicle (MPV), Ford was able to expand the Galaxy in every dimension without losing sales in size conscious Europe. Due to its size, Ford was unable to design the Galaxy using a full Kinetic Design format. However, Ford states that the Mk II Galaxy has 'elements' of Kinetic Design, such as its trapezoidal grille, large wheelarches and angular headlights. The vehicle has no spare wheel; instead an aerosol foam sealant is provided to seal punctures until a new tyre can be purchased. Only Ford's own engines are used, all diesels being from the Duratorq family of engines in and 1.8-litre format, and also and 2.0 TDCi versions, with 2.2 TDCi for more power. Two Petrol engines are now offered, there is the \\"1.6T 160PS EcoBoost Start/Stop\\" and the \\"2.0 203 PS EcoBoost Ford \\"Ford Galaxy Fuel\\" , Ford Website, 21st Oct 2012 However the 1.6l Ecoboost engine has been criticized by the Independent writer Jamie Merrill. He describes the engine as not powerful enough and should have been left in the smaller cars.Jamie Merrill, \\"Ford Galaxy Ecoboost - iDrive\\", The Independent, 21st Oct 2012 In the United Kingdom, the Mk II Galaxy was available in Edge, Zetec, and Ghia trim levels. In February 2008, Ford added the Titanium high level trim in common with the Focus, C-MAX, Kuga, Mondeo and S-MAX ranges. The Titanium model is specified to the same level as the Ghia but adds a 'techno' feel. At the same time, the availability of a 2.2 TDCi engine option (joint design with PSA) was announced. The current trim levels available in the United Kingdom (November 2011) are Zetec, Titanium and Titanium X. The Ford Galaxy also comes with many features such as Home Safe Lighting, Quickclear heated windscreen and a cooled passenger glove box.Ford \\"Ford Galaxy Technology\\" , Ford Website, 21st Oct 2012 One major selling point of the Galaxy and S-MAX is the \\"FoldFlatSystem\\". This design allows the second and third row seats to fold flat into the floor, although this change in seating design reduces the load carrying capacity of the vehicle. This model of car is known as the main vehicle on the British television series Outnumbered, which replaces the Vauxhall Zafira the family had in the older series. == Third generation (CD390, 2015−present) == After its sibling, the Ford S-Max, was presented at the 2014 Paris Motor Show, the all-new Galaxy went on sale in mid-2015.http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/2015-ford- galaxy-prices-and-specifications-revealed Rear view The Galaxy is available with the same range of engines as the S-Max, namely one diesel (in four states of tune) and two petrol variants. The petrol 1.5 SCTi Ecoboost has 160 hp, and the larger 2.0 SCTi has 240 hp, but can only be mated to Ford's Powershift automatic gearbox. At launch, Ford expected only two percent of United Kingdom sales to be petrol models.http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-reviews/ford/ford- galaxy-20-tdci-180-2015-review/ All the diesels average over 50 mpg – the most economical being the 2.0 TDCi Duratorq 120, which manages 57mpg. Both the 2.0 TDCi 150 and 180 versions come with either a six-speed manual gearbox or the Powershift auto – the 180 hp version can also be specced with AWD. The range topping Bi-Turbo 2.0 TDCi 210 comes with the Powershift gearbox only, and can accelerate from 0 to 60 in under nine seconds. The trim levels, mirroring those available in the S-Max, Mondeo and Edge, include Zetec, Titanium and Titanium X. === Mid-cycle facelift === Ford updated the Galaxy for the 2020 model year. It received a new front grille and bumpers with a similar design as the Mondeo, Focus, Fiesta, Puma and Kuga. The Galaxy also received the Vignale version, a new automatic transmission and an updated infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. ==Reviews== The Ford Galaxy was reviewed by What Car?, and was given 4 out of 5 stars.

He was ennobled by Frederick III in 1888. ==Education== Eduard Simson was born in Königsberg, East Prussia, in a Jewish family. The family converted to Protestantism in 1823. After the usual course at the Gymnasium of his native town, he entered its university in 1826 as a student of jurisprudence, and specially of Roman law. He continued his studies at Berlin and Bonn, and, having graduated doctor juris, attended lectures at the École de Droit in Paris. Returning to Königsberg in 1831 he established himself as a Privatdozent in Roman law, becoming two years later extraordinary, and in 1836 ordinary, professor in the faculty of the university. ==National Assembly== Like many other distinguished German jurists, pari passu with his professorial activity, Simson followed the judicial branch of the legal profession, and, passing rapidly through the subordinate stages of auscultator and assessor, became adviser (Rath) to the Landgericht in 1846. In this year he stood for the representation of Königsberg in the National Assembly at Frankfurt am Main, and on his election was immediately appointed secretary, and in the course of the same year became successively its vice-president and president. ==Frederick William IV== In Berlin on 3 April 1849, Simson appeared in his capacity of president at the head of a deputation of the Frankfurt Parliament to announce to King Frederick William IV his election as German Emperor by the representatives of the people. The king, either apprehensive of a rupture with the Austrian Empire, or fearing detriment to the prerogatives of the Prussian crown should he accept this dignity at the hands of a democracy, refused the offer. Simson, bitterly disappointed at the outcome of his mission, resigned his seat in the Frankfurt Parliament, but in the summer of the same year was elected deputy for Königsberg in the popular chamber of the Prussian Landtag. Here he soon made his mark as one of the best orators in that assembly. A member of the short-lived Erfurt Parliament of 1850, he was again summoned to the presidential chair. ==Prussian Landtag== On the dissolution of the Erfurt assembly, Simson retired from politics, and for the next few years devoted himself exclusively to his academical and judicial duties. It was not until 1859 that he re-entered public life, when he was elected deputy for Königsberg in the lower chamber of the Prussian Landtag, of which he was president in 1860 and 1861. In the first of these years he attained high judicial office as president of the court of appeal at Frankfurt (Oder). In 1867, having been elected a member of the constituent assembly of the North German Federation, he again occupied the presidential chair, as he did also in the first regular Diet and the Zoll-parliament which succeeded it. ==William I== On 18 December 1870, Simson arrived at the head of a deputation in the German headquarters at Versailles to offer the imperial crown to the king of Prussia in the name of the newly elected Reichstag. The conditions under which Prussia might justly aspire to the hegemony in Germany at last appeared to have been accomplished; no obstacles, as in 1849, were in the way of the acceptance of the crown by the leading sovereign of the confederation, and on 18 January 1871 King William I of Prussia was proclaimed with all pomp German Emperor in the Salle des Glaces at Palace of Versailles. ==Reichsgericht== Simson continued as president of the Reichstag until 1874, when he retired from the chair, and in 1877 resigned his seat in the Diet, but at Otto von Bismarck's urging, accepted the presidency of the supreme court of justice (Reichsgericht). He filled this high office with great distinction until his final retirement from public life in 1891. Emperor Frederick III bestowed upon Simson the Order of the Black Eagle in 1888. His grave is preserved in the Protestant Friedhof III der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde (Cemetery No. III of the congregations of Jerusalem's Church and New Church) in Berlin-Kreuzberg, south of Hallesches Tor. ==References== * Category:19th-century German people Category:German jurists Category:Prussian politicians Category:Members of the Frankfurt Parliament Category:University of Königsberg faculty Category:Prussian nobility Category:Recipients of the Order of the Black Eagle Category:Members of the Reichstag of the German Empire Category:University of Königsberg alumni Category:Humboldt University of Berlin alumni Category:University of Bonn alumni Category:German Lutherans Category:Converts to Lutheranism from Judaism Category:German Jews Category:People from Königsberg Category:1810 births Category:1899 deaths Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the Zähringer Lion ","title":"Eduard von Simson"},{"id":"1276642","text":"Yewon Arts University is a private university located in Imsil County, North Jeolla province, South Korea.

Active in clubs, on TV, as a session musician and on the pop-rock scene, he toured with Johnny O'Keefe. In 1967 Bertles temporarily joined Sydney-based rock-soul band Max Merritt & The Meteors.

As the Deltics were then in production, it was decided to produce the locomotive on the same production line; the bodyshell used for DP2 reputedly being the eighteenth made. While DP2 looked like a Deltic in outline, there were many detail differences; particularly the large bodyside radiator vents at one end, and the single roof fan as opposed to the four symmetrically placed fans on the Deltics. These differences revealed that DP2 was totally different from the twin-engined Deltics internally, having only a single prime mover and generator. The loco was later updated with electronic control systems to become the forerunner of the Class 50. It was of Co-Co wheel arrangement and was fitted with an English Electric 16CSVT engine of . It had a maximum speed of and weighed . It was initially painted in standard BR Brunswick Green livery and later (from 1965) in two-tone green livery with a light green lower bodyside band. Its first test service was on 2 May 1962, running light from Newton-le-Willows to Chester and back. Its final test with Vulcan Foundry was a fast running test six days later, with a 15-coach train of between Crewe and Penrith, passing Tebay at . On 11 May, the locomotive was lent to the London Midland Region for crew training where it undertook a few Crewe–Birmingham runs. From 14 May 1962, BR tested it on regular London Midland Region services out of London Euston and later on the Eastern Region from London King's Cross. Following its first major overhaul in mid-1965 and clad in new two-tone green Deltic livery, it was used on the Sheffield Pullman workings until 1966. It was fitted with electronic tractive effort and wheel- slip control which gave it superior acceleration to a Deltic, in spite of possessing only 82% of the power. It was placed in a Deltic Diagram covering the 01.32 King's Cross - Edinburgh and the 22.50 Edinburgh - King's Cross, These duties were performed quite punctually and without complaint. In August 1966, it was derailed at station. On 31 July 1967 it was involved in a serious accident at Thirsk, colliding at speed with the de-railed Cliffe (Kent) to Uddingston (Glasgow) cement train. DP2 sustained severe front and left hand side damage, and was taken to York shed where it remained sheeted over. The damage proved to be so great that it was considered uneconomical to repair. It was withdrawn from BR service in September 1967 and moved to the Vulcan Foundry where it was stored until it was dismantled in 1968, its reusable parts being provided to the Class 50 pool of spares. Its engine initially went to D417/50 017 'Royal Oak', but ended its working days in 50 037. == Models == The DP2 \\"Prototype Deltic\\" is being made as a kit and ready-to-run in OO gauge by Silver Fox Models.

As ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, Morgenthau has come to be identified as the most prominent American to speak about the Armenian Genocide. Morgenthau was the father of the politician Henry Morgenthau Jr. His grandchildren include Robert M. Morgenthau, District Attorney of Manhattan for 35 years, and Barbara W. Tuchman, a historian who won the Pulitzer Prize for her book The Guns of August. ==Life== Morgenthau was born the ninth of 11 living children, in Mannheim, Grand Duchy of Baden, in 1856 into an Ashkenazi Jewish family. He was the son of Lazarus and Babette (Guggenheim) Morgenthau. His father was a successful cigar manufacturer who had cigar factories at Mannheim, Lorsch and Heppenheim, employing as many as 1,000 people (Mannheim had a population of 21,000 during this period). His business suffered a severe financial setback during the American Civil War, due to an 1862 tobacco tariff on imports, which closed German tobacco exports to the US forever. The Morgenthau family immigrated to New York in 1866. There, despite considerable savings, his father was not able to re-establish himself in business. His development and marketing of various inventions and his investments in other enterprises failed. Lazarus Morgenthau staved off failure and stabilized his income by becoming a fundraiser for Jewish houses of worship. Henry attended City College of New York, where he received a BA, and later graduated from Columbia Law School. He began his career as a lawyer, but he made a substantial fortune in real estate investments.Balakian. The Burning Tigris, p. 219. In 1898, he acquired 41 lots on New York's Lower East Side from William Waldorf Astor for $850,000.\\"Col. Astor Sells a Block,\\" The New York Times, Dec. 6, 1900. A few years later, he led a syndicate that bought a swath of undeveloped land in Washington Heights around 181st Street, anticipating the construction of the first subway through the area.Clifton Hood, \\"The Impact of the IRT on New York City,\\" in Historical American Engineering Record, Survey Number HAER NY-122, pp. 145–206, available at https://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/The_Impact_of_the_IRT_on_New_York_City_(Hood). Morgenthau married Josephine Sykes in 1882 and they had four children: Helen, Alma, Henry Jr. and Ruth.About Henry Morgenthau. henrymorgenthaupreserve.com His daughter Alma married financier Maurice Wertheim. Morgenthau built a successful career as a lawyer and served as the leader of the Reform Jewish community in New York. === Democratic Party === Morgenthau, Samuel Train Dutton and Cleveland Hoadley Dodge in 1916 Morgenthau's career enabled him to contribute handsomely to President Woodrow Wilson's election campaign in 1912. He had first met Wilson in 1911 at a dinner celebrating the fourth anniversary of the founding of the Free Synagogue society and the two \\"seem to have bonded\\", marking the \\"turning point in Morgenthau's political career\\".Balakian. The Burning Tigris, p. 220. His role in American politics grew more pronounced in later months. Although he did not gain the chairmanship of Wilson's campaign finance committee, Morgenthau was offered the position of ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. He had hoped for a cabinet post as well, but was not successful in gaining one. == Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire == A telegram written by Morgenthau to the State Department in 1915 described the massacres of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire as a \\"campaign of race extermination\\". As an early Wilson supporter, Morgenthau assumed that Wilson would appoint him to a cabinet-level position, but the new President had other plans for him. Like other prominent Jewish Americans, Oscar Straus and Solomon Hirsch before him, Morgenthau was appointed as ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. Wilson's assumption that Jews somehow represented a bridge between Muslim Turks and Christian Armenians rankled Morgenthau; in reply Wilson assured him that the Porte in Istanbul \\"was the point at which the interest of American Jews in the welfare of the Jews of Palestine is focused, and it is almost indispensable that I have a Jew in that post\\". Though no Zionist himself, Morgenthau cared \\"fervidly\\" about the plight of his co- religionists.Oren. Power, Faith, and Fantasy, p. 333. He initially rejected the position, but following a trip to Europe, and with the encouragement of his pro-Zionist friend Rabbi Stephen Wise, he reconsidered his decision and accepted Wilson's offer.Balakian. The Burning Tigris, p. 222. Appointed as U.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire in 1913, he served in this position until 1916. Although the safety of American citizens in the Ottoman Empire, mostly Christian missionaries and Jews, loomed large early in his ambassadorship, Morgenthau said that he was most preoccupied by the Armenian Question.Balakian. The Burning Tigris, p. 223. After the outbreak of war in 1914, the U.S. remained neutral, so the American Embassy – and by extension Morgenthau – additionally represented many of the Allies' interests in Constantinople (Istanbul), since they had withdrawn their diplomatic missions due to the hostilities. As Ottoman authorities began the Armenian Genocide in 1914–1915, the American consuls residing in different parts of the Empire flooded Morgenthau's desk with reports nearly every hour, documenting the massacres and deportation marches taking place. Faced with the accumulating evidence, he officially informed the U.S. government of the activities of the Ottoman government and asked Washington to intervene.Oren. Power, Faith, and Fantasy, pp. 333–336. Audio recording of Chapter 24, \\"The Murder of a Nation\\", from Ambassador Morgenthau's Story. Morgenthau's Story, 1918 The American government however, not wanting to get dragged into disputes, remained a neutral power in the conflict at the time and voiced little official reaction. Morgenthau held high-level meetings with the leaders of the Ottoman Empire to help alleviate the position of the Armenians, but the Turks waived and ignored his protestations. He famously admonished the Ottoman Interior Minister Talaat Pasha, stating: \\"Our people will never forget these massacres.\\"Oren. Power, Faith, and Fantasy, p. 335. As the massacres continued unabated, Morgenthau and several other Americans decided to form a public fund-raising committee to assist the Armenians – the Committee on Armenian Atrocities (later renamed the Near East Relief) – raising over $100 million in aid, the equivalent of $1 billion today. Through his friendship with Adolph Ochs, publisher of the New York Times, Morgenthau also ensured that the massacres continued to receive prominent coverage. The New York Times published 145 articles in 1915 alone.Oren. Power, Faith, and Fantasy, p. 336. Exasperated with his relationship with the Ottoman government, he resigned from the ambassadorship in 1916. Looking back on that decision in his The Murder of a Nation, he wrote he had come to see Turkey as \\"a place of horror. I had reached the end of my resources. I found intolerable my further daily association with men, however gracious and accommodating…who were still reeking with the blood of nearly a million human beings.\\"Oren. Power, Faith, and Fantasy, p. 337. He published his conversations with Ottoman leaders and his account of the Armenian genocide in 1918 under the title Ambassador Morgenthau's Story.Morgenthau, Henry (1918). Ambassador Morgenthau's Story. Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday. In June 1917 Felix Frankfurter accompanied Morgenthau, as a representative of the War Department, on a secret mission to persuade Turkey to abandon the Central Powers in the war effort. The mission had as its stated purpose to \\"ameliorate the condition of the Jewish communities in Palestine\\". In 1918 Morgenthau gave public speeches in the United States warning that the Greeks and Assyrians were being subjected to the \\"same methods\\" of deportation and \\"wholesale massacre\\" as the Armenians, and that two million Armenians, Greeks, and Assyrians had already perished.Travis, Hannibal. \\"Native Christians Massacred: The Ottoman Genocide of the Assyrians during World War I.\\" Genocide Studies and Prevention, Vol. 1, No. 3, December 2006, p. 327. == Interwar period == Following the war, there was much interest and preparation within the Jewish community for the forthcoming Paris Peace Conference, by groups both supportive and opposed to the concept of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. In March 1919, as President Woodrow Wilson was leaving for the Conference, Morgenthau was among 31 prominent Jewish Americans to sign an anti-Zionist petition presented by U.S. Congressman Julius Kahn;Alfred M. Lilienthal, The Zionist Connection II: What Price Peace? (New Brunswick, New Jersey: North American, 1982), pp. 768–769. Cited in Edward C. Corrigan, Jewish Criticism of Zionism , Middle East Policy Council, Journal, Winter 1990–91, Number 35 he and many other prominent Jewish representatives attended the Conference. Morgenthau served as an advisor regarding Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and later worked with war-related charitable bodies, including the Relief Committee for the Middle East, the Greek Refugee Settlement Commission and the American Red Cross. In 1919, he headed the United States government fact- finding mission to Poland, which produced the Morgenthau Report. In 1933, he was the American representative at the Geneva Conference. == Death == above. Morgenthau died in 1946 following a cerebral hemorrhage, in New York City, and was buried in Hawthorne, New York. His son Henry Morgenthau Jr. was a Secretary of the Treasury. His daughter, Alma Wertheim, was married to banker Maurice Wertheim and was the mother of historian Barbara Tuchman. His daughter Ruth Morgenthau was married to banker George W. Naumburg (son of Elkan Naumburg), and then John Knight. == Works == Morgenthau published several books.

Sara Lee is also the brand name of a number of frozen and packaged foods, often known for the long-running slogan \\"Everybody doesn't like something, but nobody doesn't like Sara Lee,\\" often incorrectly reported as \\"Nobody does it like Sara Lee.\\" While the company traced its lineage to 1939, when Nathan Cummings acquired C. D. Kenny Company, a wholesale distributor of sugar, coffee, and tea in Baltimore, the Sara Lee Corporation was actually the descendant of a Chicago grocery store called Sprague, Warner & Company. This enterprise, which started on State Street in Chicago, was founded during the Civil War by Albert A. Sprague and Ezra J. Warner. By 1909, Sprague, Warner & Company was one of the leading wholesale grocery companies in the United States, famous for house brands such as Richelieu, Ferndell, and Batavia. In 1942, this company was acquired by the Canadian-born Cummings. The new Chicago-based company, at first called Sprague Warner–Kenny Corp., ranked as the largest grocery wholesaler in the United States. Annual sales grew from about $20 million in 1942 to $120 million by 1946. After changing its name in 1945 to Consolidated Grocers, Cummings's company became the Consolidated Foods Corporation in 1953.\\"Consolidated Foods Corp.\\" Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago. Retrieved on May 1, 2014. In 1956, the company bought a company known as Kitchens of Sara Lee, which became one of the company's best-known brand names. Management adopted the brand name as the name of the corporation as a whole in 1985. As of 2005, Sara Lee Corporation had operations in more than 40 countries; sold food, beverage, and household products in over 180 countries; and had some 137,000 employees worldwide. On July 4, 2012, Sara Lee Corporation was split into two companies—one for North American operations which would be renamed Hillshire Brands (the Sara Lee name would continue to be used on bakery and certain deli products distributed by Hillshire Brands), the other for international beverage and bakery businesses named D.E Master Blenders 1753. ==History== Prior to 1985, The Sara Lee Corporation was called Consolidated Foods, of which Sara Lee was the best known brand. Consolidated Foods had bought a Chicago bakery chain called Kitchens of Sara Lee in 1956 from Charles Lubin. Lubin had named his bakeries after his daughter, Sara Lee. She was born in 1941, and now goes by her married name, Sara Lee Schupf. Despite being named after a real person, the actual image of Sara never appeared on the packaging; only the name. In 1986, Sara Lee bought the manufacturing and mail order operations of Wolferman's, a maker of English muffins, that dated back to 1888. In February 1988, Sara Lee agreed to the purchase of the 84-year-old Adams-Millis Corporation of High Point, North Carolina, the largest private label sock and stocking manufacturer in the United States, with 3000 employees and 1987 sales of nearly $200 million. On June 25, 2001, Sara Lee Corp pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and agreed to pay $4.4 million for selling tainted meat that was blamed for at least 15 deaths and six miscarriages in 1998; the agreement stressed that Sara Lee's Bil Mar Foods division did not knowingly distribute the tainted meat. On August 7, 2001, Sara Lee Corp cleared the last remaining regulatory hurdle in its purchase of Earthgrains Co, receiving approval from the European Commission (S). Brenda C. Barnes joined Sara Lee Corporation in July 2004 as the President and Chief Operating Officer. Then in February 2005, Barnes was named President and Chief Executive Officer, and the corporation announced it would move its headquarters from Cincinnati, Ohio, to Downers Grove, Illinois, which housed the company's North American operating businesses and the majority of Sara Lee's corporate staff. Also in February 2005, the company began executing a multi-year plan to transform Sara Lee into a company focused on its food, beverage, and household and body care businesses around the world. To support that focus, Sara Lee announced plans to dispose of approximately 40 percent of the company's revenues, including its apparel, European packaged meats, US retail coffee and direct selling businesses. On December 22, 2005, Sara Lee Corporation was to delist from Euronext Amsterdam and Euronext Paris stock exchanges, as well as the Swiss Exchange. The company said it was taking the voluntary step due to low trading volumes on those exchanges. 2005 also saw the debut of Sara Lee Soft & Smooth made with whole grain white bread. In October, Barnes succeeded C. Steven McMillan as chairman. The year ended with the sale of the direct selling business to Tupperware. In 2006, Sara Lee announced a new company wide campaign: \\"the joy of eating.\\" The campaign was part of a restructuring at Sara Lee. 2006 featured the divestiture of Sara Lee's European meats and European branded apparel businesses. In addition, the corporation spun off to its shareholders the branded apparel, Americas/Asia, business, into a separate, publicly traded company called Hanesbrands Inc. Including the spin-off, Sara Lee raised more than $3.7 billion in proceeds as part of the company's transformation plan. In addition to the monetary benefits, the company became tightly focused on its core businesses—food, beverage, and household and body care. In 2008, Sara Lee sold off its Direct Store Delivery foodservice coffee business to Farmer Brothers for a reported $45 million. By 2009, Sara Lee was pursuing the sale of its household and body care business in their continuing effort to focus on core business. In April, Sara Lee launched a state-of-the-art research and development center named The Kitchens of Sara Lee, a campus at the company's headquarters in Downers Grove, Ill. On September 25, 2009, Sara Lee announced it accepted a binding offer by Unilever for €1.275 billion to sell its global body care and European detergents business. The transaction was approved by EU regulators in November of the following year. On November 9, 2010, Sara Lee said that by selling its North American Fresh Bakery unit to Grupo Bimbo, it could grow in other areas. The $959 million deal gave Sara Lee the right to continue using the Sara Lee name on frozen desserts and meat products. Grupo Bimbo was to use the Sara Lee name for fresh-baked products around the world except for Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand. The deal also gave Grupo Bimbo 41 baking plants, and the regional brands Grandma Sycamore's, Heiner's and Rainbo. On January 28, 2011, Sara Lee announced the company would be split into two units. The company said its North American operations (including Jimmy Dean, Ball Park and Hillshire Farm) would take the Hillshire Brands corporate name, while the international beverage and bakery businesses (including Douwe Egberts, Senseo, Pickwick, Maison du Café, L'OR, Café Pilão, and Marcilla) would constitute a separate unit named D.E Master Blenders 1753. Some analysts claimed splitting the business into two units would make a takeover more likely. Stockholders would have equal shares in both companies. In the same month, Sara Lee received noted media attention regarding their strategy to \\"refocus on the core\\" to revamp the company. In a Forbes magazine column, Adam Hartung stated Sara Lee could not \\"cost-cut, refocus or re-align a business to success with no new products and no growth plan.\\" Also, Marcel Smits, interim CEO since Barnes suffered a stroke, became the new CEO, and Jan Bennink director and chairman. The split was completed on July 4, 2012. The successor company, Hillshire Brands, re-located its headquarters from Downers Grove to Chicago in 2012. In 2014, Hillshire, along with the Sara Lee operations, was acquired by Tyson Foods. On June 1, 2018, Tyson announced that it would sell the Sara Lee, Van's, Chef Pierre and Bistro Collection brands to Kohlberg & Company. The sale was completed on August 1, forming Sara Lee Frozen Bakery, which will be based in Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois. ==Company== ===Governance=== Some former members of the board of directors of Sara Lee are: Christopher B. Begley, Crandall Bowles, Virgis W. Colbert, James S. Crown, Laurette T. Koellner, Dr. John McAdam, Sir Ian Prosser, Rozanne L. Ridgway, Norman R. Sorensen, Jeffrey W.

Such brands included Dim, Playtex, Wonderbra, Lovable, Abanderado, Nur Die, Unno and Bellinda. Sara Lee Corporation announced on Sept 28, 2009, that it had received a binding offer for its Global Body Care and European Detergents to Unilever for €1.275 billion. On June 1, 2010 Sara Lee announced it had completed the sale of its 51 percent stake in its Godrej Sara Lee joint venture to Godrej Consumer Products Ltd. for a total consideration of €185 million ($230 million). On June 15, 2010, the company announced that it had received a binding offer of $153.5 million for its remaining insecticides business. The offer is dependent on European Union antitrust approval; the decision is due May 2, 2011. On July 5, 2010, Sara Lee completed the sale of its Ambi Pur air care business to Procter & Gamble for €320 million. On April 4, 2011, Sara Lee completed the sale of its Kiwi shoe care business to SC Johnson for €245 million. In 2010, Sara Lee completed the sale of White King and Janola brands to Symex for €38 million. In addition, Sara Lee announced the pending sale of its non-Indian insecticides business to SC Johnson for €153.5 million. In 2010, Sara Lee divested its North American fresh bakery business to Grupo Bimbo. In 2012, Hillshire Brands sold its Australian bakery operations to McCain Foods. ===Discontinued=== On November 19, 2008, Sara Lee Corporation, which had acquired \\"the No. 2 kosher hot dog brand\\" in 1993, announced that it would close its kosher hot dog and meat processing facility in Chicago, on or before January 30, 2009. Sara Lee decided to exit the kosher meat business and discontinue processing and distributing products made under all of its kosher meat brands, including: Best's Kosher, Sinai Kosher, Shofar and Wilno. As of early 2019, certain Sara Lee bread and other baked goods products, which had dropped some kosher certifications in 2017, restored them. ==Consumer relations== Throughout 2012, Sara Lee contributed $343,600 to a $46 million political campaign known as \\"The Coalition Against The Costly Food Labeling Proposition, sponsored by Farmers and Food Producers.\\" This organization was set up to oppose a California citizen's initiative, known as Proposition 37, demanding mandatory labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients. ==The Sara Lee Foundation== The Sara Lee Foundation was founded in 1981 to formalize Sara Lee's dedication to community services. ==See also== * List of Illinois companies * HanesBrands, a former subsidiary of Sara Lee ==References== ==External links== * HanesBrands.com Company Site * Nathan Cummings Founder * Ambi Pur Brand website * Cruz+Verde Insecticides website Category:Food product brands Category:Food manufacturers of the United States Category:Defunct companies based in Chicago Category:Defunct companies based in Illinois Category:American companies established in 1939 Category:Food and drink companies established in 1939 Category:Food and drink companies disestablished in 2012 Category:1939 establishments in Illinois Category:2012 disestablishments in Illinois Category:Companies based in DuPage County, Illinois Category:Downers Grove, Illinois Category:United States National Medal of Arts recipients Category:Companies formerly listed on the New York Stock Exchange Category:Grupo Bimbo brands Category:American brands ","title":"Sara Lee Corporation"},{"id":"1276669","text":"Cape May Station and Welcome Center (bus station and former train station) Cape May Seashore Lines is a short line railroad in southern New Jersey. It offers two excursion services; a round trip between Richland and Tuckahoe, and a round trip between Rio Grande, Cold Spring Village, and Cape May City. The track is owned by NJ Transit and leased to the Seashore Lines. Connections are provided with Conrail's Beesley's Point Secondary, owned jointly by CSX and Norfolk Southern, at the north end in Tuckahoe. Tony Macrie has been president of the Seashore Lines since he formed the railroad in 1984. CMSL operates both freight trains and excursion trains. ==History== ===Predecessor lines=== The line to Cape May was built in 1863 by the Tuckahoe and Cape May Railroad, and operated by the Philadelphia and Reading Railway's Atlantic City Railroad and later Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines (PRSL). At one time, the rail line was known as \\"The Steel Speedway To The Shore”. Eventually it became part of Conrail, which ended passenger service on the line in 1981, ended freight service on October 10, 1983 and sold the line to New Jersey Transit as their Cape May Branch.sjrails.com \\"History of Trains to the Shore.\\" Cape May Seashore Lines Page. Accessed 2012-11-05. ===Establishment of CMSL=== The Seashore Lines was founded by Tony Macrie (CEO) in January 1984. Regular train service between Cape May Court House and Cold Spring Village began in 1996. Service was extended in Cape May City in 1999 after repairs to the swing bridge crossing the Cape May Canal were completed. In 2005, mechanical issues with the Cape May Canal swing bridge prevented trains from entering the city of Cape May. Although the bridge was repaired a year later, a severe storm in April 2007 damaged the tracks and left locomotives stranded in Tuckahoe. Passenger train service between Rio Grande and Cape May City resumed on October 12, 2009. ===New Jersey Seashore Lines=== New Jersey Seashore Lines (NJSL) is a subsidiary of Cape May Seashore Lines. New Jersey Seashore Lines was created by Cape May Seashore Lines in conjunction with the Clayton Sand Co. in Chatsworth. Using state and federal grants New Jersey Seashore Lines has rehabilitated of track between Lakehurst and the Woodmansie section of Chatsworth (which itself is part of Woodland Township), where Clayton operates a sand mine. New Jersey Seashore Lines had originally planned to operate rail service to transport sand and gravel from Clayton and serve the needs of any other customers that might need rail service along the line. The line was originally owned by the Central Railroad of New Jersey and was once part of the route of the famed Blue Comet. South of Woodmansie the tracks are abandoned leaving no connection from the south. Neither CMSL, their subsidiary NJSL or Clayton Sand Co. have released any information on the current or future plans for the line and if or when operation may begin. ===Lines=== *Richland- Tuckahoe Station, Tuckahoe *Rio Grande Station, Rio Grande - Cape May === Current Service === The Seashore Lines currently operates excursion trains on 15 miles of Conrail's Beesley's Point Secondary between Tuckahoe and Richland. Current passenger train operations include the Valentine’s Express, St. Patrick’s Express, Fall Foliage Express, and the Santa Express service. Train sets primarily consist of the railroad's two GP38 diesel locomotives and two to four coach cars. The Seashore Lines also operates occasional passenger excursions for the Buena Vista Township / Richland Village Festival. ===2012 vandalism=== On March 1, 2012, the Seashore Lines received a telephone call from the New Jersey State Police, advising them that theft of track material had occurred on their Cape May Branch in Dennisville. This is the Seashore Lines’ main line between Tuckahoe and Cape May City. The investigating trooper informed them that several individuals associated with the theft had been arrested and charged with indictable offenses. Arrested on Monday, March 5, were a father and son team from the Villas section of Lower Township, New Jersey, along with a third individual from Rio Grande. Several days later, Macrie and two Seashore Lines employees conducted a detailed track inspection of the entire area of the theft, which consisted primarily of the removal of tie plates and spikes. This inspection concluded that the area of the theft encompassed approximately 6,800 feet (1 1/4 miles), or 75 percent of the total number of tie plates and spikes in that particular section of track. In their actions to remove the tie plates and spikes, the perpetrators also damaged and destroyed numerous cross ties. Excursion trains did not run during the summer of 2012 due to the damage from the vandalism. The company offered rides to the public on railroad speeder vehicles along several miles of track on the Cape May Branch. As of early 2020, service into Cape May has not resumed. ==Roster== The Seashore Lines owns and leases a large roster of equipment: *Three EMD GP38's, two leased from GATX, one leased from LLPX.

It was designed by English Electric engineer J. O. P. Hughes in a project that started in the early 1950s. Externally it resembled a steam tender locomotive, although, in the case of GT3, the tender carried kerosene fuel. The designer stated the use of a traditional chassis arrangement and mechanical transmission was to avoid complicating the prototype with (at the time of its conception) relatively untried technologies with regard to bogie assemblies and electrical transmission. ==Overview== The National Railway Museum Archives hold the JOP Hughes papers which contain initial concept sketches for various 4-8-4 wheel arrangement single-unit configurations of the machine and early 4-6-0 tender locomotive drawings. These early concept drawings show various names, numbers and liveries, and were drawn with Boxpok-type wheels. The final design was for a 4-6-0 wheel arrangement locomotive with a fuel tender, looking much like a traditional steam locomotive in form. As constructed the locomotive was built with bespoke heavy steel frames which not only bore the auxiliaries, combustion chamber, turbines, heat exchanger and locomotive cab, but also provided adhesive weight for the finished machine. The frames were carried by a leading two axle outside framed bogie and three main axles. The driving wheels were of conventional design in the finished locomotive and were of 5 foot 9 inch diameter with 19 spokes and conventional balance weights. The centre axle mounted a mechanical transmission shaft driven from the turbine assembly, with power to the outer axles being transmitted by side rods. Power came from an English Electric EM27L gas turbine arrangement of with high and low pressure turbines. The low pressure turbine ran continuously in operation and was used to drive the locomotives auxiliaries, with the high pressure turbine operating as higher power outputs were required. Both the locomotive and its fuel tender were vacuum braked, with vacuum brake ejectors being driven by air pressure bled from the turbine. The locomotive's other auxiliaries (housed in its leading end beneath the large side air intakes) were shaft and belt driven. The tender was permanently coupled behind the locomotive and contained a Spanner train heating boiler at the leading end and fuel tanks either side of a central corridor with a boiler water tank beneath. A crew toilet compartment and British Standard corridor connection were located at the rear. The six wheel chassis was based on then standard British Railways practice, albeit it with specially made and shaped side frames and bespoke tank and bodywork assembled at Vulcan Foundry. The locomotive had a designed maximum speed of , weighed , and was painted in a lined Beech Leaf Brown Livery, earning it the nickname \\"The Chocolate Zephyr\\" amongst railway enthusiasts. Underframes, grilles and the front access and cab doors were painted Brunswick Green with lettering and lining in Orange. == Testing == The locomotive was taken to British Railway's Rugby test centre in an incomplete state for testing on rollers, and then on a short section of specially laid track. After returning to Vulcan Foundry for final assembly, the locomotive was then based at the former locomotive shed at Whitchurch in Shropshire for initial light testing and crew training on the Malpas Line, before commencing loaded test runs to Llandudno. One of these runs was filmed from on board the locomotive by British Movietone News and the resulting film also shows the locomotive being turned on Llandudno Junction turntable. In the event not all of the planned North Wales Coast Line test runs were completed. GT3 then moved to Leicester Shed on the former Great Central Main Line line for testing and crew training between Leicester and Woodford Halse and then Leicester and Marylebone. Leicester was convenient for English Electric’s Whetstone turbine works. During this period it was displayed at Marylebone for the 50th anniversary of the Institute of Locomotive Engineers. The event ran from 11–14 May 1961 and GT3 was filmed by British Pathe being inspected by the Duke of Edinburgh. Later testing was undertaken on the West Coast Main Line from Crewe over Shap summit. On one of these runs O S Nock travelled on board and was able to both witness the locomotive in operation and record its performance, his log of the trip later appearing in Railway Magazine's practice and performance feature for February 1962. Commenting on the testing the designer noted that, despite some of the expected teething troubles and modifications, once it had departed on a test run GT3 had never failed to complete its booked workings. The locomotive was described as being comfortable and easy to handle for the crew, with conversation at normal volumes possible in the fully enclosed cab. == Demise == Despite returning favourable performances on longer runs requiring sustained power outputs, the prototype nature of the locomotive would have required further investigation and development into a configuration which would have matched the convenience of the new double ended diesel electric locomotives then being built. Neither English Electric or British Railways were prepared to fund this work as at the same time both were already heavily committed to the diesel electric concept, with English Electric in particular fully engaged in manufacturing diesel-electric locomotives of many types (including the Deltic). These were rapidly becoming the future of rail traction with ever-increasing power to weight ratios. Upon completion of the Shap test runs GT3 was returned to English Electric at Vulcan Foundry at the end of 1962 and stored. Following internal correspondence in September 1965 the locomotive was partially dismantled and its turbine and heat exchanger equipment removed. It was finally scrapped at Thos W Ward, Salford in February 1966 having been towed there by a BR standard steam locomotive. == Surviving Records == The most complete record of the locomotive is contained in the paper written by its designer in 1962 and in his papers now held at the National Railway Museum Archives in York. Much of what had been written about the locomotive was based on conjecture until these sources became available; subsequently an article in Railway Magazine for December 2015 brought together an accurate and verifiable record of the locomotive. No detailed engineering drawings of the locomotives as built are thought to have survived, the York archive containing an internal memo instructing that these were to be returned to the Gas Turbine division of English Electric when dismantling commenced in 1965. Several articles with drawings have appeared in the railway modelling press since the locomotive was scrapped, but most appear to be based on a contemporary sectional view widely published at the time and are flawed with regard to details such as driving wheels (19 spoke), roof and side access hatches, cab rear, tender front and tender rear. The most accurate drawing appears to have been a contemporary \\"Skinley\\" drawing produced with the assistance of JOP Hughes. A copy resides with correspondence between Hughes and Skinley in the JOP Hughes papers at the National Railway Museum. In recent years a 5-inch gauge turbine powered model of the locomotive has been built and exhibited in the UK. ==References== Category:British Railways gas turbine locomotives Category:English Electric locomotives Category:Vulcan Foundry locomotives Category:4-6-0 locomotives Category:Experimental locomotives Category:Individual locomotives of Great Britain Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1961 Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Great Britain Category:Scrapped locomotives Category:Unique locomotives ","title":"British Rail GT3"},{"id":"1276673","text":"Patrick Anthony Jennings (born 12 June 1945) is a Northern Irish former footballer. He played 119 international matches for Northern Ireland as a goalkeeper, in an international career which lasted for over 22 years. During his career Jennings played for Newry Town, Watford, and in the top division with Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal, winning the FA Cup with both of the north London rivals. In total, Jennings made over 1,000 top level appearances, and despite being a goalkeeper he scored in the 1967 FA Charity Shield. == Club career == === Newry Town & Watford === After playing for Shamrock Rovers' under-18 side at the age of 11, Jennings concentrated on Gaelic football until he was sixteen years old, when he made his soccer comeback with his hometown side Newry Town. After impressing with the team he moved to English Third Division side Watford in May 1963. Jennings again impressed in his first season in England, playing every league game for his club, and making two international appearances that season. He was signed by Tottenham Hotspur for £27,000 in June 1964. === Tottenham Hotspur === Jennings spent thirteen years at White Hart Lane, where he played in 472 league games for Spurs, and 591 in all competitions. He won the FA Cup in 1967, the League Cup in 1971 and 1973, and the UEFA Cup in 1972. He also scored once, in the 1967 Charity Shield, from his own area, kicking the ball from his hands and sending a large punt down the field that bounced over Manchester United goalkeeper Alex Stepney and into the net. In 1973 the Football Writers' Association named him as its footballer of the year. Three years later he won PFA's version of the award – he was the first goalkeeper to receive this accolade, and to this date remains only one of two, along with Peter Shilton. === Arsenal === In August 1977, he was transferred to Tottenham's arch-rivals, Arsenal, with Tottenham thinking he was nearing the end of his career. However, Jennings saw off rivals for the goalkeeper's jersey to play for Arsenal for another eight years. Whilst at Highbury, he helped Arsenal to four Cup finals in three successive years; the FA Cup final in 1978, 1979, and 1980, as well as the European Cup Winners Cup final that year. However, Arsenal only managed to win the second of these finals, a 3–2 victory against Manchester United. In total, Jennings made 327 appearances for Arsenal, 237 of them in the League, between 1977 and his eventual retirement from first-team club football in 1985. On 26 February 1983, he became the first player in English football to make 1,000 senior appearances, celebrating this milestone with a clean sheet in a goalless league draw for Arsenal at West Bromwich Albion. === Later career === After his retirement, Jennings returned to Tottenham Hotspur, playing mostly in their reserve side to maintain his match sharpness for Northern Ireland's 1986 World Cup campaign. His final appearance for Tottenham was in the Football League Super Cup against Liverpool in January 1986. He was also briefly on Everton's books, having been signed as goalkeeping cover for the 1986 FA Cup Final against Liverpool, Neville Southall having been injured playing for Wales. == International career == Pat Jennings defending his goal against the Netherlands (1976) Jennings made his Northern Ireland debut as an eighteen- year-old, whilst playing for Watford. This game, on 15 April 1964, was a British Home Championship match against Wales, Northern Ireland won the game 3–2; George Best made his international debut in the same game. Despite retiring from club football in 1985, Jennings played his final international game at the 1986 World Cup, on his 41st birthday, making him at the time the World Cup's oldest-ever participant. The match was Northern Ireland's final group game, a 3–0 defeat against Brazil. In total, Jennings participated in the qualifying stages of six World Cups between 1966 and 1986. == Retirement == Following his retirement Jennings has worked as a goalkeeping coach. He has worked at Tottenham in this capacity since 1993. In 2003 Jennings was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in recognition of the skills he demonstrated in the English league. His son, also named Pat, is also a goalkeeper, having played for League of Ireland clubs University College Dublin, Derry City, Shamrock Rovers and NIFL Premiership club Glenavon. Jennings and his family have lived for many years in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, where his son attended The Broxbourne School along with the sons of fellow Spurs players Chris Hughton, Osvaldo Ardiles and Ray Clemence. He is still associated with Spurs and hosts Corporate Hospitality fans in the Pat Jennings Lounges at White Hart Lane and Windsor Park, Belfast. == Honours == === Club === Tottenham Hotspur *FA Cup: 1966–67 *League Cup: 1970–71, 1972–73 *FA Charity Shield: 1967 *UEFA Cup: 1971–72 Arsenal *FA Cup: 1978–79 === Individual === * FWA Footballer of the Year: 1972–73 * PFA Players' Player of the Year: 1975–76 * PFA First Division Team of the Year: 1973–74, 1975–76 * FWA Tribute Award: 1986 * Football League 100 Legends: 1998 * English Football Hall of Fame: 2003 == References == ==Further reading== * Jennings, Pat (1983).

Hildner, just 24 years old, entered the Dachau concentration camp in September 1944 as an Aufseherin. Next she was sent to an Agfa Camera-werke-connected subcamp at Munich; she eventually served in several subcamps, including Hennigsdorf, Wittenberg and Haselhorst.

In April 1945, the guards at the small camp evacuated the women in the face of the U.S. Army. Hildner was one of several guards on the death march who took part in mistreatment and murder of several young girls with her rod.

It is one of two species in the genus Chlorocardium. It is native to Guyana and Suriname in South America.Red List Standards & Petitions Working Group. 2007. Chlorocardium rodiei. In: IUCN 2013. IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2013.1. Downloaded on 24 July 2013. Other common names include cogwood, demerara greenheart, ispingo moena, sipiri, bebeeru and bibiru. It is an evergreen tree growing 15 to 30 m tall with a trunk diameter of 35 to 60 cm. The leaves are oppositely arranged and simple with smooth edges. The fruit is a drupe containing a single seed. Greenheart wood was used to build the gate for the Manchester Dock in Liverpool. The cyclic bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid rodiasine was first isolated from this species. The wood is extremely hard and strong, so hard that it cannot be worked with standard tools. It is durable in marine conditions, so it is used to build docks and other structures, and it was an early choice for fly fishing rods. An estimated 15 to 28% of the original population has been harvested. The species' use as a commercial timber began in the late 18th century, but most of the harvesting has taken place since the introduction of chainsaws in 1967. The Fram and the Endurance, made famous in the polar expeditions of Amundsen and Shackleton, were the two strongest wooden ships ever constructed and were sheathed in greenheart to prevent them from being crushed by ice. Greenheart wood is often sought for construction projects in parts of the Caribbean, where wood ants are problematic in conventional pine wood construction. It was also used to build the dock gates in Liverpool, such as the Manchester dock gate. ==References== ==External links== *Germplasm Resources Information Network: Chlorocardium *Virtual Tree Guide of the Guyanas: Chlorocardium herbarium specimens *Guyana Forestry Commission: Guyana Woods (pdf file; Greenheart, p. 7).

He had one sister always known as Annchen: she married Dr. Siegfried Ollendorf and ultimately left Germany for Palestine. His family was Jewish. Alfred said while still at school that he intended to shorten his name to Kerr, the change became official in 1909. He studied literature in Berlin with Erich Schmidt and completed his Ph.D. at the University of Halle. Alfred Kerr worked as a theatre critic for Der Tag and later for the Berliner Tageblatt. He wrote weekly Berliner Briefe for the Breslauer Zeitung from 1895-1900 and for the Königsberger Allgemeine Zeitung from 1897-1922. With the publisher Paul Cassirer he founded the artistic review Pan in 1910. ===Career=== Kerr changed his surname to avoid association with Friederike Kempner. Kerr was noted for his treatment of drama criticism as another branch of literary criticism. As his fame grew he engaged in polemics, with the critics Maximilian Harden, Herbert Ihering and Karl Kraus in particular. In the 1920s he was hostile to Bertolt Brecht, and assailed him with accusations of plagiarism. ===Exile=== In 1933 Kerr was warned by a policeman that his passport was about to be confiscated. He fled to Prague immediately. His wife Julia and their children followed him to Switzerland later. They then went to Paris and then, after the purchase of a film script by Alexander Korda, to England. (These years of exile are described, from a child's perspective, by Kerr's daughter, author Judith Kerr, in her Out of the Hitler Time trilogy.) His books were amongst those burnt in May 1933 by the Nazis when they came to power; Kerr had attacked the Nazi Party publicly very early on and Goebbels said before Hitler came to power that Kerr would be one of the first he would shoot. He lived in penury in London. He was a founder of the Freier Deutscher Kulturbund, and worked for the German PEN club. An old feud with Karl Kraus worked against him at the BBC. Kerr became naturalised as a British subject in 1947. In 1948 he visited Hamburg at the start of a planned tour of several German cities but suffered a stroke, and then decided to end his own life via an overdose of Veronal, procured for him by his wife. He was buried, without references to religion according to his wishes, in Ohlsdorf Cemetery in the position \\"Z 21-217\\" and his wife was cremated with her ashes buried at the foot of his grave when she died in 1965. The Alfred-Kerr-Preis für Literaturkritik was established in 1977. His Berliner Briefe for the Breslauer Zeitung were published as Wo liegt Berlin in 1997, Warum fliesst der Rhein nicht durch Berlin and as Was ist der Mensch in Berlin in 2017. Wo liegt Berlin was a best-seller and the proceeds were given by Michael and Judith Kerr to the Kerr Foundation in Berlin which awards an annual Kerr Prize for a young actor. An eight volume edition of his works has been published and a biography of 720 pages appeared in 2016. ==Family== Alfred Kerr married for the first time when he was over 50, to Ingeborg Thormählen, who was much younger than he, and who shortly afterwards died in the 1918 flu pandemic while pregnant; the bereavement affected him deeply. His second marriage was to the talented musician, Julia Weismann (1898–1965) in 1920. Julia was the daughter of a Prussian Secretary of State, . The Kerrs' son Michael Kerr became a prominent British lawyer. Their daughter Judith Kerr wrote a three- volume autobiography and the children's books The Tiger Who Came To Tea and the Mog series; the writer Matthew Kneale is her son with Nigel Kneale, the author of Quatermass scripts. ==Works== Memorial plaque in Berlin-Grunewald *Godwi.

It emerged in 1970 as an extreme left-wing group that split from the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF). After achieving Eritrean independence in 1991, it transformed into the People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ), which serves as Eritrea's only legal political party. ==Background== EPLF and Eritrean Liberation Front first fought during the Eritrean Civil War. In the early 1980s, new armed conflicts between the rival Eritrean Liberation Front led to the front being marginalized and pushed into neighboring Sudan. The EPLF remained the only relevant opposition to Ethiopian occupation in Eritrea. The EPLF captured many Ethiopian soldiers during the war and kept them in numerous prisoner of war camps, although captured soldiers of the EPLF (of their own) were not afforded the same treatment. These POWs were not harmed by their captors, but instead were indoctrinated about the principles of the EPLF, as well as global politics. Some segments of the EPLF went as far as teaching prisoners of war some trades and skills. During its protracted struggle the EPLF constructed an underground hospital. In these hospitals surgeries were conducted as well as the production of various pharmaceuticals (the first of its kind made by Eritreans). The front also constructed schools in the rebel areas, as well as underground and partially outdoor schools for the children of the EPLF (i.e. Winna). In 1988, the EPLF started an attack from the northern province of Sahel towards the south. The EPLF emerged as the dominant rebel force as early as 1977 and continued the struggle of the Eritrean War of Independence. In 1991 the EPLF succeeded in the conflict on May 24, 1991. ==Battles== Adi Yakob – Embaderho front (Northern front), Adi Hawsha – Sela'e Da'ero front (Southern front), Military Retreat (Soviet intervention; overthrow of Ethiopian Empire by Derg), Ela Beri'ed, Massawa I (Salina salt fields) 1977, Nakfa, Afabet, Massawa II 1990, Ginda'e front, Dekemihare front. ==Administration== rightthumbMembers of Executive Committee of EPLF 1977–1987 standing: Ogbe Abraha, Ali Said Abdella, Sebhat Ephrem, Haile Woldetinsae, Petros Solomon, Mohammed Said Bareh, Mesfin Hagos, Al-Amin Mohammed Seid sitting: Berhane Gherezgiher, Ibrahim Afa, Romedan Mohammed Nur, Isaias Afewerki, Mahmoud Shrifo The First Congress of the EPLF occurred in January 1977 and formally set out the policies of this new organization. At this first meeting a Secretary-General and Assistant Secretary-General were elected and a program adopted. This program specifically targeted a liberalization of women's rights as well as a broad educational policy for maintaining every language and improving literacy. It was also set out that the boundaries of an Eritrean state would be based on the colonial treaties of Italy. The Second Congress in 1987 brought together the EPLF and the Eritrean Liberation Front/Central Leadership (also sometimes referred to as Central Command, CC) in what was called the Unity Congress. This was the culmination of negotiations over three years which had brought together the two fighting forces in October 1986 under a unified command. On this congress, Isaias Afewerki replaced secretary-general Ramadan Nur. Subsequently, the movement abandoned most of its formerly Marxist–Leninist ideology, in favour of an own revolutionary left-wing concept and a more comprehensive and pragmatic approach to unite all Eritrean nationalists. The Third and last Congress of the EPLF was held in 1994 in Asmara. It was important as it converted the Front from a military organization to a purely political movement. At this Congress, the name of the organization was changed to the People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ). ==References== ==External links== *Official Website *List of incidents attributed to the Eritrean Peoples Liberation Front on the START database Category:African socialist political parties Category:Communism in Eritrea Category:Defunct communist militant groups Category:Eritrean nationalism Category:Eritrean War of Independence Category:Factions of the Ethiopian Civil War Category:History of Eritrea Category:National liberation movements in Africa Category:Parties of one-party systems Category:Political parties disestablished in 1994 Category:Political parties established in 1970 Category:Rebel groups in Eritrea Category:Rebel groups in Ethiopia ","title":"Eritrean People's Liberation Front"},{"id":"1276711","text":"Best Actor in a Supporting Role may refer to: * AACTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role * BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role * Zee Cine Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role – Male * Zee Cine Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role – Female See also List of awards for supporting actor ","title":"Best Actor in a Supporting Role"},{"id":"1276717","text":"Cousteau can refer to: == Music == *Cousteau (band), a British band == People == *Jacques-Yves Cousteau (1910–1997), a French marine explorer who invented the aqua-lung and pioneered marine conservation *.

It traces its beginnings to the foundation of Poznań University in 1919, and was formed as a separate institution in 1950. It gained the status of uniwersytet in 2007. ==History== The history of Poznan University of Medical Sciences started in 1919 when a pharmaceutical department was created at the University of Poznań. A year later (in 1920) the Faculty of Medicine was founded within it (in fact, this faculty existed since 1919 as a part of Poznań Society of Friends of Arts and Sciences). The chair of Dentistry was created in 1929. The first rector of Poznan University was Heliodor Święcicki and first dean of the Faculty of Medicine was Professor Adam Wrzosek. In the late autumn of 1939, the University of Poznań was closed by German occupation authorities, but many of its professors continued to teach. In 1940 an underground University of Western Poland was formed in Warsaw which comprised the faculties of Medicine, Pharmacy and Dentistry. In 1941, the Polish School of Medicine at the University of Edinburgh was founded, where the first dean was surgeon Antoni Jurasz from the University of Poznań. In the last months of the war, during the battle of Poznań, preparations for reopening of the university were begun. The university officially reopened in April 1945, before the end of the war. According to a plan of reform in 1950, the Medical Faculty, with the Department of Dentistry and the Faculty of Pharmacy of University of Poznań, were detached to form an independent school named the University of Medical Sciences. In 1975 a new Faculty of Nursing was founded, and in 1979 a Department of Medical Analytics was opened. In 1984, the Sejm (the Polish national parliament) named the school after Karol Marcinkowski, a distinguished Polish physician and patriot of the first half of the 19th century who had lived in Poznań, and who was a symbol of the highest professional and ethical values in medicine. In 1992 the Faculty of Medicine was divided into Faculty of Medicine I, responsible for the six-year Polish M.D. program, and Faculty of Medicine II, comprising the divisions of Dentistry, Post Graduate Medical Education and Medicine and Dentistry with English as the teaching language. In 1991, the university introduced programs in English, starting in 1993 with the four-year M.D. program based entirely on the American curriculum and the requirements of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) system. A six-year M.D. program in English based on the European model followed a year later. Both programs have instituted National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) subject examinations and compulsory completion on USMLE licensing examinations as a requirement for students. Subsequently, PUMS reached the last of its planned English-language based projects with the introduction of a five-year Dentistry program in 2000, and five-year M.Sc. Pharmacy program in 2004, which was replaced by the six-year Pharm. D. program in 2009, and three-year B.Sc. Physiotherapy program in 2009. These programs meet the European requirements. The students of the english programs are represented by the English Programs' Student Union (EPSU). On 27 February 2007 the Polish name of school was changed from Akademia Medyczna im. Karola Marcinkowskiego w Poznaniu to Uniwersytet Medyczny im. Karola Marcinkowskiego w Poznaniu. ==Science and research== While advanced research at the university is carried out in virtually every field of modern medicine, its contribution is most widely recognized in such disciplines as immunology, endocrinology, oncology, nuclear medicine, anaesthesiology, surgery, nephrology, gynaecology and obstetrics (especially perinatology), ecology, parasitic and tropical diseases, AIDS, viral hepatitis, hematology, child oncology, cytophysiology and cytopathology, development of the central nervous system, immunology of skin diseases, clinical pharmacology, genetics, audiology, phoniatrics and optometry.

In contrast to selective mutism, it was thought someone who was electively mute may not speak in any situation, as is usually shown in books and movies. Elective mutism was often attributed to defiance or the effect of trauma. Those who are able to speak freely in some situations but not in others are now better described by selective mutismSelective Mutism Resource Manual, Second Edition, Routledge, 2016.. ==History== In 1877, a German physician named the disorder aphasia voluntaria to describe children who were able to speak normally but often \\"refused\\" to.http://www.brighttots.com/Selective_Mutism.html Bright Tots: Selective Mutism In 1980, a study by Torey Hayden identified four \\"subtypes\\" of Elective Mutism:Torey Hayden. Classification of elective mutism *Symbiotic mutism: the most common of the forms, caused by a vocal and dominating mother and absent father (very rarely the other way around) and characterized by the use of mutism as controlling behavior around other adults. *Speech phobic mutism: the least common, in which the child showed distinct fear at hearing a recording of his or her voice. This also involved ritualistic behaviors, which may reflect OCD, and was thought to be caused by the child having been told to keep a family secret. *Reactive mutism: a reaction to trauma and/or abuse, with all children showing symptoms of depression and being notably withdrawn, usually showing no facial expressions. Notably, Hayden admits that some children put in this category had no apparent incident to react to, but they were included because of their symptoms. *Passive-aggressive mutism: silence is used as a display of hostility, connected to antisocial behavior. Some of the children in her study had reportedly not been mute until age 9-12. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), first published in 1952, first included Elective Mutism in its third edition, published in 1980. Elective mutism was described as \\"a continuous refusal to speak in almost all social situations\\" despite normal ability to speak. While \\"excessive shyness\\" and other anxiety-related traits were listed as associated features, predisposing factors included \\"maternal overprotection\\", mental retardation, and trauma. Elective mutism in the third edition revised (DSM III-R) is described similarly as in the third edition except for specifying that the disorder is not related to social anxiety disorder. In 1994, the fourth edition of the DSM reflected the name change to selective mutism and redefined the disorder. ==Cultural references== Though elective mutism is no longer recognized by most psychiatrists, it is a popular character element or plot point in stories and movies. Many characters choose to stop speaking, for various reasons. Even more commonly, there are also characters who stop speaking after a traumatic incident. In both these cases, often, and almost always in the second, the character is silent in all situations. This is therefore not selective mutism, and anxiety is very rarely involved. Selective mutism itself is almost nonexistent in pop culture. The following are a few references to stories including a character who does not speak despite being physically able to. * In the book Cut by Patricia McCormick, the main character, Callie, is an elective mute. * In The House of the Spirits by Isabel Allende, Clara Trueba is mute after witnessing her sisters molestation and autopsy. \\"She could not move until the first lights of dawn appeared. Only then did she slip back into her bed, feeling within her the silence of the entire world. Silence filled her utterly.\\" *In Hannibal Rising by Thomas Harris, Hannibal Lecter is mute after witnessing his sister killed and eaten. * In the book Flying Solo, the character Rachel is mute for six months after a classmate dies. * In The Piano, Ada is an elective mute. She chooses to learn to speak at the end of the film. * In the 1993 movie, House of Cards, Sally Matthews chooses not to speak after her father dies. * In the book Halo: Ghosts of Onyx, Lucy-B091 is mute after she is one of only two survivors from her unit of 300. * In the movie The Prophet Kamila's daughter, Elmitra, is depicted as mute after the death of her father. * In the 2014 video game Watch Dogs, Aiden Pearce's nephew, Jackson, is electively mute after the death of his sister. * In the book Fifty Shades of Grey, Christian Grey is depicted as having been an elective mute from age 4, when he witnessed his birth mother's drug overdose and death and was with her body for days before being discovered, until he was 6 years old and he spoke his newly-adopted baby sister's name. * In John Green's narrative YouTube series Swindon Town Swoodilypoopers, midfielder Maric Maric is selectively mute. * In A Good Woman Is Hard to Find, Ben Collins stops speaking after witnessing his father being knifed to death. ==References== Category:Anxiety disorders Category:Childhood psychiatric disorders Category:Oral communication Category:Emotional and behavioral disorders in childhood and adolescence ","title":"Elective mutism"},{"id":"1276790","text":"CLP may stand for: ==Biology== * CLP protease family, a family of proteolytic enzymes ** Endopeptidase Clp, an enzyme complex ** ATP-dependent Clp protease proteolytic subunit, a catalytic subunit of the Clp complex (encoded by the CLPP gene in humans) == Businesses == * CLP Group, formerly China Light and Power * Connecticut Light and Power Company == Computing, mathematics, and technology == * Cell Loss Priority * COIN-OR Linear Program Solver * Communication Linking Protocol * Congruence lattice problem * Constraint Logic Programming * Constraint logic programming (Real) * Control Language Programming, an IBM programming language used on the AS/400 and successors, including today's IBM i * Convergent Linux Platform == Political parties == * Canadian Labour Party, former * Communist Labor Party of America, predecessors of the Communist Party USA * Constituency Labour Party, a sub-division of the British Labour Party representing a single UK constituency * Country Liberal Party, Northern Territory, Australia == Certifications == * Certificate in Legal Practice (Malaysia) * Certified Landscape Professional == Other uses == * AOL Community Leader Program * CLP Regulation on classification, labelling and packaging of chemicals, EU * Cleaner, Lubricant, Preservative, US weapons fluid code * Chilean peso (ISO 4217 code: CLP), the currency of Chile * Cleft lip and palate * Cloppenburg (district), Germany ","title":"CLP"},{"id":"1276792","text":"A Libyan is a person or thing of, from, or related to Libya in North Africa.

This locomotive was built by Metropolitan-Vickers, initially as a prototype gas turbine-electric locomotive, numbered 18100. British Rail allocated the number E1000 (and later E2001) to the locomotive following its conversion from gas turbine propulsion. ==Conversion== Its new electric propulsion meant it was rated at , giving a maximum speed of and weighing . In addition, it was also converted from Co-Co to A1A-A1A wheel arrangement when the centre traction motor from each bogie was removed. The new traction motor rating (with four motors) was about the same as the original rating (with six motors). This suggests that new traction motors were fitted. The conversion of the locomotive began in January 1958 when the locomotive was moved from storage at Dukinfield Works to the Bowesfield Works at Stockton-on-Tees. The work involved the removal of the gas turbine unit, main generator, fuel tank, air filters, the centre traction motor from each bogie and all of the ancillary equipment used for the gas turbine unit. Once the locomotive had been stripped, the new electrical equipment was installed which included the transformer, the Stone-Faiveley pantograph (for which a section of the roof had to be lowered), a Brown Boveri air blast circuit breaker and the Hackbridge-Hewittic mercury arc rectifier units. The cabs of the locomotive were converted from Western Region right- hand drive to the standard British Rail left-hand drive arrangement. The rebuilt locomotive was completed and ready for trials in October 1958. It retained its original BR black livery, with a silver stripe around the middle of the body and silver numbers. ==Usage== The locomotive was used to prepare the ground for the 25 kV AC electrification being installed on the West Coast Main Line, including the testing of overhead line equipment and staff training. ==Withdrawal== Great Central near Akeman Street railway station. Once the production locomotives (Class 81 onwards) were in service, E2001 was no longer required. It was put into store at the end of 1961, and lasted for over ten years at various locations. It was officially withdrawn in April 1968 and scrapped in November 1972 at J Cashmore in Great Bridge. == Models == E1000/E2001 is being made as a kit and a ready-to-run model in OO gauge by Silver Fox Models. ==References== ===Sources=== * * * ==External links== 80 Category:Metropolitan-Vickers locomotives Category:A1A-A1A locomotives Category:25 kV AC locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1958 Category:Scrapped locomotives Category:Individual locomotives of Great Britain Category:Unique locomotives Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Great Britain ","title":"British Rail Class 80"},{"id":"1276817","text":"Two grilled cervelat with their ends cut open in the traditional Swiss manner Cervelat cut in pieces typically used for Wurstsalat Cervelas à l'alsacienne with cheese and bacon Cervelat, also cervelas, servelat or zervelat, is a sausage produced in Switzerland, France (especially Alsace and Lyon) and parts of Germany. The recipe and preparation of the sausage vary regionally. The sausages are spelled cervelas in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, Cervelat in the German-speaking part, and servelat in the Italian-speaking part. The terms ultimately derive from cerebrum, the Latin word for brain, which was used in early recipes. The term \\"Cervelat\\" is the oldest of the three. It was first recorded in 1552 by Rabelais, and is derived from zervelada, a Milanese dialect word meaning a \\"large, short sausage filled with meat and pork brains.\\" Modern recipes do not include brains, and arose towards the end of the 19th century in Basel, as a reworking of the traditional recipe. The taste of the sausages depends on the region, but generally they are similar to that of a frankfurter, but with a smokier flavour and a texture brought about by its fat shape and the tightly wrapped natural casing. Various European semi-dry cervelat are similar to summer sausage in the U.S., and Thuringian sausage can be considered a type of cervelat. In the United States, the term Thuringer sausage is used for a type of cervelat, rather than Thuringian sausage in the European sense.The Art of Making Fermented Sausages by Stanley Marianski, Adam Marianski page 167 ==Switzerland== A St. Galler bratwurst (the white one), a schüblig and a cervelat, cooked and served hot In Switzerland, cervelats are cooked (slightly smoked and then boiled) or served raw. They contain a mixture of beef, bacon and pork rind. The modern Swiss variety is packed into zebu intestines. The cervelat is often referred to as the national sausage of Switzerland. Some 160 million cervelats weighing 27,000 metric tons are produced in Switzerland annually, which is equivalent to a consumption of 25 cervelats per person each year. Grilling cervelats over an open fire with the ends cut open so they expand like a butterfly's wings is a childhood memory for nearly every Swiss person; as a result, many Swiss are emotionally attached to the sausage. Swiss cervelats are made of roughly equal parts of beef, pork, bacon, pork rind and ice, which helps bind the ingredients, along with spices, curing salt and cutter additives. The ingredients are finely minced in a cutter, packed into beef intestines, smoked for an hour and then cooked by boiling for a short time. Processed and packaged varieties sold in Swiss supermarkets also contain nitrites and antioxidants.Coop cervelas (2 x 100g) packaging, May 2010 A cervelat may weigh from about 100 to 200 grams. Swiss cervelats are prepared and eaten cooked or raw. They are boiled, grilled or fried. They can also be served uncooked, either in a salad or with bread and mustard. Sometimes sold smoked and uncooked, cervelat can be seasoned, salted and cold smoked for one day.IFIS Dictionary of Food Science and Technology by International Food Information Service page 84 ===2008 casings shortage=== Traditionally, Swiss beef intestines were used for the casings, but towards the end of the 20th century, local cattle producers lost interest in cleaning and preparing them, so meat processors switched to Brazilian zebu intestines, which are not fatty and do not easily split open when roasted. However, beginning on 1 April 2006, the European Union banned the import of many animal parts from Brazil as a measure aimed at preventing the spread of mad cow disease. Among these were beef intestines. Although Switzerland is not an EU member state, it is bound to observe European food protection laws through other treaty agreements. Hence, Swiss and German stockpiles of zebu intestines became very low by 2008, threatening production altogether, and causing some controversy in Switzerland. In January of that year, the Swiss meat industry announced that a national \\"cervelat task force\\" had failed in an exhaustive search for an acceptable alternative to zebu intestines. The New York Times noted that \\"the possible demise of cervelas visibly upset the Swiss, a normally even-tempered people.\\" The cervelat production crisis was covered closely by the Swiss media and in a newspaper poll, 72% of those surveyed said the \\"cervelas, as they knew it, had to be saved.\\" The cervelat crisis was brought up in a parliamentary debate wherein state councillor and president of the Swiss Meat Association, Rolf Büttiker, spoke of the national sausage's social significance, calling it a \\"cult sausage\\" and \\"the worker's steak\\".Interpellation no. 07.3793 on the Swiss Parliament website; see also the minutes. The Swiss government entered into negotiations with the EU to seek an exception for zebu intestines, and Swiss scientists were sent to Brazil hoping to show that the intestines posed no risk of transmitting mad cow disease. By August 2008, most of the Swiss demand for bovine intestines had been met with imports from Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay.swissinfo.ch, Cervelat replacement skins go international, 20 August 2008, retrieved 14 May 2009 ==France== Cervelas de Lyon are a sausage specialty of Lyonnaise cuisine.

He was a member of the Democratic Party. ==Life and career== Born in 1907 in the Governorate of Estonia of the Russian Empire, he emigrated to the United States at an early age. He graduated from the University of Illinois College of Law. As a lawyer, Shapiro practiced in Kankakee, Illinois. Turning to public service, he was elected state's attorney (county prosecutor) of Kankakee County in 1936. From 1947–61 he served in the Illinois State House of Representatives, where he took a special interest in mental health issues.Samuel Shapiro, Illinois Governor in 1968 Shapiro was elected the 38th Lieutenant Governor of Illinois in 1960 and again in 1964, and took office as governor when the previous governor Otto Kerner, Jr. resigned to accept appointment to the federal appellate court. Shapiro thus became the second Jewish governor of Illinois (Henry Horner being the first). Illinois thereby became the first state to have had two Jewish governors; New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island have each since elected at least a second governor of the faith. Upon becoming governor, Shapiro ran at once for a full term of his own, but was narrowly defeated by Republican Richard B. Ogilvie in the 1968 election. He then returned to private life, although he was called upon several times to serve on special commissions, the most significant of which was a commission to redraw state electoral boundaries in 1981. Shapiro was an alumnus of the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity. From 1984 until his death, he led the effort to establish a permanent headquarters for the fraternity's national offices. As a result, Alpha Epsilon Pi's International Headquarters is dedicated in his honor. Shapiro continued to work as an attorney; his death was discovered when he failed to appear in court for a client and police were sent to his home in Kankakee to investigate. He is buried in Jewish Waldheim Cemetery in Forest Park, Illinois. The state renamed the Kankakee Mental Health Center in his honor. == See also == * List of U.S. state governors born outside the United States == References == * == External links == * Category:1907 births Category:1987 deaths Category:American people of Estonian-Jewish descent Category:Democratic Party state governors of the United States Category:Estonian emigrants to the United States Category:Estonian Jews Category:Governors of Illinois Category:Jewish American state governors of the United States Category:Lieutenant Governors of Illinois Category:District attorneys in Illinois Category:People from Kankakee, Illinois Category:Illinois Democrats Category:Imperial Russian emigrants to the United States Category:20th-century American politicians Category:Burials in Forest Park, Illinois Category:University of Illinois College of Law alumni ","title":"Samuel H.

The movie was the directorial debut of twin brothers Benjamin and Dominik Reding. It took them about five years to film, mostly due to financial constraints. It was shot in stark black-and-white, underscoring the film's gritty feel. Among other recognitions, the film has won the German Camera Award, and a L.A. Outfest emerging talent award. ==Plot summary== Janosch (Sascha Backhaus) has problems at school and despises the lifestyle of his bourgeois mother. He runs away from home, to his friend Koma (Simon Goerts), who he had met at a holiday camp. Koma is an Oi! skinhead (also known as a punk-skinhead). He is a particular sort of skinhead who has little political motivations, preferring a lifestyle of partying and binge drinking, and whose musical tastes are a synthesis of skinhead and punk rock music. Koma's girlfriend is pregnant, and wants him to change his ways. She blows up his secret hideaway with dynamite, but this only infuriates Koma, who blames this on the punks he had gotten into a fight with previously. Meanwhile, Janosch meets Zottel (Jens Veith), a punk who earns a living with small circus acts at wealthy people's parties. The two fall in love, but their happiness is cut short when Koma attacks Zottel and kills him. In a fit of fury, Janosch grabs a brick and slays Koma. ==Cast list== * Sascha Backhaus as Janosch. Backhaus portrays the main protagonist Janosch, who escapes his pampered bourgeois lifestyle to become an Oi-skinhead, but later questions the ultra-masculine, testosterone-fueled subculture. Backhaus himself was a real- life squatter.Official website - The Actors * Sascha Goerts as Koma. Goerts plays the tough Koma, a hard drinking, kickboxing and often violent Oi- skinhead, who takes Janosch under his wing. Like Backhaus, Goerts was a squatter, and also an occasional street musician. According to the DVD commentary, he gave such a convincing performance that people were shocked when they found out that Goerts is in fact a soft-spoken, intelligent character. * Sandra Borgmann as Sandra. Borgmann portrays Sandra, Komas skin- girl girlfriend. She later becomes mother of his twins and grows fed up of his Oi-behaviour. In contrast to Backhaus and Goerts, Borgmann was already an established actress. * Jens Veith as Zottel. A punk with whom Janosch later has an affair. Veith is a real-life fire-eater and juggler and was one of the last actors cast for the movie. ==Development== When they started the project, the Reding brothers wanted to authentically portray youths from fringe subcultures like \\"skinheads (non-political Oi!skins), squatters, modern- primitives and tribes ... who all just do what they like ... Their own way of fun, fights, sorrows and desires.

On the DVD commentary track, the Redings explain that they could not use the sexually charged word Smegma in a film which was meant to be seen by teenagers, so they had to change the name of the band. In addition, all the Oi skinhead extras were real Oi skinheads, who demanded beer as compensation when they slowly grew weary of filming.

As a conservative political theorist, Lagarde's strong support of anti-Semitism, vocal opposition to Christianity, racial Darwinism and anti-Slavism are viewed as having been among the most influential in supporting the ideology of fascism and Nazism.Fascism: Intellectual origins, Encyclopaedia BritannicaPaul de Lagarde on Liberalism, Education, and the Jews: German Writings (1886), German History in Documents and ImagesJohnson, Paul (1983), “Modern Times”, Harper and Row: New York His great learning and gifts were curiously mixed with dogmatism and distrust in the activities of others. In politics, he belonged to the Prussian Conservative party. He died in Göttingen on 22 December 1891. ==Early life and education== De Lagarde was born in Berlin as Paul Bötticher; in early adulthood he legally adopted the family name of his maternal line out of respect for his great-aunt who raised him. At Humboldt University of Berlin (1844–1846) and University of Halle-Wittenberg (1846–1847) he studied theology, philosophy and Oriental languages. In 1852 his studies took him to London and Paris. ==Career== In 1854 he became a teacher at a Berlin public school, but this did not interrupt his biblical studies. In 1866 he received three years leave of absence to collect fresh materials, and in 1869 succeeded German orientalist and theologian Heinrich Ewald as professor of oriental languages at the University of Göttingen. Like Ewald, Lagarde was an active worker in a variety of subjects and languages; but his chief aim, the elucidation of the Bible, was almost always kept in view. Lagarde was easily the most renowned Septuagint scholar of the nineteenth century, and he devoted himself ardently to Oriental studies. ===Political interests=== Parallel to his academic work, he attempted to establish a German national religion whose most striking manifestations were an aggressive anti-Semitism and expansionism.http://www.perlentaucher.de/buch/ulrich-sieg/deutschlands- prophet.html He held few concrete religious beliefs at the ready for his postulated national religion as his first political treatise Über das Verhältnis des deutschen Staates zu Theologie, Kirche und Religion. Ein Versuch Nicht-Theologen zu orientieren (On the Relationship of the German State to Theology, Church and Religion: An Attempted Orientation for Non- Theologians) demonstrates. In regard to the state, he called for its initial and most important task to be to create a climate in which a national religion could flourish. Meanwhile, he obliged those who had faith in God to a radical morality wherein they distinguish solely between \\"duty or sin\\" in their every action. In addition, first a formal language must be developed for the religiosity of these newborn men.Deutsche Schriften; Göttingen, 19205, p. 81. Cf. Ulrich Sieg (2007), pp. 162–166. In the second part of his 1875 book, Über die gegenwärtige Lage des deutschen Reichs. Ein Bericht (On the Current Situation of the German Reich: A Report), he connected thereto and specified as follows:Deutsche Schriften; Göttingen, 19205, p. 186. The historian Ulrich Sieg classifies his position as follows: \\"He despised the Christianity that he considered bland and lukewarm and hoped for a folkish religion of the future.\\"Interview with Ulrich Sieg , accessed 4 Apr 2015. Lagarde was conversant with Adolf Stoecker, the founder of the anti-Semitic Berlin Movement. He also showed interest in folkish-anti-Semitic societies such as the Deutscher Volksverein of Bernhard Förster and Max Liebermann von Sonnenberg, as well as the Deutschsoziale Partei of Theodor Fritsch. To the latter, he established contact in 1886 by sending his treatise Die nächsten Pflichten deutscher Politik (The Coming Tasks of German Politics), at the core of which he considered to be a German policy of settlement in Eastern Europe.Ulrich Sieg (2007), p. 253. In German Writings, in which he compiled his previously published political essays, there can be found numerous anti- Semitic passages in which we learn, among other things, that he considered Jews to be the greatest barrier to German unification, whereas he simultaneously avowed the concept of a German colonization of southeastern Europe and proposed that the Jewish population settled there at the time be resettled to Palestine or Madagascar.Magnus Brechtken, „Madagaskar für die Juden“. Antisemitische Idee und politische Praxis 1885 - 1945, Oldenbourg Wissenschaft, München 1998, S. 16f. The only alternatives for Lagarde were the total assimilation or emigration of the Jews.Vgl. Ulrich Sieg (2007), p. 62f. In his 1887 essay \\"Jews and Indo-Germanics\\", he wrote: “One would have to have a heart of steel to not feel sympathy for the poor Germans and, by the same token, to not hate the Jews, to not hate and despise those who – out of humanity! – advocate for the Jews or are too cowardly to crush these vermin. Trichinella and bacilli would not be negotiated with, trichinella and bacilli would also not be nurtured, they would be destroyed as quickly and as thoroughly as possible.\\"Paul de Lagarde: \\"Juden und Indogermanen\\" 1887, nach A. Bein, Der moderne Antisemitismus, in Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte, Jg. 6, 1958. In addition to his influence on anti-Semitism, Lagarde is also of importance to the formation of German imperialist thought. In this regard, he concentrated on German border colonization within Europe rather than the acquisition of overseas colonies. This bears a close resemblance to the later concept of German Lebensraum most notably espoused by Friedrich Ratzel. In 1875, Lagarde maintained that the primary objective of German politics was the \\"gradual Germanization of Poland.\\" Since he was concerned about how many Germans emigrated in their search for land, he advocated a border colonizing land acquisition for the peasantry, which he considered the \\"true foundation of the state.\\" This land acquisition aimed to create a Mitteleuropa under German leadership \\"that reaches from the Ems to the mouth of the Danube, from the Neman to Trieste, from Metz to about the Bug.\\"Cited by Ulrich Sieg (2007), p. 173f. In his 1918 book, The New Europe, Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk regards Lagarde as one of the leading philosophical and theological spokesmen of Pan- Germanism, and furthermore describes Heinrich von Treitschke as its historian, Wilhelm II as its politician and Friedrich Ratzel as its geopolitical geographer. In all of them he saw the representatives of the imperialistic \\"German Drang nach Osten\\" that threatened the Slavic countries.Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk: Das neue Europa. Der slawische Standpunkt; Berlin 1991, pp. 13–44. ==Legacy== Lagarde's anti-Semitism laid the foundations for aspects of National Socialist ideology, in particular that of Alfred Rosenberg. He argued that Germany should create a \\"national\\" form of Christianity purged of Semitic elements and insisted that Jews were \\"pests and parasites\\" who should be destroyed \\"as speedily and thoroughly as possible\\".Snyder, L. Encyclopedia of the Third Reich, Wordsworth, 1998, p.203 Stern, Fritz The Politics of Cultural Despair: a study in the Rise of the Germanic Ideology, 1961 (see Chapter I, \\"Paul de Lagarde and a Germanic Religion\\"). His library now belongs to the New York University. ==Works== He edited the Didascalia apostolorum syriace (1854) and other Syriac texts collected in the British Museum and in Paris. He edited the Aramaic translation (known as the Targum) of the Prophets according to the Codex Reuchlinianus preserved at Karlsruhe, Prophetae chaldaice (1872), the Hagiographa chaldaice (1874), an Arabic translation of the Gospels, Die vier Evangelien, arabisch aus der Wiener Handschrift herausgegeben (1864), a Syriac translation of the Old Testament Apocrypha, Libri V. T. apocryphi syriace (1865), a Coptic translation of the Pentateuch, Der Pentateuch koptisch (1867), and a part of the Lucianic text of the Septuagint, which he was able to reconstruct from manuscripts for nearly half the Old Testament. Of the Armenians he published Zur Urgeschichte der Armenier (1854) and Armenische Studien (1877). He was also a student of Persian, publishing Isaias persice (1883) and Persische Studien (1884). In 1880, de Lagarde attempted to reconstruct a Syriac version of Epiphanius' treatise, On Weights and Measures, which he entitled, Veteris Testamenti ab Origene recensiti fragmenta apud Syros servata quinque. Praemittitur Epiphanii de mensuris et ponderibus liber nunc primum integer et ipse syriacus (Gootingae 1880). He followed up his Coptic studies with Aegyptiaca (1883), and published many minor contributions to the study of oriental languages in Gesammelte Abhandlungen (1866), Symmicta (1. 1877, ii. 1880), Semitica (i. 1878, ii. 1879), Orientalia (1879–1880) and Mittheilungen (1884). Mention should also be made of the valuable Onomastica sacra (1870; 2nd ed., 1887). He edited: * * In Deutsche Schriften (1878–81; 4th ed., Göttingen, 1903), he attempted to involve himself in politics.

Its tenets stress a unity of religion and state rather than a separation or distinction between the two, and even those Muslims who have ceased to believe fully in Islam retain Islamic habits and attitudes. The post-revolution National Transitional Council has explicitly endeavored to reaffirm Islamic values, enhance appreciation of Islamic culture, elevate the status of Qur'anic law and, to a considerable degree, emphasize Qur'anic practice in everyday Libyan life with legal implementation in accordance to Islamic jurisprudence known as sharia. Libya has a small presence of Ahmadis and Shias consisting of Pakistani immigrants, though unrecognized by the state . ==History of Islam in Libya== During the seventh century, Muslims, who were spreading their faith, reached Libya to spread the message. The urban centers soon became substantially Islamic, but widespread conversion of the nomads of the desert did not come until after large-scale invasions in the eleventh century by Bedouin tribes from Arabia and Egypt. A residue of pre-Islamic beliefs blended with the Islam of the Arabs. Hence, popular Islam became an overlay of Quranic ritual and principles upon the vestiges of earlier beliefs --prevalent throughout North Africa--in jinns (spirits), the evil eye, rites to ensure good fortune, and cult veneration of local saints. The educated of the cities and towns served as the primary bearers and guardians of the more austere brand of orthodox Islam. ==Saints and brotherhoods== Quran studying board shot in Almayyit Mosque Tripoli. Writing on wooden boards is the traditional method for memorizing Quran Islam as practiced in North Africa is interlaced with indigenous Berber beliefs. Although the Sufi orthodoxy preached the unique and inimitable majesty and sanctity of God and the equality of God's believers, an important element of Islam for centuries has been a belief in the coalescence of special spiritual power given by god to particular living human beings. The power is known as Barakah, a transferable quality of personal blessedness and spiritual force said to lodge in certain individuals. Those whose claim to possess barakah can be substantiated-- through performance of apparent miracles, exemplary human insight, or genealogical connection with a recognized possessor--are viewed as saints. These persons are known in the West as marabouts, a French transliteration of al murabitun (those who have made a religious retreat), and the benefits of their baraka are believed to accrue to those ordinary people who come in contact with them. The true Islamic way of saints became widespread in rural areas; in urban localities, Islam in its Sunni form prevail. Saints were present in Tripolitania, but they were particularly numerous in Cyrenaica. Their baraka continued to reside in their tombs after their deaths. The number of venerated tombs varied from tribe to tribe, although there tended to be fewer among the camel herders of the desert than among the sedentary and nomadic tribes of the plateau area. In one village, a visitor in the late 1960s counted sixteen still-venerated tombs. Coteries of disciples frequently clustered around particular saints, especially those who preached an original tariqa (devotional \\"way\\"). Brotherhoods of the followers of such mystical teachers appeared in North Africa at least as early as the eleventh century and in some cases became mass movements. The founder ruled an order of followers, who were organized under the frequently absolute authority of a leader, or shaykh. The brotherhood was centered on a zawiya (pl., zawaya). Because of Islam's austere rational and intellectual qualities, many people have felt drawn toward the more emotional and personal ways of knowing God practiced by mystical Islam, or Sufism. Found in many parts of the Muslim world, Sufism endeavored to produce a personal experience of the divine through mystic and ascetic discipline. Sufi adherents gathered into brotherhoods, and Sufi orders became extremely popular, particularly in rural areas. Sufi brotherhoods exercised great influence and ultimately played an important part in the religious revival that swept through North Africa during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In Libya, when the Ottoman Empire proved unable to mount effective resistance to the encroachment of Christian missionaries, the work was taken over by Sufi-inspired revivalist movements. Among these, the most forceful and effective was that of the Senussi, which extended into numerous parts of North Africa. ===Senussi=== The Senussi movement was a religious revival adapted to desert life. Its zawaayaa could be found in Tripolitania and Fezzan, but Senussi influence was strongest in Cyrenaica. The Senussi's first theocracy was in the city of Bayda, located in Cyrenaica, and that was the center for them in 1841. After the Italian occupation, the focus turned from government to seminary education and then to the creation of an Islamic University which became in 1960 the University of Mohammed bin Ali al-Sanusi. The arrival of Muammar Gaddafi's rule changed the course of the university. It is now known as the Omar Al-Mukhtar University. Rescuing the region from unrest and anarchy, the Senussi movement gave the Cyrenaican tribal people a religious attachment and feelings of unity and purpose. The Senussis formed a nucleus of resistance to the Italian colonial regime (see Italian Colonialism, ch. 1). As the nationalism fostered by unified resistance to the Italians gained adherents, however, the religious fervor of devotion to the movement began to wane, particularly after the Italians destroyed Senussi religious and educational centers during the 1930s. Nonetheless, King Idris, the monarch of independent Libya, was the grandson of the founder of the Senussi movement, and his status as a Senussi gave him the unique ability to command respect from the disparate parts of his kingdom. Despite its momentary political prominence, the Senussi movement never regained its strength as a religious force after its zawaayaa were destroyed by the Italians. A promised restoration never fully took place, and the Idris regime used the Senussi heritage as a means of legitimizing political authority, rather than of providing religious leadership. After unseating Idris in 1969, the revolutionary government placed restrictions on the operation of the remaining zawaayaa, appointed a supervisor for Senussi properties, and merged the Senussi-sponsored Islamic University with the University of Libya. The movement was virtually banned, but in the 1980s occasional evidence of Senussi activity was nonetheless reported. Senussi inspired activists were instrumental in freeing Cyrenaica from Gaddafi's control during the Libyan Civil War. ==Islam in Gaddafi's Libya== Koran class in Bayda Under the revolutionary Gaddafi government, the role of orthodox Islam in Libyan life became progressively more important. Muammar al-Gaddafi was a highly devout Muslim, with an expressed desire to exalt Islam and to restore it to its proper--i.e., central--place in the life of the people. He believed that the purity of Islam had been sullied through time, particularly by the influence of Europeans, both during and after the colonial period, and that Islam's purity must be restored by such actions as: the restoration of sharia to its proper place as the basis of the Libyan legal system, the banning of \\"immodest\\" practices and dress, and the symbolic purification of mosques. Gaddafi also believed in the value of the Quran as a moral and political guide for the contemporary world, as is evident from his tract, The Green Book, published in the mid-1970s (see The Green Book, ch. 4). Gaddafi considered the first part of The Green Book to be a commentary on the implications of the Quranic injunction that human affairs be managed by consultation. For him, this meant direct democracy, which is given \\"practical meaning\\" through the creation of people's committees and popular congresses. Gaddafi felt that, inasmuch as The Green Book was based solely on the Quran, its provisions should be universally applicable--at least among Muslims. Soon after taking office, the Gaddafi government showed itself to be devoutly conservative by closing bars and nightclubs, banning entertainment deemed provocative or immodest, and making use of the Muslim calendar mandatory. The intention of reestablishing sharia was announced, and Gaddafi personally assumed chairmanship of a commission to study the problems involved. In November 1973, a new legal code was issued that revised the entire Libyan judicial system to conform to the sharia, and in 1977 the General People's Congress (GPC--see Glossary) issued a statement that all future legal codes would be based on the Quran. Among the laws enacted by the Gaddafi government were a series of legal penalties prescribed during 1973 which included the punishment of armed robbery by amputation of a hand and a foot. The legislation contained qualifying clauses making its execution unlikely, but its enactment had the effect of applying Quranic principles in the modern era. Another act prescribed flogging for individuals breaking the fast of Ramadan, and yet another called for eighty lashes to be administered to both men and women guilty of fornication. In the early 1970s, Islam played a major role in legitimizing Gaddafi's political and social reforms. By the end of the decade, however, he had begun to attack the religious establishment and several fundamental aspects of Sunni Islam. Gaddafi asserted the transcendence of the Quran as the sole guide to Islamic governance and the unimpeded ability of every Muslim to read and interpret it. He denigrated the roles of the ulama, imams, and Islamic jurists and questioned the authenticity of the hadith, and thereby the sunna, as a basis for Islamic law. The sharia itself, Gaddafi maintained, governed only such matters as properly fell within the sphere of religion; all other matters lay outside the purview of religious law. Finally, he called for a revision of the Muslim calendar, saying it should date from Muhammad's death in 632, an event he felt was more momentous than the hijra ten years earlier. These unorthodox views on the hadith, sharia, and the Islamic era aroused a good deal of unease. They seemed to originate from Gaddafi's conviction that he possessed the transcendent ability to interpret the Quran and to adapt its message to modern life. Equally, they reinforced the view that he was a reformer but not a literalist in matters of the Quran and Islamic tradition. On a practical level, however, several observers agreed that Gaddafi was less motivated by religious convictions than by political calculations. By espousing these views and by criticizing the ulama, he was using religion to undermine a segment of the middle class that was notably vocal in opposing his economic policies in the late 1970s. But Gaddafi clearly considered himself an authority on the Quran and Islam and was not afraid to challenge traditional religious authority. He also was not prepared to tolerate dissent. The revolutionary government gave repeated evidence of its desire to establish Libya as a leader of the Islamic world. Moreover, Gaddafi's efforts to create an Arab nation through political union with other Arab states were also based on a desire to create a great Islamic nation. Indeed, Gaddafi drew little distinction between the two. The government took a leading role in supporting Islamic institutions and in worldwide proselytizing on behalf of Islam. The Jihad Fund, supported by a payroll tax, was established in 1970 to aid the Palestinians in their struggle with Israel. The Faculty of Islamic Studies and Arabic at the University of Benghazi was charged with training Muslim intellectual leaders for the entire Islamic world, and the Islamic Mission Society used public funds for the construction and repair of mosques and Islamic educational centers in cities as widely separated as Vienna and Bangkok. The Islamic Call Society (Ad Dawah) was organized with government support to propagate Islam abroad, particularly throughout Africa, and to provide funds to Muslims everywhere. The symbolic purification major urban mosques took place in 1978. Gaddafi was forthright in his belief in the perfection of Islam and his desire to propagate it. His commitment to the open propagation of Islam, among other reasons, caused him to oppose the Muslim Brotherhood, an Egyptian-based fundamentalist movement that used clandestine and sometimes subversive means to spread Islam and to eliminate Western influences. Although the Brotherhood's activities in Libya were banned in the mid-1980s, it remained present in the country maintaining a low profile. In 1983 a member of the brotherhood was executed in Tripoli, and in 1986 a group of Brotherhood adherents was arrested after the murder of a high-ranking political official in Benghazi. The Muslim Brotherhood had spread throughout Libya, but were particularly strong in the cities of Benghazi, Bayda, Derna and Ajdabiya. Gaddafi challenged the Brotherhood to establish itself openly in non-Muslim countries and promised its leaders that, if it did, he would financially support its activities. No support was ever forthcoming. Gaddafi stressed the universal applicability of Islam, but he also reaffirmed the special status assigned by Muhammad to Christians. He likened Christians to misguided Muslims who strayed from the correct path. Furthermore, Gaddafi assumed leadership of a drive to rid Africa of Christianity as well as of the colonialism with which he associated it, despite the fact that Christianity's presence in Libya long predates Islam or its presence in much of Europe. ==See also== * Islam by country ==References== ==External links== * Libyan Quran Reciter with live Quran for streaming.

He is best known for creating the ABC dramedy series Desperate Housewives. ==Early life and career== Marc Cherry was born in Long Beach and lived briefly in Oklahoma. His father was an accountant which required the family to relocate to California. After graduating from Troy High School in Fullerton, California, Cherry graduated from California State University, Fullerton's theater program and initially considered a career in performance. After winning $15,000 as a contestant on The $100,000 Pyramid in 1986, he decided to move to Hollywood and pursue writing work. His move came at a bad time; the 1988 writers strike hit as soon as Cherry arrived. Cherry broke into the industry by working as Designing Women star Dixie Carter's personal assistant. www.wga.org In 1990, he became a writer and producer for the long- running hit sitcom The Golden Girls, and later its short lived spinoff The Golden Palace. Cherry next co-created The 5 Mrs. Buchanans, a sitcom centered on four women married to brothers and their difficult mother-in-law, which had a brief run on CBS during the 1994-1995 season. Cherry also co-created The Crew (1995). On his own, he later created Some of My Best Friends, a 2001 sitcom that was based in part on the 1997 film Kiss Me, Guido. In 2014 and 2016, Cherry was a judge and mentor for the Songbook Academy, a summer intensive for high school students operated by the Great American Songbook Foundation and founded by Michael Feinstein. ==Desperate Housewives== In 2002, a conversation with his mother inspired him to develop a show about the fractured lives of four upper middle class suburban women. After HBO, FOX, CBS, NBC, Showtime, and Lifetime all passed on the show, Cherry got his big break when his agent was arrested and sent to jail for embezzlement. His new agents brought the show to ABC, which decided to pick it up. The series, Desperate Housewives, was an immediate ratings smash and generated enormous national (and subsequently, international) debate. Cherry received several lucrative offers from various parties, but chose to sign a long-term deal with Touchstone, since their network had shown faith in Desperate Housewives when no one else would. Cherry featured several actors on Housewives with whom he had previously worked. Mark Moses, who played Paul Young, and Harriet Sansom Harris, who played Felicia Tilman, were both cast members of The 5 Mrs. Buchanans. In season three, Cherry cast former boss Dixie Carter in the role of Gloria Hodge, Orson's unhinged mother. Actor Alec Mapa, who appeared in Some of My Best Friends, appeared on \\"Housewives\\" in a recurring role as Gabrielle's stylist. Cherry appeared in a cameo as one of Susan's moving men on the final episode of Desperate Housewives. ==Devious Maids== In 2012, after the end of Desperate Housewives, Cherry and Eva Longoria began working on a new series, Devious Maids. Initially it had been produced for ABC, but it then aired on Lifetime. The series is set in Beverly Hills and the protagonists are latina maids: Marisol (Ana Ortiz), Rosie (Dania Ramirez), Carmen (Roselyn Sanchez), Zoila (Judy Reyes), and Valentina (Edy Ganem), who work for celebrities or rich people. They not only clean the homes of celebrities, but also put order in their lives, and sometimes fall in love. Just like the women of Wisteria Lane, these maids have to deal with mysteries and secrets, since, during the first episode, one of their friends, the waitress Flora, is mysteriously murdered, and it's up to Marisol to investigate the murder and to exonerate her son Eddie, wrongly accused. Even for Devious Maids, Marc Cherry hired someone who had worked with him: Roselyn Sanchez, who plays Carmen Luna, one of the maids, appeared in the last episode of Desperate Housewives. Others in Devious Maids who had previously worked with Cherry include Rebecca Wisocky, Melinda Page Hamilton, Valerie Mahaffey, Matt Cedeno, Richard Burgi, and James Denton. ==Why Women Kill== On September 24, 2018, it was announced that CBS All Access had given the production a straight-to-series order. Why Women Kill was created by Cherry, who was also expected to executive produce alongside Brian Grazer, Francie Calfo, Michael Hanel, and Mindy Schultheis. Production companies involved with the series were slated to consist of Imagine Entertainment and CBS Television Studios. On December 10, 2018, it was reported that the series would receive $8.4 million dollars in tax credits from the state of California and premiered on August 15, 2019. ==Lawsuit== On April 5, 2010, former Desperate Housewives cast member Nicollette Sheridan filed a $20 million lawsuit against Cherry and ABC, alleging that he had assaulted her on set and wrongfully terminated her contract. Sheridan also alleged in her lawsuit that Cherry was abusive to other actors and writers on the show. ABC said in a statement that they had investigated similar claims made by Sheridan and found them to be of no merit. The stars of Desperate Housewives (Teri Hatcher, Felicity Huffman, Marcia Cross and Eva Longoria) pledged their support to Cherry in his battle against assault allegations made by Sheridan.\\"Desperate Housewives Stars Unite Against Nicollette Sheridan\\", Metro.co.uk, April 14, 2010\\"Housewives\\" Stand Behind Cherry in Assault Battle, San Francisco Chronicle, April 14, 2010 At the end of 2010, Sheridan removed abuse claims from the suit.Nicollette Sheridan Drops Abuse Claims From \\"Desperate Housewives\\" Lawsuit, TV Guide, December 18, 2010Nicollette Sheridan Amends \\"Housewives\\" Suit Again , Oh, the Scandal!, January 13, 2011 The case finally went to trial in February 2012. On March 13, 2012, the judge dismissed the battery charge against Cherry due to lack of evidence, and Cherry was no longer a defendant in the lawsuit which then focused solely on Sheridan's alleged wrongful termination by ABC. Closing arguments were heard in the case on March 14, 2012 and the jury began their deliberations. By March 19, 2012, the twelve members of the jury had failed to reach a verdict and a mistrial was declared. A retrial was scheduled to begin on September 10, 2012, but on August 16, 2012, the Los Angeles Court of Appeal determined that Sheridan had not been wrongfully fired and dismissed the retrial. A further appeal made by Sheridan to the California Supreme Court was rejected on November 16, 2012. ==Other credits== Cherry appeared as himself in the \\"Righteous Brothers\\" episode of Arrested Development, which was created by fellow Golden Girls writer Mitchell Hurwitz. ==Political affiliation== Cherry was described in an article about him in Newsweek as a \\"somewhat conservative, gay Republican.\\"Sex and the Suburbs - Newsweek Entertainment - MSNBC.com Cherry is a registered Republican.

She was built with a revolutionary stealth propulsion system called a \\"caterpillar drive\\", which is described as a pump-jet system in the book. In the film however, it is shown as being a magnetohydrodynamic drive. ==The story== The drama of the story partially centers around the dual capabilities of the submarine. As a submarine of the Typhoon class, she carries many ballistic missiles armed with nuclear warheads. With a stealthy propulsion unit, she can no longer be detected by NATO naval vessels. As described in both the book and the film, these capabilities combine to create a horrific weapon, whereby the submarine could easily reach the coastal waters of a city, like New York, or Washington D.C., fire its missiles, and destroy key targets before any government or military leaders could launch a retaliatory counterattack on the U.S.S.R. One interpretation, as offered in the film and book, is that this submarine's existence is for one purpose: not as a deterrent to an American attack on the Soviet Union, but solely as a weapon of first strike. It thus becomes critical for the U.S. government to see this submarine either destroyed or captured. Captain First Rank Marko Aleksandrovich Ramius was the first and last commanding officer of Red October. According to the book, in late 1984 (according to the dates mentioned in the book, the year could not have been 1984, but is consistent with the year 1982) Ramius and his command crew take Red October out on exercises. Once at sea Ramius murders Ivan Putin, the political commissar, and then turns the boat towards the United States. Despite efforts by the Soviet Navy, Red October manages to rendezvous with USS Dallas and the United States is able to engage in a complicated rescue plan. Along for the ride on Dallas, and later on Red October, is a part-time CIA analyst named Jack Ryan, who reads Ramius' intent and suggests setting up the rendezvous. The rescue plan results in the Soviet Navy's belief that the submarine has been destroyed. The Soviet Alfa- class attack submarine Konovalov discovers Red October's survival, but is destroyed before it can report back that Red October's sinking had been staged. Most of the officers defect with Ramius but the commander of Dallas conceals the defection from the rest of the Soviet crew, who are repatriated in due course. The submarine is reverse engineered by the United States Navy to discern its secrets. Sometime between a year and eighteen months later the hull of the sub is sunk in a deep ocean trench, although previously the submarine USS Ethan Allen had been scuttled in order to deceive Soviet officials that Red October had been sunk. The technology then seems to disappear, although there are later references in other books, including The Sum of All Fears. In The Cardinal of the Kremlin Ramius says the U.S. Navy is building an advanced version of the pump-jet system for American submarines. In reality, a variant of the magnetohydrodynamic drive stated in the film has been tested, but proved too inefficient and cumbersome to be used as an effective means of a propulsion system on a submarine. This type of propulsion system would not be enclosed in a duct/pipe (as depicted in the film). A pump jet would be more efficient, but not for a submarine of that size. In Clancy's books, the Red October adventure proved useful to Ryan's career. In later books, Ryan is able to use his heroism in obtaining the submarine as a lever with which to force a threatening KGB Secretary to defect to the U.S. against his will (in the novel The Cardinal of the Kremlin), ending the possibility of a Kremlin coup against a politically centrist Soviet government. Years later the truth of these events come to light when political opponents of then- President Ryan reveal his part in the affair. By this time in the early 1990s, the Soviet Union has collapsed and the prevailing opinion in Moscow seems to be \\"well done\\", although they put the Russian hierarchy in a political bind vis-a-vis cooperation with the United States at a critical point. In the story, Red October is the seventh Typhoon class hull built for the Soviet Navy. (The real Typhoon class only had six hulls built. The seventh, TK-210, was scrapped before construction was finished). ==Appearance== In the film, Red October appears much like a standard Typhoon-class submarine though she has a number of significant differences. The aft section of the submarine contains two ducts for the caterpillar drive. The upper rudder carries a towed sonar array which typical Typhoon-class submarines do not feature. Also, the bridge tower of the submarine is taller and more simplified, with no large bulging lower section of a standard Typhoon bridge tower, but instead a much smaller bulge. The difference in the appearance of the bridge tower may have been an error in the design of the model of Red October as earlier on in the film, schematics of a Typhoon-class submarine are shown which display a standard Typhoon bridge tower but also carry the sonar array attached to the rudder as on Red October. Red October is also longer due to additional ballistic missile launch tubes.

Its mission is \\"To promote and coordinate sustainable management and development of water and related resources for the countries' mutual benefit and the people's well-being\\". ==History== ===Mekong Committee (1957–1978)=== The origins of the Mekong Committee are linked to the legacy of (de)colonialism in Indochina and subsequent geopolitical developments. The political, social, and economic conditions of the Mekong River basin countries evolved dramatically since the 1950s, when the Mekong represented the \\"only large river left in the world, besides the Amazon, which remained virtually unexploited.\\"Nakayama 2002: 274–275. The impetus for the creation of the Mekong cooperative regime progressed in tandem with the drive for the development of the lower Mekong, following the 1954 Geneva Conference which granted Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam independence from France. A 1957 United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) report, Development of Water Resources in the Lower Mekong Basin, recommended development to the tune of 90,000 km2 of irrigation and 13.7 gigawatts (GW) from five dams.Nakayama 2002: 275–276. Based largely on the recommendations of ECAFE, the \\"Committee for Coordination on the Lower Mekong Basin\\" (known as the Mekong Committee) was established in September 1957 with the adoption of the Statute for the Committee for Coordination of Investigations into the Lower Mekong Basin. ECAFE's Bureau of Flood Control had prioritized the Mekong --of the 18 international waterways within its jurisdiction--in the hopes of creating a precedent for cooperation elsewhere. and \\"one of the UN's earliest spin-offs\\",Straits Times 2006. as the organization functioned under the aegis of the UN, with its Executive Agent (EA) chosen from the career staff of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The US government--which feared that poverty in the basin would contribute to the strength of communist movements--proved one of the most vocal international backers of the committee, with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation conducting a seminal 1956 study on the basin's potential.Nakayama 2002: 276 Another 1962 study by U.S. geographer Gilbert F. White, Economic and Social Aspects of Lower Mekong Development, proved extremely influential, resulting in the postponement of (in White's own estimation) the construction of the (still unrealized) mainstream Pa Mong Dam, which would have displaced a quarter-million people.Jacobs 1998: 591. The influence of the United States in the committee's formation can also been seen in development studies of General Raymond Wheeler, the former Chief of the Army Corps of Engineers, the role of C. Hart Schaaf as the Mekong Committee's Executive Agent from 1959 to 1969, and President Lyndon Johnson’s promotion of the committee as having the potential to \\"dwarf even our own T.V.A.\\" However, US financial support was terminated in 1975 and did not resume for decades due to embargoes against Cambodia (until 1992) and Vietnam (until 1994), followed by periods of trade restrictions.Jacobs 1998. However, MakimMakim 2002: 14. argues that the committee was \\"largely unaffected by formal or informal U.S. preferences\\" given the ambivalence of some riparians about US technical support, in particular Cambodia's rejection of some specific types of assistance. However, the fact remains that \\"international development agencies have always paid the bills for the Mekong regime,\\" with European (especially Scandinavian) nations picking up the slack left by the United States, and then (to a lesser extent) Japan.Browder 2000: 237. The Mekong Committee was a forceful advocate for large-scale dams and other projects, primarily preoccupied with facilitating projects. For example, the 1970 Indicative Basin Plan called for 30,000 km2 of irrigation by the year 2000 (up from 2,130 km2) as well as 87 short-term tributary development projects and 17 long-term development projects on the mainstream. The Indicative Basin Plan was crafted largely in response to criticisms of the committee's \\"piecemeal\\" approach and declining political support of the organization; for example, the Committee had received no funds from Thailand, normally the biggest contributor, during the 1970 fiscal year.Jacobs 1995: 142. The completion of all 17 projects was never intended; rather the list was meant to serve as a \\"menu\\" for international donors, who were to select 9 or 10 of the projects. While a few of the short-term projects were implemented, none of the long-term projects prevailed in the political climate of the ensuing decade, which included the end of the Vietnam War in 1975.Nakayama 2002: 276; Jacobs 1995. Several tributary dams were constructed, but only one--the Nam Ngum Dam (completed 1971), in Laos--outside of Thailand, whose electricity was sold to Thailand. According to Makim,Makim 2002: 18. Nam Ngum was the \\"only truly intergovernmental project achieved\\" by the committee. This period was also marked by efforts to expand the jurisdiction and mandate of the committee between 1958 and 1975, which did not receive the consent of all four riparians.Radosevich and Olson 1999: 6–7. However, these efforts culminated, in January 1975, in the adoption of a 35-article Joint Declaration of Principles for Utilization of the Waters of the Mekong Basin by the sixty- eighth session of the Mekong Committee, prohibiting the \\"unilateral appropriation\\" without \\"prior approval\\" and \\"extra-basin diversion\\" without unanimous consent.MRC 1975. However, no committee sessions were held in 1976 or 1977, as no plenipotentiary members had been appointed by Cambodia, Laos, or Vietnam--all of which experienced regime change in 1975.Nakayama 2002: 277. ===Interim Mekong Committee (1978–1995)=== Mekong River The rise of the xenophobic and paranoid Khmer Rouge government in Cambodia made Cambodia's continued participation unsustainable, so in April 1977 the other three riparians agreed to the Declaration Concerning the Interim Mekong Committee, which resulted in the establishment of the Interim Mekong Committee in January 1978. The weakened interim organization was only able to study large-scale projects and implement a few small-scale projects, almost exclusively in Thailand; instead the institutional role of the organization shifted largely to data collection. The 1987 Revised Indicative Basin Plan--the high-water mark of the Interim Committee's activity--scaled back the ambitions of the 1970 plan, envisioning a cascade of smaller dams along the Mekong's mainstream, divided into 29 projects, 26 of which were strictly national in scope. The Revised Indicative Basin Plan can also be seen as laying the groundwork for Cambodia's readmission.Jacobs 1995: 145. The Supreme National Council of Cambodia did request readmission in June 1991. Cambodia's readmission was largely a side-show which masked the true issue facing the riparians: that the rapid economic growth experienced in Thailand relative to its neighbors had made even the modest sovereignty limitations imposed by Mekong agreements seem undesirable in Bangkok. Thailand and the other three riparians (led by Vietnam, the most powerful of the remaining three states) were locked in disagreement over whether Cambodia should be readmitted under the terms of the 1957 Statute (and more importantly, the 1975 Joint Declaration), with Thailand preferring to negotiate an entirely new framework to allow its planned Kong-Chi-Moon Project (and others) to proceed without a Vietnamese veto.Nakayama 2002: 278. Article 10 of the Joint Declaration, requiring unanimous consent for all mainstream development and inter-basin diversion proved to be the main sticking point of Cambodia's readmission, with Thailand perhaps prepared to walk away from the regime altogether. The conflict came to a head in April 1992 when Thailand forced the executive agent of the Committee, Chuck Lankester, to resign and leave the country after barring the secretariat from the March 1992 meeting.Browder 2000: 247. This prompted a series of meetings organized by the UNDP (which was terrified that the regime in which it had invested so much might disappear), culminating in the April 1995 Agreement on the Cooperation for the Sustainable Development of the Mekong River Basin signed by Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam in Chiang Rai, Thailand, creating the Mekong River Commission (MRC). Since the dramatic confrontation of 1992, several seemingly overlapping organizations were created, including the Asian Development Bank's Greater Mekong Subregion (ADB-GMS, 1992), Japan's Forum of Comprehensive Development of Indochina (FCDI, 1993), the Quadripite Economic Cooperation (QEC, 1993), the Association of South East Asian Nations and Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry's Working Group on Economic Cooperation in Indochina and Burma (AEM- MITI, 1994), and (almost finalized) Myanmar and Singapore's ASEAN-Mekong Basin Development Cooperation (ASEAN-ME, 1996). ===Mekong River Commission (1995–present)=== right The MRC has evolved since 1995. Some of the \\"thorny issues\\" set aside during the negotiation of the agreement were at least partially resolved by the implementation of subsequent programmes such as the Water Utilization Programme (WUP) agreed to in 1999 and committed to implementation by 2005.Sneddon and Fox 2006: 191. The commission’s hierarchical structure has been repeatedly tweaked, as in July 2000 when the MRC Secretariat was restructured. The 2001 Work Programme has largely come to be viewed as a shift \\"from a project-oriented focus to an emphasis on better management and preservation of existing resources.\\" On paper, the Work Programme represents a rejection of the ambitious development schemes embodied by the 1970 and 1987 Indicative Basin Plans (calling for no mainstream dams) and a shift to a holistic rather than programmatic approach. In part, these changes represent a response to criticism of the MRC's failure to undertake a \\"regional-scale project\\" or even a region-level focus.Bakker 1999: 223. 2001 also saw a major shift in the MRC--at least on paper--when it committed to a role as a \\"learning organization\\" with an emphasis on \\"the livelihoods of the people in the Mekong region.\\"MRC 2001b. In the same year its annual report emphasized the importance of \\"bottoms-up\\" solutions and the \\"voice of the people directly affected.\\"MRC 2001a: 23. Similarly, the 2001 MRC Hydropower Development Strategy explicitly disavowed the \\"promotion of specific projects\\" in favor of \\"basin-wide issues.\\"Sneddon and Fox 2007a: 2177. In part, these shifts mark a retreat from past project failures and recognition that the MRC faces multiple, and often more lucrative, competitors in the project arena.Makim 2002: 38. ==Governance== The MRC is governed by its four member countries through the Joint Committee and the Council. Members of the Joint Committee are usually senior civil servants heading government departments. There is one member from each country. The Joint Committee meets two to three times a year to approve budgets and strategic plans. Members of the Council are cabinet ministers. The Council meets once a year. Technical and administrative support is provided by the MRC Secretariat. The secretariat is based in Vientiane, Laos, with over 120 staff including scientists, administrators, and technical staff. A chief executive officer manages the secretariat. In April 2010, the Mekong River Commission convened a summit in Hua Hin, Thailand.

Part of a joint initiative by the US agency for International Development (USAID) and NASA, SERVIR Mekong project, with five countries, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam including Myanmar which aims to tap into the latest technologies to help the Mekong River region protect its vital ecosystem. Although China contributes only 16–18 percent of the Mekong's overall water volume, the glacial melt waters of the Tibetan plateau take on increasing importance during the dry season.Robertson 2006. The ability of upstream nations to undermine downstream cooperation was perhaps best symbolized by an April 1995 ceremonial boat trip from Thailand to Vietnam--to celebrate the signing of the 1995 Agreement-- which ran aground mid-river as a result of China filling the reservoir of the Manwan Dam.The Economist 1995. Although China and Burma became \\"dialogue partners\\" of the MRC in 1996 and slowly but steadily escalated their (non- binding) participation in its various forums, it is at present unthinkable that either would join the MRC in the near future.Radosevich and Olsen 1999. In April 2002, China began providing daily water level data to the MRC during the flood season.Paul 2003. Critics noted that the emphasis on \\"flood control\\" rather than dry season flows represented an important omission given the concerns prioritized by the Mekong regime.Dore 2003: 422. In July 2003, MRC CEO Joern Kristensen reported that China had agreed to scale back its plans to blast rapids by implementing only phase one (of three) of its Upper Mekong Navigation Improvement Project; however, China’s future intentions in this area are far from certain.Pinyorat 2000. One area in which China has been particularly reticent is in providing information about the operation of its dams, rather than just flow data, including refusing to join emergency meetings in 2004.Pearce 2004. Only in 2005 did China agreed to hold technical discussions directly with the MRC.MRC 2007. On 2 June 2005, at the invitation of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Water Resources, MRC CEO Dr. Olivier Cogels and a delegation of the secretariat's senior staff made the first official visit to Beijing to hold technical consultations under the framework of cooperation between China and the MRC, within the scope of the Mekong Programme. The delegation identified a number of potential areas of cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Water Resources, and the Ministry of Communication, Information and Transport. These discussions resulted in China supplying the MRC (beginning in 2007) with 24-hour water level and 12-hour rainfall data for flood forecasts in exchange for monthly flow data from the MRC Secretariat. The incentives for China to enter into cooperative regimes on the Mekong are substantially reduced by the alternative of the Salween River as a commercial outlet for China's Yunnan province, made considerably more attractive by requiring negotiation solely with Burma, rather than with four different riparians. News media and official sources often portray China's joining the commission as a panacea for resolving the over-development of the Mekong. However, there is no indication that China's joining the MRC would provide downstream riparians with any real capacity to challenge China's development plans, given the dramatic power imbalances exhibited by these countries' relations with China.Wain 2004. The MRC has been hesitant to fully register concerns about Chinese upstream hydro-development. For example, in a letter to the Bangkok Post, MRC CEO Dr. Olivier Cogels in fact argued that Chinese dams would increase the river's dry season volume as their purpose was electricity generation and not irrigation.Cogels 2007. While such dams certainly could increase dry season flows, the only certainty about future Chinese reservoir policies seems to be that they will be crafted outside of downstream cooperation regimes. Public statements from MRC leaders in the same vein as Cogels' comments have—to some—earned the MRC a reputation of being complicit in allowing \\"China's dam-building machine float downstream.\\"Sherman 2004. ==See also== * SERVIR Mekong Project ==References== ==Bibliography== *Backer, Ellen Bruzelius. 2007. \\"The Mekong River Commission: Does It Work, and How Does the Mekong Basin’s Geography Influence Its Effectiveness?\\" Südostasien aktuell: Journal of Current Southeast Asian Affairs, p. 31–55. *Baker, Chris. 2007, February 24. \\"What is Vientiane?\\" Bangkok Post. *Bakker, Karen. 1999. \\"The politics of hydropower: developing the Mekong.\\" Political Geography, 18: 209–232. * *Cogels, Olivier. 2007, January 9. \\"Mekong hydropower development is good.\\" Bangkok Post. *Dore, John. 2003. \\"The governance of increasing Mekong regionalism.\\" In Social Challenges for the Mekong Region.

Groucho plays detective Wolf J. Flywheel (a character name originating from the Marx-Perrin radio show Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel in the early 1930s). The Big Store was the last of five films the Marx Brothers made under contract to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The Marxes had decided to retire as a team and The Big Store was advertised as their farewell film. However, they would return to the screen in A Night in Casablanca (1946) and Love Happy (1949). Groucho later said that these last two films were made primarily because Chico, a compulsive gambler, needed the money. The Big Store costars singer Tony Martin and Virginia Grey as the love interests, and long- time Marx Brothers foil Margaret Dumont in her seventh and final film with the Marxes. The villain was portrayed by Douglass Dumbrille, who had played a similar role in A Day at the Races (1937). Tagline: \\"Where everything is a good buy. Goodbye!\\" ==Plot== Department Store owner Hiram Phelps has died, leaving half-ownership in the Phelps Department Store to his nephew, singer Tommy Rogers. The other half is left to Hiram's sister and Tommy's aunt, Martha Phelps (Margaret Dumont). Rogers has no interest in running a department store, so he plans to sell his interest in the store and use the money to build a music conservatory. Store manager Grover (Douglass Dumbrille) plots to kill Rogers before he can sell his half of the business, marry the wealthy Martha, then likely kill her too, becoming sole owner of the Phelps Department Store. Martha is highly suspicious, worried about Tommy's safety lest anyone suspect her of foul play to take over the store. Against Grover's wishes, she hires private detective Wolf J. Flywheel (Groucho) as a floorwalker and Tommy's bodyguard. Between Tommy's romance with store employee Joan Sutton (Virginia Grey) and Flywheel romancing Martha, Flywheel, Ravelli (Chico) and Wacky (Harpo) eventually expose Grover and save Tommy. ==Comedy highlights== The film has two extended scenes. One is in the store's bed department, with novel beds that come out of the walls and floor. The second takes place near the film's climax, where Groucho, Chico and Harpo escape their pursuers in a madcap chase through the store, involving the elevator, a staircase, chandeliers, roller skates, a mail chute and a bicycle. The elaborate sequence utilized an unusual number of stunt doubles, Mack Sennett- type slapstick stunts and stop motion photography for a Marx Brothers film. At two points, Groucho breaks the fourth wall. During the \\"Sing While You Sell\\" sequence, as he narrates a fashion show, he speaks a few asides, including \\"This is a bright red dress, but Technicolor is so expensive.\\" Later, he comments, \\"I told you in the first reel [Grover] was a crook.\\" ==Musical numbers== As in the previous Marx Bros. MGM films, The Big Store contains elaborate musical numbers, including as the upbeat \\"Sing While You Sell\\", led by a singing, dancing Groucho; and the \\"Tenement Symphony\\" sung by Tony Martin and a children's choir. The screenwriting team of Kuller, Golden and Fimberg also supplied the lyrics to Hal Borne's original music. The Big Store is the second Marx film with an instrumental version of \\"Cosi-Cosa\\" from A Night at the Opera, which can be heard during the moving bed scene. It was also heard in A Day at the Races. *\\"If It's You\\"- Tony Martin (music & lyrics by Ben Oakland, Artie Shaw & Milton Drake) *\\"Sing While You Sell\\"- Groucho, Six Hits and a Miss, Virginia O'Brien and Harpo as a drum-beating snake charmer *\\"Rock- a-bye Baby\\"- Virginia O'Brien *\\"Mama Eu Quero\\"- Chico and Harpo (piano duet) *\\"A Whimsical Trio\\" - Harpo (harp, violin, cello) (by Mario Castelnuovo- Tedesco, using music from the works below) **\\"Mozart's Sonata in C major\\" - Harpo (harp) **\\"Beethoven's Minuet\\" - Harpo (harp) *\\"Tenement Symphony\\"- Tony Martin, onstage choir and orchestra, featuring Chico and Harpo ==Cast== *Groucho Marx - Wolf J.

Theodore Strauss of The New York Times wrote that \\"if it lacks the continuously harebrained invention of, say, 'A Night at the Opera,' the boys are still the most erratic maniacs this side of bars. If one were entirely truthful one would have to admit that the picture has many a dull stretch, that the tricks have been overworked, that the boys are slowing down, etc., etc. But with Marxian adherents—among whom we most decidedly belong—the question is simply, Are the Marx Brothers in it? They are.\\" A review in Variety called it a \\"moderate comedy where dull stretches overshadow the several socko laugh sequences during a bumpy unfolding ... Marx Bros. repeat their familiar antics without much variation from previous appearances.\\" Film Daily suggested that a couple of the chase scenes were \\"a little lengthy\\" but still concluded, \\"A 'laugh clocker' could run a high total checking this and the preview audience seemed to love it.\\" John Mosher of The New Yorker wrote that the film was \\"not great Marx material, not a film that collectors will exhibit as a sample of this era's humor, but again and again the old flash is there.\\" The film made a profit of only $33,000. Nonetheless, it was among the more profitable Marx Brothers films of the period.Scott Eyman, Lion of Hollywood: The Life and Legend of Louis B.

Part of the meat is very finely minced, but another part retains its structure. Jagdwurst contains about 20 percent fat. In the regions of the former GDR (eastern Germany), a common dish is sliced Jagdwurst coated in breadcrumbs (normally mixed with egg) and fried, often in butter.

Jagdwurst can also be served on fresh buttered bread or breakfast rolls with a hint of mustard. Construction workers in Germany would carry a pocket knife with their lunch box, which contained a small roll of Jagdwurst, buttered bread slices and German mustard and perhaps even beer.

In 1515 Shachna established the yeshiva in Lublin, which had the third largest Jewish community in Poland during that period. Shachna became famous as a teacher, and students came to Lublin from all over Europe to study there. The yeshiva became a center of learning of both Talmud and Kabbalah; the Rosh yeshiva received the title of rector and equal rights to those in Polish universities with the permission of the King in 1567.

He is a founding member of Aquarium Rescue Unit and Jazz Is Dead and has played with The Allman Brothers Band, Project Z, Derek Trucks Band, Phil Lesh and Friends, and The Dead. ==Career== A native of Fayetteville, North Carolina, Herring is the son of a high school English teacher and a Superior Court judge. The youngest of three brothers, he attended Terry Sanford High School in Fayetteville. Although he played saxophone in the high school band, he became known for his talent on guitar, which he had begun playing at age 13. Herring had a Telecaster guitar with a Stratocaster neck, in the same style as one of his biggest influences, Steve Morse of the Dixie Dregs. After high school he formed the Paradox, a cover band that played mostly jazz fusion and songs by the Dixie Dregs, Al Di Meola, and Chuck Mangione. The band's horn section included Wayne Rigsby and Charles Humphries on trumpet and Herring on saxophone. After graduating from high school, in 1980, Herring attended a summer session at the Berklee College of Music. In addition, he is a graduate of The Guitar Institute of Technology in Hollywood, California. Herring was the lead guitarist for the jam band Col. Bruce Hampton and the Aquarium Rescue Unit. Formed in Atlanta in 1989, its members include Allman Brothers Band bassist Oteil Burbridge and Leftover Salmon drummer Jeff Sipe. He was invited to participate on the H.O.R.D.E. tour with Aquarium Rescue Unit in 1992 and 1993 and was offered the lead guitar job in the Allman Brothers Band after Dickey Betts was arrested after a show in Saratoga Springs, New York on July 30, 1993. Herring declined to take the position full-time. Bruce Hampton left Aquarium Rescue Unit in 1994, citing time pressure as his reason. Herring and other members continued to tour in early 1997 until drummer Jeff Sipe departed for Leftover Salmon. In 1998 and 1999 Herring went on tour as Jazz Is Dead with bassist Alphonso Johnson, keyboardist T Lavitz, and drummer Billy Cobham. The band's albums included jazz rock versions of songs by the Grateful Dead. Herring also appeared on the album Out of the Madness by The Derek Trucks Band. He went on tour with the Allman Brothers Band in 2000, then joined Phil Lesh of the Grateful Dead in Phil Lesh and Friends. In 2002, Herring joined The Other Ones, a band which included four former members of the Grateful Dead -- Phil Lesh, Bob Weir, Mickey Hart, and Bill Kreutzmann. Herring continued to play with the group, now renamed The Dead, in 2003 and 2004. In 2005, he also toured with the jazz, funk, and occasionally bluegrass-oriented band The Codetalkers, which featured Herring on guitar with his previous bandmate Col. Bruce Hampton on vocals, harmonica, and guitar. This band also allowed Herring to expand a musical friendship with Codetalkers' front man Bobby Lee Rodgers, with whom Herring formed a new band in the spring of 2006 (tentatively dubbed Herring, Rodgers, and Sipe). 2005 also marked the release of the Lincoln Memorial disc from Project Z, of which Jimmy is a founding member. In January 2005, Herring appeared on the Jam Cruise 3 stage with several acts, including Colonel Les Claypool's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade. Herring left Phil Lesh and Friends in November, 2005. On August 3, 2006, Widespread Panic announced Herring would be taking over the lead guitar spot in the band after the departure of George McConnell. Also in 2006, Herring and an almost complete original lineup of Aquarium Rescue Unit reunited as Col. Bruce Hampton and The Aquarium Rescue Unit featuring Oteil Burbridge, Jimmy Herring, Col. Bruce Hampton and Jeff Sipe with Bobby Lee Rodgers sitting in. In 2006, Jimmy officially became a member of Widespread Panic as their new lead guitar player. HIs first performance with the group was at Radio City Music Hall. In 2008, Herring released Lifeboat, his first official solo album, on Abstract Logix. The material consists primarily of instrumental jazz-rock fusion, and features a rotating lineup of long-time Herring collaborators, including Oteil and brother Kofi Burbridge, Jeff Sipe, alto and soprano saxophonist Greg Osby, and others, including two songs featuring Derek Trucks. The album was met with generally positive reviews. On February 7, 2009, Herring, along with Steve Gorman (The Black Crowes), guitarist Audley Freed (Jakob Dylan, ex-Crowes, Blue Floyd) and bassist-singer Nick Govrik, made their live debut of Trigger Hippy at the Cox Capitol Theater in Macon, Georgia. On August 21, 2012, Jimmy Herring released Subject to Change without Notice, his second solo album on Abstract Logix. The album received rave reviews and was produced by John Keane who is well known for producing albums for Widespread Panic, R.E.M, The Indigo Girls among others. Jimmy Herring was also on the cover of Guitar Player Magazine the very same year. He toured the album extensively in the United States during the Fall of 2012 with Jeff Sipe, Neal Fountain and Matt Slocum. In 2013, Jimmy Herring, Wayne Krantz, Michael Landau, Etienne Mbappe and Keith Carlock started a band called The Ringers. The idea of this five musicians to form this unique band came from Abstract Logix Founder and Producer Souvik Dutta. They went to perform five concerts in USA to a wonderful response. The Ringers returned in 2014 performing fourteen concerts in January and February, this time with drummer Gary Novak. In 2017, Jimmy Herring formed The Invisible Whip with Jeff Sipe on drums, Jason Crosby on violin and Rhodes, Kevin Scott on bass, Matt Slocum on Organ. They performed 50 shows who includes co-billing with John McLaughlin on his farewell American Tour. In 2018, Abstract Logix released \\"Live in San Francisco\\" , a live album from John McLaughlin and Jimmy Herring's co-bill tour from the year prior. On May 26, 2018, Jimmy Herring played guitar with The Dave Matthews Band in Atlanta, Georgia. He joined the band on stage for the songs Satellite and #41 where he again displayed his smooth playing style and warmth on the guitar. In 2019, Jimmy Herring formed The 5 of 7, featuring Kevin Scott on bass, Matt Slocum on keys, Darren Stanley on drums and Rick Lollar on voice and guitar. ==Equipment== Herring's primary guitar is a white PRS NF3 model guitar with a maple neck, stock electronics, mint green pickguard and Dunlop 6000 frets. As of 2019, for the Jimmy Herring and the 5 of 7 project, Jimmy has been primarily using a natural finished PRS NF3 model guitar that was custom made for him by Paul Reed Smith. Jimmy has also been known to use a modified American Standard Fender Stratocaster. The Stratocaster is equipped with two Lollar Imperial humbuckers. The fingerboard radius has been flattened out to 20\\" and has Dunlop 6000 fret wire, which are the tallest and widest guitar frets manufactured today. Herring also uses a 1969 Stratocaster as well as several other PRS guitars (including a hollowbody) and has played a 1970 Gibson SG given as a gift from Derek Trucks. Although he has long used effects sparingly, his 2005 Codetalkers rig saw him sport an Ernie Ball volume pedal and an H&K; Tube Factor. He has expanded his effects pedals when playing Dead related music, and sported a TC Electronic M-One, and a Mutron with both The Dead and Phil Lesh and Friends. He splits the signal off at the speaker output of his amp and uses that signal to drive a separate solid state amp just for reverb. The reverb level is controlled with a volume pedal. As of early 2014, the reverb unit is an Eventide Space Reverb. Amps are chosen for specific venues and projects. Most common now are a slightly modified blackface Super Reverb head, slightly modified blackface Pro Reverb, slightly modified blackface Twin Reverb, Stock blond/black Bassman head. Depending on the amp, the speakers are either Tone Tubby or ElectroVoice. In the last few years, Jimmy has also employed amps from Homestead and Germino, and guitars from PRS; an NF3, a Custom 22 with an extra volume knob for the neck pickup, a 20th PS Anniversary, and a 594. The NF3 and Custom 22 are the most prevalent. A strat with 3 single coils is sometimes used as well. ===With Widespread Panic=== At the beginning of Herring's tenure with Widespread Panic he was using his favorite guitar, a 3-color sunburst Stratocaster built by his friend Gene Baker at the Fender Custom Shop, equipped with two Seymour Duncan 59' reissue humbuckers, with a 1973 Marshall Superlead 100 watt amp accompanied by a 4x12 Marshall stereo and a 67' blackface Fender Super Reverb as amplifiers. During the remainder of the Fall 2006 tour Herring continued to use his custom shop Strat. At the beginning of Fall 2007, Herring began using Fuchs Overdrive Supreme amplifiers. Into 2009 Herring continued to use Fuchs amps, but now used a Tripledrive Supreme 100 watt head, and occasionally an Overdrive Supreme 100 watt head. He uses a Tone Tubby 4x12 cab and two 2x12 Hard Truckers speaker cabs with Alnico tone tubby speakers. He also uses a Fractal Audio Axe-Fx for effects, mainly reverb and delay sounds. In 2011 he continues to use Fuchs as his main amplifier. His main guitars are the White American Standard Stratocaster with Lollar Imperial humbuckers and an MIJ '62 Telecaster Custom reissue with Lollar Vintage T pickups. ==Discography== * Endangered Species (Tone Center, 2001) * Lifeboat (Abstract Logix, 2008) * Subject to Change without Notice (Abstract Logix, 2012) * Live in San Francisco (Abstract Logix, 2018) Source: With Aquarium Rescue Unit *Eepeee (1994) *In a Perfect World (1994) *The Calling (1997) With Col.

They adhere to the Maliki madhhab, one of the four Sunni schools of law. Since independence in 1960, Mauritania has been an Islamic republic. The Constitutional Charter of 1985 declares Islam the state religion and sharia the law of the land. ==History== Mauritania mostly colored baby blue (Maliki Sunni) Islam first spread southward into West Africa, including Mauritania, with the movement of Muslim traders and craftsmen and later with the founders of Islamic brotherhoods. Although the brotherhoods (Sufism and tariqa) played a role in the early expansion of Islam, it was not until the nineteenth century that these religious orders assumed importance when they attempted to make religion a force for expanding identities and loyalties beyond the limits of kinship. The relative peace brought to the area by French administration and the growing resentment of colonial rule contributed to the rapid rise in the power and influence of the brotherhoods. In recent decades, these orders have opposed tribalism and have been an indispensable element in the growth of nationalist sentiment. Since the Ahmadiyya Islamic movement has a large presence in West Africa, the African Muslim Congress met in Mauritania in 1976 to call upon African nations to regard Ahmadi Muslims as apostates, though with little success. Since 2010, there has also been a large increase in converts to Shia Islam - the number being estimated at around 50,000 and being primarily from the Beni Ḥassān tribes. ==Sufi brotherhoods== In the 1980s, two brotherhoods (tariqa), the Qadiriyyah and the Tijaniyyah, accounted for nearly all the brotherhood membership in Mauritania. The Qadiriyyah and Tijaniyyah were essentially parallel \\"ways,\\" differing primarily in their methods of reciting the litanies. Their Islamic doctrines and their religious obligations were basically similar. Two smaller brotherhoods also existed — the Shadhiliyyah, centered in Boumdeït in Tagant Region, and the Goudfiya, found in the regions of Tagant, Adrar, Hodh ech Chargui, and Hodh el Gharbi. ==Indigenous traditions== As Islam spread westward and southward in Africa, various elements of indigenous religious systems became absorbed into and then altered strictly Islamic beliefs. For example, the Islamic tradition in Mauritania began to include a variety of spirits and supernatural beings, whilst recognizing Allah as the only God. Muslims in Mauritania believe in various lesser spirits apparently transformed from pre-Islamic faiths into Islamic spirits. ==See also== * Islam by country ==References== * Mauritania ","title":"Islam in Mauritania"},{"id":"1276943","text":"Anatomy () is a 2000 German horror film written and directed by Stefan Ruzowitzky that stars Franka Potente. The film became the highest-grossing German-language movie in 2000.Foroohar, Rana; Seno, Alexandra; Theil, Stefan. \\"Hurray for Globowood\\", Newsweek International, May 27, 2002 Columbia Pictures released the film's English-dubbed version in the United States theatrically.Lucasfilm uses some Force with the script, USA Today, 8 September 2000 However, the dubbed version under-performed at the United States box office. A sequel, Anatomy 2 (Anatomie 2) was released in 2003. ==Plot== Medical student Paula Henning wins a place in a summer course at the University of Heidelberg, where her grandfather had been a noted professor. During one of her classes on anatomy, the body of David, a young man whom Paula encountered on her train to Heidelberg, turns up on her dissection table. Paula's instructor, Professor Grombek, humiliates her by daring her to dissect the heart. Paula finds that David's body presents strange cuts, and decides to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding his death. When she goes to cut a sample for an independent test, she is amazed to find a triple \\"A\\" mark near David's ankle. She is then startled by the school's mortuary attendant, who wants to know if Professor Grombek is aware of her acts. Paula finds clues pointing to an ancient secret society, the Anti- Hippocratic Society, which performs gruesome experiments on living people deemed undesirable. Paula also comes across research about the rituals that they perform on transgressors of their rules, or those who inquire too much. One night, Paula sits on her bed and realizes it has been soaked in blood, with candles left under it, as a sign of warning from the Society. She then attacks a figure that enters her room, who turns out to be her friend Hein, who wants someone to talk to over his recent breakup from his girlfriend Gretchen. Casper, Paula's romantic interest, also enters the room and becomes furious that she is not alone. Hein leaves, apparently more at peace. As Gretchen and her new boyfriend prepare to have sex in one of the morgue halls, Hein murders the other man in a jealous rage. He then injects Gretchen with poison, telling her that he will preserve her body. Hein hides it in the morgue and removes the head to prevent identification. He is so absorbed in the labor that he falls asleep without having dispatched the other body. When Paula tries to share her findings about the Society with Hein the next day, he menacingly tells her it's dangerous to know too much. Grombek reveals that her grandfather was a member, and that the drug he became famous for developing was the result of his experiments in Nazi concentration camps. She flees to the hospital to confront her grandfather, but is told that he has died. At the assembly of the Society, Hein expresses no remorse for the murders and defiantly accepts their punishment, slashing himself three times in the face. Grombek takes responsibility for the killings and leaves to call the authorities to arrest Hein. Later, while Paula destroys the diplomas granted to her grandfather, a crazed Hein kills Grombek in his house. Paula gets back to the school but is trapped by Hein and his accomplice, Phil. While they are preparing her for preservation, her bindings are partially cut by Casper. Paula gets loose, poisons Phil, and runs away until Hein strikes a high voltage cable and dies. Casper and Paula then escape together. Halfway through the end credits, a sequence shows two of Paula's classmates praising Hein's abilities in dissection and preservation, discuss Grombek's imminent replacement, and how in their respective practices they will keep a low profile while experimenting for the Anti-Hippocratic Society. ==Cast== * Franka Potente as Paula Henning * Benno Fürmann as Hein * Rüdiger Vogler as Dr. Henning * Anna Loos as Gretchen * Oliver Wnuk as Ludwig * Arndt Schwering- Sohnrey as David * Sebastian Blomberg as Caspar * Holger Speckhahn as Phil * Traugott Buhre as Prof. Grombek * Gennadi Vengerov as the Preparateur ==Reception== On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 58% based on , with a weighted average rating of 5.3/10.

Produced and directed by Raymond Raikes, Neil Tuson, and Charles Lefaux, it was aired in 15-minute episodes at 6.45 (later 6.15) each weekday evening. From 11 January 1947 an additional \\"omnibus\\" edition repeated all of the week's programmes each Saturday morning between 11.00 and 12.00. In all, 711 episodes were produced and the serial achieved a peak audience of 15 million.James Chapman (2006) Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television Vol. 26, No. 4, pp. 537–559 \\"‘HONEST BRITISH VIOLENCE’: CRITICAL RESPONSES TO DICK BARTON—SPECIAL AGENT (1946–1951)\\" Its end was marked by a leading article in The Times.The Times, 31 March 1951, p. 7 \\"The Last Instalment\\" The serial followed the adventures of ex-Commando Captain Richard Barton MC (Noel Johnson, later Duncan Carse and Gordon Davies) who, with his mates Jock Anderson (Alex McCrindle) and Snowy White (John Mann), solved all sorts of crimes, escaped from dangerous situations, and saved the nation from disaster time and again. The series was replaced from time to time by one about the adventures of an explorer. One episode was titled \\"Plague on the Plateau\\". Beginning in 1948, the Hammer film company made three Dick Barton films and, long after the radio series had been replaced by The Archers, Southern Television made a television version in 1979. Dick Barton has also been adapted into a tongue-in-cheek stage play and a spoof radio comedy. Each version has featured the original's memorable signature tune, \\"Devil's Galop\\" by Charles Williams. ==Radio series== ===Style=== The series was devised by producer Norman Collins. The scripts were written by Edward J. Mason and Geoffrey Webb. The programme gave rise to a popular catchphrase of the late 1940s \\"With one bound Dick was free!\\" which made light of the fact that no matter how dangerous the cliffhanging situation Dick found himself in every evening, he would always escape easily. Early ideas for the character's name included \\"Bill Barton\\" and \\"Rex Drake\\". However, the production team finally settled on the more dynamic Dick Barton. After the series had been on the air for some time, the BBC (conscious that the biggest audience for the programme was schoolboys) wrote a strict code of what Dick and his chums could and couldn't do, one clause famously stating \\"Sex plays no part in his adventures.\\" ===Cast=== *Noel Johnson as Dick Barton *John Mann as Snowy White *William Fox as Colonel Gardiner *Alex McCrindle as Jock Anderson *Margaret Robertson as Jean Hunter ===Cancellation=== In 1951 The Archers was first broadcast at 11.45 am on the Light Programme. BBC management, led by drama head Val Gielgud, had never felt comfortable with the sensationalism of Dick Barton. The Archers, which they considered more 'suitable', took Dick Barton place in the schedules from Easter 1951. ===Revivals=== In 1972 as part of the BBC's Golden Jubilee, the BBC broadcast a new, abridged, 10-episode version of the first Barton serial - \\"The Secret Weapon\\". The cast included many members of the original cast, including Noel Johnson, John Mann, William Fox, Alex McCrindle, and Margaret Robertson. From October 1997 to May 1998, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a six-part sequel/pastiche called Richard Barton: General Practitioner!, in which Dick Barton's son Richard is a country doctor caring for his apparently senile father, who retreats into fantasies based on his past adventures, believing that there are devilish enemies lurking around him. The series was written by Edward Mason's son Lol Mason, and featured Moray Watson as old Dick Barton, Robert Bathurst as his son Richard, Matilda Ziegler as Richard's wife Sally, Julian Dutton as young Dick Barton and Iain Cuthbertson as Jock Anderson. The series was rebroadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra in 2015 http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05nxw2c and again in 2019. In 2009, BBC Audiobooks released Dick Barton and the Mystery of the Missing Formula (), a reading of a novel based on the radio serials written by Mike Dorrell and read by Toby Stephens. The BBC produced a completely new live recording of an original 1951 Dick Barton serial in June 2013, starring Tim Bentinck and Terry Molloy. http://www.bbcshop.com/dick-barton-live/invt/9781910281253 ==Films== Beginning in 1948, the Hammer film company made three Dick Barton films, which were intended to be the beginning of a long-running series. Don Stannard, the star, was killed in a car crash in 1949, and Hammer decided to discontinue the series after the production of only three films. Hammer shelved plans to film the next Dick Barton film, Dick Barton in Africa written by John Gilling.p.59 Hearn, Marcus & Barnes, Alan The Hammer Story: The Authorised History of Hammer Films 1997 Titan Books * Dick Barton: Special Agent (1948) * Dick Barton Strikes Back (1949) * Dick Barton at Bay (1950) ==Television== In 1979, Southern Television, one of the smaller ITV Network Companies, made a series of Dick Barton - Special Agent which ran in an early evening slot on the ITV Network. Like the original, it ran in 15-minute segments and was again accompanied by the familiar theme tune, the titles playing against an animated dagger and target motif. The production was blighted by financial troubles, though, and some critics said it was a mistake to try to resurrect the character. The cast of the show was Tony Vogel as Dick Barton, Anthony Heaton as Snowy White, James Cosmo as Jock Anderson and John Gatrell as Sir Richard Marley. The 32x15 minutes episodes were transmitted by most of the ITV network on Saturdays and Sundays between January and April 1979. Southern, however, screened the show across consecutive nights from Mondays through to Thursday in the radio series's original timeslot of 6.45 to 7.00pm. * Adventure One written by Clive Exton, in ten parts. Demobbed after six years in the army, old friend Sir Richard Marley asks Barton to look into the disappearance of his daughter Virginia (Fiona Fullerton) and son Rex (Kevan Sheehan). They come up against master criminal, Melganik played by John G Heller. * Adventure Two written by Julian Bond, in eight parts. At a late night celebration at the \\"Blue Parrot\\", Barton and his colleagues rescue a young girl, Lucy Cameron (Debbie Farrington) from being attacked. She tells them that her father, George Cameron (Colin Rix) has been kidnapped by the evil Muller (Guy Deghy) who is after the deadly poison he has developed. * Adventure Three written by Clive Exton, in six parts. Celebrating from the last adventure, Dick's Aunt Agatha (Stella Kemball) rings up and tells him that her house has vanished. A further phone call from Sir Richard Marley reveals that scientist, Harold Jenkins (Peter Godfrey) has perfected his ultimate weapon and Barton and comrades soon find themselves up against Melganik again. * Adventure Four written by Julian Bond, in eight parts. Dandy Parkes (Terence Seward), a middle-aged playboy and Amanda Aston (Marsha Fitzalan), wife of a respected Whitehall official are threatened by the Drew Brothers (Ernie Drew by Bernard Kay). The complete series was released on DVD in March 2009, and in 2010 reruns of Dick Barton were shown on the British satellite television channel Film 24. By 2016 it had reappeared on another satellite channel, Talking Pictures TV. ==Stage musical== A stage musical, Dick Barton Episode I, Special Agent, written by Phil Willmott, directed by Ted Craig. Musical direction was by Stefan Bednarczyk. It premièred at the Warehouse Theatre in December 1998 to great acclaim. It was revived in 1999 and productions then toured Britain between 1998 and 2001. Following its success, further \\"episodes\\" were written and performed at the Warehouse Theatre: * December 1999 was Dick Barton Episode II, The Curse Of The Pharaoh's Tomb by Phil Willmott.

For some time, this was the only Dick Barton radio material that was commercially available, having been recovered from a recording made by a member of the public. However, this has now changed. In February 2011, BBC Radio 4 and a number of national newspapers reported that 338 episodes of Dick Barton recorded in the late 1940s had been recovered from the NFSA [National Film and Sound Archive] in Australia; these re-recordings, using the original BBC scripts and music cues, starred Douglas Kelly as Barton with Moira Carleton, Clifford Cowley, Richard Davies, William Lloyd and Patricia Kennedy. BBC Worldwide's audio arm have released a number of these on CD. The Dick Barton radio series was later relaunched in the UK on BBC Radio 4 Extra (formerly BBC Radio 7) and further Dick Barton CDs have been announced by AudioGO (using the NFSA recordings). The BBC produced a completely new live recording of an original 1951 Dick Barton serial in June 2013, starring Tim Bentinck and Terry Molloy. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22689138 This new live production of the 1951 Barton story 'Dick Barton and the Trail of the Rocket' was recorded at the Y Theatre in Leicester using original scripts from 1951. It was released on CD by BBC Audio in July 2014, along with a number of bonus features. It is the only recording of this final Dick Barton serial to be made available by the BBC on CD. The original 1951 recording was never archived. It was billed as 'Dick Barton - Special Agent: LIVE' and starred Tim Bentinck in the lead. The following Dick Barton dramas are now available to buy on CD (or as downloads) via BBC Audio: 1 STORY 1: 'Dick Barton and the Secret Weapon' (AKA 'Dick Barton: Special Agent) written by Edward J.

Since 1839 he became the head of a secret committee started to organise yet another uprising against the partitioning powers, which was nicknamed the Libelt Committee - Komitet Libelt). For taking part in the Greater Poland Uprising (1846) He was sentenced by the Prussian authorities to 20 years of imprisonment in a fortress for taking part in the Greater Poland Uprising (1846). However, he was amnestied in 1848 and returned to Posen (Poznań), where he took part in the Greater Poland Uprising (1848) and joined various organisations supporting the independence of Poland (Polish National Committee and Revolutionary Committee). During the Spring of Nations he was elected as one of the members of the Frankfurt Parliament; he also took part in the Slavic Congress in Prague in June 1848. In 1849 he was elected a member of the Prussian parliament and became the director of the liberal Dziennik Polski (Polish Daily). The following year Libelt began to establish various scientific and social organisations in Greater Poland, including the Society of Friends of the Sciences in Posen (Poznań), which became a de facto university. Between 1868 and 1875 he headed the Society and gave lectures in æsthetics. In 1873, he was elected to the Prussian Lower House. In his philosophical works, Libelt described the so-called Polish messianism, or a belief that the history of the world would be redeemed by the Polish people, who gained moral excellence because of the suffering of their fatherland. He believed in existence of a super-rational cognitive power, visible through art. He is known internationally mainly because of the word intelligentsia popularized by him in one of his books (Filozofia i krytyka - Philosophy and Critics). ==Writings== * Filozofia i krytyka, Hegelian in tendency (1845–50) * Estetyka (1851) * Umnictevo, a system of ethics (1857) * Dziela (1875) * Zbior pism pomniejszych, political papers (1849–51) * Dziewica Orléanska (1847) * Humor i pravada, sketches (1852) == See also == * Poznań Society of Friends of Learning * History of philosophy in Poland * List of Poles == References == * Witold Jakóbczyk, Przetrwać na Wartą 1815-1914, Dzieje narodu i państwa polskiego, vol.

Filmmakers have picked up on this wealth of material, with both adaptations of literary classics and new stories. ==Films== Donna Reed, Jimmy Stewart and Karolyn Grimes in the American film It's a Wonderful Life Many Christmas stories have been adapted to movies and TV specials, and have been broadcast and repeated many times on TV. Since the popularization of home video in the 1980s, their many editions are sold and re-sold every year during the holiday shopping season. Notable examples are the many versions of the ballet The Nutcracker, the film It's a Wonderful Life, and the similarly themed versions of Dickens' A Christmas Carol, in which the elderly miser Ebenezer Scrooge is visited by ghosts and learns the errors of his ways. By contrast, the hero of the former, George Bailey, is a businessman who sacrificed his dreams to help his community. On Christmas Eve, a guardian angel finds him in despair and prevents him from committing suicide, by supernaturally showing him how much he meant to the world around him. A few films based on fictionalized versions of true stories have become Christmas specials themselves. The story behind the Christmas carol \\"Silent Night\\" and the story of \\"Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus\\" are two examples. Sometimes, family films boasting special effects and/or uplifting messages, but having no real relation to Christmas, are telecast during the season as part of the holiday programming. The Wizard of Oz, for instance, was always telecast during the Christmas season between 1959 and 1962. Other films often seen around the Christmas period are Annie, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Mary Poppins, Oliver!, The Sound of Music, Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, and The Lord of the Rings trilogy, as well as several animated Disney, DreamWorks, and Pixar movies. Others have some scenes during the Christmas season, such as the Harry Potter films, which are frequently included in the viewing rotation. The action film Die Hard is seen by some as a Christmas film, as it takes place on the holiday, and is often viewed during the season, although whether or not Die Hard should be considered a Christmas film has been debated due to its story not being about the holiday itself. In the United Kingdom, during the 2000s ITV usually showed a James Bond and/or a Harry Potter film(s) during the Christmas Holidays whilst the BBC showed the Chronicles of Narnia and/or High School Musical films. And for many years Channel 5 have shown American/Canadian made-for-TV Christmas films during the weeks before Christmas. In North America, the holiday movie season often includes release of studios' most prestigious pictures, in an effort both to capture holiday crowds and to position themselves for Oscar consideration. Next to summer, this is the second-most lucrative season for the industry. In fact, a few films each year open on the actual Christmas Day holiday. Christmas movies generally open no later than Thanksgiving, as their themes are not so popular once the season is over. Likewise, the home video release of these films is typically delayed until the beginning of the next year's Christmas season. American Christmas-themed films are also broadcast on the Hallmark Channel and its companion channel Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, which during the holiday season generally feature new films along with reruns of favorites from prior years. Actresses Candace Cameron Bure, Lacey Chabert, and Danica McKellar, along with actor Niall Matter, are frequently featured in lead or major roles. The films themselves generally feature a similar theme of a person who has \\"lost the Christmas spirit\\" and through \\"Christmas magic\\" regains it (commonly by a romantic encounter; frequently one of the two in the romance is a single parent or has lost someone special around a prior Christmas season). Another theme plays on the \\"big city-small town\\" dynamic, whereby a lead character has either left a small hometown for the big city (and has had to return), or a big city person has to go to a small town, in either case deciding that the small town is where they should remain. The settings are usually in the northern United States, or in a mountain area (such as Colorado), where snow (and the ensuing \\"White Christmas\\") are used as a backdrop for the film (though the films themselves are often filmed in British Columbia due to favorable film tax benefits). As of Christmas 2019 The Grinch is the highest grossing Christmas film of all time. ==Television specials and episodes== Before 1962, when Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol premiered, true Christmas specials made for TV were either adaptations of stories such as A Christmas Carol (with live actors), or the Nativity Story, or episodes of variety shows highlighting Christmas music. They were often hosted by such celebrities as Perry Como, Jane Wyatt, or Florence Henderson. (A notable exception was The Spirit of Christmas in 1950, which, although featuring an appearance by Alexander Scourby, who also narrated, starred the Mabel Beaton Marionettes.) This all changed once variety shows began dying out in the late 1980s and Rankin-Bass began producing more and more Christmas specials. One notable television special usually seen at Christmas was Amahl and the Night Visitors, the first opera written especially for television. Composed by Gian-Carlo Menotti with a libretto in English by the composer, the opera told of a disabled beggar boy living with his (presumably) widowed mother in the Holy Land. They are visited by the Three Wise Men who are on their way to see the Christ Child, and when Amahl offers his crutch as a gift, he is miraculously cured. Commissioned by NBC, the opera was telecast annually in the U.S. from 1951 to 1966. In 1978, it returned to television, but this new production did not have the spectacular success that previous ones did. ===United Kingdom=== TV programmes which have had special Christmas episodes in the United Kingdom include Top of the Pops (from 1960s-2006), Morecambe and Wise (1970s), The Two Ronnies (1980s), Stars in Their Eyes, Only Fools and Horses (both 1990s), and more recently, Doctor Who, Top Gear (both 2000s) and Downton Abbey (2010s). The animated tale The Snowman has been screened for many years during the Christmas period (usually Christmas Eve or Christmas Day), and a new story, Father Christmas, by the same artist and company, is usually broadcast around the same time. Adaptations of novels from Charles Dickens are also common around Christmas time. Along with A Christmas Carol (the most popular due to its Christmas season setting, and the message portrayed), such as Bleak House (2005), Oliver Twist (2007) and Great Expectations (2011), among others. These adaptations usually featured all-star casts. Christmas Day begins at 12 at night with the showing of Midnight Mass on the BBC. In addition, HM Queen Elizabeth II annually broadcasts a 10-minute speech on Christmas Day at 3 p.m., charting her views of the past year and giving her own reflections and advice. Many long-running British soap operas have Christmas specials, usually involving a dramatic storyline developed over several weeks which culminates at Christmas. Often these stories are tragic, involving a death, divorce, a dramatic revelation or similar event. Most Christmas specials in the UK are specially commissioned separately to a production season, and many are extended from the usual episode length. For example, the 2007 Doctor Who Christmas special was 71 minutes as opposed to the standard 45 minutes, was broadcast six months after the third series had finished and four months before the fourth series started. UK Christmas specials may or may not feature the holiday itself as part of the narrative. While the season receives almost universal acknowledgement on British TV, some channels and programmes have tried \\"alternative\\" or \\"anti-Christmas\\" ideas. One example is Channel 4 which has run an Alternative Christmas message since 1993. In 2009, two movie channels renamed themselves for the season; Sky Movies Screen 2 became Sky Movies Christmas Channel and Movies 24 became Christmas 24. From 2010, changes to Sky Movies line-up meant that Sky Movies Showcase was used for Sky Movies Christmas Channel. On 16 November 2012, two music channels renamed themselves; Bliss became Blissmas and Greatest Hits TV was rebranded as Christmas Hits TV. ===United States=== In the United States, many television series (particularly those of a family-oriented nature) produce a Christmas episode, although seldom outside of a season's production block. Stand-alone Christmas specials are also popular, from newly created animated shorts and movies to repeats of those that were popular in previous years, such as Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and A Charlie Brown Christmas. Some local affiliates provide the Yule Log, a block of time either on Christmas morning or both during the evening hours of Christmas Eve and Christmas morning showing footage of a fireplace, coupled with popular Christmas music. Some local affiliates that provide the Yule Log simulcast Christmas music from a radio station playing it. Every Christmas Day, ABC airs a Christmas parade at Walt Disney World Resort and along with its sister cable network, ESPN, NBA games featuring some of the league's best teams and players, broadcasting a doubleheader, while NBC airs an ice skating special. Many US sitcoms or dramas like to include Christmas specials in their series. NBA games airing on network television on Christmas Day are notable because it is the day the first NBA games air on network television each season. Christmas specials based on classical music have also been well received. Among them, in addition to the previously mentioned Amahl and the Night Visitors, have been the many telecasts of the ballet The Nutcracker, and concert specials featuring musicians such as the Boston Pops, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, the Cincinnati Pops, and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus. ==Radio== Many radio stations begin to add Christmas music to their rotation in late November, and often switch to all-Christmas programming for December 25. Some do for part of or all of December 24 as well. A few stations switch to all-Christmas music for the entire season (some beginning as early as mid-November); in Detroit, 100.3 WNIC in 2005 started Christmas music day and night on midnight of October 31 because programmers believed that at least some listeners who are attracted by the Christmas music will remain loyal listeners when the station reverts to its standard format on Boxing Day. Radio stations also broadcast traditional Western art music, such as the \\"Hallelujah\\" chorus from Handel's Messiah. Among other pieces inspired by Christmas are Tchaikovsky's ballet The Nutcracker and the popular suite drawn from it, and Johann Sebastian Bach's \\"Christmas Oratorio\\" (BWV 248). Some radio stations play Christmas music commercial-free the entire day on Christmas Day, with only interruptions for Christmas messages from station personnel and personnel from the station's parent company. Others, like 96.5 KOIT in San Francisco do on both part of or all of Christmas Eve and the entire day Christmas Day. Frequently, the first song played on an \\"all- Christmas\\" station is the popular tune It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas. The UK music industry features the battle of the bands and artists to make it to the Christmas No. 1 spot, recognised on the first Sunday before, or on, Christmas Day. Many of these songs are festive, while others are novelty songs that remain but briefly at the top of the chart. Gospel singer Cliff Richard is a fixture of Christmas charts, appearing nearly every year, and subsequently being mocked for doing so. In more recent years the Christmas chart has been dominated by the winner of The X Factor and various social media backed records aimed to hijack the charts. As with television, British radio programmes also schedule Christmas specials. These mainly include comedy shows such as I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue and The Now Show. The Music Choice channels have over the past few years have begun playing Christmas music as early as the beginning of November, instead of waiting till after Thanksgiving. ==Literature== ==References== Category:Bible in popular culture medium nl:Lijst van kerstfilms ","title":"Christmas by medium"},{"id":"1276997","text":"The University of Art and Design Linz (common short form University of Arts Linz) is one of four universities in Linz, Upper Austria. 355x355px The University of Art and Design Linz (Kunstuniversität Linz) has its institutional and programmatic roots in the “Kunstschule” (Art School) of the City of Linz, which was founded in 1947, assigned academy status in 1973 and finally made a fully-fledged university in 1998. The institution was conceived as an explicit statement to signify dissociation from the previous art policy of the National Socialist era. This is in particular exemplified by its emphasis on the fundamental values of freedom of art and research, its commitment to modernism and contemporary art and the positioning of the University at the interface of free-artistic and applied-economically oriented design. In the past as in the present, these values form the basis of the fundamental essence and identity of the Kunstuniversität Linz. Since 1 January 2004, the university is constituted as a “corporation under public law” according to the new Universities Organisation Act of 2002 and hence enjoys far-reaching autonomy. In the context of the regional and international frame conditions within which Kunstuniversität Linz operates, three main orientations were evolved over the past few years. Going beyond specialist competencies per se, they are of particular importance for artistic development, research and teaching and moreover reflect the unique profile of the university. ==History== ===1947=== The University of Art and Design Linz is the successor to the Art School (“Kunstschule”) of the City of Linz, established in 1947. Originally, the School is assigned premises in the western bridgehead building at Hauptplatz 8. In later years, branch facilities are set up in Bischofstraße and Prunerstraße. The institution operates two master schools of painting, headed by Herbert Dimmel and Karl Hauk, who also serves as director of the Art School until 1949, as well as one master school of graphic art, headed by Alfons Ortner. In 1948 and 1951, respectively, a master school of sculpture, headed by Walter Ritter, and a master school of typography and applied graphic design, headed by Friedrich Neugebauer, follow suit. ===1959/60=== Alfons Ortner is appointed director. His goal is to bring the Art School closer to becoming an academy of applied art. ===1961/62=== University of Art and Design Linz In 1961, the Art School of the City of Linz is awarded full public-law status by the Federal Ministry of Education; the statute of the school and the curricular, scholastic and examination regulations are revised; the “master schools” are now called “master classes”. The following new master classes are introduced: Advertising Art, head: Erich Buchegger Basic Course, head: Roxane Cuvay ===1973=== The Federal Act of 9 May 1973, Federal Gazette No. 251/1973, transforms the institution into the “Academy of Art and Industrial Design in Linz” (Hochschule für künstlerische und industrielle Gestaltung in Linz). Alfons Ortner is voted founding rector. At this time, the institution offered the following master classes: *Painting and Graphic Art, Alfons Ortner *Advertising Art, Erich Buchegger *Typography and Book Design, Friedrich Neugebauer *Interior Design, Friedrich Goffitzer *Industrial Design, Horst C. H. Meru *Ceramics, Günter Praschak *Three- dimensional Design – Metal, Helmuth Gsöllpointner *Three-dimensional Design – Sculpture, Erwin Reiter *Basic Course, Roxane Cuvay (interim) and the following chairs: *Environment Design, Günther Feuerstein *Art Education, Hannes Haybäck ===1975 and 1976=== Endowment of a chair for handicraft education and appointment of Helmut Huber as its head and endowment of a chair for textile design and appointment of Fritz Riedl as its head. ===1977 to 1980=== In autumn 1977, the \\"Fund of the Academy of Design of Linz” organises the exhibition “Forum Metall Linz” (concept developers, organisers and artistic directors: Helmuth Gsöllpointner and Peter Baum). In summer 1980, the Fund co-operates with the New Gallery of the City of Linz and others in organising the exhibition “Forum Design – Design formt den Alltag” (concept by Helmuth Gsöllpointner, Angela Hareiter, Laurids Ortner and Peter Baum). ===1984 to 1990=== The construction of a new building for the institution is initiated and the former Ringbrot factory in Urfahr, Sonnensteinstraße/Reindlstraße is converted to university use. The chair for handicraft education and the master classes for sculpture, visual design and ceramics move into the converted building in 1986. In 1990, the master classes for painting and graphic art, visual media design, metal, textile design, the chair for environment design, the central media workshop, the printing shop, the silkscreen workshop, the chapter of the Austrian National Union of Students and parts of the administration move into the new building in Urfahr. ===1995 to 1997=== The former pipe tobacco factory (Peter Behrens Building) on Untere Donaulände (built between 1929 and 1935 by Peter Behrens and Alexander Popp) is rented. The master classes for sculpture and experimental visual design move from Urfahr to the Peter Behrens Building. ===1998 to 2000=== On 1 October 1998, the new Federal Universities of the Arts Organisation Act (KUOG) enters into force. As per this day, the institution becomes the \\"University of Art and Design Linz\\". As per 27 September 2000, all bodies of Kunstuniversität Linz are elected according to the provisions of KUOG 1998, and as per 28 September 2000, the institution is wholly subject to KUOG 1998. On 5 April 2000, Reinhard Kannonier is elected the first rector under the provisions of KUOG 1998. ===2002 to 2003=== Foundation of the Forum – Friends and Alumni of Kunstuniversität Linz; setting-up of the international research laboratory Design-Organisation-Media (DOM); (head: Michael Shamiyeh). Reinhard Kannonier is re-elected rector for another four-year term of office. Acting upon a proposal by Kannonier, the University Council chooses three Vice-Rectors. The size of the Senate of Kunstuniversität Linz is set at 12 members by the founding assembly. ===2004=== Since 1 January 2004, the university has been operating as a “corporation under public law” according to the new Universities Organisation Act of 2002 and hence is largely autonomous. What has remained a constant for the many decades since its inception are several core competencies of Kunstuniversität Linz: free artistic and applied design, interdisciplinarity, teaching at a very high level. In recent years, the profile of the university has been largely determined by the three focuses on intermediality, spatial strategies and artistic-scientific research. ==Directors/Rectors== *Directors of Kunstschule der Stadt Linz (Art School of the City of Linz) *Karl Hauk – Director from 1947 to 1949 *Herbert Dimmel – Director from 1949 to 1959 *Alfons Ortner – Director as of 1959 ==Rectors== *Alfons Ortner, Founding rector of the Academy of Art and Industrial Design in Linz, 1973 to September 1977 *Helmuth Gsöllpointner, rector in the academic years 1977/78 to 1980/81 *Hannes Haybäck, rector in the academic years 1981/82 to 1984/85 and 1985/86 to 1988/89 *Friedrich Goffitzer, rector in the academic years 1989/90 to September 1991 *Wolfgang Stifter, rector in the academic years 1991/92 to 1995/96 and 1996/97 to 1999/2000 *Reinhard Kannonier, rector since October 2000, elected until September 2011, nominated again until 2019 Category:Art schools in Austria ","title":"University of Art and Design Linz"},{"id":"1276999","text":"Laelaps hilaris Koch by Oudemans.

Anthonie (Antoon) Cornelis Oudemans Jzn (November 12, 1858 – January 14, 1943) was a Dutch zoologist.This minibiography is based on: Eindhoven G. L. van (1943). \\"In memoriam Dr. A. C. Oudemans\\". Tijdschrift voor Entomologie 86: 1–56. Although he was a specialist in acarology, the study of the ticks and mites, he was often best known for his books on sea monsters and the dodo. Born in Batavia, Dutch East Indies, he was the son of the noted Dutch astronomer Jean Abraham Chrétien Oudemans and the grandson of the Dutch educator, poet and philologist Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans Sr., after whom he was named. He often used the patronymic \\"Jzn\\" (for Jeanzoon) in his publications. A cousin was the entomologist J.T. Oudemans. He was educated at Arnhem and went to the University of Utrecht. He wrote his dissertation on ribbon worms,Bijdrage tot de kennis van het bloedvaatstelsel en de nephridia der Nemertinen. Proefschrift ter verkrijging van den graad van Doctor in de Planten Dierkunde aan de Rijks-Universiteit te Utrecht. Utrecht, P. W. van de Weijer, p. 1–114, Pl. I–III, f. 1–75. and in 1885 was appointed director of the Royal Zoological Gardens at The Hague. Oudemans worked on the acari and comprehensively reviewed all literature until 1850 in a series of articles titled Kritisch historisch Overzicht der Acarologie. He described numerous species not only of acari and insects several insect but even a primate species, the black crested mangabey. 1892 saw the publication of Oudeman's The Great Sea Serpent, a study of the many sea serpent reports from the world's oceans. Oudemans concluded that such creatures might be a previously unknown large seal, which he dubbed Megophias megophias. Reception of the volume has been described as respectful but \\"cold\\". Bernard Heuvelmans later suggested that The Great Sea Serpent was the root of cryptozoology. In 1917 he published Dodo-studiën: naar aanleiding van de vondst van een gevelsteen met dodo-beeld van 1561 te Vere, an article on extinct dodo research. In 1895, Oudemans left The Hague to teach biology in the Frisian city of Sneek. He published several scientific articles in later years. He had married Helena Johanna van de Velde in 1887, but became a widower, and remarried to Aletta Amelia Louise Pilgrim in 1919. In 1942 he donated the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie his important collection of mites (Acari). This collection numbers 5981 slides (1316 species). After his death, the accompanying drawings were bequeathed to the museum as well.

In a multiprocessor system, there is one idle thread associated with each CPU core. For a system with hyperthreading enabled, there is an idle thread for each logical processor. The primary purpose of the idle process and its threads is to eliminate what would otherwise be a special case in the scheduler. Without the idle threads, there could be cases when no threads were runnable (or \\"Ready\\" in terms of Windows scheduling states). Since the idle threads are always in a Ready state (if not already Running), this can never happen. Thus whenever the scheduler is called due to the current thread leaving its CPU, another thread can always be found to run on that CPU, even if it is only the CPU's idle thread. The CPU time attributed to the idle process is therefore indicative of the amount of CPU time that is not needed or wanted by any other threads in the system. The scheduler treats the idle threads as special cases in terms of thread scheduling priority. The idle threads are scheduled as if they each had a priority lower than can be set for any ordinary thread. Because of the idle process's function, its CPU time measurement (visible through, for example, Windows Task Manager) may make it appear to users that the idle process is monopolizing the CPU. However, the idle process does not use up computer resources (even when stated to be running at a high percent). Its CPU time \\"usage\\" is a measure of how much CPU time is not being used by other threads. In Windows 2000 and later the threads in the System Idle Process are also used to implement CPU power saving. The exact power saving scheme depends on the operating system version and on the hardware and firmware capabilities of the system in question. For instance, on x86 processors under Windows 2000, the idle thread will run a loop of halt instructions, which causes the CPU to turn off many internal components until an interrupt request arrives. Later versions of Windows implement more complex CPU power saving methods. On these systems the idle thread will call routines in the Hardware Abstraction Layer to reduce CPU clock speed or to implement other power-saving mechanisms. There are more detailed sources of such information available through Windows' performance monitoring system (accessible with the perfmon program), which includes more finely grained categorization of CPU usage. A limited subset of the CPU time categorization is also accessible through the Task Manager, which can display CPU usage by CPU, and categorized by time spent in user vs. kernel code. == See also == * List of Microsoft Windows components * Idle (CPU) * Microsoft Windows * HLT (x86 instruction) * Process Explorer == References == * Category:Windows NT architecture ","title":"System Idle Process"},{"id":"1277015","text":"The steering law in human–computer interaction and ergonomics is a predictive model of human movement that describes the time required to navigate, or steer, through a 2-dimensional tunnel. The tunnel can be thought of as a path or trajectory on a plane that has an associated thickness or width, where the width can vary along the tunnel. The goal of a steering task is to navigate from one end of the tunnel to the other as quickly as possible, without touching the boundaries of the tunnel. A real-world example that approximates this task is driving a car down a road that may have twists and turns, where the car must navigate the road as quickly as possible without touching the sides of the road. The steering law predicts both the instantaneous speed at which we may navigate the tunnel, and the total time required to navigate the entire tunnel. The steering law has been independently discovered and studied three times (Rashevsky, 1959; Drury, 1971; Accot and Zhai, 1997). Its most recent discovery has been within the human–computer interaction community, which has resulted in the most general mathematical formulation of the law. ==The steering law in human–computer interaction== Within human–computer interaction, the law was rediscovered by Johnny Accot and Shumin Zhai, who mathematically derived it in a novel way from Fitts's law using integral calculus, experimentally verified it for a class of tasks, and developed the most general mathematical statement of it. Some researchers within this community have sometimes referred to the law as the Accot–Zhai steering law or Accot's law (Accot is pronounced ah-cot in English and ah-koh in French). In this context, the steering law is a predictive model of human movement, concerning the speed and total time with which a user may steer a pointing device (such as a mouse or stylus) through a 2D tunnel presented on a screen (i.e. with a bird's eye view of the tunnel), where the user must travel from one end of the path to the other as quickly as possible, while staying within the confines of the path. One potential practical application of this law is in modelling a user's performance in navigating a hierarchical cascading menu. Many researchers in human–computer interaction, including Accot himself, find it surprising or even amazing that the steering law model predicts performance as well as it does, given the almost purely mathematical way in which it was derived. Some consider this a testament to the robustness of Fitts's law. In its general form, the steering law can be expressed as :T=a + b \\\\int_{C} \\\\frac{ds}{W(s)} where T is the average time to navigate through the path, C is the path parameterized by s, W(s) is the width of the path at s, and a and b are experimentally fitted constants. In general, the path may have a complicated curvilinear shape (such as a spiral) with variable thickness W(s). Simpler paths allow for mathematical simplifications of the general form of the law. For example, if the path is a straight tunnel of constant width W, the equation reduces to :T=a + b \\\\frac{A}{W} where A is the length of the path. We see, especially in this simplified form, a speed–accuracy tradeoff, somewhat similar to that in Fitts's law. We can also differentiate both sides of the integral equation with respect to s to obtain the local, or instantaneous, form of the law: :\\\\frac{ds}{dT} = \\\\frac{W(s)}{b} which says that the instantaneous speed of the user is proportional to the width of the tunnel. This makes intuitive sense if we consider the analogous task of driving a car down a road: the wider the road, the faster we can drive and still stay on the road, even if there are curves in the road. ==Derivation of the model from Fitts's law== This derivation is only meant as a high level sketch. It lacks the illustrations of, and may differ in detail from, the derivation given by Accot and Zhai (1997). Assume that the time required for goal passing (i.e. passing a pointer through a goal at distance A and of width W, oriented perpendicular to the axis of motion) can be modeled with this form of Fitts's law: :T_\\\\text{goal} = b \\\\log_2 \\\\left( \\\\frac{A}{W} + 1 \\\\right) Then, a straight tunnel of length A and constant width W can be approximated as a sequence of N evenly spaced goals, each separated from its neighbours by a distance of A/N. We can let N grow arbitrarily large, making the distance between successive goals become infinitesimal. The total time to navigative through all the goals, and thus through the tunnel, is { - Tstraight tunnel = \\\\lim_{N \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\sum_{i=1}^N b \\\\log_2 \\\\left( \\\\frac{A/N}{W} + 1 \\\\right) -  = \\\\lim_{N \\\\to \\\\infty} N b \\\\log_2 \\\\left( \\\\frac{A}{N W} + 1 \\\\right) -  = b \\\\lim_{N \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\log_2 \\\\left( \\\\frac{A}{N W} + 1 \\\\right)}{1/N} (applying L'Hôpital's rule ...) -  = b \\\\lim_{N \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{\\\\left( \\\\frac{A}{N W} + 1 \\\\right)}\\\\frac{A}{W}(-1/N^2)}{-1/N^2} -  = b \\\\frac{A}{W} \\\\lim_{N \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\left( \\\\frac{A}{N W} + 1 \\\\right)} -  = b \\\\frac{A}{W} } Next, consider a curved tunnel of total length A, parameterized by s varying from 0 to A. Let W(s) be the variable width of the tunnel. The tunnel can be approximated as a sequence of N straight tunnels, numbered 1 through N, each located at si where i = 1 to N, and each of length si+1 − si and of width W(si). We can let N grow arbitrarily large, making the length of successive straight tunnels become infinitesimal. The total time to navigative through the curved tunnel is { - Tcurved tunnel = \\\\lim_{N \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\sum_{i=1}^N b \\\\frac{s_{i+1} - s_i}{W(s_i)} -  = b \\\\int_0^A \\\\frac{ds}{W(s)} (... by the definition of the definite integral) } yielding the general form of the steering law. ==Modeling steering in layers == Steering law has been extended to predict movement time for steering in layers of thickness t (Kattinakere et al., 2007). The relation is given by : T = a+b\\\\sqrt{(A/W)^2+(A/t)^2}. ==See also== * Crossing-based interface -- any graphical user interface that uses goal crossing tasks as the basic interaction paradigm ==References== * * Johnny Accot and Shumin Zhai (1997).

It was considered, from a relational international contract viewpoint, as a rational compromise solution between two ideal-type extremes of international monetary regimes: the perfectly flexible and the perfectly fixed exchange rates. The agreement was signed by France, West Germany, Japan, Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom. The Italian government was invited to sign the agreement but declined. == Background == The Plaza Accord is recognized as the precursor to the Louvre Accord and this deal was struck to depreciate the US dollar for the purpose of exchange rate realignment with the Japanese yen and German Deutsche Mark, which was agreed upon during the G7 Minister of Finance meeting held in New York in 1985. The United States had a trade deficit while Japan and a few European countries were experiencing a trade surplus along with negative GDP growth. The then U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker attempted to address the imbalance by encouraging its trade partners to stimulate their economies so they can purchase more from it. He maintained that if these partners did not grow, he would allow the dollar's continued depreciation. After the Plaza Accord, the dollar depreciated, reaching an exchange rate of ¥150 per US$1 in 1987. By this time, the nominal dollar exchange rate against other currencies had fallen more than 25%. The ministers of the G7 nations gathered at the Louvre in Paris to minimize this decline and stabilize it around the prevailing levels. The Louvre Accord may have helped prevent a recession because it stopped the US dollar from decreasing further in relation to other currencies. == Provisions == France agreed to reduce its budget deficits by 1% of GDP and cut taxes by the same amount for corporations and individuals. Japan would reduce its trade surplus and cut interest rates. The United Kingdom would reduce public expenditures and reduce taxes. Germany, the real object of this agreement because of its leading economic position in Europe, would reduce public spending, cut taxes for individuals and corporations, and keep interest rates low. The United States would reduce its fiscal 1988 deficit to 2.3% of GDP from an estimated 3.9% in 1987, reduce government spending by 1% in 1988 and keep interest rates low. == Impact == The US dollar continued to weaken in 1987 against the Deutsche mark and other major currencies, reaching a low of 1.57 marks per dollar and 121 yen per dollar in early 1988. The dollar then strengthened over the next 18 months, reaching over 2.04 marks per dollar and 160 yen per dollar, in tandem with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates aggressively, from 6.50% to 9.75%. ==References== Category:Financial history of the United States Category:Group of Eight Category:Foreign exchange market Category:History of international trade Category:Monetary policy Category:1987 in France ","title":"Louvre Accord"},{"id":"1277033","text":"==Events== === March events === * 9 March – The Wilmington and Raleigh Railroad is completed from Wilmington to Weldon, North Carolina.

At the time of his death The New York Times stated that McCracken was \\"the most successful dramatic tenor yet produced by the United States and a pillar of the Metropolitan Opera during the 1960s and 1970s.\\" ==Biography== Born in Gary, Indiana, McCracken's earliest musical experiences were singing in his church choir in childhood. In the US Navy during World War II, he sang in the Blue Jacket Choir. He studied music at Columbia University, with Elsa Seyfert in Konstanz, Germany, and then with Joyce McLean in New York City until his death. McCracken made his professional opera debut in 1952 with the Central City Opera in Colorado as Rodolfo in Puccini's La bohème. He sang minor roles at the Metropolitan Opera from 1953 to 1957, while still a student. In 1957, he moved to Europe and made his debut at the Vienna State Opera. He had great success with the Zürich Opera. The role of Otello in Verdi's opera, Otello, was one of his signature roles. Starting in 1963, he became one of the Met's principal dramatic tenors. He replaced an injured Mario del Monaco at The Royal Opera House in London on very short notice on 11 April 1964, which won critical acclaim, including by Philip Hope-Wallace of The Guardian who described it as: \\"[T]he audience know at once that this was the voice for the part: large, inclined to perhaps splay a little, but sonorous, the emanation of the true Otello...\\"Hope-Wallace 1981, p. 67 James McCracken also starred in Otello and Carmen in 1972; in Aida directed by John Dexter in 1976; in Le prophete in 1977; and in Tannhaeuser in 1978, his only leading Wagnerian role. Feeling slighted about being passed over for the September 1978 telecast of Otello which starred Jon Vickers, McCracken resigned from the Metropolitan Opera, only to return to a rousing ovation in October 1983 for the Centennial Gala, during which he performed Otello's Act 3 soliloquy, \\"Dio! mi potevi scagliar\\". The following season, he took part in a live telecast of Verdi's Aida on January 5, 1985, which was historic in that it was Leontyne Price's farewell to the operatic stage. McCracken's voice was huge, with a distinctive and somewhat thick texture. Occasionally he was criticized for his less-than-effortless singing technique. But virtually all critics acknowledged his acting skill, as well as the overwhelming power of his sound and his clarion high notes. He was married to mezzo-soprano Sandra Warfield, with whom he performed Saint-Saëns' Samson and Delilah at the Met. He was a member of the Metropolitan Opera's final U.S. tour, where he sang the role of Canio in Pagliacci. ==Recordings== McCracken made a number of complete opera recordings, including \\"Le prophète\\" (with Marilyn Horne and Renata Scotto, (Col/CBS), 1976), \\"Carmen\\" (conducted by Leonard Bernstein, (DG), 1972), \\"Fidelio\\" (with Birgit Nilsson, (Decca/London), 1964), \\"Otello\\" (with Dame Gwyneth Jones, (EMI/Angel), 1968) and \\"Pagliacci\\", on which side 4 of the original LP version was a recital of opera arias, (Decca/London), (1967), as well as Schoenberg's Gurre-Lieder (with Jessye Norman, Tatiana Troyanos and David Arnold, (Phi), 1979), and a program of Irish and Scottish songs with piano (EMI/Angel), 1977. Additionally, he sang the part of Waldemaar in Gurre- Lieder when it opened the Edinburgh International Festival in 1961.

Pakistan has been called a \\"global center for political Islam\\". Islam in Pakistan existed in communities along the Arab coastal trade routes in Sindh as soon as the religion originated and had gained early acceptance in the Arabian Peninsula. The connection between the Sind and Islam was established by the initial Muslim missions during the Rashidun Caliphate. Al- Hakim ibn Jabalah al-Abdi, who attacked Makran in the year 649 AD, was an early partisan of Ali ibn Abu Talib. During the caliphate of Ali, many Hindus of Sindh had came under influence of Islam and some even participated in the Battle of Camel and died fighting for Ali. Under the Umayyads (661 - 750 AD), many Shias sought asylum in the region of Sindh, to live in relative peace in the remote area. Ziyad Hindi is one of those refugees. In 712 CE, a young Arab general Muhammad bin Qasim conquered most of the Indus region for the Umayyad empire, to be made the \\"As-Sindh\\" province with its capital at Al-Mansurah. By the end of the 10th century CE, the region was ruled by several Hindu Shahi kings who would be subdued by the Ghaznavids. About 97% of Pakistanis are Muslims. Pakistan has the second largest number of Muslims in the world after Indonesia.see: Islam by country The majority are Sunni (90%) while Shias make up between 5-7%. Smaller minority Muslim populations in Pakistan include Quranists, nondenominational Muslims. There are also two Mahdi'ist based creeds practiced in Pakistan, namely Mahdavia and Ahmadis, the latter of whom is considered by the constitution of Pakistan to be non-Muslims are constitute 1% of Muslims.The 1998 Pakistani census states that there are 291,000 (0.22%) Ahmadis in Pakistan. However, the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community has boycotted the census since 1974 which renders official Pakistani figures to be inaccurate. Independent groups have estimated the Pakistani Ahmadiyya population to be somewhere between 2 million and 3 million Ahmadis. However, the 2 million figure is the most quoted figure and is approximately 1% of the country.

Ethnic and national groups around the world. Greenwood Press. Westport 2002, page 52 * ==Islam before the creation of Pakistan== The Arab conqueror Muhammad bin Qasim conquered Sindh in 711 CE. The Pakistan government's official chronology claims this as the time when the foundation of Pakistan was laid but the concept of Pakistan came in 1940. The Early Medieval period (642–1219 CE) witnessed the spread of Islam in the region. During this period, Sufi missionaries played a pivotal role in converting a majority of the regional Buddhist and Hindu population to Islam. These developments set the stage for the rule of several successive Muslim empires in the region, including the Ghaznavid Empire (975–1187 CE), the Ghorid Kingdom, and the Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526 CE). The Lodi dynasty, the last of the Delhi Sultanate, was replaced by the Mughal Empire (1526–1857 CE). ==Islam in newly created Pakistan== ===Nature of state=== The Muslim League leadership, ulama (Islamic clergy) and Jinnah had articulated their vision of Pakistan in terms of an Islamic state. Muhammad Ali Jinnah had developed a close association with the ulama. When Jinnah died, Islamic scholar Maulana Shabbir Ahmad Usmani described Jinnah as the greatest Muslim after the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb and also compared Jinnah's death to the Prophet's passing. Usmani asked Pakistanis to remember Jinnah's message of Unity, Faith and Discipline and work to fulfil his dream: > to create a solid bloc of all Muslim states from Karachi to Ankara, from > Pakistan to Morocco. He [Jinnah] wanted to see the Muslims of the world > united under the banner of Islam as an effective check against the > aggressive designs of their enemies. The first formal step taken to transform Pakistan into an ideological Islamic state was in March 1949 when the country's first Prime Minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, introduced the Objectives Resolution in the Constituent Assembly. The Objectives Resolution declared that sovereignty over the entire universe belongs to God Almighty. The president of the Muslim League, Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman, announced that Pakistan would bring together all Muslim countries into Islamistan-a pan-Islamic entity. Khaliq believed that Pakistan was only a Muslim state and was not yet an Islamic state, but that it could certainly become an Islamic state after bringing all believers of Islam into a single political unit. Keith Callard, one of the earliest scholars on Pakistani politics, observed that Pakistanis believed in the essential unity of purpose and outlook in the Muslim world: > Pakistan was founded to advance the cause of Muslims. Other Muslims might > have been expected to be sympathetic, even enthusiastic. But this assumed > that other Muslim states would take the same view of the relation between > religion and nationality. However, Pakistan's pan-Islamist sentiments were not shared by other Muslim governments at the time. Nationalism in other parts of the Muslim world was based on ethnicity, language and culture. Although Muslim governments were unsympathetic with Pakistan's pan-Islamic aspirations, Islamists from all over the world were drawn to Pakistan. Figures such as the Grand Mufti of Palestine, Al-Haj Amin al-Husseini, and leaders of Islamist political movements, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, became frequent visitors to the country. After General Zia-ul-Haq took power in a military coup, Hizb ut- Tahrir (an Islamist group calling for the establishment of a Caliphate) expanded its organisational network and activities in Pakistan. Its founder, Taqi al-Din al-Nabhani, would maintain regular correspondence with Abul A’la Maududi, the founder of Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), and he also urged Dr Israr Ahmed to continue his work in Pakistan for the establishment of a global caliphate. Social scientist Nasim Ahmad Jawed conducted a survey in 1969 in pre-divided Pakistan on the type of national identity that was used by educated professional people. He found that over 60% of people in East Pakistan (modern day Bangladesh) professed to have a secular national identity. However, in West Pakistan (current day Pakistan) the same figure professed to have an Islamic and not a secular identity. Furthermore, the same figure in East Pakistan defined their identity in terms of their ethnicity and not Islam. It was the opposite in West Pakistan, where Islam was stated to be more important than ethnicity. After Pakistan's first ever general elections the 1973 Constitution was created by an elected Parliament. The Constitution declared Pakistan an Islamic Republic and Islam as the state religion. It also stated that all laws would have to be brought into accordance with the injunctions of Islam as laid down in the Quran and Sunnah and that no law repugnant to such injunctions could be enacted. The 1973 Constitution also created certain institutions such as the Shariat Court and the Council of Islamic Ideology to channel the interpretation and application of Islam. ===Zia ul Haq's Islamization=== On 5 July 1977, General Zia-ul-Haq led a coup d'état. In the year or two before Zia-ul-Haq's coup, his predecessor, leftist Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, had faced vigorous opposition which was united under the revivalist banner of Nizam-e-Mustafa (\\"Rule of the prophet\\"). According to supporters of the movement, establishing an Islamic state based on sharia law would mean a return to the justice and success of the early days of Islam when the Islamic prophet Muhammad ruled the Muslims. In an effort to stem the tide of street Islamisation, Bhutto had also called for it and banned the drinking and selling of wine by Muslims, nightclubs and horse racing. Many diverse Islamic denominations are practised within Pakistan. \\"Islamisation\\" was the \\"primary\\" policy, or \\"centerpiece\\" of his government. Zia-ul-Haq committed himself to establishing an Islamic state and enforcing sharia law. Zia established separate Shariat judicial courts and court benches to judge legal cases using Islamic doctrine. New criminal offences (of adultery, fornication, and types of blasphemy), and new punishments (of whipping, amputation, and stoning to death), were added to Pakistani law. Interest payments for bank accounts were replaced by \\"profit and loss\\" payments. Zakat charitable donations became a 2.5% annual tax. School textbooks and libraries were overhauled to remove un-Islamic material. Offices, schools, and factories were required to offer praying space. Zia bolstered the influence of the ulama (Islamic clergy) and the Islamic parties, whilst conservative scholars became fixtures on television. 10,000s of activists from the Jamaat-e-Islami party were appointed to government posts to ensure the continuation of his agenda after his passing. Conservative ulama (Islamic scholars) were added to the Council of Islamic Ideology. Separate electorates for Hindus and Christians were established in 1985 even though Christian and Hindu leaders complained that they felt excluded from the county's political process. Zia's state sponsored Islamization increased sectarian divisions in Pakistan between Sunnis and Shias and between Deobandis and Barelvis. A solid majority of Barelvis had supported the creation of Pakistan, and Barelvi ulama had also issued fatwas in support of the Pakistan Movement during the 1946 elections, but ironically Islamic state politics in Pakistan was mostly in favour of Deobandi (and later Ahl-e-Hadith/Salafi) institutions. This was despite the fact that only a few (although influential) Deobandi clerics had supported the Pakistan Movement. Zia-ul-Haq forged a strong alliance between the military and Deobandi institutions. Possible motivations for the Islamization programme included Zia's personal piety (most accounts agree that he came from a religious family), desire to gain political allies, to \\"fulfill Pakistan's raison d'être\\" as a Muslim state, and/or the political need to legitimise what was seen by some Pakistanis as his \\"repressive, un-representative martial law regime\\". Until the government of General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, \\"Islamic activists\\" were frustrated by the lack of \\"teeth\\" to enforce Islamic law in Pakistan's constitution. For example, in the 1956 constitution, the state did not enforce \\"Islamic moral standards\\" but \\"endeavor[ed]\\" to make them compulsory and to \\"prevent\\" prostitution, gambling, consumption of alcoholic liquor, etc. Interest was to be eliminated \\"as soon as possible\\".quoting article 25, 28, 29, 198 of the 1956 Constitution of Pakistan According to Shajeel Zaidi a million people attended Zia ul Haq's funeral because he had given them what they wanted: more religion. A PEW opinion poll found that 84% of Pakistanis favoured making Sharia the official law of the land. According to the 2013 Pew Research Center report, the majority of Pakistani Muslims also support the death penalty for those who leave Islam (62%). In contrast, support for the death penalty for those who leave Islam was only 36% in fellow South Asian Muslim country Bangladesh (which shared heritage with Pakistan). A 2010 opinion poll by PEW Research Centre also found that 87% of Pakistanis considered themselves 'Muslims first' rather than a member of their nationality. This was the highest figure amongst all Muslim populations surveyed. In contrast only 67% in Jordan, 59% in Egypt, 51% in Turkey, 36% in Indonesia and 71% in Nigeria considered themselves as 'Muslim first' rather than a member of their own nationality. \\"Islamic activists\\" such as much or the ulama (Islamic clerics) and Jamaat-e-Islami (Islamist party), support the expansion of \\"Islamic law and Islamic practices\\". \\"Islamic Modernists\\" are lukewarm to this expansion and \\"some may even advocate development along the secularist lines of the West.\\" ==Islamic way of life== Pakistan mostly colored Cerulean blue (Hanafi Sunni) The mosque is an important religious as well as social institution in Pakistan.Malik, Jamal. Islam in South Asia: A Short History. Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2008. Many rituals and ceremonies are celebrated according to Islamic calendar. ==Muslim fiqhs in Pakistan== Growth in the number of religious madrassahs in Pakistan from 1988 to 2002Rahman, T. Madrasas: Potential for Violence in Pakistan in Madrasas in South Asia: Teaching Terror? Edited by Jamal Malik. Routledge 2008. pp. 64. The famed Data Durbar shrine of Sufi saint Ali Hujweiri in Lahore is known for devotees from over the world. According to the CIA World Factbook and Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies, 95-97% of the total population of Pakistan is Muslim. ===Sunni=== The majority of the Pakistani Muslims belong to the Sunni Hanafi Madhhab (school of jurisprudence).The Muslims belong to different schools which are called Madhahib (singular: Madhhab) i.e., schools of jurisprudence (also 'Maktab-e-Fikr' (School of Thought) in Urdu).) Estimates on the Sunni population in Pakistan range from 85% to 90%. ===Shia=== Shia Ithna 'ashariyah are estimated to be 5–7% of the country's population. Pakistan, like India, is said to have at least 5-7% Shias. Shias allege discrimination by the Pakistani government since 1948, claiming that Sunnis are given preference in business, official positions and administration of justice. Attacks on Shias increased under the presidency of Zia-ul-Haq, with the first major sectarian riots in Pakistan breaking out in 1983 in Karachi and later spreading to Lahore and Balochistan. Sectarian violence became a recurring feature of the Muharram month every year, with sectarian violence between Sunnis and Shias taking place in 1986 in Parachinar. In one notorious incident, the 1988 Gilgit Massacre, Osama bin Laden-led Sunni tribals assaulted, massacred and raped Shia civilians in Gilgit after being inducted by the Pakistan Army to quell a Shia uprising in Gilgit. ===Sufism=== Tomb of Syed Abdul Rahim Shah Bukhari constructed by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb Sufism is a vast term and many Sufi orders exist within Pakistan where the philosophy has a strong tradition. Historically, the Sufi missionaries had played a pivotal role in converting the native peoples of Punjab and Sindh to Islam. The most notable Muslim Sufi orders in Pakistan are the Qadiriyya, Naqshbandiya, Chishtiya and Suhrawardiyya silsas (Muslim Orders) and they have a large amount of devotees in Pakistan. The tradition of visiting dargahs is still practiced today. Sufis whose shrines receive much national attention are Data Ganj Baksh (Ali Hajweri) in Lahore (ca. 11th century), Sultan Bahoo in Shorkot Jhang, Baha-ud- din Zakariya in Multan and Shahbaz Qalander in Sehwan (ca. 12th century) and Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai in Bhit, Sindh and Rehman Baba in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province. The Urs (death anniversary) of Sufi saints accounts for the largest gathering upon their shrines held annually by the devotees. Although, popular Sufi culture is centered on Thursday night gatherings at shrines and annual festivals which feature Sufi music and dance, certain tariqas such as Sarwari Qadri Order, refrain from such traditions and believe in paying visit to the shrines, making prayers or reciting manqabat. Moreover, contemporary Islamic fundamentalists also criticize the popular tradition of singing, dance and music, which in their view, does not accurately reflect the teachings and practice of the Prophet Mohammad and his companions. There have been terrorist attacks directed at Sufi shrines and festivals, five in 2010 that killed 64 people. Presently, the known tariqas in Pakistan have maintained their organisations usually known as tehreeks and have their khanqahs for the dhikr of Allah, as per the old age Sufi tradition. ===Quranists=== Muslims who reject the authority of hadith, known as Quranist, Quraniyoon, or Ahle Quran, are also present in Pakistan.Ali Usman Qasmi, A mosque for Qurani Namaz, The Friday Times, Retrieved February 16, 2013 The largest Quranist organization in Pakistan is Ahle Quran, followed by Bazm-e-Tolu-e-Islam. Another Quranist movement in Pakistan is Ahlu Zikr.Dolatabad, Seyed Ali Hosseini, Hossein Naseri Moghadam, and Ali Reza Abedi Sar Asiya. \\"Pillars, proofs and requirements of the Quran-Sufficiency Theory, along with its criticism.\\" International Journal of Humanities and Cultural Studies (IJHCS) ISSN 2356-5926 (2016): 2303-2319. ===Nondenominational=== Roughly twelve per cent of Pakistani Muslims self-describe or have beliefs overlapping with non- denominational Muslims. These Muslims have beliefs that by and large overlap with those of the majority of Muslims and the difference in their prayers are usually non-existent or negligible. Nonetheless, in censuses asking for a clarification on which strand or rite of Muslim faith they most closely align, they usually answer \\"just a Muslim\\".Pewforum Chapter 1: Religious Affiliation retrieved, retrieved 11 March 2015 ===Mahdavia & Ahmadiyya=== There are two main Mahdi'ist-based creeds practised in Pakistan, Mahdavia and Ahmadiyya. The former, Mahdavia, has been practised in modern-day Pakistan since the 15th century. Mahdavis consider Syed Jaunpari to be the Mahdi prophecised in Muslim canons.Sheikh, Samira. \\"Aurangzeb as seen from Gujarat: Shi ‘i and Millenarian Challenges to Mughal Sovereignty.\\" Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society 28.3 (2018): 557-581.. The minority group Ahmadiyya is also present. In 1974, the government of Pakistan amended the Constitution of Pakistan to define a Muslim \\"as a person who believes in finality of Prophet Muhammad\\" and technically Ahmadis are declared non-Muslims. Ahmadis believe in Muhammad as the best and the last law bearing prophet and Mirza Ghulam Ahmad as the Christ of Muslims. Consequently, they were declared non-Muslims by a parliamentary tribunal. There are approximately 2 million Ahmadis in the country. This equates to around 1% of the population. ==Conversions== There have been conversions to Islam from the religious minorities of Pakistan. Baba Deen Mohammad Shaikh, a former Hindu, is a Muslim missionary from Matli in Badin District of Sindh province and has converted over 110,000 Hindus to Islam. There are Christian missionaries active in Pakistan trying to convert Muslims. The Daily Pakistan in 2017 reported that the South Korean missionaries are involved in evangelising in Muslim countries like Pakistan.In 2014, four Christian missionaries were arrested for distributing Christian pamphlets in the Mirpurkhas in Sindh. In 2017, a Christian missionary couple sent by the British Pakistani Christian Association on a missionary trip to Pakistan was forced to leave Pakistan. In 2017, two Christian missionaries preaching in Pakistan were killed by militants. ==Gallery== File:Zahir al-Din Muhammad Babur - Foray to Kuhat (Kohat) - Walters W5967A - Full Page.jpgThe first Mughal Emperor Babur before crossing the Indus River File:Shah Jahan Mosque Thatta Sindh Pakistan 6.jpgShah Jahan Mosque, Thatta was patronized by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan.

In general, it is used to incorporate food ingredients, enzymes, cells or other materials on a micro metric scale. Microencapsulation can also be used to enclose solids, liquids, or gases inside a micrometric wall made of hard or soft soluble film, in order to reduce dosing frequency and prevent the degradation of pharmaceuticals. In a relatively simple form, a microcapsule is a small sphere comprising a near-uniform wall enclosing some material. This enclosed material in the microcapsule is referred to as the core, internal phase, or fill, whereas the wall is sometimes called a shell, coating, or membrane. Some materials like lipids and polymers, such as alginate, may be used as a mixture to trap the material of interest inside. Most microcapsules have pores with diameters between a few nanometers and a few micrometers. The coating materials generally used for coating are: * Ethyl cellulose * Polyvinyl alcohol * Gelatin * Sodium alginate The definition has been expanded, and includes most foods, where the encapsulation of flavors is the most common. The technique of microencapsulation depends on the physical and chemical properties of the material to be encapsulated. Many microcapsules however bear little resemblance to these simple spheres. The core may be a crystal, a jagged adsorbent particle, an emulsion, a Pickering emulsion, a suspension of solids, or a suspension of smaller microcapsules. The microcapsule even may have multiple walls. ==Reasons for encapsulation== The reasons for microencapsulation are numerous. It is mainly used to increase the stability and life of the product being encapsulated, facilitate the manipulation of the product and provide for the controlled release of the contents. In some cases, the core must be isolated from its surroundings, as in isolating vitamins from the deteriorating effects of oxygen, retarding evaporation of a volatile core, improving the handling properties of a sticky material, or isolating a reactive core from chemical attack. In other cases, the objective is not to isolate the core completely but to control the rate at which it releases the contents, as in the controlled release of drugs or pesticides. The problem may be as simple as masking the taste or odor of the core, or as complex as increasing the selectivity of an adsorption or extraction process. In environmental science, a pesticide may be microencapsulated to minimize leaching or volatilization risks. ==Techniques of microcapsule manufacture== ===Physical methods=== ====Pan coating==== This process widely used in the pharma industry, is the oldest industrial procedure for forming small, coated particles or tablets. The particles are tumbled in a pan or other device. ====Centrifugal extrusion==== Liquids are encapsulated by a rotating head containing concentric nozzles. In this process, a jet of core liquid is surrounded by a sheath of wall solution or melt. ====Vibrational nozzle==== Core-shell encapsulation or microgranulation (matrix-encapsulation) can be done using a laminar flow through a nozzle and an additional vibration of the nozzle or the liquid. The vibration has to be done in resonance with the Rayleigh instability and leads to very uniform droplets. The liquid can consist of any liquids with limited viscosities (0-10,000 mPa·s have been shown to work), e.g. solutions, emulsions, suspensions, melts etc. The soldification can be done according to the used gelation system with an internal gelation (e.g. sol-gel processing, melt) or an external (additional binder system, e.g. in a slurry). The process works very well for generating droplets between , applications for smaller and larger droplets are known. The units are deployed in industries and research mostly with capacities of 1-20,000 kg per hour (2-44,000 lb/h) at working temperatures of (room temperature up to molten silicon). Heads are available with from one up to several hundred thousand nozzles. ====Spray–drying==== Spray drying serves as a microencapsulation technique when an active material is dissolved or suspended in a melt or polymer solution and becomes trapped in the dried particle. The main advantages are the ability to handle labile materials because of the short contact time in the dryer and the operation is economical. In modern spray dryers the viscosity of the solutions to be sprayed can be as high as 300 mPa·s. Applying this technique, along with the use of supercritical carbon dioxide, sensitive materials like proteins can be encapsulated. ===Physicochemical methods=== ====Ionotropic gelation ==== Ionotropic gelation occurs when units of uric acid in the chains of the polymer alginate, crosslink with multivalent cations. These may include, calcium, zinc, iron and aluminium. ====Coacervation-phase separation==== Coacervation-phase separation consists of three steps carried out under continuous agitation. # Formation of three immiscible chemical phases: liquid manufacturing vehicle phase, core material phase and coating material phase. # Deposition of coating: core material is dispersed in the coating polymer solution. Coating polymer material coated around core. Deposition of liquid polymer coating around core by polymer adsorbed at the interface formed between core material and vehicle phase. # Rigidization of coating: coating material is immiscible in vehicle phase and is made rigid. This is done by thermal, cross-linking, or dissolution techniques. ===Chemical methods=== ====Interfacial polycondensation==== In interfacial polycondensation, the two reactants in a polycondensation meet at an interface and react rapidly. The basis of this method is the classical Schotten-Baumann reaction between an acid chloride and a compound containing an active hydrogen atom, such as an amine or alcohol, polyesters, polyurea, polyurethane. Under the right conditions, thin flexible walls form rapidly at the interface. A solution of the pesticide and a diacid chloride are emulsified in water and an aqueous solution containing an amine and a polyfunctional isocyanate is added. Base is present to neutralize the acid formed during the reaction. Condensed polymer walls form instantaneously at the interface of the emulsion droplets. ====Interfacial cross-linking==== Interfacial cross-linking is derived from interfacial polycondensation, and was developed to avoid the use of toxic diamines, for pharmaceutical or cosmetic applications. In this method, the small bifunctional monomer containing active hydrogen atoms is replaced by a biosourced polymer, like a protein. When the reaction is performed at the interface of an emulsion, the acid chloride reacts with the various functional groups of the protein, leading to the formation of a membrane. The method is very versatile, and the properties of the microcapsules (size, porosity, degradability, mechanical resistance) can be customized. Flow of artificial microcapsules in microfluidic channels: ====In situ polymerization==== In a few microencapsulation processes, the direct polymerization of a single monomer is carried out on the particle surface. In one process, e.g. cellulose fibers are encapsulated in polyethylene while immersed in dry toluene. Usual deposition rates are about 0.5μm/min. Coating thickness ranges . The coating is uniform, even over sharp projections. Protein microcapsules are biocompatible and biodegradable, and the presence of the protein backbone renders the membrane more resistant and elastic than those obtained by interfacial polycondensation. ====Matrix polymerization==== In a number of processes, a core material is imbedded in a polymeric matrix during formation of the particles. A simple method of this type is spray-drying, in which the particle is formed by evaporation of the solvent from the matrix material. However, the solidification of the matrix also can be caused by a chemical change. ==Release methods and patterns== Even when the aim of a microencapsulation application is the isolation of the core from its surrounding, the wall must be ruptured at the time of use. Many walls are ruptured easily by pressure or shear stress, as in the case of breaking dye particles during writing to form a copy. Capsule contents may be released by melting the wall, or dissolving it under particular conditions, as in the case of an enteric drug coating. In other systems, the wall is broken by solvent action, enzyme attack, chemical reaction, hydrolysis, or slow disintegration. Microencapsulation can be used to slow the release of a drug into the body. This may permit one controlled release dose to substitute for several doses of non-encapsulated drug and also may decrease toxic side effects for some drugs by preventing high initial concentrations in the blood. There is usually a certain desired release pattern. In some cases, it is zero-order, i.e. the release rate is constant. In this case, the microcapsules deliver a fixed amount of drug per minute or hour during the period of their effectiveness. This can occur as long as a solid reservoir or dissolving drug is maintained in the microcapsule. A more typical release pattern is first-order in which the rate decreases exponentially with time until the drug source is exhausted. In this situation, a fixed amount of drug is in solution inside the microcapsule. The concentration difference between the inside and the outside of the capsule decreases continually as the drug diffuses. Nevertheless, there are some other mechanisms that may take place in the liberation of the encapsulated material. These include, biodegradation, osmotic pressure, diffusion, etc. Each one will depend on the composition of the capsule made and the environment it is in. Therefore, the liberation of the material may be affected by various mechanisms that act simultaneously. ==Applications== The applications of micro-encapsulation are numerous. The ones mentioned below are some of the most common ones. * Adhesives * Anti-corrosive coatings * Carbonless copy paper * E-paper or e-ink * Essential oils, flavors and other volatile bioactives for food or in feed additives * Pesticides * Pharmaceuticals, small molecules and recently also peptides and small proteins for oral or sublingual delivery * Phase change materials * Powder perfume * Scratch-n-sniff * Self-healing material such as novel plastics that can automatically repair damage: * Textiles * Temperature release (controlled release) in baking * Thermochromic dyes * Time release technology for pharmaceuticals * Visual indicators * Self healing coatings * DNA protection from degradation for product tracing and data storage * Protection of bioactive compounds that are easily degradated under normal environmental conditions. ==References== ==Bibliography== * Prakash, S. et al. \\"The Gut Microbiota and Human Health with an Emphasis on the Use of Microencapsulated Bacterial Cells\\", Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology (2011), * ==External links== *Southwest Research Institute Category:Polymers ","title":"Micro-encapsulation"},{"id":"1277059","text":"The Museum of Science (MoS) is a science museum and indoor zoo in Boston, Massachusetts, located in Science Park, a plot of land spanning the Charles River. Along with over 700 interactive exhibits, the museum features a number of live presentations throughout the building every day, along with shows at the Charles Hayden Planetarium and the Mugar Omni Theater, the only domed IMAX screen in New England. The museum is also an accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) and is home to over 100 animals, many of which have been rescued and rehabilitated. ==History== Lechmere Viaduct in the 1910s. The museum is later constructed behind the Metropolitan Police Station on the left Original Charles River lock adjacent to the museum and positioned just west of the Charles River Dam Bridge Mugar Omni Theater New England Habitats exhibit ===Origin and early years=== The museum began as the Boston Society of Natural History in 1830, founded by a collection of men who wished to share scientific interests. Their first meeting was held on February 9, 1830 with seven original members in attendance: Walter Channing, Benjamin E. Green, George Hayward, John Ware, Edward Brooks, Amos Binney, and George B. Emerson. It was more commonly called the Boston Museum of Natural History in the 19th century, and this name occurs frequently in the literature. In 1862, after the society had gone through several temporary facilities, a building was constructed in the Back Bay area of the city and dubbed the \\"New England Museum of Natural History.\\" The museum was located next to the original Rogers Building of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and both neoclassical structures were designed by William G. Preston. The original MIT building was demolished in 1939, but the Natural History Museum building survives today, as a home furnishings showcase. A great deal of scientific work was done by the society, especially around geology, and the results of this work can be found in the Proceedings of the Boston Society of Natural History which are now freely available online. A library and children's rooms were added to the museum around 1900. It was renamed the Museum of Science in 1939, under the directorship of Henry Bradford Washburn, Jr., a renowned American mountaineer. The Boston Museum of Natural History of 1830/1864–1945 should not be confused with the private Warren Museum of Natural History (1858–1906, formerly on Chestnut Street in Boston). The contents of the latter collection, including the first intact mastodon, were relocated to the American Museum of Natural History of New York City in 1906. Museum Then and Now, an exhibit of artifacts from the early years of the society, is located near the second floor Blue Wing entrance to the Theater of Electricity in today's museum. ===Post WWII=== After World War II, the old Museum of Science building was sold, and the museum was relocated, again under the name Boston Museum of Science. Under the leadership of Bradford Washburn, the society negotiated with the Metropolitan District Commission for a 99-year lease of the land on the Charles River Dam Bridge, now known as Science Park. The museum pays $1 a year to the state for use of the land. Construction and development began in 1948, and the museum opened in 1951, arguably the first all-encompassing science museum in the country. In these first few years, the museum developed a traveling planetarium, a version of which is still brought to many elementary schools in the Greater Boston area every year. They also obtained during these early years \\"Spooky\\", a great horned owl who became a symbol or mascot of the museum; he lived to age 38, the longest any great horned owl is known to have lived. Today, a number of other taxidermed specimens remain on display, teaching children about the animals of New England and of the world. The Science Park/West End MBTA station was opened in August 1955, allowing easier access to the museum by public transportation. The Charles Hayden Planetarium was opened in 1958. Many more expansions continued into the 1970s and 1980s. In 1999, The Computer Museum in Boston closed and became part of the Museum of Science, integrating some of its displays, although the most of the historical artifacts were moved to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. A major renovation and expansion took place during 2005 and 2006. In 2010, the Charles Hayden Planetarium was closed for renovation, and has since reopened. The main entrance to the museum straddles the border between the cities of Boston and Cambridge, and the boundary is indicated by a marker embedded in the floor inside the museum. In 2013, the Museum of Science was the venue for the first joint session of the Boston and Cambridge city councils, to discuss policy measures to improve retention of talented recent university graduates in the area. ===Future=== Starting in 2013, the Museum of Science has been undergoing a major renovation to upgrade the physical structure and develop new educational content. This $250 million campaign will upgrade nearly half of the Exhibit Halls from 2012, and open three new major exhibits: the Hall of Human Life, the Yawkey Gallery on the Charles River, and What Is Technology? The Hall of Human Life opened in November 2013 in the newly expanded Level 2 of the Green Wing, and has a focus on human biology. The audio kinetic sculpture Archimedean Excogitation has been moved to the atrium to make way for a new exhibit in the lower lobby called The Yawkey Gallery on the Charles River. This exhibit opened in 2016, creating a new entry to the museum with better views of the Charles River and Boston-Cambridge skyline. On October 18, 2016 former mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg revealed that his foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies, is donating $50 million to the museum, the largest gift in the institution's 186-year history. The museum also opened a new exhibit named Wicked Smart: Invented in the Hub which has information about new technologies, especially those created in or around the Boston area. This new exhibit also contains a few interactive activities including a wheel chair visitors can sit in and an Xbox Kinect and projector. In March 2020, the Museum of Science closed indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic and transitioned to online learning.

The cart activities include robotics and circuitry and are more meant for teaching visitors about new technology. All activities also include a magnet for visitors who attempted the activities. ==Notable past exhibits== * In the 1950s, a small Wilson cloud chamber was featured in the main entrance hall. Visitors could come within inches of radioactive material to watch the vapor trails of the particles they emitted. * The first Fresnel lens using electricity in the US (Navesink lighthouse), was on display from the early 1950s until 1979. * In 1988, the museum was host to an exhibit focusing on the life and times of Ramses II. The exhibit displayed more than 70 artifacts, on loan from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Arguably, the centerpiece of the exhibit was a 40-foot-tall model of an Egyptian temple which housed a 3,000-year-old, 57-ton granite statue of Ramses. The exhibit ran from May 7, 1988 through August 30, 1988. * From August to October 2004, the museum was host to the US premiere of The Lord of the Rings the Motion Picture Trilogy the Exhibition, developed by the Te Papa museum in New Zealand, and containing many of the costumes and props from the films. * Gunther von Hagens' Body Worlds 2: The Anatomical Exhibition of Real Human Bodies was at the Museum of Science from July 29, 2006 to January 7, 2007. * From October 25, 2009 to February 21, 2010, Harry Potter: The Exhibition was at the museum. * The Museum of Science built and designed its own film-based exhibit, entitled Star Wars: Where Science Meets Imagination. It was on display there from October 2005 to April 2006, and traveled to other venues. * The Science Behind Pixar is a 13,000 square foot exhibition currently on tour around the US. It was created by the Museum of Science, Boston, in collaboration with Pixar Animation Studios. This exhibit featured some of the activities, videos, and images that describe the math, computer science, and science that go into making computer animated films. ==Computing exhibits== A disk containing the source code for the Morris worm was located in the museum's Computing Revolution exhibit. Although the history artifacts of The Computer Museum (TCM) were moved from Boston to Silicon Valley to become the core of the current Computer History Museum, some former TCM educational exhibits and objects were transferred to the Boston Museum of Science where two new computing and technology exhibits were created. The Computing Revolution, an exhibit no longer on display at the Museum of Science, related the history of computing through a variety of hands-on interactive exhibits. Cahners ComputerPlace, previously located in the Blue Wing, Level 1, housed displays ranging from educational video games to an interactive AIBO ERS-7 robot. The first integrated quantum computing system, developed by MOS Director of Strategic Projects Carol Lynn Albert in collaboration with IBM, is on display as part of MOS's computing exhibits. ==Other attractions== * The museum has developed a to-scale community Solar System model that spans as far as the Riverside MBTA station (in Newton, Massachusetts). The models of the Sun, Mercury and Venus are located on the museum grounds. * Construction began on a rooftop Wind Turbine Lab in 2009. The lab tests nine wind turbines from five different manufacturers on the roof of the museum. An exhibit in the Blue Wing, Catching the Wind, includes a live data stream on how much electricity each turbine is producing. ==See also== * Boston Society of Natural History, predecessor to the museum * Intel Computer Clubhouse Network, global after- school technology program headquartered at the museum ==ReferencesThe museum's current Science & Technology Center * Current Exhibits & Reviews * A science podcast from the Current Science & Technology Center * Navesink lighthouse information from the National Park Service * \\"Human Connections\\" Video on the making of this large interactive polarized light mural, located in the atrium of the Mugar Imax Wing of the MOS (Artist: Austine Wood Comarow) * MOS is a member of NISE Net, and participates in NanoDays Category:1830 establishments in Massachusetts Category:Association of Science-Technology Centers member institutions Category:Buildings and structures in Boston Category:Dinosaur museums in the United States Category:IMAX venues Category:Landmarks in Boston Category:Museums established in 1830 Museum of Science Category:Indoor zoos Category:Natural history museums in Massachusetts Category:Science museums in Massachusetts Category:Zoos in Massachusetts Category:Towers in Massachusetts Category:Wind power in Massachusetts ","title":"Museum of Science (Boston)"},{"id":"1277062","text":"Bread crumbs or breadcrumbs (regional variants: breading, crispies) are sliced residue of dry bread, used for breading or crumbing foods, topping casseroles, stuffing poultry, thickening stews, adding inexpensive bulk to soups, meatloaves and similar foods, and making a crisp and crunchy covering for fried foods, especially breaded cutlets like tonkatsu and schnitzel. The Japanese variety of bread crumbs is called panko. ==Types== ===Dry breadcrumbs=== Dry breadcrumbs are made from dry breads which have been baked or toasted to remove most remaining moisture, and may have a sandy or even powdery texture. Bread crumbs are most easily produced by pulverizing slices of bread in a food processor, using a steel blade to make coarse crumbs, or a grating blade to make fine crumbs. A grater or similar tool will also do. ===Fresh breadcrumbs=== The breads used to make soft or fresh bread crumbs are not quite as dry, so the crumbs are larger and produce a softer coating, crust, or stuffing. The crumb of bread crumb also refers to the texture of the soft, inner part of a bread loaf, as distinguished from the crust, or \\"skin\\". === Panko === Baked panko crusted pork with pineapple sauce over udon is a variety of flaky bread crumb used in Japanese cuisine as a crunchy coating for fried foods, such as tonkatsu. Panko is made from bread baked by electrical current, which yields a bread without a crust, and then grinding the bread to create fine slivers of crumb. It has a crisper, airier texture than most types of breading found in Western cuisine and resists absorbing oil or grease when fried, resulting in a lighter coating. Outside Japan, its use is becoming more popular in both Asian and non-Asian dishes. It is often used on seafood and is often available in Asian markets, speciality stores, and, increasingly, in many large supermarkets. Panko is produced worldwide, particularly in Asian countries, including Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, China, and Vietnam. ==== Etymology ==== The Japanese first learned to make bread from Europeans. The word パン粉 (panko) is derived from pan, giving us the word for bread in Japanese (derived from the Portuguese word “pão” for bread), and -粉 (-ko), a Japanese Kanji indicating \\"flour\\", \\"coating\\", \\"crumb\\", or \\"powder\\" on occasion, when used as a suffix; (as in komeko, \\"rice powder\\", sobako, \\"buckwheat flour\\", and komugiko, \\"wheat flour\\"). ==Breading== Cornmeal breading Breading (also known as crumbing) is a dry grain-derived food coating for a piece of food made from bread crumbs or a breading mixture with seasonings. Breading can also refer to the process of applying a bread-like coating to a food. Breading is well suited for frying as it lends itself to creating a crisp coating around the food. Breading mixtures can be made of breadcrumb, flour, cornmeal, and seasoning that the item to be breaded is dredged in before cooking. If the item to be breaded is too dry for the coating to stick, the item may first be moistened with buttermilk, raw egg, egg wash or other liquid. Breading contrasts with batter, which is a grain- based liquid coating for food that produces a smoother and finer texture, but which can be softer overall. ==In popular culture== In the fairy tale \\"Hansel and Gretel\\", breadcrumbs are used by Hansel and Gretel to track their footpath. However, the bread crumbs were eventually eaten by birds, subsequently leading them to become lost in the woods. The popularity of breadcrumbs in the fairy tale led to the use of the word \\"breadcrumb\\" as a navigation element that allows users to keep track of their locations within programs or documents. == Image gallery == File:Panko - Paprika - 3.jpgPanko breadcrumbs with paprika flavour File:Panko - White - 2.jpgPanko white breadcrumbs File:971027-I'ANS-ATN-IMG 8790.jpgIANS orange breadcrumbs File:971027-I'ANS-ATN-IMG 8772.jpgIANS simple breadcrumbs File:Tonkatsu at Butagumi in Nishi-Azabu.jpgalt=Close up of Japanese breaded tonkatsuPanko on Tonkatsu File:971110-ILIA-Vanak-IMG 8870-2.jpgalt=Fried shrimpFried shrimp with panko breadcrumbs File:980722-Recipe-05-Shrimps-IMG 8660.jpgalt=Shrimps with PankoShrimps coated by panko breadcrumbs File:990402-ians-recipe-01-IMG 4724.jpgalt=Bread with filling cut in halfCrispy breads with chicken and corn ==References== Category:Food ingredients Crumbs Category:Food industry ","title":"Bread crumbs"},{"id":"1277063","text":"Wojsko komputowe (, comput army) is a type of military unit used in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 17th century and the 18th century. Until the mid-17th century, Polish forces were divided into permanent units () and supplemental units ( or ), which were created in the time of military needs. In 1652 this distinction ceased, and both types of forces were merged into wojsko komputowe. The etymology of the name is from (account, calculation), and Old Polish komput—an army budget which was voted for by the Commonwealth parliament, the Sejm. Wojsko kwarciane was composed from various units, both Commonwealth-born soldiers and foreign mercenaries. The Diet voted to pay for certain amount of infantry and cavalry. Personnel number (which was a kept a state secret) varies, because often the commanders (hetmans) paid for additional manpower from their own purses. During peacetime, the Commonwealth komput army numbered about 12,000 for the Crown (Poland proper) and 6,000 for the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. During wartime it was increased to around 24,000–40,000 for the Crown and 8,000-22,000 for Lithuania. In addition, wojsko kwarciane was supplemented with peasant-based recruits of piechota wybraniecka and from 1653, piechota łanowa, registered Cossacks (until 1699), pospolite ruszenie, royal guard, armies of magnates and cities, and wojsko ordynackie. In 1717 the Silent Sejm introduced under Russian pressure komput values of 18,000 for Crown and 6,200 for Lithuania. This marked the beginning of Russian control over Commonwealth armies, which would last until the May Constitution of Poland.

In the 1856 presidential election, he became the first Republican vice- presidential nominee when nominated alongside John C. Frémont. The Republican Party lost that campaign. During the American Civil War, Dayton served as the United States Ambassador to France, a position in which he worked to prevent French recognition of the Confederacy. ==Early life== Dayton was born in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, to farmer Joel Dayton (1776–1833) and Nancy (Lewis) Dayton (1787–1866). His father worked as a farmer and mechanic, and was not well off, but the extended Dayton family was long prominent in New Jersey. William L. Dayton was the grand-nephew of Elias Dayton and second cousin of Jonathan Dayton. He graduated from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1825. He then studied law with Peter Dumont Vroom, was admitted to the bar in 1830, and became an attorney in Freehold. ==Political career== In 1837, Dayton was elected to the New Jersey Legislative Council, and he became an associate judge of the New Jersey Supreme Court in 1838. Following the death of U.S. Senator Samuel L. Southard, he was appointed to the United States Senate starting July 2, 1842, and elected to finish the term ending in 1845. He was re-elected by the New Jersey Legislature as a Whig in 1845 but lost in 1851, ending his service on March 3, 1851. In 1856, Dayton was selected by the nascent Republican Party as their first nominee for Vice President of the United States over Abraham Lincoln at the Philadelphia Convention. He and his running mate, John C. Fremont, lost to the Democratic ticket of James Buchanan and John C. Breckinridge. Afterwards, he served as New Jersey Attorney General until 1861, when President Lincoln appointed him Minister to France. He served from May 1861 until his death in December 1864. His service spanned most of the American Civil War. ==Ambassador== In France, Dayton was part of a successful lobbying campaign to prevent the government of Napoleon III from recognizing the independence of the Confederacy or allowing Confederate use of French ports. Dayton died in Paris and was buried in Riverview Cemetery, Trenton, New Jersey.James, George. \\"He's Looked at Life From Both Sides Now\\", The New York Times, \\"Buried here too is William Lewis Dayton, the first Republican vice presidential candidate who defeated Lincoln for the position in 1856 but lost the presidential nomination to him in 1860.\\" February 20, 2000.

The team was founded by Charles Weeghman. They came in second in the Federal League rankings in and won the league championship in . They came to an end when the Federal League came to a deal with the National and American Leagues that disbanded all its teams. The Whales are notable as the original occupants of the stadium now known as Wrigley Field, the current home of the Chicago Cubs and the only Federal League stadium still in use. ==History== Founded by Charles Weeghman, the club finished 1½ games behind the Indianapolis Hoosiers in the inaugural season for the league, during which the team lacked a formal nickname and was known simply as the Chicago Federals. Prior to the start of the season, Weeghman built a stadium for the team, called Weeghman Park, designed by Zachary Taylor Davis, who had previously designed Comiskey Park. He also leased the parcel on which the park stood for 99 years. Chicago Federals playing at Weeghman Park in April 1914 In the league's second and final season, the Chicago Federals adopted the nickname Whales, and included the logo of a whale inside a large \\"C\\" on their uniform shirts.

When Kenesaw Mountain Landis brokered a deal between the Federal League, American League and National League that ended the Federal League's existence, Weeghman was allowed to buy controlling interest in the Cubs. He then merged the Whales with the Cubs and moved the Cubs from West Side Park into his new steel-and- concrete structure. While Weeghman himself was forced out within four years due to financial troubles, the Cubs still play in the park he built to this day, the only Federal League park still in use. It was renamed Cubs Park in 1920 and acquired its present name, Wrigley Field, in 1926. Many Whales players had American and National League experience, including manager Joe Tinker, Dutch Zwilling, Mordecai Brown, and Rollie Zeider. As the Federals, they played the first game at Wrigley Field on April 23, 1914, and to mark the park's centennial on April 23, 2014, the Cubs wore the Federals' uniforms. ==References== ==See also== *Chicago Whales all-time roster *1914 Chicago Federals season *1915 Chicago Whales season Category:Baseball teams established in 1914 Category:Baseball teams disestablished in 1915 Category:Federal League teams Category:Defunct Major League Baseball teams Whales Category:1914 establishments in Illinois Category:1915 disestablishments in Illinois Category:Defunct baseball teams in Illinois ","title":"Chicago Whales"},{"id":"1277082","text":" USCGC Alex Haley (WMEC-39) is a United States Coast Guard Cutter and former United States Navy vessel that was recommissioned for Coast Guard duty on 10 July 1999.

Martin Company (now Lockheed-Martin) under the direction of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). Twelve Viking rockets flew from 1949 to 1955.\\"The Viking Rocket Story\\", by Milton W. Rosen, Harper & Brothers, NY, 1955. Rosen, the NRL project manager for Viking, describes the project's context, history, design, and includes chapters on all flights through Viking 11, with an outline of basic design issues for large liquid rockets, together with much interesting detail about the countless problems that inevitably arose in such an ambitious and innovative program. == Origins == After World War II, the United States experimented with captured German V-2 rockets as part of the Hermes project. Based on these experiments the U.S. decided in 1946 to develop its own large liquid-fueled rocket design, to be called Neptune but changed to Viking. The intent was to provide an independent U.S. capability in rocketry, to continue the Hermes project after the V-2s were expended, and to provide a vehicle better suited to scientific research. The Navy, in particular, needed a vehicle to study the atmosphere and learn how to predict bad weather which would affect the fleet. The V-2 would tumble in the rarefied atmosphere at high altitudes. Having been designed as a weapon, the V-2 carried a large payload, approximately one ton of high explosive. This was more than was considered necessary for the scientific instrument payload of a high-altitude research rocket, but in the case of the V-2, used for research, most of the payload was lead ballast required for stable flight,\\"Rockets, Missiles, and Space Travel\\", by Willey Ley, 3rd Edition, Viking Press, New York, 1951, p. 250ff. limiting the potential speed and altitude that could be reached with the smaller payloads typically needed for early scientific investigations. The NRL, partly at the instigation of the American Rocket Society (ARS), chose to build the advanced sounding rocket. Milton Rosen, head of the Viking project, credits rocket pioneer Robert Goddard, the ARS, the California Institute of Technology and the V-2 for the \\"profound influence\\" they had on the design of the rocket.Rosen, p. 28 The Viking was the most advanced large, liquid-fueled rocket being developed in the U.S. at the time.\\"History of Rocketry & Space Travel,\\" revised edition, Wernher von Braun and Frederick I. Ordway III, Thomas Y. Crowell Co., New York, 1969, p. 151 == Design features == The Viking was roughly half the size, in terms of mass and power, of the V-2. Both were actively guided rockets, fueled with the same propellant (Ethyl alcohol and liquid oxygen), which were fed to a single large pump-fed engine by two turbine-driven pumps. The Reaction Motors XLR10-RM-2 engine was the largest liquid-fueled rocket engine developed in the United States up to that time, producing (sea level) and (vacuum) of thrust. Isp was and respectively, with a mission time of 103s. As was also the case for the V-2, hydrogen peroxide was converted to steam to drive the turbopump that fed fuel and oxidizer into the engine. As its V-2 counterpart, it also was regeneratively cooled. Viking pioneered important innovations over the V-2. One of the most significant for rocketry was the use of a gimbaled thrust chamber which could be swiveled from side to side on two axes for pitch and yaw control, dispensing with the inefficient and somewhat fragile graphite vanes in the engine exhaust used by the V-2. The rotation of the engine on the gimbals was controlled by gyroscopic inertial reference; this type of guidance system was invented by Robert Goddard, who had partial success with it before World War II intervened.Rosen, p. 66 Roll control was by use of the turbopump exhaust to power RCS jets on the fins. Compressed gas jets stabilized the vehicle after the main power cutoff. Similar devices are now extensively used in large, steerable rockets and in space vehicles. Another improvement was that initially the alcohol tank, and later the LOX tank also, were built integral with the outer skin, saving weight. The structure was also largely aluminum, as opposed to steel used in the V-2, thus shedding more weight. Vikings 1 through 7 were slightly longer (about 15 m, 49 ft) than the V-2, but with a straight cylindrical body only in diameter, making the rocket quite slender. They had fairly large fins similar to those on the V-2. Vikings 8 through 14 were built with an enlarged airframe of improved design. The diameter was increased to 45 in (114 cm), while the length was reduced to 13 m (42 ft), altering the missile's \\"pencil shape.\\" The fins were made much smaller and triangular. The added diameter meant more fuel and more weight, but the \\"mass ratio\\", of fueled to empty mass, was improved to about 5:1, a record for the time. == Flight history == Diagram showing both Viking rocket variants, Vikings 1 to 7 (left) and 8 to 12 (right) All except Viking 4 were flown from White Sands, New Mexico. The first launch, of Viking 1, on 3 May 1949 came after a very prolonged and trying period of ground firing tests, and attained an altitude of . The altitude was limited by a premature engine cut- off, eventually traced to steam leakage from the turbine casing. Viking 2, flown 6 September 1949, also suffered early engine cut-off for the same reason as Viking 1; it reached only . (Subsequent engines had the turbine casing halves welded rather than bolted together, solving the problem.) Viking 3, 9 February 1950, suffered from instability in a redesigned guidance system, and had to be cut off by ground command when it threatened to fly outside the range. Altitude was again only . Viking 4, on 11 May 1950, launched from the deck of the USS Norton Sound near the Equator, reached a peak altitude of , almost the maximum possible for the payload flown, in a nearly perfect flight. Guidance system was reverted to that of Vikings 1 and 2. Viking 5, 21 November 1950 reached . Engine thrust was about 5% low, or altitude would have been slightly higher. Viking 6, 11 December 1950, suffered catastrophic failure of the stabilizing fins late in powered flight, with loss of attitude control, and associated very large drag. Altitude was therefore only . Viking 7, 7 August 1951, reached altitude to beat the old V-2 record for a single-stage rocket. This was the highest and last flight of the original airframe design. Viking 8, 6 June 1952, first rocket of improved airframe design, lost when it broke loose during static testing, and flew to before ground commanded cut- off. Viking 9, 15 December 1952, reached altitude in the first successful flight of the improved airframe design. Viking 10. The engine exploded on first launch attempt 30 June 1953. The rocket was rebuilt and was flown successfully 7 May 1954, to . Viking 11 rose to on 24 May 1954, an altitude record for a Western single-stage rocket up to that time.

The National Air and Space Museum contains a full-size cutaway reconstruction of Viking 12, built from original blueprints. Two additional Viking airframes, similar to Vikings 9 through 12, were flown as test vehicles for Project Vanguard. Both were launched from Cape Canaveral, on 8 December 1956 (Viking 13) and 1 May 1957 (Viking 14),Ordway, Frederick I. ; Wakeford, Ronald C. International Missile and Spacecraft Guide, N.Y., McGraw-Hill, 1960, p. 208. and were designated Vanguard TV0 and Vanguard TV1 respectively. == Achievements == USS Norton Sound at sea, 11 May 1950 While the underlying motivation for the Viking Project clearly had a national defense component, since it was a US Navy program, it nevertheless established a number of early space exploration landmarks, some technological and some scientific. Peaceful space travel and space exploration were clearly important objectives that energized many of the higher level instigators even of the German V-2 rocket program, which was funded by the German Army entirely for military purposes. Viking was probably the most ambitious program up to its time, which had significant objectives that were essentially scientific, accompanied by a desire to explore and advance rocket technology for more ambitious peaceful space exploration goals such as artificial earth satellites.Rosen, Chapter 14 Technological advances pioneered by Viking included the following: * An essentially all-aluminum airframe, with a mass ratio (fueled mass to empty vehicle mass) of about 5:1 for the improved (Viking 8 and later) model. This was a significant improvement over the V-2, which was largely constructed of steel. The altitude records achieved by Viking, for a single-stage rocket, were mostly the result of its light-weight structure. * Thrust vector control by gimbaling the rocket motor, as opposed to the graphite vanes used by the German V-2 and the U.S. Army Redstone missiles. This method of control has become standard since, both for reliability and efficiency reasons. * Control of the vehicle's orientation, after fuel exhaustion of the main engine, by small auxiliary jets, permitting programmed pointing of scientific instruments, etc. * Extensive radio telemetry for both engineering and scientific data, which greatly reduced the number of test flights needed before useful results were obtained. Among its scientific achievements, firsts up to their time, were: * The highest altitude measurement of atmospheric density (by Viking 7). * The highest altitude measurement of atmospheric winds (Viking 7). * The first measurements of the atmospheric positive ion composition at high altitude (Viking 10). * The highest altitude exposures of cosmic-ray emulsions (Vikings 9, 10, and 11). * The highest altitude photographs of the Earth (Viking 11). Through the Viking flights, NRL was first to measure temperature, pressure, density, composition and winds in the upper atmosphere and electron density in the ionosphere, and to record the ultraviolet spectra of the Sun. == Viking into Vanguard == The success NRL achieved in this series of experiments encouraged laboratory scientists to believe that, with a more powerful engine and the addition of upper stages, the Viking rocket could be made a vehicle capable of launching an earth satellite. This led to NRL's three-stage Project Vanguard vehicle which launched the second US satellite. Two later rockets in the Viking series, Vanguard TV0 (renamed from Viking 13) and TV1, substantially similar to Vikings 8 through 12, were used as suborbital test vehicles during Project Vanguard, before the first Vanguard vehicle became available for test as Vanguard TV2, in the fall of 1957. ==See also== *Vanguard rocket ==References== ==External links== Adapted from * U.S. Naval Research Laboratory * Astronautix.com * Begg's aerospace * Directory of U.S. Military Rockets and Missiles * NASA sounding rockets, 1958-1968 * Free paper models of viking 7, 10, 13 and 14 * The Robert Goddard Connection with Viking (see Professional Relations) * 1948 Rocket Will Double V-2's Record July 1947 article on original Neptune Program Category:Spaceflight before 1951 Category:1951 in spaceflight Category:1952 in spaceflight Category:1954 in spaceflight Category:1955 in spaceflight Category:1956 in spaceflight Category:1957 in spaceflight Category:Sounding rockets of the United States ","title":"Viking (rocket)"},{"id":"1277095","text":"La Jolla Playhouse is a not-for-profit, professional theatre on the campus of the University of California San Diego. ==Background== Joan and Irwin Jacobs Center for La Jolla Playhouse La Jolla Playhouse was founded in 1947 by Gregory Peck, Dorothy McGuire, and Mel Ferrer. In 1983, it was revived under the leadership of Des McAnuff. Since then, the Playhouse's repertoire has included eighty-four world premieres, thirty-two West Coast premieres, and eight American premieres, and has won more than three hundred honors, including the 1993 Tony Award as America's Outstanding Regional Theatre. It is supported, in part, by grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the California Arts Council, the City of San Diego, and the County of San Diego. It was announced on April 10, 2007 that Christopher Ashley would succeed McAnuff as Artistic Director. La Jolla Playhouse provides a number of educational opportunities for children, teens, and adults interested in theatre arts, both as performers and behind-the-scenes. In addition, the Performance Outreach Program (POP Tour) annually brings a professional, world- premiere production to schools, libraries, and community centers throughout San Diego. There are additional summer theater opportunities through the La Jolla Playhouse Conservatory, YP@LJP summer camps, student matinees, and many other in-school workshops and classes. Among the productions that originated at the Playhouse before finding success on Broadway are The Who's Tommy, Matthew Broderick's revival of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, Jane Eyre, Dracula, the Musical, Thoroughly Modern Millie, Cry Baby, Bonnie and Clyde, The Pulitzer Prize-winning I Am My Own Wife, 700 Sundays, Jersey Boys, Memphis, Peter and the Starcatcher, Chaplin, Hands on a Hardbody, Des McAnuff's revival of Jesus Christ Superstar, Zhivago and Big River . ==Page To Stage== La Jolla Playhouse began the Page To Stage Play Development Program in 2001 to facilitate the development of new plays and musicals, offering audiences the rare opportunity to experience the \\"birth\\" of a play and take part in its evolution. As a Page To Stage workshop, a production will feature minimal sets and costumes, and will be revised throughout its entire process, including performances. After the performance, audience feedback sessions will provide insight and suggestion for both the creative team and the actors. In the five years since the program began, two Page To Stage Productions have gone on to win Tony Awards. Doug Wright's I Am My Own Wife won the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and Tony Awards for Best Play and Best Leading Actor in a Play (Jefferson Mays); and Billy Crystal’s 700 Sundays, a 2004 Page To Stage Production, won the 2005 Tony Award for Special Theatrical Event. ==Management== ===Managing Directors=== *1981–1991: Alan Levey *1992–2004: Terry Dwyer *2005–2008: Steven Libman *2009–2018: Michael S.

It was started in 1994 and, in 2015, completed 21 years of operation. Primarily an email-based network (with smaller operations on Facebook and the web, it has been considered influential in linking Goans across the globe, specially in the diaspora. ==History== It was started in 1994 by a (then) 17-year-old student Herman Carneiro, and since then has grown into being the most influential electronic mailing list linked to Goa. Carneiro studied Chemical Engineering (Northeastern University in Boston), and has an M.Sc. in Control of Infectious Diseases from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. He was at Imperial College, London. He has worked in biomedical research at LeukoSite, Inc. and then at PerSeptive Biosystems, process design at Pharm-Eco laboratories, and capital engineering projects at Kodak. Carneiro was at Whitehead Institute, MIT, where he was a team manager for the Human Genome Project. Later, as part of his Masters-degree program, he designed and carried out a research project for the World Health Organization in Cambodia on sustainable interventions to prevent dengue fever outbreaks in the region. He has also conducted research in new drug discovery at Pfizer, Inc., and has worked for the Massachusetts Department of Public Health as an epidemiologist. Herman has also been keen sportsman and represented Kenya in the East and Central African Junior Tennis Championships in 1992 and 1993. ==Launched in 1994== Goanet was started on 25 August 1994 with approximately 20 members. The mailing list was run from Carneiro's university e-mail account. According to Carneiro: \\"Netters were asked to put a * in their subject line to indicate a message to be posted on the list as opposed to private e-mail. The list grew slowly but steadily. Pretty soon we had 100 members and by that time I could not cope forwarding all the e-mail. So, I requested that a mailing list program be set up for Goanet on my university's server. I was successful and Goanet found its home for next 4 years.\\" ==On the Goacom server== Goanet had real-time archives on the web and the membership continued to grow steadily. In 1998, Goanet moved to the Goacom server. This allowed Goanet to expand even further. Carneiro has argued that Goanet (also called Goa-Net and GoaNet earlier) has been \\"more than a mailing list from the start -- it's been a virtual community.\\" ==Run by volunteers== Volunteers of Goanet have included Bosco D'Mello (Canada), Eddie Fernandes (UK), Vivian Coelho (USA), Eustaquio Santimano (Denmark), Sunila Muzawar (UAE), Frederick Menezes (Goa), among others. Among the first members were Jacqueline Carneiro (USA), Jeannette Carneiro (USA), Peter D'Souza (USA), Maria D'Souza (USA), Ulysses and Kendy Menezes (Kuwait), Kevin Coutinho, Craig Rodrigues (Canada), Marlon Menezes (US), Brendan Fernandes (Australia), Joanne Fernandes (Australia), Tashlyn Gonzalves (Australia), and Sherwin Nazareth (Australia). ==Outside Goa== Goanet has a readership of over 10,000 people each day. In 2004, the network was claiming a membership of \\"probably... 5200 members, besides others who visit the website\\" and a readership in scattered across some 50 countries worldwide. The list's participants, primarily Goans now living outside of Goa have been involved with a number of initiatives, including an attempt to bring computers to more schools in Goa and efforts by the government to study migration from Goa. ==Built awareness== Goanet has built awareness about expat and environmental issues in Goa. It has also inspired the formation of a number of other cyber ventures (particularly e-mail lists) and has also been active in discussing Goan writing and literature. Prominent posters on the list include JoeGoaUk, who is known to share a number of photographs and news reports on a daily basis from Goa itself. Dr. Alberto G. Gomes has written an academic paper on the interactions on Goanet. (‘Going Goan on the Goa-Net: Computer-mediated Communication and Goan Diaspora’. Social Analysis 45 (1), p 53–66) In 2012, Goanet announced that it had launched Goanet-Femnet for empowering women, and was helping campaign to preserve Goa in conjunction with the Save Goa Campaign, UK.http://www.mail-archive.com/goanet-news@lists.goanet.org/msg03168.html ==References== ==External links== * Going Global in Cyberspace ‘Going Goan on the Goa-Net: Computer-mediated Communication and Goan Diaspora’. * Goanet archives from Dec 1995, earlier years partial record. * Goanet mailing-list welcome page * Goanet on Facebook Goanet on Facebook. * Goanet Femnet * Goanet on Twitter Goanet on Twitter. * Goanet Celebrates its Sixth Birthday * Case study: Goanet – Linking the Goan Diaspora Across the World Category:Mass media in Goa ","title":"Goanet"},{"id":"1277098","text":"Indianapolis Hoosiers was the name of three major league and at least three minor league baseball clubs based in Indianapolis. * Indianapolis Hoosiers (American Association), which played in 1884 * Indianapolis Hoosiers (National League), which played from 1887 until 1889 * Indianapolis Hoosiers (Federal League), which played in 1914 and then became the Newark Peppers * Indianapolis Hoosiers (minor league baseball) ==See also== * Indiana Hoosiers, athletic teams representing Indiana University ","title":"Indianapolis Hoosiers"},{"id":"1277102","text":"The Newark Peppers, originally known as the Indianapolis Hoosiers, were a Federal League baseball team from 1913-1915.The Federal League of Base Ball Clubs, by Robert Peyton Wiggins, published by McFarland, 2009The Federal League of 1914–1915: Baseball's Third Major League, by Marc Okkonen, published by SABR, 1989 The Federal League (FL), founded in 1913, was a third major league in 1914 and 1915. ==History== The Federal League began as an independent minor league in 1913. The franchise placed in Indianapolis, Indiana, was called the \\"Hoosier Feds\\" or just \\"Hoosiers\\", and won the 1913 league championship. Their ball field the first season was referred to as Riverside Beach or Riverside Park, and newspapers reported its location as \\"30th Street and Riverside Park\\". When the Federal League declared itself a challenger to the two major leagues in 1914, it retained its franchise in Indianapolis, and built a new facility, Federal League Park. Primarily owned by oil magnate Harry F. Sinclair,Hoosiers article at Everything2 the Hoosiers again won the Federal League championship that year with an 88–65 record. Although the FL had placed a team (the Tip-Tops) in Brooklyn, from the outset Federal League officials felt they could more effectively compete commercially against the American and National leagues by placing a team in Manhattan. All attempts were effectively blocked by principals of the two existing Manhattan teams (the New York Giants and the New York Yankees). Federal League executives decided to relocate the Indianapolis franchise to a major city in the New York metropolitan area, and Newark was chosen. Although the team was named the Newark PeppersChicago Tribune May 11, 1915, page 11 \\"The Whales fairly knocked the cover off the ball, easily defeating the Newark Peppers by the score of 10 to 5\\"] (and called \\"The Peps\\" for short), the team actually played at Harrison Park, in the town of Harrison, New Jersey, across the Passaic River from downtown Newark. (As part of the franchise transfer, Indianapolis outfielder Benny Kauff, who was the Federal League batting champ in 1914, was placed with the Tip-Tops.) The team finished in 5th place with a won–loss record of 80–72. The Peppers were disbanded when the Federal League went out of business after the 1915 season. The Peppers were the only major league baseball franchise in New Jersey besides the Elizabeth Resolutes, who played half of the 1873 season in the National Association (the precursor to the National League). The Brooklyn Dodgers played seven \\"home\\" games (one against each NL rival) in Jersey City in 1956 and 1957. ==Notable players== The team's roster included future Baseball Hall of Fame members Edd Roush and Bill McKechnie.

Mills, who was born in Newark, was also the only native Jerseyan on the team. ==See also== * 1914 Indianapolis Hoosiers season * 1915 Newark Peppers season ==References== ==External links== * 1914 Indianapolis Hoosiers at Baseball Reference * 1915 Newark Peppers at Baseball Reference Category:Baseball teams established in 1914 Category:Baseball teams disestablished in 1915 Category:Federal League teams Category:Defunct Major League Baseball teams Category:1914 establishments in Indiana Category:1915 disestablishments in Indiana Category:Defunct baseball teams in New Jersey Category:Defunct baseball teams in Indiana ","title":"Newark Peppers"},{"id":"1277103","text":"First Olsen Ltd, until 2005 known as First Olsen Tankers, is a Norwegian shipping company owned by Ganger Rolf ASA and Bonheur and affiliated with Fred.

By 2000, the station began broadcasting via satellite at a cost that was a couple of million dollars. The station was located in the predominantly Shi'a neighborhood of Haret Hreik in the southern suburbs of Beirut, where the Hezbollah is also headquartered. Originally, the station employed only a few men that had studied media in London during the mid-1980s. But almost a year later, Al-Manar was employing over 150 people. Initially, Al Manar would broadcast only five hours per day. Shortly before the 1992 election, it began broadcasting regular news bulletins in order to help Hezbollah attain more votes and spread its message to more people. In 1993, the station expanded its broadcasting to seven hours a day and extended its signal to the southern part of the Bekaa Valley. Ahead of the 1996 Lebanese parliamentary elections, additional antennas were erected in Northern Lebanon and throughout the Mount Lebanon range, so that the station could be viewed not only in Lebanon, but also in western Syria and northern Israel. Broadcasting was extended to 20 hours in 1998 but reduced to 18 hours in 2000. In 1996, the Lebanese government granted broadcasting licenses to only five television stations, not including Al-Manar. Approximately 50 stations were forced to close at the time. Several stations appealed the government's decision, but only four of them were finally granted licenses, one of which was Al-Manar. On 18 September, the Lebanese Cabinet decided to grant Al-Manar a license after having been requested to do so by then Syrian president Hafiz al-Asad. Al-Manar received the license in July 1997. According to the US Department of Treasury, Al Manar is the media arm of the Hezbollah. The station manager Muhammad Afif Ahmad, said that Al Manar belongs to Hezbollah culturally and politically.The Washington Post, 19 June 1995, Al-Manar: Hizbullah TV, 24/7, Avi Jorisch, Middle East Quarterly Winter 2004, pp. 17–31 By 2004, Al Manar was estimated to hold 10-15 million viewers daily worldwide. ===Satellite broadcasting=== During the 1990s, the popularity of satellite broadcasting greatly increased in the Arab world and in Lebanon. The first Lebanese station to use this technology was Future Television, launching Future International SAT in 1994, while LBCI and the Lebanese government followed by launching LBCSAT and Tele Liban Satellite respectively. In order to compete with these emerging stations, and in order to find an international audience, Al-Manar announced its intention to launch a satellite channel on 9 March 2000. Muhammad Ra'd, a Hezbollah member of parliament and al-Manar's largest shareholder, submitted the request to the minister of transmission, which was approved in April 2000. Although the launch of the satellite station was originally planned for July, the date was moved up in order to coincide with the end of the Israeli occupation of South Lebanon on 25 May. This success led other television stations to follow in launching satellite stations, including Murr TV in November 2000, but it was shut down for \\"violating an election law prohibiting propaganda\\" – a fate which al-Manar did not meet, although its programming was also considered propaganda by many analysts . ArabSat, a leading communications satellite operator in the Middle East, headquartered in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, was at first wary about collaborating with al-Manar, because of the station's Shi'a agenda – the two companies agreed, however, that the programming would be adapted to the pan- Arab audience, leading to a slight difference between the local broadcast and the one via satellite. At first, only three hours of satellite programming were broadcast per day, but by December 2000, the station was broadcasting around the clock. Al-Manar was soon carried by many satellite providers. However, starting with the removal of the station from TARBS World TV in Australia in 2003, many satellite television providers stopped featuring it. Until then the station was featured by the following providers at one time or another: *Intelsat, broadcasting to North America *New Skies Satellites NSS-803, Africa and parts of Europe *ArabSat, Middle East, North Africa, and parts of Europe *Hispasat, South America *AsiaSat, Asia *Nilesat *Eutelsat, Europe, North Africa, and Middle East *SES Astra, Europe According to the BBC on 26 July 2006, Al-Manar had three satellite signals:BBC News, 26 July 2006 Israel steps up \\"psy-ops\\" in Lebanon Retrieved 1 August 2006 * ArabSat 2B at 30.5 degrees east * Badr 3 at 26 degrees east * NileSat 102 at 7 degrees west ===Al-Manar during 2006 Lebanon War=== ====Israeli Air Force strike==== The channel was continuously struck by missiles during Israeli air raids. The Israeli Air Force attacks on 13 July 2006 led to injury of three employees. The attack on Al-Manar's facilities shortly followed another strike against the Rafic Hariri International Airport in Beirut earlier that morning. Despite the attack, the station remained on air, broadcasting from undisclosed locations. The IDF bombed Al-Manar's Beirut complex again on 16 July causing fire in the complex and surrounding buildings. The station's signal disappeared briefly several times, then continued normal programming. Illegality of bombing The bombing of media outlets violates international law when they are not being used for military purposes (\\"it is unlawful to attack facilities that merely shape civilian opinion; neither directly contributes to military operations\\"), according to Human Rights Watch. This incident has been condemned by the International Federation of Journalists. The Israel Association of Journalists withdrew from the federation due to this criticism, claiming that Al-Manar employees \\"are not journalists, they are terrorists\\".Jerusalem Post, 16 July 2006, Israel threatens to leave World Press Federation Note that this article refers to the \\"World Press Federation\\" in an apparent errorJerusalem Post, 20 July 2006, Israeli journalists pull out of IFJ Retrieved 27 July 2006 The New York based Committee to Protect Journalists, has also expressed alarm over the incident as \\"it (Al-Manar) does not appear based on a monitoring of its broadcasts today to be serving any discernible military function, according to CPJ’s analysis.\\" == Content == Al-Manar's programming consists of 25% music videos and fillers, 25% series and dramas, 25% talk shows, and finally 25% news and family shows. Most of the programming is self-produced, although on occasion, programming from IRIB (Iran) is used. The point-of-view of the programming is strongly anti-Israel and anti-US. \\"Appearing on al-Manar, Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah frequently calls for \`Death to America\`\\" and the Statue of Liberty is depicted \\"as a ghoul, her gown dripping blood, a knife instead of a torch in her raised hand.\\"Avi Jorisch, National Review, 22 December 2004, Terrorist Television Hezbollah has a worldwide reach. ===Programs=== The news programming includes much footage from the international press, especially the Israeli. Additionally the station subscribes to the following wire services: Reuters, Associated Press, Agence France Presse, and Deutsche Presse Agentur. It also sources stories from Iranian news agencies such as FARS and IRNA. The station airs eight news bulletins a day in Arabic in addition to one in English and one in French. Several talk shows are regularly aired on al-Manar. The best known of these is Beit al-ankabut (The Spider's House); its title alludes to a metaphor, Hassan Nasrallah often employs to describe Israel. It is dedicated to uncovering the \\"weakness of the Zionist entity\\", i.e. Israel. It attempts to convince the Arab world that Israel could easily be destroyed, for example, by an increase in the Arab population and the implementation of the Palestinian right of return. Further talk shows include Hadith al-sa'a (Talk of the Hour), Matha ba'ad (What's Next?), Ma'al Hadath (With The Event), Bayna Kawsayn (Between The Brackets), Milafat (Files), Al-din wa al-hayat (Religion and Life), and Nun wa al-qalam (The 'Nun' and the Pen). Guests include well-known journalists, analysts, writers, Lebanese politicians, spokespersons of terrorist groups, and Islamic scholars, who then discuss current religious, political, and cultural, regional and global topics. Al-Manar often airs music videos and fillers in between full-length programs and during commercial breaks. The music videos are generally dedicated to the following seven purposes: the promotion of the Hezbollah, highlighting the importance of armed resistance against Israel, the glorification of martyrdom, spreading of anti- Americanism, denunciation of Israel and Zionism as the embodiments of terrorism, the appeals for the destruction of Israel, and the depiction of the future of Arab youths. The videos are on average three minutes long. The videos are usually professionally produced by the station itself and each usually takes about three to four days to make. The filler material usually consists of appeals to donate money to the Hezbollah, lists of demonstrations taking place worldwide, and slogans in English, Hebrew, or Arabic. The station also offers sports broadcasting - such as the programs Goal and Tis'in daqiqa (Ninety Minutes) -, family programming - such as Al-mustakshifoun al-judud (The New Explorers), Al-Muslimoun fi al-Sin (Muslims in China), and Ayday al- khayr (Hands of Benevolence) -, game shows - including Al-mushahid shahid (The Viewer Is the Witness), where contestants attempt to guess the names of Israeli political and military figures, and Al-muhima (The Mission) -, and even a children's program called Al-manr al-saghir (The Little Manar), which is in the style of the US show Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, targeting three- to seven-year-olds. Al-Manar also broadcasts Iranian soap operas, dubbed into Modern Standard Arabic. During Ramadan, al-Manar features special programs, many of which are self-produced. In 2001, Izz al-Din al-Qassam: Qisat al-jihad wa al-muqawama (Izz al-Din al-Qassam: A Story of Jihad and Resistance), a four-part drama based on the life of Izz al-Din al-Qassam, an early-twentieth- century Arab, after whom the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades are named. It was considered a success among Palestinians. The 2002 program Faris bi la jawad (A Knight without a Horse), which was produced by an Egyptian, was based on The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, an old Russian anti-Semitic text claiming a conspiracy of Jews control the world, like many programs of the station. The 29-part series Ash-Shatat (The Diaspora), which was aired in 2003, was also based on The Protocols and produced in Syria; it led to the banning of al- Manar in France.Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center at the Center for Special Studies: Legal proceedings to ban Al-Manar in France and Lebanon’s rushing to Hezbollah’s aid ===Religion=== Al-Manar was the first TV station to report Hezbollah's condemnation of the 11 September attacks. Other non- state attacks against the United States have also been condemned on Al-Manar, including the 2000 USS Cole bombing suicide attack against a US Navy destroyer. Al-Manar was once described as one of the channels, among other complex reasons, of the spread of Shiism in Syria in the years before 2009. Until the Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon, Al-Manar's programming political focus was mainly against the Israeli presence in Lebanon. While the withdrawal in May 2000 left a void in the station's programming, Hezbollah and A-Manar consider the Shebaa Farms to be Lebanese territory occupied by Israel, and this became a focal point for political programming. In September of that year, the al-Aqsa Intifada broke out, and Al-Manar began to cover the issue of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict more extensively, overtly propagandizing to support the Palestinian militants. == Journalistic standards and neutrality == According to Al Manar's news director, Hassan Fadlallah, Al Manar does not aim to be neutral in its broadcasting, \\"Neutrality like that of Al Jazeera is out of the question for us,\\" Fadlallah said. \\"We cover only the victim, not the aggressor. CNN is the Zionist news network, Al Jazeera is neutral, and Al Manar takes the side of the Palestinians...He said Al Manar's opposition to neutrality means that, unlike Al Jazeera, his station would never feature interviews or comments by Israeli officials. \\"We're not looking to interview Sharon,\\" Fadlallah said. \\"We want to get close to him in order to kill him.\\" ===Accusations and restrictions=== ====Designation as a 'terrorist entity'==== Al-Manar was placed on a US terrorist watchlist in December 2004. Reporters without Borders said that no evidence was presented of Al-Manar's involvement with terrorism. The main evidence provided for Al-Manar being anti-semitic was its partial showing, in October–November 2003, of the Syrian-produced 29-part series Ash-Shatat (\\"The Diaspora\\"). \\"Al Manar management apologized for airing the series, dropped it and explained that the Station had purchased it without first viewing the entire series.\\" Lebanon's ambassador to the United States, Farid Abboud, protested: \\"If you want simply to demonize or eliminate one side, you're not going to advance the issue. If you are going to focus on one side simply because of the political message, it's unacceptable and it's a grave breach of the freedom of speech.\\". In March 2006 Al-Manar was designated as a \\"Specially Designated Global Terrorist entity\\" by the United States, declaring it \\"owned or controlled by the Iran-funded Hezbollah terrorist network\\". As a result, Al-Manar was made subject to US sanctions. ====Allegations of anti-Semitic programming==== One of the satellite providers which has transmitted Al-Manar is the French satellite Hot Bird 4, owned by the Eutelsat Satellite organisation. On 13 December 2004, the French Conseil d'État, the highest administrative Court in France, ordered the French-based Eutelsat Company to shut down Al-Manar broadcasts following accusations that its programmes were anti-Semitic and could incite hatred.(full text of the decision , press release , in French; BBC report)EU, Brussels, 17 March 2005 EU Rules and Principles on Hate Broadcasts: Frequently Asked Questions Retrieved 26 July 2006 Al-Manar claims the French decision was political and not legal, influenced by Israel and Jewish lobbies.Al Jazeera, 27 December 2004 US designates Al-Manar TV 'terrorist' Retrieved 1 August 2006 ====Banning of broadcasts==== Al-Manar's broadcasts have been banned by the US, France, Spain, and Germany. After the U.S. Department of State placed Al-Manar on the Terrorist Exclusion List on 17 December 2004, transmissions to North America via Intelsat's satellites were blocked.Reuters, 18 December 2004 U.S. designates Al-Manar TV as 'terrorist' Retrieved 1 August 2006The Washington Times, 19 December 2004 Hezbollah's TV loses U.S. feed Retrieved 1 August 2006 Javed Iqbal, a resident of New York City is the first person to charged under this law. Iqbal, 45, a Pakistani who had been living in the U.S. for more than 25 years, was charged by federal prosecutors with providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization by broadcasting Al Manar to U.S. customers, in exchange for thousands of dollars payment. In a 2008 plea bargain, he agreed to serve a prison term of up to years. Saleh Elahwal, who also operates HDTV, was also charged and went on trial 5 January 2009.NY man pleads guilty to broadcasting Hezbollah TV, Reuters, 23 December 2008NYC man admits he helped air Hezbollah TV, Larry Neumeister, AP, 23 December 2008 Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, says it's constitutional for the government to outlaw businesses with direct operational ties to terrorist organizations, and media outlets that directly incite and direct violent action, but in this case, the government is trying to stop the spread of ideas.N.Y. Man Charged with Aiding Hezbollah TV Channel, NPR, Weekend Edition 27 August 2006, Liane Hansen, host. Mark Dubowitz, who founded the Coalition Against Terrorist Media to in part stop Al-Manar, said Al-Manar was shouting fire in a crowded theater, although Lieberman disagreed with that metaphor. The Dutch Media Authority \\"discovered that a satellite owned by New Skies Satellites was carrying Al-Manar and has ordered the company to stop doing so, because the channel did not have the required Dutch licence.\\"Al Jazeera, 17 March 2005 Al-Manar TV to go off Dutch platform Retrieved 30 July 2006Haaretz, 18 March 2005 EU blocks Hezbollah TV broadcasts in Europe Retrieved 30 July 2006 Many, including Radio Netherlands Worldwide Media Network consider this to be a ban. The Spanish authorities banned the retransmission of Al-Manar by Hispasat on 30 June 2005 (which effectively prevents its reception not only in the Iberian Peninsula but also in South America). The lack of transmission from Intelsat had the effect of making Al- Manar unavailable in Canada, which some have interpreted as a \\"ban\\". While Al- Manar is not approved for distribution in Canada, there is no record of application for approval having been made. TARBS World TV voluntarily stopped broadcasting al-Manar in Australia on 5 November 2003, 15 days into an investigation by the ABA regarding accusations of \\"broadcast programs that are likely to incite or perpetuate hatred against or gratuitously vilify any person or group on the basis of their ethnicity, nationality, race or religion\\". The report for this investigation was never finalised as TARBS had gone into receivership by that time. Al-Manar in August 2009 received approval for broadcast by Australian Communications and Media Authority. Al-Manar provides a live feed of its programming on the Internet through its website. This effectively circumvents the bans as Al-Manar is still available in all the areas it does not broadcast to via satellite. ===Google and Apple applications=== On 25 July 2012, Al Manar launched an application through Apple's iTunes app store, directing users to various content produced by the Hezbollah television station, including speeches by Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah. However, the application was subsequently pulled from iTunes four days later, and two days after that, Google announced that the al-Manar app had been removed from Google Play.Hezbollah TV app banned by Apple and Google by Gabe Fisher, Times of Israel, 1 August 2012. Maha Abouelenein, Head of Communications for the Mena at Google, subsequently stated that \\"We remove applications that violate our policies, such as apps that are illegal or that promote hate speech\\" although she added that \\"We don’t comment on individual applications – however, you can check out our policies for more.\\"Google and Apple ban web application for Hezbollah TV station Jumana Al Tamimi, Gulf News, 8 August 2012. Al Manar TV subsequently blamed \\"Israeli incitement against Al Manar TV\\" as the reason Al-Manar mobile apps were removed by Apple and Google. An Al-Manar TV reporter stated that: \\"Al Manar TV is once again targeted by America and Israel. The removal of the channel's mobile apps from the Google and Apple stores is a new attempt to curb Al-Manar's message of resistance. Al Manar TV Director-General Abdallah Qasir stated that the removal of the apps \\"indicates that Al Manar TV has the ability to cause great harm to Israel, and that Israel is extremely annoyed by Al Manar becoming so widespread and by its great credibility. Israel cannot even bear to see the Al-Manar icon on smartphones.\\" Abd Al-Hadi Mahfouz, president of the Lebanese National Media Council, also supported Al-Manar, arguing that: \\"This move contradicts all laws pertaining to radio and television, to the exercising of media liberties, and to the right of citizens, Western and Arab alike, to information.\\" Rabi' Al-Ba'lbaki, the head of the Lebanese IT Association reportedly called for a boycott of Apple and Google if they do not restore service for Al-Manar's applications.Hizbullah's Al-Manar TV after Google and Apple Banned Its Apps: We Will Find Other Ways to Deliver \\"Message of Resistance\\", MEMRITV, Clip No. 3517 (transcript), 2 August 2012.

In an effort to avoid distributor policies and control, the new applications are downloadable directly from Al-Manar's website, which is hosted British server. The website also provides instructions, along with screen shots, on configuring Android phones to accept applications \\"not sourced in Android Market\\" and for installing the application on iPhones.

Upper Black Eddy is officially part of Bridgeton Township which also borders the adjacent Borough of Milford, Hunterdon County, New Jersey via the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission's free Upper Black Eddy- Milford Bridge over the Delaware River. ==History== Upper Black Eddy originates from the Black family who operated a hotel at this point of Delaware River and did share part of its unique name with the former village of (Lower Black Eddy) now known as Point Pleasant, Pennsylvania. The village's growth in the early 19th century was due to the opening of the Pennsylvania Canal passing through the village as a result canal-related businesses sprang up quickly, including a shipyard, mule stables, general store and several hotels; the most notable was the Upper Black Eddy Inn. This was later transformed into Chef Tell's Manor House, which closed in 2004 and demolished in 2010. The Upper Black Eddy portion of the Pennsylvania Canal was also known as \\"Candy Bend\\". Origins of that name are unknown but local lore suggests that the Upper Black Eddy Inn also operated as a brothel, and a popular stop for \\"candy\\" - a slang term of the time for a prostitute. There is no conclusive evidence to validate this local lore. Upper Black Eddy has two notable geographic features: 1: Ringing Rocks Park. This is a 4-acre (16,000 m²) boulder field of weathered Diabase rocks, some of which \\"ring\\" much like a bell when struck with a hammer. This park also includes Buck County's highest waterfall situated on High Rocks Creek. 2: Nockamixon Cliffs. 400 foot shale cliffs overlooking the Delaware River is located within the Delaware Canal State Park. ==Businesses== Homestead General Store, the oldest continually operating general store on the Delaware Canal is located in Upper Black Eddy along with Homestead Coffee Roasters, an artisan coffee roaster specializing in organic and fair trade coffee. The Bridgeton House on the Delaware, a B&B; inn, which opened in 1981, continues the tradition of lodging on the Delaware. Upper Black Eddy was supposedly a favored vacation spot for President Grover Cleveland due to his love for fishing. The Narrows Restaurant opened on River Road in April 2019. Upper Black Eddy is also home to Ajiri Tea, a not-for- profit company that supports education in western Kenya. 100% of netprofits of the company are donated to pay school fees for orphan education in Kisii, Kenya.

It is designed to try to move the poor population from favelas (shanty towns), where one quarter of people in São Paulo now live, into more permanent structures. This approach mimicked that of the Housing Development Board (HDB) in Singapore (where over 80% of the population lives in HDB-developed public housing), hence the name Cingapura (\\"Singapore\\"). These structures are often called 'superblocks'. They were intended to have a supply of electricity, a good water supply and sewer pipes. On top of this, residential security guards were to be employed to reduce crimes which were and are rife throughout the favelas in Brazil. Much of the work was to be done by the residents of the favelas themselves, the project being dubbed a 'self-help' project. The existing favelas were to be cleared and building materials provided for the builders for free. One of the major difficulties in building on the sites of the favelas was the large slopes on which they are built. This difficult terrain was the only reason the owners of the land did not use it. Levelling the land was very expensive and eventually proved too expensive; only a tenth of the proposed apartments were completed, with the focus being on residents living on marginal land, like floodplains. Some residents are not happy with the way the project has developed. Many of the towers were not completed, leaving a skyline of half-finished buildings and empty shacks. Some residents are very frustrated at the way the government have treated them. Many have moved away, or committed suicide. Also, many artisans who could practice their craft in a more free environment could not do so, as the buildings were closely controlled by the owners. Those that were built were not very successful, as many of the families from the favelas found that the new apartments were too much of a change of environment. They did not like the fact they couldn't extend on their new apartments, and many attempted to bring their livestock into the flats. Only 14,000 of the 140,000 projected apartments were actually built. Recently, a reported 6,000 apartments are likely to be built. ==See also== * Public housing in Singapore * Favela * Urban renewal * Gentrification ==References== ==External links== * The first world is here by Elma-Lia Nascimento, 13 May 2005 *Pictures Category:Geography of São Paulo Category:Public housing Category:Unfinished buildings and structures Category:Welfare in Brazil Category:Housing organizations ","title":"Cingapura project"},{"id":"1277180","text":"Terri Kathleen Nunn (born June 26, 1961) is an American singer and actress. She is best known as the vocalist for the new wave/synthpop band she fronts, Berlin, and is also known by that band name. ==Biography== Nunn was born in Los Angeles, California. Her father Larry Nunn (1925–1974) was a painter and a former contract child actor for MGM (Men of Boys Town, The Major and the Minor). He was an alcoholic and died from suicide when she was 13 years old. In 1976, Nunn auditioned for the role of Princess Leia in Star Wars,. but the role went to Carrie Fisher. In 1977, she posed, under the name Betsy Harris, for nude photos for the February issue of Penthouse. For many years, Nunn denied that the photos were of her, because when they were taken she was only sixteen and still legally a minor. She joined Berlin in 1978 and temporarily left the group the following year to pursue an acting career. Nunn acted in numerous television shows in the 1970s and 1980s, including T.J. Hooker, Lou Grant and James at 15. In 1981, she rejoined Berlin as the lead vocalist and soon forged her recording career in the band. Her greatest success in Berlin was the top-selling 1986 single \\"Take My Breath Away\\", the theme song for the film Top Gun. It reached the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100. She sang other popular songs with Berlin, including \\"Sex (I'm A...)\\", \\"The Metro\\", \\"You Don't Know\\", \\"No More Words\\", “Love Life” and \\"Masquerade\\". In 1985, Nunn briefly dated Michael Hutchence, whom she met at an INXS concert in London while Berlin were recording the album Count Three & Pray. The relationship ended when INXS returned to Australia. In 1985, Nunn left Berlin and recorded the song \\"Dancing in Isolation\\" for the film Better Off Dead. In 1989, she performed a duet with Paul Carrack called \\"Romance\\", which was included on the soundtrack to the film Sing. In 1991, she recorded and released a solo album entitled Moment of Truth, in association with David Z, Prince's Paisley Park producer.. In 1993, she approached lead singer Andrew Eldritch of The Sisters of Mercy with a song idea and collaborated with him on \\"Under the Gun\\". Nunn obtained usage rights to the band name \\"Berlin\\" in 1996, and reformed that band with new members, who began recording and touring. Berlin released two EPs Fall into Heaven and Fall into Heaven 2 in 1999, followed by Live: Sacred and Profane in 2000, their first live album. Voyeur hit shelves in 2002. 4Play (2005) contains original songs and cover versions of some of the band's songs. In 2003, Berlin’s original lineup reunited for the VH1 series \\"Bands Reunited\\". In 2008, Nunn contributed sex and dating advice to Carrie Borzillo- Vrenna's book Cherry Bomb. Nunn sang across the United States on the 2009 Regeneration Tour, which also featured Martin Fry of ABC, Wang Chung, and Cutting Crew. In 2010, Nunn appeared as a guest judge on season two of RuPaul's Drag Race, mentoring the contestants in a rock-themed singing challenge. Nunn co-hosts Between the Sheets, a popular podcast on webcast media station Hottalkla.com. In January 2012, Nunn debuted her radio show on KCSN-FM. It features interviews and live performances.. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Nunn among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. === Personal life === Nunn is married to attorney Paul Spear. She has one daughter and two stepsons. The family has lived in Santa Rosa Valley, California since 2012. Pamela Moore, also a singer, is Nunn's cousin.

Each game is a series of 26 turns, keyed to the letters of the alphabet from A to Z. On the first turn, each player must write an Encyclopedia-style entry beginning with the letter A, citing and linking to two entries that are not yet written. These are called \\"undefined\\" entries. Undefined entries must begin with a letter later in the alphabet. The 25 subsequent turns proceed consecutively through the letters of the alphabet, one letter per turn. In a turn, each player writes one entry that begins with the turn's specified letter. If one or more undefined entries are available that begin with the letter, a player must choose and write an undefined entry before any new entries can be created under that letter. A new entry must create and link to two undefined entries, and must also link to an entry written on a previous turn. Near the endgame, when sufficient undefined entries exist to occupy all players for the remainder of the game, no new undefined entries may be created. Many variants exist, such as covering two or three letters per turn, or starting each player on a different letter. Some games permit other players to post comments or expansions of earlier entries. The optional \\"Rule of X\\" treats X (or any other appropriate letter) as a wild card; entries for the X turn may begin with any letter. \\"Telephone pad\\" is a shorter variant with 8 turns (corresponding to the letters on a telephone keypad) instead of 26 turns (one per letter of the alphabet). == See also == * Epic Legends Of The Hierarchs: The Elemenstor Saga ==References== == External links == * Lexicon: An RPG -- the original idea for Lexicon. * Lexicon Rules -- A collection and clarification of the original rules, combined with a compilation of almost every variant. * An (old) list of Lexicon games * The New Metamorphoses: A Lexicon Category:Collaborative fiction Category:Indie role-playing games Category:Universal role-playing games Category:Role-playing games introduced in 2003 ","title":"Lexicon (game)"},{"id":"1277186","text":"Robert Stanbury \\"Buster\\" Olney III (born February 17, 1964) is an American columnist for ESPN: The Magazine, ESPN.com, and covered the New York Giants and New York Yankees for The New York Times. He is also a regular analyst for the ESPN's Baseball Tonight. He also hosts ESPN's Baseball Tonight daily podcast. ==Early life and education== Olney grew up on a dairy farm in Randolph Center, Vermont, which came in handy when he served as the \\"Cow Insider\\" for Mike Greenberg's milking of a cow on Mike and Mike in the Morning on June 21, 2007. He was educated at Northfield Mount Hermon School and Vanderbilt University, where he majored in history. As a child Buster was an avid baseball fan. At age 8, he developed an affinity for the Los Angeles Dodgers after reading a book about Sandy Koufax. Buster would later attribute his fanship as a reason for his journalistic career. ==Journalism career== ===Print=== After graduation, Olney began covering baseball in 1989, as the Nashville Banner's beat reporter assigned to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds. While in Nashville, he formed a close relationship with the legendary Don Meyer, Head Coach of the men's basketball program at David Lipscomb University. He later worked at the San Diego Union-Tribune and The Baltimore Sun. He arrived at the Times in 1997 and in his first year won an Associated Press award. During one of his first assignments in Nashville, the Sounds hosted the Columbus Clippers who, at the time, were the AAA affiliate of the New York Yankees. Olney almost had a minor confrontation with a Yankee prospect at the time known more for his football play, Deion Sanders. Olney had attempted to do a piece on Sanders, but was blown off. In return, Olney wrote what he called later in his career an unflattering piece on Sanders.

The connection between Islam and Saudi Arabia (or at least the western Hejaz region of the country) is uniquely strong. The kingdom, which sometimes is called the \\"home of Islam\\", is the location of the cities of Mecca and Medina, where Muhammad, the messenger of the Islamic faith, lived and died, and attracts millions of Muslim Hajj pilgrims annually, and thousands of clerics and students who come from across the Muslim world to study. The official title of the King of Saudi Arabia is \\"Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\\"—the two being Al-Masjid al-Haram in Mecca and Al-Masjid al-Nabawi in Medina—which are considered the holiest in Islam. In the 18th century, a pact between Islamic preacher Muhammad ibn Abd al- Wahhab and a regional emir, Muhammad bin Saud, brought a fiercely puritanical strain of Sunni Islam first to the Najd region and then to the Arabian Peninsula. Referred to by supporters as \\"Salafism\\" and by others as \\"Wahhabism\\", this interpretation of Islam became the state religion and interpretation of Islam espoused by Muhammad bin Saud and his successors (the Al Saud family), who eventually created the modern kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932. The Saudi government has spent tens of billions of dollars of its petroleum export revenue throughout the Islamic world and elsewhere on building mosques, publishing books, giving scholarships and fellowships,Kepel, Gilles (2002). Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam. trans. Anthony F. Roberts, p.72 hosting international Islamic organisations, and promoting its form of Islam, sometimes referred to as \\"petro-Islam\\". Whether Salafis/Wahhabis are a majority in Saudi Arabia is disputed, with one estimate putting their number at only 22.9% of the native population (concentrated in Najd). The Wahhabi mission has been dominant in Najd for two hundred years, but in most other parts of the country—Hejaz, the Eastern Province, Najran—it has dominated only since 1913–1925. Most of the 15 to 20 million Saudi citizens are Sunni Muslims, while the eastern regions are populated mostly by Twelver Shia, and there are Zaydi Shia in the southern regions. According to a number of sources, only a minority of Saudis consider themselves Wahhabis, although according to other sources, the Wahhabi affiliation is up to 40%, making it a very dominant minority, at the very least using a native population of 17 million based on \\"2008-9 estimates\\". In addition, the next largest affiliation is with Salafism, which encompasses all of the central principles of Wahhabism, with a number of minor additional accepted principles differentiating the two. Public worship and proselytising by non-Muslims in Saudi Arabia, including the distribution of non-Muslim religious materials (such as the Bible), is illegal.World Report 2018: Saudi Arabia. Retrieved February 3, 2018. ==History== The Islamic prophet, Muhammad, was born in Mecca in about 571. From the early 7th century, Muhammad united the various tribes of the peninsula and created a single Islamic religious polity. Following his death in 632, his followers rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim rule beyond Arabia, conquering huge swathes of territory. Although Arabia soon became a politically peripheral region as the focus shifted to the more developed conquered lands, Mecca and Medina remained the spiritually most important places in the Muslim world. The Qur'an requires every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it, as one of the five pillars of Islam, to make a pilgrimage, or Hajj, to Mecca during the Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah at least once in his or her lifetime.Farah, Caesar (1994). Islam: Beliefs and Observances (5th ed.), pp.145–147 From the 9th century, a number of Shia sects developed particularly in the eastern part of Arabia. These included the Qarmatians, a millenarian Ismaili sect led by Abū-Tāhir Al-Jannābī who attacked and sacked Mecca in 930. ===Al Saud and ibn Abd al-Wahhab=== In 1744, in the desert region of Nejd, Muhammad bin Saud, founder of the Al Saud dynasty, joined forces with the religious leader Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab. Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab was the founder of the Wahhabi movement, a strict puritanical form of Sunni Islam. This alliance formed in the 18th century provided the ideological impetus to Saudi expansion and remains the basis of Saudi Arabian dynastic rule today. The first \\"Saudi state\\" established in 1744 in the area around Riyadh, rapidly expanded and briefly controlled most of the present-day territory of Saudi Arabia,\\"Reining in Riyadh\\" by D. Gold, 6 April 2003, NYpost (JCPA) but was destroyed by 1818 by the Ottoman viceroy of Egypt, Mohammed Ali Pasha.\\"The Saud Family and Wahhabi Islam\\". Library of Congress Country Studies. In 1824, a much smaller second \\"Saudi state\\", located mainly in Nejd, was established in 1824, but by 1891 its Al Saud rulers were driven into exile in Kuwait. At the beginning of the 20th century, a third attempt was made to conquer this territory by another Al-Saud, Abdulaziz Ibn Saud. He gained the support of the Ikhwan, a tribal army inspired by Wahhabism and led by Sultan ibn Bijad and Faisal Al-Dawish, which had grown quickly after its foundation in 1912. With the aid of the Ikhwan, Ibn Saud captured al-Hasa from the Ottoman Empire in 1913. Ibn Saud defeated a rival ruling family and took the title Sultan of Nejd in 1921. By this time the Ottomans had been defeated in World War I, and Ottoman suzerainty and control in Arabia was no more. With the help of the Ikhwan, the Hejaz was conquered in 1924–25. Following this victory however the Ikhwan clashed with Ibn Saud. He opposed their raiding the British protectorates of Transjordan, Iraq and Kuwait, to expand of the Wahhabist realm, and they opposed his policies of allowing some modernization and some non-Muslim foreigners in the country. The Ikhwan were defeated and their leaders executed in 1930 after a two-year struggle. In 1932 the two kingdoms of the Hejaz and Nejd were united as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. === Era of oil exports === Oil was discovered in the Persian Gulf region of Saudi Arabia in 1938, and oil wells eventually revealing the largest source of crude oil in the world. For the king, oil revenues became a crucial source of wealth since he no longer had to rely on receipts from pilgrimages to Mecca. This discovery would alter Middle Eastern political relations forever. During the 1960s and '70s, religious authorities allowed some practices that had previously been forbidden (haram). At the urging of the government and after vigorous debate, religious authorities allowed the use of paper money in 1951, abolished slavery in 1962, permitted the education of females in 1964, and use of television in 1965. By the 1970s, as a result of oil wealth and government modernization policies, economic and social development progressed at an extremely rapid rate, transforming the infrastructure and educational system of the country; in foreign policy, close ties with the US were developed. By 1976 Saudi Arabia had become the largest oil producer in the world. The power of the ulema was in decline. However, in the 1980s and 1990s, this trend was reversed. In 1979, the modernizing monarch of Iran, despite his oil revenues and apparently formidable security apparatus, was overthrown by an Islamic revolution. The new revolutionary Islamic Republic was across the Persian Gulf from Saudi oil fields and across from where most of Saudi Arabia's minority Shiites—co-religionists of Iran who also often worked in the oil industry—lived. There were several anti-government uprisings in the region in 1979 and 1980. Also alarming to the government was the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Islamist extremists. The militants involved were in part angered by what they considered to be the corruption and un-Islamic nature of the Saudi government, proclaimed the return of the Mahdi. The takeover and siege of the mosque lasted for nearly two weeks, during which the mosque was severely damaged and several hundred militants, soldiers, and hostages were killed. In response the royal family enforced much stricter observances of traditional religious and social norms in the country and gave the Ulema a greater role in government. First photographs of women in newspapers were banned, then women on television. Cinemas and music shops were shut down. School curriculum was changed to provide many more hours of religious studies, eliminating classes on subjects like non-Islamic history. Gender segregation was extended \\"to the humblest coffee shop\\". The religious police became more assertive. Greater emphasis was put on religion in the media (increased religious programming on television and radio, and an increase in articles about religion in newspapers), in individual behavior, in government policies, in mosque sermons. In 1986 King Fahd replaced his title \\"His Majesty\\" with \\"Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\\". The ulema's powers and financial support were strengthened in particular, they were given greater control over the education system and allowed to enforce stricter observance of Wahhabi rules of moral and social behaviour. These policies did not succeed in dampening the growth and strength of religious conservatives dissatisfied with the royal family. Saudi Islamism gained momentum following 1991 Gulf War. The presence of U.S. troops on Saudi soil from 1991 onwards was deeply unpopular with conservative Saudis and one of the major issues that has led to an increase in Islamist terrorism by Saudis inside and out of Saudi Arabia, (the 9/11 attacks in New York being the most prominent example). Islamist terrorist activity increased dramatically in 2003, with the Riyadh compound bombings and other attacks, which prompted the government to take much more stringent action against terrorism. The king (Abdullah) has also taken steps to rein back the powers of the ulema, for instance transferring their control over girls' education to the Ministry of Education. Some have complained that the king's dominance over the ulema has weakened the traditional Islamic legitimacy of Saudi throne. ==Current position== ===Role in the state and society=== The Qur'an, declared by the country's Basic Law to be Saudi Arabia's constitution Islam plays a central role in Saudi society. It has been said that Islam is more than a religion, it is a way of life in Saudi Arabia, and, as a result, the influence of the ulema, the religious establishment, is all-pervasive. Article one of the 1992 Saudi \\"Basic Law of Governance\\" states, > The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a sovereign Arab Islamic State. Its religion > is Islam. Its constitution is Almighty God's Book, The Holy Qur'an, and the > Sunna (Traditions) of the Prophet (PBUH). Arabic is the language of the > Kingdom. Unlike most Muslim countries, Saudi Arabia gives the ulema direct involvement in government, and fields a specifically \\"religious\\" police force, called the Haia. (Iran gives the ulema much more influence and also has a religious police.) According to Robert Baer, this power is only over certain sectors of governance. The founder of Saudi Arabia, Ibn Saud, established a division of power (according to Baer) with the Wahhabi religious establishment in 1932. In \\"return for allowing it control of the mosques, culture, and education\\", the ulema or religious establishment \\"would never go near core political issues, such as royal succession, foreign policy, and the armed forces.\\" This agreement has \\"been more or less respected\\" since 1932. Historians note that in his alliance with the House of Saud, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab called for the state to have an \\"imam\\" (religious leader, himself) and an \\"emir\\" (military leader, Ibn Saud). However, the third head of the House of Saud used the title \\"Imam\\", and Saudi kings have served in this role since. A Council of Senior Scholars, appointed and paid by the government advises the king on religious matters. The ulema have also been a key influence in major government decisions, have a significant role in the judicial and education systems and a monopoly of authority in the sphere of religious and social morals. Not only is the succession to the throne subject to the approval of the ulema, but so are all new laws (royal decrees). The religious police or Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice numbers 3,500-4,000. Members patrol the streets enforcing dress codes, strict separation of men and women, salat prayer by Muslims during prayer times, investigating reports of witchcraft, and other behavior it believes to be commanded or forbidden by Islam. Daily life in Saudi Arabia is dominated by Islamic observance. Five times each day, Muslims are called to prayer from the minarets of mosques scattered throughout the country. Because Friday is the holiest day for Muslims, the weekend begins on Thursday.Sulaiman, Tosin. Bahrain changes the weekend in efficiency drive, The Times, 2 August 2006. Retrieved 25 June 2008. Turkey has a weekend on Saturday and Sunday In accordance with Salafi doctrine, only two religious holidays are publicly recognized, Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. Celebration of other Islamic holidays, such as the Prophet's birthday and Day of Ashura are tolerated only when celebrated locally and on a small scale. Public observance of non-Islamic religious holidays is prohibited, with the exception of 23 September, which commemorates the unification of the kingdom. no mention of holidays Conformity of behavior is highly valued as part of religion, apparent in sameness of dress. Almost all women wear a loose-fitting black abaya cloak covering all but their eyes and hands, almost all men wear a white thawb with a red and white checkered headdress. Sharia, or Islamic law, is the basis of the legal system in Saudi Arabia. It is unique not only compared to Western systems, but also compared to other Muslim countries, as (according to its supporters) the Saudi model is closest to the form of law originally developed when Islam became established in the Arabian peninsula in the 7th century. The Saudi courts impose a number of severe physical punishments. The death penalty can be imposed for a wide range of offences including murder, rape, armed robbery, repeated drug use, apostasy, adultery, witchcraft and sorcery and can be carried out by beheading with a sword, stoning or firing squad, followed by crucifixion. === Wahhabism=== Many of the strict and unique practices in Saudi Arabia mentioned above come from Wahhabism, the official and dominant form of Sunni Islam in Saudi Arabia, named after the preacher and scholar Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab. Proponents consider the name derogatory, preferring the term Salafiyya, after the early Muslims known as the Salaf.The Daily Star Lamine Chikhi. 27 11 2010. This interpretation is often described as 'puritanical', 'intolerant' or 'ultra-conservative', however proponents believe its teachings seek to purify the practise of Islam of any innovations or practices that deviate from the seventh-century teachings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his companions.'The Islamic Traditions of Wahhabism and Salafiyya', US Congressional Research Service Report, 2008, by Christopher M. Blanchard available from the Federation of American Scientists website. According to one anti-Wahhabi source (Stephen Schwartz), \\"no more than\\" 40% of Saudi nationals consider themselves Wahhabis. The message of the school was the essential oneness of God (tawhid). The movement is therefore known by its adherents as ad dawa lil tawhid (the call to unity), and those who follow the call are known as ahl at tawhid (the people of unity) or muwahhidun (unitarians). The school puts an emphasis on following of the Athari school of thought. Ibn Abd- al-Wahhab, was influenced by the writings of Ibn Taymiyya and questioned the philosophical interpretations of Islam within the Ash'ari and Maturidi schools, claiming to rely on the Qur'an and the Hadith without speculative philosophy so as to not transgress beyond the limits of the early Muslims known as the Salaf. Ibn Abd-al-Wahhab attacked a \\"perceived moral decline and political weakness\\" in the Arabian Peninsula and condemned what he perceived as idolatry, the popular cult of saints, and shrine and tomb visitation. In the 1990s, Saudi leadership did not emphasize its identity as inheritor of the Wahhabi legacy as such, nor did the descendants of Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab, the Al ash Shaykh, continue to hold the highest posts in the religious bureaucracy. Wahhabi influence in Saudi Arabia, however, remained tangible in the physical conformity in dress, in public deportment, and in public prayer. Most significantly, the Wahhabi legacy was manifest in the social ethos that presumed government responsibility for the collective moral ordering of society, from the behavior of individuals, to institutions, to businesses, to the government itself. ===Non Salafi=== The Wahhabi mission has been dominant in most of the central region of Najd—its \\"heartland\\"—for two hundred years, but in most other parts of the country it has dominated only since 1913–1925. The eastern region has many Twelver Shias, the southern regions of Saudi Arabia has many Zaydi Shias. The hijaz region has long had a more pluralistic tradition. The southwest region of Asir is known for its followers of a local leader, Idris, revered by many as a Sufi saint, a concept which Wahhbism opposes. According to one estimate by Michael Mehrdad Izady, \\"using cultural and not confessional criteria\\", there are 4.3 million (25%) Shia, 4 million (23%) Wahhabi, 9 million (52%) non-Wahhabi Sunnis in Saudi Arabia Two critics of Wahhabism (Ali Al-Ahmed and Stephen Schwartz), also give a relatively high estimate of the non-Wahhabi population of Saudi Arabia—over 60%. ==== Sunnism ==== Although Wahabism is a strand of Sunni Islam, the promotion of non- Salafi-Sunnism is restricted.Robert Murray Thomas Religion in Schools: Controversies Around the World Greenwood Publishing Group 2006 page 180 ==== Shia Islam ==== An estimated 15%Saudi Arabia's Shia press for rights bbcby Anees al-Qudaihi  24 March 2009Council on Foreign Relations Author: Lionel Beehner June 16, 2006 of citizens in Saudi Arabia are Shia Muslims, most of whom are adherents to Twelver Shia Islam. Twelvers are predominantly represented by the Baharna community living in the Eastern Province, with the largest concentrations in Qatif, al-Hasa, and Dammam. In addition there is a small Twelver Shia minority in Medina (called the Nakhawila). Sizable Zaydi and Isma'ili communities also live in Najran along the border with Yemen. Shia, human rights groups and other observers have complained of \\"systematic discrimination\\" of Shia in Saudi Arabia \\"in religion, education, justice, and employment\\".Saudi Arabia: Treat Shia Equallyhrw.org 2009/09/02 Unlike other countries with sizable Shia populations (such as Iraq and Lebanon), Saudi Arabia has no Shia cabinet ministers, mayors or police chiefs. Shia are kept out of \\"critical jobs\\" in the armed forces and the security services, and not one of the three hundred Shia girls’ schools in the Eastern Province has a Shia principal.Nasr, Vali, The Shia Revival: How Conflicts within Islam Will Shape the Future, W. W. Norton & Company; 2006, p.236see also: ( In the Eastern provinces of Saudi Arabia there are Shia courts who deal with cases such as marriage, divorce and inheritance.Saudi Arabia, Precarious Justice: Volume 20 - Page 133, Human Rights Watch - 2008 Shia demonstrations in Qatif have sometimes led to conflict with Sunni Saudi religious authorities who disapprove of Shia commemorations marking the martyrdom of Hussein ibn Ali by the Sunni Caliph Yazid I. There also Shias living in Southern Saudi Arabia, who are mostly from the Zaydi branch.Saudi Arabia and the New Strategic Landscape - Page 30 ====Ahmadiyya==== Ahmadiyya is a small persecuted Islamic sect in Saudi Arabia. There are \\"no accurate figures\\" for the number of Ahmadi in Saudi Arabia. Ahmadis are officially banned from entering the country and are barred from performing the pilgrimage to Mecca. This has led to criticisms from multiple human rights organizations. They are primarily foreign workers from India and Pakistan and some from other countries. An increasing number of Saudi citizens identify as Ahmadis. Since the Ahmadiyya faith is banned in the country, there are no Ahmadi mosques. Ahmadis generally gather together in private properties for their daily prayers, thereby limiting exposure to the local authorities. From the very early history of the Ahmadiyya Movement in the 19th century, Ahmadis have had contact with the region in what were then a number of Ottoman provinces in the Arabian peninsula, primarily due to their spiritual connection to the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina. ===Islamic pilgrimage=== Saudi Arabia, and specifically Mecca and Medina, in HejazArabia: the Cradle of Islam, 1900, S.M.Zwemmer are the cradle of Islam, and the pilgrimage destinations for large numbers of Muslims from across the Islamic world.Goldschmidt, Jr., Arthur; Lawrence Davidson (2005). A Concise History of the Middle East (8th ed.), p.48 One of the King's titles is Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, the two mosques being Al-Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, which contains Islam's most sacred place (the Kaaba) and Al-Masjid an-Nabawi in Medina which contains Muhammad's tomb.Saudi Embassy (US) website – Islam Retrieved 20 January 2011Saudi Embassy (US) website – Guardian of the Holy Places Retrieved 20 January 2011 The Hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca, occurs annually between the first and tenth days of the last month of the Muslim year, Dhul Hajj. The Hajj represents the culmination of the Muslim's spiritual life. For many, it is a lifelong ambition. From the time of embarking on the journey to make the Hajj, pilgrims often experience a spirit of exaltation and excitement; the meeting of so many Muslims of all races, cultures, and stations in life in harmony and equality moves many people deeply. Certain rites of pilgrimage may be performed any time, and although meritorious, these constitute a lesser pilgrimage, known as umrah. Pilgrims in the annual Hajj at the Kaaba in Mecca. The Ministry of Pilgrimage Affairs and Religious Trusts handles the immense logistical and administrative problems generated by such a huge international gathering. The government issues special pilgrimage visas that permit the pilgrim to visit Mecca and to make the customary excursion to Medina to visit the Prophet's tomb. Care is taken to assure that pilgrims do not remain in the kingdom after the Hajj to search for work. An elaborate guild of specialists assists the Hajjis. Guides (mutawwifs) who speak the pilgrim's language make the necessary arrangements in Mecca and instruct the pilgrim in the proper performance of rituals; assistants (wakils) provide subsidiary services. Separate groups of specialists take care of pilgrims in Medina and Jiddah. Water drawers (zamzamis) provide water drawn from the sacred well. Since the late 1980s, the Saudis have been particularly energetic in catering to the needs of pilgrims. In 1988, a US$15 billion traffic improvement scheme for the holy sites was launched. The improvement initiative resulted partly from Iranian charges that the Saudi government was incompetent to guard the holy sites after a 1987 clash between demonstrating Iranian pilgrims and Saudi police left 400 people dead. A further disaster occurred in 1990, when 1,426 pilgrims suffocated or were crushed to death in one of the new air-conditioned pedestrian tunnels built to shield pilgrims from the heat. The incident resulted from the panic that erupted in the overcrowded and inadequately ventilated tunnel, and further fueled Iranian claims that the Saudis did not deserve to be in sole charge of the holy places. In 1992, however, 114,000 Iranian pilgrims, close to the usual level, participated in the Hajj. ==Islam and politics== ===Islamic legitimacy=== The religious establishment in Saudi Arabia, led by the Al ash-Sheikh, which influences almost every aspect of social life, is deeply involved in politics. It has long been fractured into at least two distinct groups, with the senior ulema closely tied to the political agenda of the House of Saud. A younger generation of ulema, who are less firmly established and more radical in tone, have openly criticized the senior ulema and the government in the past. > Fractures between the government and this younger generation deepened in May > 2003, when Riyadh fired or suspended thousands of > them.http://www.stratfor.com/dissident_saudi_clerics_weaken_riyadh dead link > Many were to be \\"re-educated,\\" while others were simply ousted from the > religious establishment.

The Islamic Legitimacy of the modern Saudi state has been questioned by many radical Islamist groups and individuals including Al-Qaeda.Video: As-Sahab media, \\"Knowledge is for acting upon\\" Saudi Arabia's grand mufti, Sheikh Abdul-Aziz ibn Abdullah Al ash-Sheikh, has defended the religious establishment's legitimacy in a public forum, while responding to mounting criticism of the religious leadership's close political alliance with the ruling House of Saud. During a question-and-answer session with members of the public and the media, Al Al-Sheikh denied that the government influenced fatwas (religious rulings) and said accusations to the contrary within the media were false: > Both the criticism and the public response to it indicate a deepening level > of dissent, not only within the kingdom's religious establishment, but also > among the public.

Intertie; nickname: Inga–Shaba and also referred to as Inga–Kolwezi) is a -long high-voltage direct current overhead electric power transmission line in the Democratic Republic of Congo, linking the Inga hydroelectric complex at the mouth of the Congo River to mineral fields in Shaba (Katanga).Compendium of HVDC schemes, CIGRÉ Technical Brochure No. 003, 1987, pp136-141. It was primarily constructed by Morrison-Knudsen International, an American engineering company, with the converter equipment supplied by ASEA. Construction was completed in 1982 and it cost US$900 million. The scheme was, for many years, the longest HVDC line in the world. ==History== The Inga–Shaba HVDC represented one of the United States' most important third world commitments of the 1970s and 1980s. However, construction progress was plagued by rebel insurgency in Southern Zaire, massive logistical challenges, large cost overruns, and financing delays. By utilizing the hydroelectric potential of the Inga Dam and by constructing one switching station near Kinshasa at Selo, the Government of Zaire under Mobutu Sese Seko was theoretically able to control the flow of power to secession-prone Katanga, then Shaba, province, but never actually exercised this option. It was reported in La Libre Belgique, a Brussels newspaper, that Tractionel, a Belgian electrical contractor, had argued that more economical alternatives were available nearer Shaba, using low-head generator plants, but had been overlooked in favor of the American consortium, consisting of Morrison-Knudsen International as a prime contractor, and Swedish ASEA, Italian Sadelmi-Cogepi and Irish GE subsidiary as sub-contractors. The project was initially conceived as a US$250 million contract - but cost overruns, partly due to unanticipated armed conflict in Shaba Province, pushed the final price up over US$1 billion, with unofficial estimates ranging as high as US$1.3 billion, inclusive of a comprehensive Operations and Maintenance Contract.U.S. State Department, Zaire Desk, circa 1985 Construction of the Inga–Shaba Project provided the Ministry of Energy and the Société nationale d'électricité (SNEL), with the means to promote further development activity throughout Zaire, by attracting potential investors and overseas firms; however, there have been suggestions that well- placed officials in the Mobutu government may have accepted gratuities at various critical junctures during the construction phase.Nzongola-Ntalaja, G., 2002, and Kwitny, J.,1984 As the Republic became more indebted to overseas financial entities, the Inga–Shaba Project ultimately accounted for approximately 20% of the former Zaire's debt burden, the total amount of which was $5 billion at the time, according to a variety of credible sources. ==Route== The ten-year project entailed design and construction of a electrical transmission line from Inga () at the mouth of the Congo River, specifically from the Inga Dam, one of Africa's three largest hydroelectric complexes, to the distant copper mining region then known as Shaba, today Katanga. It featured switching stations at Selo (near Kinshasa) (), Kikwit (), Kananga () and Kamina (), prior to delivering power to the Kolwezi Inverter Station().Technical Reports, MKI, 1975-1985 == Electrodes == The electrode for the Inga static inverter plant is situated 39 kilometres away from the station at and designed as linear ground electrode with a resistance of 0.24 ohm, while the electrode of Kolwezi static inverter plant, which is situated 11 kilometres away from the station at is designed as three-legged ground star electrode with a resistance of 0.14 ohm. ==Technology== This scheme, equipped from the outset with thyristor valves provided by Swedish subcontractor ASEA, was designed to transmit 560 megawatts, in the first phase, at a symmetrical bipolar voltage of ±500 kilovolts. Although not the first 500 kV HVDC project in operation (the ±533 kV Cahora Bassa scheme having been completed in 1977) it was the first such scheme to use only a single twelve-pulse bridge per pole. Consequently, its thyristor valves were the highest-rated in the world (in terms of voltage) at the time and remained so until the completion, in 2007, of the ±450 kV, single-converter NorNed scheme.Skog, J.E., van Asten, H., Worzyk, T., Andersrød, T., Norned – World’s longest power cable, CIGRÉ session, Paris, 2010, paper reference B1-106. The thyristor valves for Inga Shaba had 258 thyristors in series in each valve and were air-insulated and air-cooled. Inga Shaba was the longest HVDC transmission line in service until 2010, when it was overtaken by the 2071 km, ±800 kV, 6400 MW HVDC link from Xiangjiaba Dam to Shanghai in China. Because the line runs through relatively inaccessible terrain, an unusually broad right-of-way was cleared, at considerable expense, to ensure tower integrity. The line operated initially at only 10% of capacity. In the 1990s, prior to major social unrest, the line increased its power transmission to 200 MW, still considerably below design capacity. As of 2000, reliability had been poor with many thyristor failures at the inverter station.Oliveira,H., Sintra,L., Lokala,J., Pembele,I.E., Lubini,I.E.., Goossen,P.V., Bhana,S., Operating experiences in the HVDC systems of the Southern African power pool Cahora-Bassa: Apollo and Inga- Shaba, CIGRÉ session, Paris, 2000, paper reference 14-111. As of 2010, the line was still functional as far as Bandundu, the capital of Bandundu province, approximately northeast of Kinshasa. In 2009 ABB was awarded a contract to refurbish and modernise the converter equipment. This upgrade is due to be completed in 2013. == See also == * Grand Inga Dam * High-voltage direct current ==References== ==Bibliography== * Kwitny, Jonathan Endless Enemies: The Making of an Unfriendly World (1984; ) Nzongola-Ntalaja, Georges.

Mills was a warm advocate of small farms. == Biography == John Mills was a person of considerable eminence in the 18th century, though little definite is known because no record exists of his life.William White (1889) Notes and Queries. p. 456 From his manner of expression, it is possible he may have lived his early life in foreign countries a long time, possibly in France, but he was not born there. In 1741 he was staying in London, where he had made preparations to go to Jamaica. He cancelled those plans because, as he wrote \\"having met with something more advantageous which engages me to stay in England\\"Mills (1741), cited Dix-huitième siècle. Nr. 1-2, 1969. p. 274: And cited in John Lough (1971) Mills married a French woman, and they had two children; one baptised in Paris on 27 April 1742 and another born in May 1743. In 1743 Mills was in Paris for the purpose of bringing out, in concert with Gottfried Sellius, a German historian, a French edition of Ephraim Chambers's Cyclopaedia; but Lebreton, the printer commissioned by him to manage the undertaking, cheated him out of the subscription money, assaulted him, and ultimately obtained a license in his own name. This was the origin of the famous Encyclopédie. Mills, unable to obtain redress, returned to England. In 1755 Mills had started translation The History of the Roman Emperors, from Augustus to Constantine by Jean-Baptiste Louis Crévier from the French, and in 1763 Mills continued and completed the Memoirs of the Court of Augustus, by Thomas Blackwell the younger. In the 1760s he found his true vocation as a writer on agriculture, which started with his translation in 1762 of Duhamel du Monceau's Practical Treatise of Husbandry. In 1766 he published an Essay on the Management of Bees. The A New System of Practical Husbandry, (1767) treated all branches of agriculture, and contains the first mention of the potato as grown in fields. In 1770 appeared a translation from the Latin of G.A. Gyllenberg's Natural and Chemical Elements of Agriculture; in 1772 an Essay on the Weather (translated into Dutch in 1772), and Essays, Moral, Philosophical, and Political (anonymous, but advertised under his name); and in 1776 a Treatise on Cattle. On 13 February 1766List of Fellows of the Royal Society 1660 – 2007 at royalsociety.org, 2008 Mills was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society with Benjamin Franklin as one of his sponsors. He was the first foreign associate of the French Agricultural Society, on whose list his name, with London as his residence, appears from 1767 to 1784. He was also member of the Royal Societies of Agriculture of Rouen, the Mannheim Academy of Sciences, and the Economical Society of Bern.John Mills. A New and Complete System of Practical Husbandry. London. Volume 1, 1766. Title page. == Work == John Mills was credited for his comprehensive knowledge of agriculture, and of the cultivation and use of the ground. He authored and translated several works in these fields. He became a well known author on the subject of husbandry in the 1760s, and was elected member of the Royal Society in 1766. He had come to prominence about twenty years earlier, while working on the translation of Chambers's Cyclopaedia. === Encyclopédie === Encyclopédie, Conditions for Subscriber, 1745/71. Ephraim Chambers had first published his Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences in two volumes in London in 1728, following several dictionaries of arts and sciences that had emerged in Europe since the late 17th century.Lough (1971. p. 3-5)Robert Shackleton \\"The Encyclopedie\\" in: Proceedings, American Philosophical Society (vol. 114, No. 5, 1970. p. 39) This work became quite renowned, and four editions were published between 1738 and 1742. An Italian translation of this work appeared from 1747 to 1754. In France a member of the banking family Lambert began translating Chambers into French,Précis de la vie du citoyen Lambert, Bibliothèque nationale, Ln. 11217; Listed in Shackleton (1970, p. 130). but in 1745 John Mills and Gottfried Sellius were the first to actually prepare a French edition of Ephraim Chambers's Cyclopaedia for publication, which they entitled Encyclopédie. Early in 1745 Mills and Sellius published a prospectus for the EncyclopédieRecently rediscovered in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, see Prospectus pour une traduction française de la Cyclopaedia de Chambers blog.bnf.fr, Dec. 2010 to attract subscribers to the project. This four-page prospectus was illustrated by Jean-Michel Papillon,André-François Le Breton, Jean-Michel Papillon, Ephraïm Chambers. Encyclopédie, ou Dictionnaire universel des arts et des sciences. 1745 and accompanied by a plan (see image), stating that the work would be published in five volumes from June 1746 until the end of 1748.Reproduction from 1745 original in: Luneau de Boisjermain (1771) Mémoire pour les libraires associés à l'Encyclopédie: contre le sieur Luneau de Boisjermain. p. 165. The text was translated by Mills and Sellius, and it was corrected by an unnamed person, who appears to have been Denis Diderot.Philipp Blom. Encyclopédie: the triumph of reason in an unreasonable age Fourth Estate, 2004. p. 37: The prospectus was reviewed quite positively and cited at some length in several journals.\\"Prospectus du Dictionnaire de Chambers, traduit en François, et proposé par souscription\\" in: M. Desfontaines. Jugemens sur quelques ouvrages nouveaux. Vol 8. (1745). p. 72 The Mémoires pour l'histoire des sciences et des beaux arts journal praised the project as \\"voici deux des plus fortes entreprises de Littérature qu'on ait faites depuis long-tems\\" (here are two of the greatest efforts undertaken in literature in a long time).Review in: Mémoires pour l'histoire des sciences et des beaux arts, May 1745, Nr. 2. p. 934-8 The Mercure Journal in June 1745 wrote a 25-pages article specifically praising Mill's role as translator; the Journal introduced Mills as an English scholar who had been raised in France and who spoke both French and English as a native. The Journal reports that Mills had discussed the work with several academics, was zealous about the project, had devoted his fortune to support this enterprise, and was the sole owner of the publishing privilege.Mercure Journal (1745, p. 87) cited in: Lough (1971), p. 20 However, the co-operation fell apart later in 1745. André Le Breton, the publisher commissioned to manage the undertaking, cheated Mills out of the subscription money, claiming, for example, that Mills' knowledge of French was inadequate. In a confrontation Le Breton physically assaulted Mills. Mills took Le Breton to court, but the court decided in Le Breton's favour. Le Breton replaced Mills with Jean Paul de Gua de Malves, who in turn was later replaced by Denis Diderot. Soon after the court ruling, Mills left for England.Mills' summary of this matter was published in Boisjermain's Mémoire pour P. J. F. Luneau de Boisjermain av. d. Piéc. justif 1771, p. 162-3, where Boisjermain also gave his version of the events (p. 2-5).Comments by Le Breton are published in his biography; in the preface of the encyclopedia; in John Lough (1971); etc. === The History of the Roman Emperors, from Augustus to Constantine, 1755 === The History of the Roman Emperors from Augustus to Constantine, 1755 Mills re- emerged from the shadow in 1755 as the translator of The History of the Roman Emperors, from Augustus to Constantine. This work was originally written in 10 volumes by Jean-Baptiste Louis Crévier, who was Professor of Rhetoric in the Collège de Beauvais in Paris. Mills had translated from the French the first two volumes, when in 1755 a review of this work was published in The monthly review of literary journal. The review introduced Mills as the translator, with the following phrase: :Mr. Mills, and his other works, we are alike strangers to; but have been informed he has published some tracts, with reputation, abroad; and that he was the first undertaker and promoter of the translation of Chambers's Cyclopædia into French...Review of \\"The History of the Roman Emperors, from Augustus to Constantine\\" in: The monthly review of literary journal Vol XII. 1755. p. 405-412 In Robert Watt's Bibliotheca Britannica (1824, p. 670) this translation was credited to another John Mills Esq.,Robert Watt (1824) Bibliotheca Britannica: Or a General Index to British and Foreign Literature. p. 670: See entries: MILLS, John, F.R.S. and MILLS, John, Esq. but this description clearly indicates we are dealing with one and the same person. The 1755 review was critical about Mill's translation skills, and stated: :...If he is an Englishman, which, but for his name, we should doubt, from his manner of expression, it is possible he may have lived so long in foreign countries, as to have somewhat lessened his acquaintance with his vernacular language: for we have met with few writers that have shewn themselves less masters of its purity, Mr. Johnson has judiciously observed, that \\"the great pest of speech is frequency of translation. No book was ever turned from one language to another, without imparting something of its native idiom; this is the most mischievous and comprehensive innovation; single words may enter by thousands, and 'the fabric of the tongue continue the fame; but new phraseology changes much at once, it alters not the single stones of the building, but the order of the columns.\\" The review specifically expressed, that Mills left his diction in a Gallic form, that renders it uncouth to an English ear. They hoped, that the remaining volumes would be more agreeable to the reader. It is unknown if Mills fulfilled this expectation, but he did translate another eight volumes, which were published in the next years. === A practical Treatise of Husbandry, 1759 === Mills first serious work in the field of agriculture, was the translation of Duhamel du Monceau's Practical Treatise of Husbandry, from the French. The full title of this translation is: Treatise of Husbandry, 1759, Plate I :A practical Treatise of Husbandry: Wherein are contained many useful and valuable Experiments and Observations in the New Husbandry, collected during a Series of Years, by the celebrated, M. Duhamel Du Monceau, Member of the Royal Academy of Sciences dt Paris, Fellow of the Royal Society, London, &c.; Also the most approved Practice of the best English Farmers, in the old Method of Husbandry. With Copper-Plates of several new and useful Instruments., 4tO. 16s. Whiston, &c.; Duhamel's work originally consisted of five volumes, which were published at different times. Mills didn't translation this work as a whole. He translated only such experiments as seemed to him most instructive in the then modern practice of farming, either according to the old or new method.Review of \\"A Practical Treatise of Husbandry.\\" in: The Monthly Review, Or, Literary Journal, Volume 21 by Ralph Griffiths, G. E. Griffiths, 1759, p. 139-148 (online) Mills explained in the preface, that \\"Duhamel and his correspondents have set the world an example which has long been wanted, and greatly desired by all who have the good of their country at heart, and are in the least sensible of the importance of Agriculture. They have given us a series of experiments in this most useful art, continued for several years together, with accuracy and judgment, and related in a clear, distinct, manner.\\"Mills in Preface of \\"A Practical Treatise of Husbandry,\\" 1762. According to Mills the work of Duhamel is noted for it empirical origin. Theory alone can avail but little in agriculture, Mills declared, referring to the following observation by Francis Home: :Agriculture does not take its rise originally from reason, but from fact and experience. It is a branch of natural philosophy, and can only be improved from a knowledge of facts, as they happen in nature. It is by attending to these facts that the other branches of natural philosophy have been so much advanced during these two last ages. Medicine has attained its present per section, only from the history of diseases and cafes delivered down. Chemistry is now reduced to a regular system, by the means of experiments made either by chance or design. But where are the experiments in Agriculture to answer this purpose ? When I look round for such, I can find few or none. There then lies the impediment in the way of Agriculture. Books in that art, we are not deficient in: but the book which we want, is a book of experiments.Francis Home, The Principles of Agriculture and Vegetation, Edinburgh, 1757, pp. 3–5; Cited in the Preface of \\"A Practical Treatise of Husbandry,\\" 1762. Only after reading the three first volumes of Experiments published by M. Duhamel, Francis Home declared: \\"They are distinct, exact, conclusive so far as they have gone, and stand a model for experiments in Agriculture. What a shame for Great Britain, where Agriculture is so much cultivated, to leave its exact value to be determined by foreigners!\\" === Memoirs of the court of Augustus, 1763 === Memoirs of the Court of Augustus, Vol. 3, 1763 Another of Mills' projects was the continuation and completion of the third volume of Memoirs of the court of Augustus in 1763 from the original papers of Thomas Blackwell. Blackwell's works, including An Enquiry into the Life and Writings of Homer (1735), Letters Concerning Mythology (1748) and Memoirs of the Court of Augustus (3 vols., 1753–63), established him as one of the premier figures in the Scottish Enlightenment. Blackwell had published the first two volumes between 1753 and 1757, and the third volume was printed off to p. 144, when Blackwell died. An advertisement prefixed to this volume explained the continuation: :\\"The proprietor, unwilling to let the sets of those gentlemen who had purchased the former volumes remain incomplete, put all the papers left by the author, relative to this work, into the hands of the present editor, who begs leave to observe, that those papers being, in general, Little more than loose leaves, detached notes, memorandums, and, very often, only bare hints of things intended to be said, without any connection, reference to each other, or even paging, he hopes he may justly claim some indulgence from the public, wherever he has erred in his endeavours to give them the order and method which he imagines might have been Dr. Blackwell's, if that gentleman had lived to finish his work.\\"Text cited in Tobias Smollett (1763, p. 289) Mills further stated Blackwell's loose papers were deficient, and he had to recourse to the Ancients. A review of this work by Tobias Smollett in The Critical Review: Or, Annals of Literature stated, that \\"it is impossible for us to ascertain the particular passages of this publication that belong to Mr. Mills; but we will venture to say, upon the whole, that this volume, both in point of composition and language, is not inferior to its two elder brothers.\\"Tobias Smollett (1763) The Critical Review: Or, Annals of Literature. Vol. 15. p. 289 === A new and complete system of practical husbandry, 1762–1765 === John Mills wrote A new and complete system of practical husbandry, in five volumes, which were published between 1762 and 1765. The full titles of this work was: Title page of A new and complete system of practical husbandry by John Mills, 1767 : A new and complete system of practical husbandry, containing all that experience has proved to be most useful in farming, either in the old or new method, with a comparative view of both, and whatever is beneficial to the husbandman, or conducive 'to the ornament and improvement of the country gentleman's estate; The five volumes of a new and complete system of husbandry, by Mills, is the first publication on agriculture that presents all the branches of the art within the compass of one work. John Worlidge began the attempt, but failed in the comprehension that is required. * The first volume of Mills treats \\"soils\\" in the different kinds, clays, sands, and loams; manures, animal and vegetable, and composts; of the improvement of moorlands, and boggy lands and all uncultivated lands; the culture of grain and pulse; the sowing and change of crops; the culture of wheat, and rye, oats, barley, maize, or Indian corn, millet, panic, rice, buckwheat; culture of pulse, viz., beans, peas, vetches, lentils, and lupines. * Volume II. contains the horse-hoeing husbandry of grain and pulse; the distempers of corn. * Volume III. treats the enemies of corn; preservation of grain, turnips, potatoes, cabbages, clover, sainfoin, lucerne, cytisus, burnet, natural grasses; enclosing, and the situation of farms and farm houses. * Volume IV. contains \\"Gardening, and the culture of hops and olive\\".\\" * Volume V. treats \\" The making and managing o fermented liquors,\\" and concludes with hemp, flax, madder, woad, weld, or dyer's weed, and a long appendix to each volume. Mills leads all the previous authors in the arrangement of his work, which undoubtedly carried away the palm of agricultural writing at the time of its appearance. He joins extensively with John Evelyn and Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau, and does ample justice to the system of cultivation proposed by Jethro Tull. Turnips and potatoes were in general use, and the Rotherham plough is figured in the work, as are also thirteen of the natural grasses. Potatoes are entered in this work for the first time as a vegetable in the field cultivation, being about 150 years after the use of the plant was known as an esculent root. Mills quotes the authority of Miller in proof of its value and extensive utility. This author conveys his meaning and intelligence in the true style of writing—cool and plausible, and with becoming diffidence on all scientific disquisitions. No dogmatism mars the placid tenor of his story. Mills was a great stickler for small farms, almost cottier allotments; he did not see that any single bodily labour can effect but very little unless in combination, and that extensive projects employ most labour, and produce the largest results. A thick mist long clouded the human vision on that and similar points, and is not yet dispelled. === Other works === The full titles of his other works Mills authored were: * \\"A treatise on cattle, showing the most approved methods of breeding, rearing, and fitting for use horses, asses, mules, horned cattle, sheep, goats, and swine, with directions for the proper treatment of them in their several diseases. To which is added a dissertation on their contagious diseases, carefully collected from the best authorities, and interspersed with remarks.\\" * \\"An essay on the management of bees; wherein is shown the method of rearing these useful insects, and that the practice of saving their lives when their honey and wax are taken from them was known to the ancients, and is in itself simple and easily executed;\\" * \\"An essay on the weather, with remarks on the shepherd of Banbury's rules forjudging of its changes, and directions for preserving lives and buildings from the fatal effects of lightning;\\" The treatise on cattle is an octavo volume of 491 pages, and treats horses, asses, mules, horned cattle, sheep, goats, and swine, with the cures of their disorders, which have a dissertation on their nature. The matter is more descriptive than that of Bradley, but not so practical in the application, though much merit is attached to the knowledge it shows of the origin and progress of the different animals. Mills also translated \\"Duhamel's husbandry;\\" in 1759, \\"Natural and chemical elements of agriculture, from the Latin of Gustavus Adolphus Gyllenborg;\\" in 1770, and he was the reputed author of some essays, moral, philosophical, and political. == Legacy == In the field of agricultural science John Mills was a proponent of a new movement named \\"horse-hoeing husbandry\\" or \\"new husbandry\\". This was based on the work of Jethro Tull, and supported by Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau in France, Michel Lullin de Chateauvieux in Switzerland, Mills in England. Mills translated their work, and introduced it in England, wherein for example Arthur Young learned about the work of Louis François Henri de Menon.Travels in France during the years 1787, 1788 & 1789., 1790; 1892 edition, p. 138 In return Mills's main work A New and Complete System of Practical Husbandry was translated into German,Göttingische gelehrte Anzeigen. Vol. 2, (1764) p. 1048 ; Review of A New and Complete System os Practical Husbandry Vol 2. translated into German. and had its influence in the main land. The British The Complete Farmer: Or, a General Dictionary of Husbandry 3rd ed. (1777). The Complete Farmer, listed John Mills in the subtitle of this work among the foremost authorities in the field of Husbandry of his time. Other people mentioned in this context were Carl Linnaeus, Louis François Henri de Menon, Hugh Plat, John Evelyn, John Worlidge, John Mortimer, Jethro Tull, William Ellis, Philip Miller, Thomas Hale, Edward Lisle, Roque, and Arthur Young.The Complete Farmer: Or, a General Dictionary of Husbandry. 3rd ed. 1777. In the 19th century Donaldson (1854) in his Agricultural Biography, credited Mills' Practical Husbandry for being the \\"first publication on agriculture that presents all the branches of the art within the compass of one work. 'Worlidge began the attempt, but failed in the comprehension required.\\"Samuel Austin Allibone. A Critical Dictionary of English Literature, and British and American Authors, Living and Deceased, from the Earliest Accounts to the Middle of the Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2, p. 1289. However, by then most of the work of the proponents of \\"horse-hoeing husbandry\\" had become obsolete, due to the rapid progress of agriculture in those days.John Claudius Loudon (1825) An Encyclopædia of Agriculture. Volume 1. p. iii: Preface Specifically Mills' Practical Husbandry was used as reference until the 1820s.See for example: A.F.M. Willich et al.

Carrying the Glidrose Publications copyright, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Hodder and Stoughton and in the United States by Putnam. Beginning with this novel, and continuing for the remainder of the John Gardner series, Bond is promoted to the Royal Navy rank of Captain. ==Plot summary== M receives word that a terrorist organisation known as BAST (Brotherhood of Anarchy and Secret Terrorism) is planning to infiltrate and destroy a top-secret Royal Navy aircraft carrier-based summit, the \\"Stewards' Meeting\\", scheduled a year hence, comprising American President George H. W. Bush, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev. James Bond is returned to active duty in the Royal Navy and promoted from Commander to Captain, in order to infiltrate the aircraft carrier HMS Invincible and identify potential sleeper agents. In the months leading to the top-secret summit, Bond spends his time training at Yeovilton learning to fly a Navy Sea Harrier jet. Learning of Bond's mission, BAST decides that he is a hindrance to their plans and attempts to kill him by attempting to shoot him down during a Sea Harrier training exercise. Later, when Bond goes on holiday in Italy, another attempt is made on his life. Bond escapes, but is apparently unable to save his then- current girlfriend, Beatrice Maria da Ricci. Returning from holiday Bond boards HMS Invincible and is tasked with security for the \\"Stewards' Meeting\\", all while a massive war game is being carried out among the American, British, and Soviet Navies, known as Landsea '89. Before long Bond is at the centre of a murder investigation of an American Naval Intelligence officer, and he leaves to report the incident, BAST executes its plans to capture the ship and hold the world's three most powerful leaders for a $600 billion ransom. ==Characters== * James Bond * M * Bill Tanner * Bassam Baradj: Born Robert Besavitsky in New York, Baradj is the main leader of BAST, codenamed \\"Viper.\\" BAST's plot to take over and hold the world's three most powerful leaders was his idea. He is later shot by Beatrice Maria da Ricci in Gibraltar. * Abou Hamarik: Hamarik, codenamed \\"Snake,\\" is the second of three leaders of BAST. He is able to infiltrate HMS Invincible by killing an American Naval Intelligence officer who has been called into replace another that was murdered on board the carrier. Hamarik is found out and is wounded by Nikki Ratnikov after he had taken Bond and a number of secret service agents from the three nations hostage. After the incident, Hamarik is arrested by Bond. * Clover Pennington: First Officer Clover Pennington is a Wren with the Royal Navy. She is secretly the third head of BAST, codenamed \\"Cat.\\" Under Pennington's leadership while Bond is away BAST is able to take over the aircraft carrier with a number of supporters (all Wrens), who were aboard the ship for the Landsea '89 war game. Pennington is accidentally killed by one of her supporters after being used as cover and pushed into a room by Bond. * Beatrice Maria da Ricci: Ricci is an operative working for the British secret service who has been tasked with protecting Bond, specifically while on holiday. She is supposedly killed while on holiday in Italy with Bond, however, she makes a return later on, informing Bond that her death was appropriately faked in order to save Bond from another attempt on his life by BAST. She and Bond later team up to arrest Bassam Baradj, although ultimately she kills Baradj while saving Bond's life. * Nikki Ratnikov: Nikki Ratnikov is a secret service agent from Russia who was sent to protect Mikhail Gorbachev during the Steward's Meeting. She is killed by Abou Hamarik during an exchange of gunfire while on board HMS Invincible. During the exchange she successfully wounds Hamarik, which later leads to his arrest. ==Publication history== * UK first hardback edition: 1989 Hodder & Stoughton * U.S. first hardback edition: July 1989 Putnam * UK first paperback edition: 1990 Coronet Books * U.S. first paperback edition: 1990 Berkley Books ==Reviews== Private Eyes anonymous critic complained that each Gardner book takes \\"Bond a further step or two away from the tall, resourceful ladykiller who first appeared in Casino Royale\\", and that \\"the real Bond atmosphere has been dead for upwards of 30 years.\\" The critic also believed that Bond was a product of his times. \\"Gardner manages to remove most of the characteristics that made [Bond] interesting\\" and that the book's explosions, throat-cuttings and neck- breakings, \\"[have] an odd, perfunctory quality.\\" The novel, \\"has none of Fleming's ability to build up tension or introduce detail casually. When Gardner talks knowledgeably about aircraft specifications the effect is only to reassure us that he has read the appropriate flight manual.\\" The critic also notes that Gardner \\"can't quite bring himself to take it seriously.\\" Charles Champlin in the Los Angeles Times noted how different Fleming and Gardner are. \\"Ian Fleming wrote as a hedonist who prospered by dramatizing a life's worth of fantasies - acquisitions, indulgences, guilt-free sex and violence. John Gardner writes in Win, Lose or Die as a military affairs reporter who describes the operations of a Harrier VTOL aircraft as lovingly as Fleming described Pussy Galore. Gardner is long on facts, short on feelings. This is the eighth of the counterfeit James Bonds by Gardner.\\" Commenting on the villain, Champlin writes, \\"Its leader, who intends to dispose of practically everyone, is as colorless a supervillain as ever Bond has faced. Call him Drabfinger.\\" The book \\"is all so unamusing and juicelessly programmatic. The persistence of the series, despite these pallid copyings, is the ultimate tribute to the richness of Fleming's original invention.\\" Available online. The Globe and Mail critic Margaret Cannon said, \\"this isn't Ian Fleming's James Bond, but the eighth book written by John Gardner, the recreator of Bond, and it's a far cry from the original. Bond, with his libido and gadgetry, is a creation of the fifties, when sex was furtive and gadgets were fun. Today, such authors as Tom Clancy serve up real technological frights that make all of Bond's plots seem like the innocent revels they are. Furthermore, Gardner's Bond is too American – too breezy and beefy - to be the real 007. This one needs to RIP.\\" Kirkus Reviews said that, \\"Despite too many acronyms, too much artillery, and too many layers of deceptive identity, this is still one of Gardner's better Bonds, guaranteed to make you feel excited as well as a little foolish.\\" Available online. ==See also== * Outline of James Bond ==References== Category:1989 British novels Category:James Bond books Category:Novels by John Gardner (British writer) Category:Hodder & Stoughton books ","title":"Win, Lose or Die"},{"id":"1277226","text":"Sankaty Head Golf Club is one of the easternmost golf courses in Massachusetts, perched on the edge of Nantucket Island in Siasconset, Massachusetts. The course was designed by Emerson Armstrong and opened in 1923. It is an 18-hole course. It is one of the few examples of world-class links-style golf outside of the UK (see Shinnecock Hills). The Atlantic wraps around 270 degrees of the layout and the famous Sankaty Head Lighthouse looms over the front nine. The current staff includes: Lori Snell as General Manager, Mark Heartfield as Director of Golf, and Dieter Wiedmayer as Head Golf Professional. Sankaty members are a driving force behind the Francis Ouimet Scholarship Fund. They also have successfully sustained one of the few remaining caddy camps in the world, Camp Sankaty Head, which has existed since the late 1930s. Membership is private, but the public can play during the off- season (before Memorial Day and after Labor Day). Famous members include Jack Welch (whose island residence is just off the 4th tee-box), Larry Bossidy, Bob Wright, Harry Fraker, Larry Bossidy, Amos Hostetter, Henry C. Pfaff, and Bill Belichick. On June 4, 2019, the Sankaty Head Golf Club was chosen to be the host site of the USGA's 41st U.S. Mid-Amateur Championship. This will be their first hosted USGA Championship and is planned for Sept. 25–30, 2021. == The Caddy Camp == The Sankaty Head Caddy Camp, directed by Dave Hinman, is the last remaining caddy camp in the United States and one of the last in the world. Here 60 caddies, 6 junior staff members, a program director, caddymaster, camp director, assistant camp director, and cook are located between the eleventh and thirteenth fairways on the course. After being picked through an application process, caddies come to this camp from Iowa, Florida, New York, South Carolina, Maine, New Jersey and other states. There are three \\"huts\\" in the camp, with 20 boys in each. Other buildings in camp include a mess hall, recreational hall, library, laundry shack, staff hut, and the director's hut. While the boys are not caddying, they can enjoy organized team sports of softball, volleyball, football, basketball, and of course, golf. Also in their free time, the boys can enjoy recreational golf, a workout in the weight \\"pit\\", or a game of ping pong in the rec hall. On Aug. 2, 2011, a fire at the caddy camp erupted during a propane delivery. The fire consumed three buildings and injured the driver of the propane tanker truck. == Course Information == ===Course Statistics=== * Black Tees: 6625 yards - 72.6 rating - 126 slope. * White Tees: 6270 yards - 70.8 rating - 123 slope. * Blue (Men's) Tees: 5580 yards - 67.2 rating - 118 slope. * Blue (Women's) Tees: 5580 yards - 72.5 rating - 119 slope. * Yellow (Men's) Tees: 5270 yards - 65.7 rating - 111 slope. * Yellow (Men's) Tees: 5270 yards - 70.7 rating - 115 slope. * ===Scorecard=== * == See also == * Siasconset Golf Club == References == ==External links== *Official Sankaty Head Golf Club website *Official Sankaty Head Caddie Camp website *Massachusetts Golf Association Member Page *Course Review *When Did Golfing Begin on Nantucket?

Carrying the Glidrose Publications copyright, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Hodder & Stoughton and in the United States by Putnam. The book title is sometimes presented as two words, but is correctly one word since it is a character name. Instead of picking up where the novelisation Licence to Kill left off, Brokenclaw completely ignores the story's events and continues from Win, Lose or Die. ==Plot summary== After expressing frustration over a lack of action after his year-long mission with the Royal Navy (as detailed in Win, Lose or Die), Bond threatens to resign. Instead, M orders Bond to take a vacation. Bond travels to Victoria, British Columbia where he is intrigued by Lee Fu- Chu, a half-Blackfoot, half-Chinese philanthropist who is known as \\"Brokenclaw\\" because of a deformed hand. Later, Bond is ordered to San Francisco where he is tasked to investigate the kidnapping of several scientists who have been working on a new submarine detection system and an \\"antidote\\" known as LORDS and LORDS DAY. Bond and CIA agent Chi-Chi Sue go undercover using the codenames Peter Abelard and Héloïse that were assigned to two agents from the People's Republic of China that are sent to evaluate the submarine technology before purchasing it. Ultimately, Bond discovers that Brokenclaw is involved in this scheme on behalf of China, and also has plans of his own which involve sparking a worldwide economic disaster by bringing about the collapse of the dollar by tapping into the New York Stock Exchange, which would in turn bring down other major currencies worldwide. The plan, dubbed Operation Jericho was a long-term plan initially started by the Japanese, but now believed to have been worked on simultaneously by the Chinese before being acquired by Brokenclaw. Brokenclaw's hideout in California is raided by Special Forces after he is located by Naval Intelligence officer Ed Rushia who was searching and attempting to help Bond and Chi-Chi while on their mission. Brokenclaw escapes the raid only to be tracked down by Bond and Rushia, off the books, to the Chelan Mountains of Washington where Bond is challenged to a torture ritual known as o-kee-pa. In the end, the competition comes down to a fight between the two using bow and arrows; Brokenclaw barely misses Bond and in turn is shot through the neck by Bond's arrow. ==Characters== * James Bond * M * Bill Tanner * Ann Reilly * Brokenclaw: Half Chinese, half Blackfoot, he was born Lee Fu-Chu. He received the name \\"Brokenclaw\\" because of a deformity in his left hand where his thumb is on the right (viewing the palm up) rather than the left. Brokenclaw is a crime lord in San Francisco who has a large hold on the city's prostitution, gambling, and drug rackets. He also works for CELD (Central External Liaison Department), the intelligence service of the People's Republic of China, and possibly CCI (Central Control of Intelligence). Brokenclaw has managed to get his hands on a new technology that can detect submarine signatures which he plans to give to CELD. Additionally, Brokenclaw also plans to cause economic disaster by bringing about the collapse of the dollar. Ultimately Brokenclaw's plans are prevented by Bond. He later retreats to a getaway location in the Chelan Mountains of Washington. There he challenges Bond to a ritual known as o-kee-pa. During this competition he is shot by Bond in the neck with an arrow. * Miss Sue Chi-Ho: Known to her friends as Chi-Chi Sue or simply Chi- Chi, she is on loan from the CIA. She can speak fluent Cantonese and was previously a U.S. Naval Intelligence officer. She accompanies Bond on Operation Curve posing as Jenny Mo, an operative codenamed Héloïse from the People's Republic of China who was sent to evaluate Brokenclaw's submarine detection technology. * Ed Rushia: A Commander with U.S. Naval Intelligence. He is tasked with following Bond and Chi-Chi to ensure their safety throughout their mission. After Bond and Chi-Chi disappear, Rushia searches California for them. After eventually picking up their signal he helps Bond escape a deathtrap in which Bond is thrown to Brokenclaw's wolves. He later teams up with Bond, off the record, to find Brokenclaw in Washington after Brokenclaw's hideout is raided. * Wanda Man Song Hing: A Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy, Wanda is undercover posing as Brokenclaw's lover. Her father who owed Brokenclaw an enormous sum of money gave her (willingly to go undercover) to Brokenclaw as compensation. She is later discovered and as retribution her father is thrown to the wolves while she is badly tortured. * Agents Nolan and Wood: Crooked FBI agents who are working secretly for Brokenclaw. They discover Bond is not who he claims to be and capture him for Brokenclaw. They later capture Chi-Chi for Brokenclaw and attempt to hold her ransom. They are eventually arrested by Ed Rushia. ==Publication history== * U.S. first hardback edition: 1 August 1990 Putnam * UK first hardback edition: September 1990 Hodder & Stoughton * UK first paperback edition: October 1991 Coronet Books * U.S. first paperback edition: 1991 Berkley Books ==Trivia== * The local Victoria newspaper is referred to as the 'Times-Columnist'; it is actually called the Times-Colonist, referring to Vancouver Island's previous colonial status in the British Empire. * Although it has been established by Ian Fleming on numerous occasions that James Bond hates tea, in the opening chapters of the novel Bond drinks tea. * Peter Abelard and Héloïse, Bond and Chi-Chi's undercover names, is a reference to a famous love affair. * John Gardner considered Brokenclaw to be one of his least favourite Bond books, in addition to Role of Honour.

The CAB was established with powers to focus on the illegally acquired assets of criminals involved in serious crime. The aims of the CAB are to identify the criminally acquired assets of persons and to take the appropriate action to deny such people of these assets. This action is taken particularly through the application of the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996. The CAB was established as a body corporate with perpetual succession in 1996 and is founded on the multi-agency concept, drawing together law enforcement officers, tax officials, social welfare officials as well as other specialist officers including legal officers, forensic analysts and financial analysts. This multi-agency concept is regarded by some as the model for other European jurisdictions. The CAB is not a division of the (police) but rather an independent body corporate although it has many of the powers normally given to the . The Chief Bureau Officer is drawn from a member of the holding the rank of Chief Superintendent and is appointed by the Garda Commissioner. The remaining staff of the CAB are appointed by the Minister for Justice and Equality. CAB members retain their original powers as if they were working within their separate entities and have direct access to information and databases that their original organisations are allowed by law. This ability to share information was described by the Garda Síochána Inspectorate in its Crime Investigation Report of October 2014 as \\"a good model that could be replicated outside of CAB\\". The CAB reports annually to the Minister through the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and this report is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Minister for Justice and Equality, in publishing the 2011 CAB Annual Report, stated: \\"The work of the bureau is one of the key law enforcement responses to tackling crime and the Government is very much committed to further strengthening the powers of the bureau through forthcoming legislative proposals.\\" In publishing the Bureau's 2012 report the Minister for Justice and Equality set out: \\"The Annual Report provides an insight into the workings of the Bureau and highlights the advantage of adopting a multi-agency and multi-disciplinary approach to the targeting of illicit assets. The Bureau is an essential component in the State’s law enforcement response to serious and organised crime and the Government is fully committed to further strengthening its powers through future legislative reform.\\" The Minister for Justice and Equality set out that Ireland, through the work of the Bureau, has established itself as a jurisdiction that is responding to that challenge and the work of the Bureau is internationally recognised as a best practice approach to tackling criminality and the illicit monies it generates. The CAB has been effective against organised criminals, especially those involved in the importation and distribution of drugs. It has also been used against corrupt public officials and terrorists. ==Legislative framework== The Law Reform Commission provides consolidated legislation relating to the Bureau, namely: * Criminal Assets Bureau Act, 1996 & 2005 (consolidated to 20 March 2013) * Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996 & 2005 (consolidated to 1 October 2012) The Proceeds of Crime Acts were amended further by the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act, 2016. The Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2016 is designed to facilitate the seizure of property which is suspected to be the proceeds of crime by expanding the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau to seize those proceeds. This act amends the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 in two key respects. First, it allows the Criminal Assets Bureau to seize property which it suspects to be the proceeds of crime for up to 21 days. Second, it reduces the threshold value of property which can be pursued by the Criminal Assets Bureau from €13,000 to €5,000. ==Objectives== The statutory objectives of the CAB are – #the identification of the assets of persons which derive, or are suspected to derive, directly or indirectly from criminal conduct; #the taking of appropriate action under the law to deprive or to deny those persons of such assets or the benefit of such assets, and #the pursuit of any necessary investigation or other preparatory work in relation to relevant proceedings. The emergence of CAB signalled a more focused approach on targeting the financial proceeds of crime than previously existed. ==Overview== The CAB collected €89 million in taxes in its first ten years of existence and it also engaged in initiatives to curtail international criminality. The CAB has a staff of 91, including members of , Revenue Commissioners, (both customs and taxes officers), and civil servants from the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Justice and Equality. Its annual budget for 2011 was €6.673 million, of which 86% is salary cost. This was reduced to €6.410 million in 2012, but has increased to 8.832m Euro in 2018. ===Budget=== The budget of the Bureau over the period 2008 to 2018 was as follows: Colors= id:lightgrey value:gray(0.9) id:darkgrey value:gray(0.8) id:sfondo value:rgb(1,1,1) id:barra value:rgb(0.6,0.7,0.8) ImageSize = width:680 height:305 PlotArea = left:50 bottom:50 top:30 right:30 DateFormat = x.y Period = from:0 till:9.5 TimeAxis = orientation:vertical AlignBars = justify ScaleMajor = gridcolor:darkgrey increment:2 start:0 ScaleMinor = gridcolor:lightgrey increment:1 start:0 BackgroundColors = canvas:sfondo BarData= bar:2008 text:2008 bar:2009 text:2009 bar:2010 text:2010 bar:2011 text:2011 bar:2012 text:2012 bar:2013 text:2013 bar:2014 text:2014 bar:2015 text:2015 bar:2016 text:2016 bar:2017 text:2017 bar:2018 text:2018 PlotData= color:barra width:50 align:left bar:2008 from: 0 till:7.509 bar:2009 from: 0 till:6.877 bar:2010 from: 0 till:6.531 bar:2011 from: 0 till:6.673 bar:2012 from: 0 till:6.410 bar:2013 from: 0 till:6.455 bar:2014 from: 0 till:6.654 bar:2015 from: 0 till:6.678 bar:2016 from: 0 till:6.686 bar:2017 from: 0 till:8.259 bar:2018 from: 0 till:8.832 PlotData= bar:2008 at:7.509 fontsize:S text: €7.509 shift:(-15,5) bar:2009 at:6.877 fontsize:S text: €6.877 shift:(-15,5) bar:2010 at:6.531 fontsize:S text: €6.531 shift:(-15,5) bar:2011 at:6.673 fontsize:S text: €6.673 shift:(-15,5) bar:2012 at:6.410 fontsize:S text: €6.410 shift:(-15,5) bar:2013 at:6.455 fontsize:S text: €6.455 shift:(-15,5) bar:2014 at:6.654 fontsize:S text: €6.654 shift:(-15,5) bar:2015 at:6.654 fontsize:S text: €6.678 shift:(-15,5) bar:2016 at:6.654 fontsize:S text: €6.686 shift:(-15,5) bar:2017 at:8.259 fontsize:S text: €8.259 shift:(-15,5) bar:2018 at:8.832 fontsize:S text: €8.832 shift:(-15,5) TextData= fontsize:M pos:(20,10) text:€ Million ===Officers and staff=== Officers and staff of the CAB (with the exception of members of the and the Bureau Legal Officer) are protected with statutory anonymity. This anonymity, whilst causing some concerns, has been recognised an important practical issue for all countries when faced with action against people who may be involved in violent crime and extortion and recognises that although police and customs officers are usually trained to deal with such threats and to expect them, revenue and social security officials do not reasonably expect to have to deal with such risks when they take a job. A number of people have been convicted for threatening CAB officers: * Christopher Pratt was sentenced in 2013 to three years in prison for threatening to \\"take the head off\\" a CAB officer. * Paschal Kelly was sentenced in 2015 to four-and-a-half years in prison for threatening a CAB officer, tax evasion and serious driving offences, and more recently in February 2019 was sentenced to 18 years in prison following a conviction for a \\"tiger kidnapping\\".url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/gang- member-jailed-for-18-years-over-tiger-kidnapping-1.3778844 Fachtna Murphy was the first Chief Bureau Officer and Barry Galvin was the first Bureau Legal Officer. The current Chief Bureau Officer is Detective Chief Superintendent Patrick Clavin (who succeeded Eugene Corcoran) and the current Bureau Legal Officer is Kevin McMeel. The former Bureau Legal Officer was Declan O'Reilly. The Bureau Legal Officer is appointed following a recruitment campaign run by the Public Appointments Service. ==Background== The CAB was established in October 1996 by the then Minister for Justice, Nora Owen TD, and was given statutory powers on 15 October 1996 by the Criminal Assets Bureau Act, 1996 (Establishment Day) Order, 1996 (SI 310/1996). The CAB was established to deal with increasing levels of serious organised crime in Ireland, most notable being the murders of crime reporter Veronica Guerin and Detective Garda Jerry McCabe. The CAB was set up by the Oireachtas as a body corporate primarily for the purpose of ensuring that persons should not benefit from any assets acquired by them from any criminal activity. It was given power to take all necessary actions in relation to seizing and securing assets derived from criminal activity, certain powers to ensure that the proceeds of such activity are subject to tax, and also in relation to the Social Welfare Acts. However, as the High Court has noted, it is not a prosecuting body nor a police authority but rather it is an investigating authority which, having investigated and used its powers of investigation, then applies to the High Court for assistance in enforcing its functions. ==Proceeds of crime== A novel or radical aspect of the CAB was the use of civil forfeiture to freeze and seize the proceeds of criminal conduct under the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996. Ireland was one of the first countries to introduce civil forfeiture. Civil forfeiture involved a recognition on the part of the State that conventional methods of tackling organised crime were ineffective. Whilst the CAB was perhaps intended to confiscate the assets of drug dealers and those involved in organised crime its powers can extend to all assets that are the result of criminal activity. Even though the CAB focuses on serious and organised crime, it has increasingly moved against low- and medium-level offenders who may present as poor role models within their communities, albeit that these cases often cost more to bring than they return financially. The CAB has been distinguished from other agencies who tackle serious organised crime in Ireland in that those agencies may be typified as being reactive whereas the CAB is proactive; a fact which may be considered as representing a significant development in crime control. Whilst novel to Ireland, the concept of forfeiture in the absence of a criminal conviction has a long ancestry, with roots in ancient Rome and evidence of its lineage in the Old Testament. It has long been an important feature of the jurisprudence of the USA and has recently been adopted in other common law jurisdictions including the UK and the Cayman Islands in their proceeds of crime legislation. In 2005, the CAB's powers were amended by Part 3 of the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2005. The purpose of this Act was to make further provision in relation to the recovery and disposal of proceeds of crime. This involved amending four different acts as follows: #the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, #the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996, #the Criminal Justice Act 1994, and #the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001. The Act was intended to substantially bolster the powers of the CAB in the continuing battle to target the proceeds of all types of crime and will extend those powers to the proceeds of white-collar crime and corruption. The substantial provisions of the Act extended the proceeds of crime legislation to cover foreign criminality and corrupt enrichment. In addition, there were a number of technical provisions relating to court procedures, search powers and evidence. Under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 & 2005 if the CAB can satisfy the High Court on the balance of probabilities that specified property is the proceeds of crime, the court will make an interim order over the property preventing anybody from dealing with it. This order stays in place for 21 days, following which an application is made for an interlocutory hearing, on notice to any person who has an interest in that property. If it appears to the court that such property is the proceeds of crime, despite anything said by any respondent, an interlocutory order is put in place for a period of seven years. In the course of that time any person who can satisfy the court that the property is not the proceeds of crime can move to have the order lifted. If no such order has been granted during those seven years, the CAB can seek a disposal order effectively extinguishing anybody's rights to the properties and transferring it to the central exchequer. In April 2014, Deputy Eamonn Maloney sponsored a private members Bill to amend the Proceeds of Crime Acts. Section 1 of the Bill seeks to reduce the seven-year period to two years. This Bill was listed before the Dáil on Friday 8 May 2015 and is viewed as a move by the Government to toughen the laws on confiscating criminals' assets and similarly is expected to yield a multimillion-euro windfall for the taxpayer. As the Bill is a Private Members' Bill, its referral to Select Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality was required pursuant to the Standing Orders 82A and 118. In July 2016, the statutory threshold of €13,000 as set out under the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996 was reduced to €5,000. This was done to facilitate the Bureau in targeting mid-level proceeds of crime. This Irish model, including the Irish legislation, the innovative multi-agency Criminal Assets Bureau approach, as well as judicial dicta, has played a central role in the expansion of the non-conviction based approach across the common law world. ===Constitutional and human rights debate=== Some have suggested that, for example, a bridal gift from a perpetual tax evader to his daughter might now find itself on the responding end of an order from the CAB. The limits of the legislation are uncertain and accordingly, the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 and 2005 has been subject to academic review. Writing in 2014, one academic concluded: ::\\"The Proceeds of Crime Act was hastily rushed through parliament in the summer of 1996 in the wake of significant concerns surrounding organized crime and little thought was given to its implications, and likely effectiveness, of this legislation... Ireland will continue to be driven by this sense of populist punitiveness whereby harsh regimes are introduced for no other reason than that they are appealing.\\" Others conclude that civil forfeiture and recovery is a potent crime fighting device: ::\\"Civil recovery is a particularly useful device where the offender is unavailable for prosecution or where it is difficult to obtain sufficient evidence to obtain a conviction against him, primarily because of the reluctance of witnesses to testify. Hence, it is an important tool for dealingwith crime bosses who are usually divorced from the day-to-day activities of their enterprise and thus insulated from detection and prosecution.\\" Civil forfeiture holds with the view that it is not enough to prosecute the perpetrator but recognises the importance of also combatting the driving forces behind the criminal act. The Supreme Court, however, in reviewing the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 concluded: Similar legislation in England and Wales has also withstood constitutional scrutiny in its highest courts. In 2014, the Supreme Court of India addressed the issue of whether forfeiture of property violated Article 20 of the Constitution of India. In deciding that forfeiture did not violate the constitution, the Indian Supreme Court cited with approval the Irish High Court decision in Gilligan v Criminal Assets Bureau. It noted that non- conviction based asset forfeiture model was also to be found in various countries: United States of America, Italy, Ireland, South Africa, UK, Australia and certain provinces of Canada. Similar civil forfeiture legislation was found to be constitutional compliant in Bulgaria. ==Ad Hoc Legal Aid== The Department of Justice and Equality operated the CAB Ad Hoc Legal Aid Scheme until 2014. However, from 1 January 2014 the remit for the administration of the Scheme transferred to the Legal Aid Board. The scheme is applicable to persons who are respondents and/or defendants in any court proceedings brought by, or in the name of, the CAB or its Chief Bureau Officer or any member of the CAB, including court proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, Revenue Acts or Social Welfare Acts. The scheme also includes: *social welfare appeals made to the Circuit Court under Section 34 of the Social Welfare Act 1997; *tax appeals made to the Circuit Court under the Taxes Acts where the CAB or its Chief Bureau Officer or any member of the CAB is the respondent and/or defendant; and *applications made by the Director of Public Prosecutions under Section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 The Ad Hoc Legal Aid Scheme provides that the grant of legal aid, including the level of legal representation and/or witness expenses allowed, is a matter for the court with the appropriate jurisdiction to deal with the specific case. The calculation of fees which apply to counsel representing the legally aided person is made in accordance with the mechanism which is in operation under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 and the Regulations made under that Act. The CAB Ad Hoc Legal Aid Scheme cost €334,000 in 2009, up 18% from the previous year's figure of €283,000. It cost €257,000 in 2010. In October 2014, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform suggested that the State could cut its criminal legal aid bill by using the Criminal Assets Bureau to carry out a “more thorough” analysis of defendants’ ability to pay. ==Outcomes== From the Bureau's establishment in October 1996 up to end of 2011 the Bureau successfully froze over €70m worth of criminals' assets. It also collected €137m of the €200m demanded in unpaid taxes, interest and penalties. CAB also made social welfare savings of almost €6m and recovered over €2m in fraudulently claimed welfare. According to the Annual Report for 2017, the total amount of funds restrained was in excess of €4.8 million. However, one case currently under investigation accounts for approximately €3.5 million. Tax recovered by the Bureau during 2017 amounted to €2.374m from fifty one individuals / entities and as a result of actions by Social Welfare Bureau Officers, a total sum of €319,720.31 was returned to the Exchequer in 2017.http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/CAB%20Annual%20Report%202017.pdf/Files/CAB%20Annual%20Report%202017.pdf ==International cooperation== The statutory functions of the Criminal Assets Bureau include the taking of all necessary actions for the purpose of the freezing and confiscation of assets suspected of deriving from criminal activity and that such actions include, where appropriate, subject to any international agreement, cooperation with any police force or any authority outside Ireland which has functions related to the recovery of proceeds of crime. CAB represents Ireland at the Camden Assets Recovery Interagency Network (CARIN), a group which aims to improve informal cross-border and inter-agency cooperation within the European Union and elsewhere. CAB currently sits on the CARIN steering group. The CAB held the presidency of CARIN in 2005 and again in 2013. EU Council Decision 2007/845/JHA obliges Member States to set up or designate national Asset Recovery Offices (AROs) as national central contact points which facilitate, through enhanced cooperation, the fastest possible EU-wide tracing of assets derived from crime. This Decision was designed to complete the CARIN by providing a legal basis for the exchange of information between Asset Recovery Offices of all the Member States. The Decision allows the AROs to exchange information and best practices, both upon request and spontaneously, regardless of their status (administrative, law enforcement or judicial authority). It requests AROs to exchange information under the conditions laid down in Framework Decision 2006/960/JHA2 (\\"the Swedish Initiative\\") and in compliance with the applicable data protection provisions. Ireland designated the Criminal Assets Bureau as its ARO. In 2008 a Cross Border Fuel Fraud Enforcement Group was established by the Northern Ireland Security Minister, Paul Goggins, and operates under the auspices of the Organised Crime Task Force. On this group, which is chaired by HM Revenue and Customs, sits the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), the Northern Ireland Environment Agency together with the CAB, the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda Síochána. The Criminal Assets Bureau is also represented on the Joint Agency Task Force, which was created under the \\"Fresh Start Agreement\\" to identify strategic priorities for combatting cross-border organised crime and to oversee operational co-ordination. The CAB is a member partner of Organised Crime Portfolio (OCP) (HOME/2011/ISEC/AG/FINEC/400000222) which is funded by EU Commission, DG Home Affairs and is carried out by an international consortium coordinated by Transcrime – Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (Milan, Italy). The aims of the project are to study the investments of organised crime in European Union Member States, analyse the infiltration of organised crime groups and assess the impact on legitimate markets. ==See also== *: Agence de recouvrement des avoirs saisis et confisqués (AGRASC) *: Bureau Ontnemingswetgeving Openbaar Ministerie (BOOM) (Criminal Assets Deprivation Bureau) *: Assets Recovery Agency (ARA) *Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation (GBFI) ==References== ==External links – Annual Reports== *CAB Annual Report 2003 *CAB Annual Report 2004 *CAB Annual Report 2005 *CAB Annual Report 2006 *CAB Annual Report 2007 *CAB Annual Report 2008 *CAB Annual Report 2009 *CAB Annual Report 2010 *CAB Annual Report 2011 *CAB Annual Report 2012 *CAB Annual Report 2013 *CAB Annual Report 2014 *CAB Annual Report 2015 *CAB Annual Report 2016 *CAB Annual Report 2017 *CAB Annual Report 2018 ==External links – Other== *Tribunal of Inquiry Into Certain Planning Matters and Payments Category:Government agencies of the Republic of Ireland Category:Law enforcement agencies of the Republic of Ireland Category:Asset forfeiture ","title":"Criminal Assets Bureau"},{"id":"1277251","text":"Dorsey Station in Manitoba, Canada An HVDC converter station (or simply converter station) is a specialised type of substation which forms the terminal equipment for a high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission line.Arrillaga, Jos; High Voltage Direct Current Transmission, second edition, Institution of Electrical Engineers, , 1998. It converts direct current to alternating current or the reverse. In addition to the converter, the station usually contains: * three-phase alternating current switch gear * transformers * capacitors or synchronous condensers for reactive power * filters for harmonic suppression, and * direct current switch gear. ==Components== ===Converter=== Valve hall at Henday converter station, part of the Nelson River DC Transmission System in Canada. The converter is usually installed in a building called the valve hall. Early HVDC systems used mercury-arc valves, but since the mid-1970s, solid state devices such as thyristors have been used. Converters using thyristors or mercury-arc valves are known as line commutated converters. In thyristor-based converters, many thyristors are connected in series to form a thyristor valve, and each converter normally consists of six or twelve thyristor valves. The thyristor valves are usually grouped in pairs or groups of four and can stand on insulators on the floor or hang from insulators from the ceiling. Line commutated converters require voltage from the AC network for commutation, but since the late 1990s, voltage sourced converters have started to be used for HVDC. Voltage sourced converters use insulated-gate bipolar transistors instead of thyristors, and these can provide power to a deenergized AC system. Almost all converters used for HVDC are intrinsically able to operate with power conversion in either direction. Power conversion from AC to DC is called rectification and conversion from DC to AC is called inversion. ===DC equipment=== HVDC cable termination and DC smoothing reactor on the Baltic Cable HVDC link. The direct current equipment often includes a coil (called a reactor) that adds inductance in series with the DC line to help smooth the direct current. The inductance typically amounts to between 0.1 H and 1 H. The smoothing reactor can have either an air-core or an iron-core. Iron-core coils look like oil- filled high voltage transformers. Air-core smoothing coils resemble, but are considerably larger than, carrier frequency choke coils in high voltage transmission lines and are supported by insulators. Air coils have the advantage of generating less acoustical noise than iron-core coils, they eliminate the potential environmental hazard of spilled oil, and they do not saturate under transient high current fault conditions. This part of the plant will also contain instruments for measurement of direct current and voltage. Special direct current filters are used to eliminate high frequency interference. Such filters are required if the transmission line will use power-line communication techniques for communication and control, or if the overhead line will run through populated areas. These filters can be passive LC filters or active filters, consisting of an amplifier coupled through transformers and protection capacitors, which gives a signal out of phase to the interference signal on the line, thereby cancelling it. Such a system was used on the Baltic Cable HVDC project. ===Converter transformer=== A single- phase, three-winding converter transformer. The converter transformers step up the voltage of the AC supply network. Using a star-to-delta or \\"wye-delta\\" connection of the transformer windings, the converter can operate with 12 pulses for each cycle in the AC supply, which eliminates numerous harmonic current components. The insulation of the transformer windings must be specially designed to withstand a large DC potential to earth. Converter transformers can be built as large as 300 Mega volt amperes (MW) as a single unit. It is impractical to transport larger transformers, so when larger ratings are required, several individual transformers are connected together. Either two three-phase units or three single-phase units can be used. With the latter variant only one type of transformer is used, making the supply of a spare transformer more economical. Converter transformers operate with high flux Power Steps In the Four Steps of the Converter per cycle, and so produce more acoustic noise than normal three-phase power transformers. This effect should be considered in the siting of an HVDC converter station. Noise- reducing enclosures may be applied. ===Reactive power=== When line commutated converters are used, the converter station will require between 40% and 60% of its power rating as reactive power. This can be provided by banks of switched capacitors or by synchronous condensers, or if a suitable power generating station is located close to the static inverter plant, the generators in the power station. The demand for reactive power can be reduced if the converter transformers have on-load tap changers with a sufficient range of taps for AC voltage control. Some of the reactive power requirement can be supplied in the harmonic filter components. Voltage sourced converters can generate or absorb reactive as well as real power, and additional reactive power equipment is generally not needed. ===Harmonic filters === Harmonic filters are necessary for the elimination of the harmonic waves and for the production of the reactive power at line commutated converter stations. At plants with six pulse line commutated converters, complex harmonic filters are necessary because there are odd numbered harmonics of the orders and produced on the AC side and even harmonics of order on the DC side. At 12 pulse converter stations, only harmonic voltages or currents of the order and (on the AC side) or (on the DC side) result. Filters are tuned to the expected harmonic frequencies and consist of series combinations of capacitors and inductors. Voltage sourced converters generally produce lower intensity harmonics than line commutated converters. As a result, harmonic filters are generally smaller or may be omitted altogether. Beside the harmonic filters, equipment is also provided to eliminate spurious signals in the frequency range of power-line carrier equipment in the range of 30 kHz to 500 kHz. These filters are usually near the alternating current terminal of the static inverter transformer. They consist of a coil which passes the load current, with a parallel capacitor to form a resonant circuit. In special cases, it may be possible to use exclusively machines for generating the reactive power. This is realized at the terminal of HVDC Volgograd-Donbass situated on Volga Hydroelectric Station. ===AC switchgear=== The three-phase alternating current switch gear of a converter station is similar to that of an AC substation. It will contain circuit breakers for overcurrent protection of the converter transformers, isolating switches, grounding switches, and instrument transformers for control, measurement and protection. The station will also have lightning arresters for protection of the AC equipment from lightning surges on the AC system. ==Others== ===Required area=== The area required for a converter station is much larger than a conventional transformer, for example a site with a transmission rating of 600 megawatts and a transmission voltage of 400 kV is approximately 300 x 300 metres (1000 x 1000 feet). Lower-voltage plants may require somewhat less ground area, since less air space clearance would be required around outdoor high-voltage equipment. ===Location factors=== Converter stations produce acoustic noise. Converter stations can generate serious levels of radio-frequency interference, so include design features to control these emissions. Walls may provide noise protection. As with all AC substations, oil from equipment must be prevented from contaminating ground water in case of a spill. Substantial area may be required for overhead transmission lines, but can be reduced if underground cable is used. ==See also== *List of HVDC projects *Rotary converter plant *High-voltage transformer fire barriers ==References== Category:High-voltage direct current Category:Electric power conversion ","title":"HVDC converter station"},{"id":"1277259","text":"Pandemonium! is a 1996 platform video game developed by Toys for Bob and published by Crystal Dynamics for the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Microsoft Windows, N-Gage, Mobile and iOS. Pandemonium! features Fargus, a joker, and Nikki, a sorceress, who unwittingly casts a spell that destroys the town. The goal of the game is to reach the Wishing Engine, where they can wish the town back to normal. For each level, the player can choose which character to be. Each has a special move – Fargus can deliver a special spinning attack, and Nikki can double jump. The game consists of a great variety of unique gameplay objects, such as watermelons, clouds, spider webs and logs. A sequel, Pandemonium 2 (Miracle Jumpers in Japan), was released in 1997 for PlayStation and Microsoft Windows. == Gameplay == Pandemonium! employs 2.5D gameplay; while the game renders polygons in a typical 3D fashion, gameplay is 2D. The area of gameplay is as a two-dimensional surface twisting and bending in a three-dimensional world. Occasionally, this surface will overlap itself. There are segments where the path branches, allowing the player to choose their course. Enemies are generally defeated through the usual platform jumping method of bouncing on the enemy's head. There are power-ups located in each level, with varying effects. One is a freeze ray which turns enemies into ice, while another is a shrink ray which reduces the size of enemies to the point where the player character can step on them. == Plot == In the land of Lyr, an unpopular carnival jester called Fargus, and his stick-puppet Sid, are seeking a new career. Meanwhile, a talented acrobat named Nikki, bored of carnival life, runs away to pursue her dream of being a wizard. Fargus, Sid, and Nikki meet at a \\"Wizards in Training\\" seminar at Lancelot Castle. The seminar turns out to be rather boring, so during a break Nikki and Fargus steal the speaker's spellbook and take it to the high balcony overlooking the village.\\"How it all Began...\\", Pandemonium! instruction manual. Pages 6-7. When Nikki begins practicing with the magical book, Fargus and Sid urge her to perform a 10th level spell. With a few magical words, a green monster called Yungo appears and consumes the entire village. They search the book for how to get rid of the monster. The book reveals that they'll have to obtain a wish from the Wishing Engine. With a map from the book to help them, they set off on their journey. When they find the Wishing Engine, it tells them to speak three wishes. Fargus wishes for a chicken just to confirm that it works. Nikki wishes that the village was returned to as it was before the spell was cast. Nikki and Fargus are then teleported back to the top of Lancelot Castle. Yungo spits out the village and is pulled back into his own dimension. Nikki ponders what happened to their third wish, and Fargus guiltily admits that out of desire to share his joy with the world, he wished that everyone back home could be just like him, inadvertently turning everyone in the village into Fargus clones. Nikki and Fargus resign themselves to another trip to the Wishing Engine. ==Development and release== Work on Pandemonium! began in December 1994, starting with two months spent on learning the dynamics of 3D games. The team concentrated on building a prototype level to demonstrate at Electronic Entertainment Expo 1995. Once this was done, set designers and artists were brought on to help create the bulk of the game, bringing the development team up to 30 people. Early in development it was planned to record hundreds of one-liners for the player characters, similar to the earlier Crystal Dynamics game Gex. According to lead designer Paul Reiche III, at the beginning of June 1996 the team decided they wanted the game to be released before Thanksgiving Day of that year and shifted into \\"high gear mode\\". The last 2-3 months of development were devoted to fine-tuning, balancing, and bug-fixing, in particular adjusting the level of detail on levels so as to maintain a consistent frame rate of 30 frames per second. Having decided to step down as a publisher and focus on development, Crystal Dynamics sold the publication rights for Pandemonium! to Electronic Arts once the game was finished. As usual for Crystal Dynamics games, the European publishing rights were given to BMG Interactive. However, BMG decided against publishing the Saturn version, so Sega of Europe purchased the rights from BMG and published that version. It was originally slated for release in May 1997, but was pushed back to the second half of June so that a bug could be fixed. The Saturn, PlayStation and PC versions have 18 levels, while the N-Gage version has 11. In the PlayStation and Saturn versions, progress is saved using a password system. The Japanese version of the game, called Magical Hoppers, has considerable changes to the story, characters and cutscenes and is distributed by Bandai. The PlayStation version was released to the PlayStation Store on October 8, 2009. ==Reception== The PlayStation version of Pandemonium received mixed to positive reviews. Critics generally said that while the gameplay is essentially 2D, the open, airy graphic designs and the exceptional camerawork make it easy for players to be caught in an illusion of 3D. Most found that the gameplay was lacking in innovation, though the diverse and surprising level designs made it enjoyable and relatively fresh. Some critics complained that the \\"boing\\" sound which accompanies each jump is annoying. GamePro concluded the game to be a mixed bag, and advised gamers to rent it to determine if it fits their interests. Dan Hsu of Electronic Gaming Monthly felt it had little to offer besides the graphics, but the other three members of the review team were much more enthusiastic, saying they particularly enjoyed searching out the levels' secrets. GameSpot gave it a largely negative review, arguing that the level design is flawed and the two playable characters are not differentiated enough. They criticized Burke Tresichmann's music for having tracks which are too juvenile and/or similar to his scores for The Horde and Captain Quazar. However, GamePro and Sushi-X of Electronic Gaming Monthly opined that the music was both well-done and consistently suited the tone. Next Generation summarized that \\"while Pandemonium keeps the player on rails, it's still an enjoyable and extremely colorful ride.\\" The Saturn version was also well-received, as critics agreed that despite the half a year that had passed since the game's release on PlayStation, it still held up well. Sega Saturn Magazine and Saturn Power both deemed it the first truly outstanding platform game for the Saturn. GamePro said that \\"It breaks little new ground beyond the cool perspectives, but the gameplay's meaty enough to hold your interest.\\" Sushi-X of Electronic Gaming Monthly said it \\"is a step above its PlayStation sibling\\", citing tighter controls. However, his co-reviewer Shawn Smith and GamePro both felt the PlayStation version was better, due to the port's slight decrease in graphical quality, though critics unanimously agreed that Crystal Dynamics had done an overall exemplary job of optimizing the game for the Saturn. ==Notes== == References == == External links == * * Pandemonium! at GameSpot Category:1996 video games Category:Crystal Dynamics games Category:Fantasy video games Category:IOS games Category:Mobile games Category:N-Gage games Category:N-Gage service games Category:Platform games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Sega Saturn games Category:Single- player video games Category:Square Enix franchises Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Video games scored by Burke Trieschmann Category:Video games with 2.5D graphics Category:Windows games Category:Toys for Bob games ","title":"Pandemonium!

A lift table is a device that employs a scissors mechanism to raise or lower goods and/or persons. Typically lift tables are used to raise large, heavy loads through relatively small distances. Common applications include pallet handling, vehicle loading and work positioning. Lift tables are a recommended way to help reduce incidents of musculoskeletal disorders by correctly re-positioning work at a suitable height for operators. Lift tables lend themselves to being easily adapted to a specific use. They can work in hostile environments, be manufactured in stainless steel and have equipment like conveyors, turn-tables, barriers and gates easily added to their deckplates. ==Use== Unimog 405/UGN on a lift table B-17 bomber Lift tables can come in a vast array of configurations and can be built to suit various highly specialized industrial processes. The most common lift table design incorporates hydraulic cylinders and an electrically powered pump to actuate the scissor lifting mechanism. Lift tables can also be driven by pneumatic sources, trapezoidal-threaded screw drives, push chains or by hydraulic foot pump when the load is not heavy. Lift tables can be mounted in a pit for floor-level loading, especially useful for access by manual pallet-pump trucks and the mobility impaired or wheelchair users.

Carrying the Glidrose Publications copyright, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Hodder & Stoughton and in the United States by Putnam. More so than any previous Bond novel, The Man from Barbarossa acknowledges then-current world events. The story begins in January 1991 just prior to the end of the Persian Gulf War, and later includes a description of the early stage of the war against Iraq. Gardner also predicted that hardliners within the Soviet Union might attempt a coup against the government, which did occur later in 1991 but under different circumstances. The book also strongly suggests that the Cold War was soon to end, which did occur that year in December. John Gardner has stated on many occasions that of the 007 novels he wrote, this is his favourite because it was different and had a more creative approach than all his previous attempts. Additionally, Gardner believes that of all his novels, this was Glidrose's favourite as well, although the American publishers took a strong dislike to it. Critics were mixed, with many feeling it was one of Gardner's lesser Bond novels. ==Plot summary== The Man from Barbarossa begins with a prelude that includes some background information on the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union codenamed Operation Barbarossa, the massacre at Babi Yar that occurred not long after, and information on Josif Voronstov, a fictional character said to be a deputy of real-life Paul Blobel who was primarily responsible for the massacre. When the story begins, an elderly American living in New Jersey is kidnapped by a Russian terrorist group called the \\"Scales of Justice\\". The man, Joel Penderek, was captured under the belief that he is Josif Voronstov, the war criminal partially responsible for the massacre at Babi Yar. The group demands the Soviet government put the man on trial for his crimes, and begins murdering government officials when leaders refuse and are slow to react. The situation is slightly more complicated as the CIA and the Mossad believe Voronstov to be a man located in Florida who they had under surveillance. Captain James Bond is partnered with an Israeli Mossad agent, Pete Natkowitz, and two agents from the French Secret Service, Henri Rampart and Stephanie Adoré. They are assigned to work with Bory Stepakov and his assistant Nina Bibikova from the KGB to infiltrate the Scales of Justice posing as a TV crew so as to discover their real motive. Accomplishing this, they learn that the group plans to sabotage perestroika and supply Iraq with nuclear weapons before the United Nations-led coalition invades. The man behind the Scales of Justice, General Yevgeny Yuskovich, is a cousin of Josif Voronstov who is identified as Joel Penderek. The trial was staged in order to shift focus away from Yuskovich's other plans. ==Characters== * James Bond * M * Bill Tanner * Miss Moneypenny * Josif Voronstov: Deputy to Paul Blobel, the instigator of the massacre at Babi Yar.

They usually only have sleeping space for two adults and often have a basic kitchen in the rear.\\"Nostalgia makes a comeback\\", RVBusiness, volume 59, number 3, June 2008 Teardrop trailers first became popular in the 1930s, when magazines such as Mechanix Illustrated published plans. The first teardrop designs incorporated standard 4 by 8-foot sheets of plywood with hardwood spars. Teardrop trailers remained popular until the mid-1960s, after which they disappeared from mainstream camping. However, in the late 1990s, plans became available on the Internet and in recent years teardrop trailers have made a resurgence and are again growing in popularity. A teardrop trailer is generally small, ranging from to in width and to in length. They are usually to in height. Wheels and tires are usually outside the body and are covered by fenders. Since teardrop trailers are so light, usually less than 1,000 pounds (450 kg), just about any vehicle can tow one and fuel consumption is minimally affected. There is room inside a teardrop trailer for two people to sleep, as well as storage for clothes and other items. Outside, in the rear under a hatch, there is usually a galley for cooking. Teardrop trailers tend to have lighting and other electrical power supplied by a storage battery, although some have mains power hookups like regular travel trailers. Some teardrop trailer owners participate in organized camping events for teardrop trailers, called \\"gatherings\\". The teardrop trailer phenomenon is not local to any one country. Builders reside throughout the Americas, Europe, Israel, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia. In Australia they are known as teardrop campers. Their popularity has resulted in the establishment of several commercial manufacturing organizations and in the import of some North American models. ==See also== == References == == External links == * dmoz: Teardrop Trailers Category:Caravans and travel trailers ","title":"Teardrop trailer"},{"id":"1277285","text":"The Monark 540 is a sailboat.

The group was started when Raines and Mercurio, childhood friends from affluent Chevy Chase, Maryland, moved to New Orleans together to attend college at Tulane and Loyola Universities, became enamored of the local funk scene, populated by such legendary acts as The Meters and Dirty Dozen Brass Band and inspired by local legends such as Professor Longhair. There they teamed with noted New Orleans drummer Stanton Moore, saxophonist/harmonica (now producer) Ben Ellman, Rich Vogel, and Theryl de Clouet. In 2004, the band parted ways with vocalist DeClouet, and continued as an instrumental group until 2007 when they released From The Corner to the Block featuring rappers ranging from Juvenile, Chali 2na, Boots Riley, and Lyrics Born. They continue to tour with different vocalists: 2011-2012 with Cyril Neville, 2011-2014 with Corey Glover, 2014 with Maggie Koerner, 2015-present with Erica Falls. They have also toured with trombonist Corey Henry from 2009-2016 and trumpet player Shamarr Allen from 2016 to present. They have been releasing albums consistently since 1996. ==Musical style== The band has developed a unique sound as a result of their influences, including: rock, funk, brass band, blues, jazz, hip hop, electronic, and world music. Many of their songs include performances by other artists of various styles of music, like hip-hop artists Boots Riley (of The Coup), Gift of Gab (of Blackalicious) and Chali 2na (of Jurassic 5), to vocalists Macy Gray, Mavis Staples, Allen Toussaint, Irma Thomas, David Shaw, Mystikal, Mannie Fresh, and JJ Grey & Mofro. On the European version of From the Corner to the Block there are two tracks more than on the US version. One of those tracks (\\"Valley Of Pain\\") features the German rapper Dendemann. ==Evolution== The band's sound has evolved from organic New Orleans funk to a more modern style, incorporating elements of hip hop, electronica, fusion, and jazz. This change has been largely characterized by the increased use of electronic effects on guitar, bass, saxophone, and drums. Drummer Stanton Moore uses phrase samplers to sample a rhythm which he can then play over, producing intricate and layered drum sounds. Ben Ellman, saxophonist and harmonica player, often distorts his instruments to the degree that they sound similar to an electric guitar. In 2007, the band began to produce their own albums (mainly Ben Ellman and Robert Mercurio). This opened them up to more studio experimentation and exploration resulting in their loop, edit and production heavy album YA-KA- MA. == Tipitina's == The band has long considered the legendary New Orleans music venue Tipitina's an unofficial home base, having recorded a live album there and having performed there regularly since the beginning of their career. This includes annual performances on Halloween, New Year's Eve, during the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, and a yearly \\"sunrise set\\" on Lundi Gras (the day preceding Mardi Gras), appropriately playing until the sun rises on Mardi Gras day. In 2018, the members of the band made their association with the venue official, purchasing the venue from the previous owners, Mary and Roland Von Kurnatowski. ==Live performances== The band is also noted for inviting guest musicians from New Orleans to perform onstage with them. These include: the Soul Rebels Brass Band, The Neville Brothers, Brian Seeger, Corey \\"Boe Money\\" Henry, George Porter of The Meters, Dirty Dozen Brass Band and Skerik (a saxophone player who is actually based in Seattle, Washington, but is part of Stanton Moore's side project Garage A Trois). The band is often on tour, and have shared the stage with acts including Live, Counting Crows, the Allman Brothers Band, The Roots, Fusebox Funk, Widespread Panic, B.B. King, Mike Doughty (formerly of Soul Coughing), Gift of Gab (of Blackalicious), Jurassic 5, Jack Johnson, Gov’t Mule, The Revivalists, The Record Company, Trombone Shorty and Orleans Ave, Toots and the Maytals, and Steel Pulse. Galactic performed \\"I Got It (What You Need)\\" on Jimmy Kimmel Live in 2007. They also performed \\"Back That Ass Up\\" and \\"Rodeo\\" as Juvenile’s band on Jimmy Kimmel Live in 2006. Galactic toured North America in 2012 with Corey Glover and Soul Rebels Brass Band. On March 29, 2012 Galactic appeared with Soul Rebels Brass Band and Corey Glover on Conan show on TBS . In 2015, they performed Summer Festivals in the US, Canada, and Japan with vocalist Macy Gray. While on their 2016 tour, Galactic performed on marine themed call-in talkshow, FishCenter Live. They correctly guessed the coloration of a squirrelfish and won points for a zebra moray eel, Eel Hamburger. They will be headlining the 11th annual Rooster Walk Music and Arts Festival in Martinsville, VA in May 2019. ==Recent releases== Ya-Ka-May was released on Feb 9, 2010 on ANTI-. The album includes guest performances by a range of New Orleans musicians. Long-established performers such as Rebirth Brass Band, Irma Thomas, Big Chief Bo Dollis of The Wild Magnolias, Allen Toussaint and Walter \\"Wolfman\\" Washington are represented, along with younger performers in the traditional vein, such as Trombone Shorty and Corey Henry, John Boutté, Josh Cohen and Ryan Scully of Morning 40 Federation, and Glen David Andrews, and also Bounce artists Cheeky Blakk, Big Freedia, Katey Red, and Sissy Nobby. Galactic released a live album in May 2011 titled The Other Side of Midnight: Live in New Orleans.This album includes live versions of many songs on Ya-Ka-May. On February 21, 2012 Galactic released a new studio album titled Carnivale Electricos which focused on the theme of Carnivale. They invited artists from New Orleans to flesh out the diversity of the town's music in a virtual Fat Tuesday strut across town: the battle chant of Mardi Gras Indian War Chief Juan Pardo and the Golden Comanches; the voice of Mystikal; and the 40-piece Kipp Renaissance High School marching band. For \\"Voyage Ton Flag\\" they sampled the late accordionist Clifton Chenier and carnival-rock number \\"Hey Na Na (Hey Na)\\" with David Shaw of New Orleans's Revivalists. Brazil is represented by samba poet Moyseis Marques on \\"O Coco da Galinha\\" and by Casa Samba, who retake the forro \\"Magalenha...\\" The LP has been described by the band as \\"a tour\\" through New Orleans' various styles of music. Greenhaus, Mike https://relix.com/articles/detail/the-core-galactic/ Relix On July 17, 2015, Galactic released a new studio album titled Into the Deep. It featured Macy Gray, J.J. Grey, David Shaw, Maggie Koerner, and Mavis Staples. On February 7, 2020, Galactic released a new single titled \\"Float Up\\". The track features Anjelika Jelly Joseph. ==Discography== * Coolin' Off (Fog City, 1996) * Crazyhorse Mongoose (Capricorn, 1998) * Late for the Future (Polygram, 2000) * We Love 'Em Tonight: Live at Tipitina's (Volcano, 2001) * Vintage Reserve (Volcano, 2003) * Ruckus (Sanctuary, 2003) * From the Corner to the Block (2007) * Goin' Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino (Vanguard, 2007) Performing \\"Going to the River\\" with Robbie Robertson and \\"So Long\\" with Big Chief Monk Boudreaux. * Ya-Ka-May (Anti, 2010) U.S. Billboard Chart No. 161 * The Other Side of Midnight: Live in New Orleans (Anti, 2011) * Carnivale Electricos (Anti, 2012) - Charted at No. 118 on Billboard * Into the Deep (Provogue, 2015) * Already Ready Already (Tchoup-zilla Records, 2019) ==References== ==External links== * Official web site * * Category:American funk musical groups Category:Rock music groups from Louisiana Category:Jam bands Category:Musical groups from New Orleans Category:Capricorn Records artists ","title":"Galactic"},{"id":"1277287","text":"Death Is Forever, first published in 1992, was the twelfth novel by John Gardner to feature Ian Fleming's secret agent, James Bond (including Gardner's novelization of Licence to Kill). Carrying the Glidrose Publications copyright, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Hodder & Stoughton and in the United States by Putnam. Death Is Forever is significant as the first James Bond novel to be published after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, two elements that were part and parcel of Bond's creation 40 years earlier. ==Plot summary== The aftermath of the Cold War provides the setting for the plot of Death Is Forever. After the deaths of a British Intelligence agent and an American agent with the CIA working in Germany under mysterious and surprisingly old-fashioned circumstances, James Bond and CIA agent Elizabeth Zara (\\"Easy\\") St. John are assigned to track down the surviving members of \\"Cabal\\", a Cold War-era intelligence network that received a mysterious and unauthorised signal to disband. Soon, Bond finds himself playing a life-or-death game of \\"Who do You Trust?\\" as he and Easy track down Wolfgang Weisen, the power responsible for killing off Cabal's members one by one. Bond uncovers Weisen's plot to kill off the heads of each European country during the inaugural run of the Eurostar from London to Paris in an effort to create havoc in the west and usher in a second era of Communism. More than most other Gardner novels, Death Is Forever is grounded in contemporary events, with the fallout from the end of the Cold War and the failed 1991 Russian coup being important backdrops to the story. The Eurotunnel connecting England and France, which was still under construction at the time the book was written, also serves as a major setting. ==Publication history== * UK first hardback edition: July 1992 Hodder & Stoughton * U.S. first hardback edition: June 1992 Putnam * UK first paperback edition: July 1993 Coronet Books * U.S. first paperback edition: August 1993 Berkley Books ==See also== * Outline of James Bond ==References== Category:1992 British novels Category:James Bond books Category:Novels by John Gardner (British writer) Category:Hodder & Stoughton books ","title":"Death Is Forever"},{"id":"1277288","text":"==Events== Furness Railway No. 3, entered service February 1846 in the north of England ===January events=== * January 13 – Opening of the Milan–Venice railway's bridge over the Venetian Lagoon between Mestre and Venice in Italy. ===March events=== * March 26 – John M.

The valves consist of thyristors, or at older plants, mercury arc rectifiers. Mercury arc rectifiers are usually supported by insulators mounted on the floor, while thyristor valves may be either supported by insulators or hung from the roof of the valve hall. The latter required a stronger ceiling structure, however the hall and the static inverter can better survive earthquakes compared to valve structures standing on the floor. A valve hall is equipped with heating and cooling equipment to control the temperature of the mercury arc rectifiers (which operate best over a narrow temperature range) or thyristors. The valve hall also protects the valves from weather and dust.K. R. Padiyar , HVDC power transmission systems: technology and system interactions New Age International, 1990 , page 30 Several valve assemblies, connected in series for the required terminal voltage, may be installed in the valve hall building. High voltage bushings are supported through the walls of the valve hall, to allow connections between the converter transformers on the one side and the DC switchyard on the other. Beside the valve hall there is often an additional building, in which are control electronics, equipment for valve cooling and valve monitoring, station service power distribution, and amenities for the plant workers. Because very high voltages are present while the inverters are in operation, access to the valve halls is limited while the static inverter is running. The auxiliary control building may have windows to observe the valve hall, but usually the converter is remotely controlled. To protect communication systems from electromagnetic interference, valve hall buildings must have shielding installed to control emission of radio-frequency energy. J. Arrillaga, Y. H. Liu, N. R. Watson Flexible power transmission: the HVDC options , John Wiley and Sons, 2007 page 226 At some HVDC converters such as at Cabora-Bassa, outdoor valves are installed in oil-immersed containers.

When Laura March, on leave from the British Security Service, is murdered in Switzerland with a poison pellet shot from a powerful air rifle, James Bond and Swiss agent Fredericka \\"Flicka\\" von Grüsse are called in to investigate. While at Laura's funeral, Bond notices among the wreaths a perfect white rose, its petals tipped blood-red and an ambiguous note wired to the stem. His investigation reveals an identical rose and note at the funerals of four high- profile personalities, all assassinated with a week. With no group claiming responsibility for the deaths, Bond focuses on Laura's case as an entrée to tracking the murderous spree. He uncovers her recently dissolved love affair with the world-famous actor David Dragonpol, now an eccentric collector of theatre memorabilia living in a castle on the Rhine. Bond and Flicka go undercover to search the castle for clues, and in the garden find roses just like the ones at each of the funerals. Their joint discovery leads to a manhunt in which the identity of the serial killer is revealed.

At that time, he struck up a relationship with then University of New Orleans coach Tim Floyd, who recognized Cato's potential. In 1994, Floyd took over as head coach at Iowa State University and convinced Cato to transfer to Iowa State. Cato averaged 11 points, eight rebounds and four blocks per game for an Iowa State team that reached the Sweet Sixteen of the 1997 NCAA Basketball Tournament. == NBA career == Drafted 15th overall in the 1997 NBA Draft by the Dallas Mavericks, Cato's draft rights were immediately traded to the Portland Trail Blazers for the draft rights to Chris Anstey and cash considerations. Cato averaged 3.8 and 3.5 points per game in his two seasons in Portland before being bundled in a six-for-one deal with the Houston Rockets that sent Scottie Pippen to the Blazers. He spent five years in Houston, averaging a career-high 8.7 points per game in 1999-2000, and started all but two of the games he played in both the 2001-02 and 2003-04 seasons. On October 28, 1999, Cato signed a six-year, $42,000,000 contract extension that increased in controversy as his playing statistics cooled. With Yao Ming as the Rockets' new starting center, the Rockets traded Cato in a seven-player deal that sent Steve Francis, Cuttino Mobley, and Cato to the Orlando Magic for Tracy McGrady, Juwan Howard, Tyronn Lue, and Reece Gaines. While he started 50 games in the 2004-05 season for the Magic, his playing minutes went down significantly the following season as he battled shoulder injuries. On February 15, 2006, Cato, along with the Magic's first-round pick in the 2007 NBA Draft, was traded to the Detroit Pistons for center Darko Miličić and point guard Carlos Arroyo.

The campaign was fought by the Axis powers of Germany and Romania against the Soviet Union for control of Sevastopol, a port in the Crimea on the Black Sea. On 22 June 1941 the Axis invaded the Soviet Union during Operation Barbarossa. Axis land forces reached the Crimea in the autumn of 1941 and overran most of the area. The only objective not in Axis hands was Sevastopol. Several attempts were made to secure the city in October and November 1941. A major attack was planned for late November, but heavy rains delayed it until 17 December 1941. Under the command of Erich von Manstein, Axis forces were unable to capture Sevastopol during this first operation. Soviet forces launched an amphibious landing on the Crimean peninsula at Kerch in December 1941 to relieve the siege and force the Axis to divert forces to defend their gains. The operation saved Sevastopol for the time being, but the bridgehead in the eastern Crimea was eliminated in May 1942. After the failure of their first assault on Sevastopol, the Axis opted to conduct siege warfare until the middle of 1942, at which point they attacked the encircled Soviet forces by land, sea, and air. On 2 June 1942, the Axis began this operation, codenamed Störfang (Sturgeon Catch). The Soviet Red Army and Black Sea Fleet held out for weeks under intense Axis bombardment. The German Air Force (Luftwaffe) played a vital part in the siege, its 8th Air Corps bombing the besieged Soviet forces with impunity, flying 23,751 sorties and dropping 20,528 tons of bombs in June alone. The intensity of the German airstrikes was far beyond previous German bombing offensives against cities such as Warsaw, Rotterdam or London. At the end of the siege, there were only 11 undamaged buildings left in Sevastopol. The Luftwaffe sank or deterred most Soviet attempts to evacuate their troops by sea. The German 11th Army suppressed and destroyed the defenders by firing 46,750 tons of artillery ammunition on them during Störfang. Finally, on 4 July 1942, the remaining Soviet forces surrendered and the Germans seized the port. The Soviet Separate Coastal Army was annihilated, with 118,000 men killed, wounded or captured in the final assault and 200,481 casualties in the siege as a whole for both it and the Soviet Black Sea Fleet. Axis losses in Störfang amounted to 35,866 men, of whom 27,412 were German and 8,454 Romanian. With the Soviet forces neutralized, the Axis refocused their attention on the major summer campaign of that year, Case Blue and the advance to the Caucasus oilfields. ==Background== The Soviet naval base at Sevastopol was one of the strongest fortifications in the world. Its site, on a deeply eroded, bare limestone promontory at the southwestern tip of the Crimea made an approach by land forces exceedingly difficult. The high-level cliffs overlooking Severnaya Bay protected the anchorage, making an amphibious landing just as dangerous. The Soviet Navy had built upon these natural defenses by modernizing the port and installing heavy coastal batteries consisting of 188mm and 305mm re-purposed battleship guns which were capable of firing inland as well as out to sea. The artillery emplacements were protected by reinforced concrete fortifications and 9.8 inch thick armored turrets. The port was a valuable target. Its importance as a potential naval and air base would enable the Axis to conduct far-ranging sea and air operations against Soviet targets into and over the Caucasus ports and mountains.Dear and Foot 2005, p. 774. The Red Air Force had been using the Crimea as a base to attack targets in Romania since the Axis invasion in June 1941, proving its usefulness as an air base.Bergstrom 2007, p. 43. Likewise, the Wehrmacht had launched a bombing raid on the Sevastopol naval base at the start of the invasion.Beevor 2012, p. 191. Since the beginning of Barbarossa, the offensive against the USSR had not really addressed the Crimea as an objective. German planners assumed the area would be captured in mopping-up operations once the bulk of the Red Army was destroyed west of the Dnieper river. But in June, attacks by Soviet aircraft from the Crimea against Romania's oil refineries destroyed 12,000 tons of oil. Hitler described the area as an \\"unsinkable aircraft carrier\\" and ordered the conquest of Ukraine and Crimea as vital targets in the Directive 33, dated 23 July 1941.Forczyk 2008, p. 6. The Command of the Army (OKH) issued orders that the Crimea was to be captured as soon as possible to prevent attacks on Romanian oil supplies, vital to the German military. Hitler, impatient with obstruction to his commands to advance in the south, repeated on 12 August his desire that the Crimea be taken immediately. Over a month later, during the capture of Kiev, Generaloberst Erich von Manstein was given command of the German 11th Army on 17 September. After only a week in command, he launched an assault upon the Crimea. After severe fighting, Manstein's forces defeated several Soviet counteroffensives and destroyed two Soviet armies. By 16 November, the Wehrmacht had cleared the region, capturing its capital Simferopol, on 1 November. The fall of Kerch on 16 November left only Sevastopol in Soviet hands.Forczyk 2008, p. 8–9. By the end of October 1941, Major-General Ivan Yefimovich Petrov's Independent Coastal Army, numbering 32,000 men, had arrived at Sevastopol by sea from Odessa further west, it having been evacuated after heavy fighting. Petrov set about fortifying the inland approaches to Sevastopol. He aimed to halt the Axis drive on the port by creating three defence lines inland, the outermost arc being 16 km (10 mi) from the port itself. Soviet forces, including the Soviet 51st Army and elements of the Black Sea Fleet, were defeated in the Crimea in October and were evacuated in December, leaving Petrov's force as Sevastopol's main defence force. Having cleared the rest of the Crimea between 26 September – 16 November, the Romanian 3rd Army and German 11th Army prepared for an attack on the port. The German 11 Army was the weakest on the entire front, initially containing only seven infantry divisions. The Romanians contributed a large force, but were only lightly equipped and generally lacked heavy artillery. The weather turned against the Axis in mid-October and torrential downpours delayed the buildup. This gave Vice Admiral Filipp Oktyabrsky, commander of the Black Sea Fleet, time to bring in men and materiel from Novorossiysk. By 17 December, the weather had cleared sufficiently for the Axis to begin a major operation.Dear and Foot 2005, p. 775. ==Forces involved== ===Axis=== The German 11th Army, commanded by Erich von Manstein, besieged Sevastopol. At the time of the final assault in June 1942, 11th Army consisted of nine German infantry divisions in two Corps, and one Romanian Corps, being the Romanian 7th Mountain Corps. Significant support was given by the Luftwaffe. The Oberkommando der Luftwaffe dispatched Luftflotte 4 (Air Fleet 4) 8th Air Corps for support. It consisted of nine Geschwader (Wings) containing 600 aircraft, all coming under the command of Generaloberst (General Colonel) Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen. Among this contingent was a powerful concentration of medium bomber, dive bomber, and torpedo bomber Geschwader.Bergstrom 2007, p. 42. Naval support came from the Italian 101st Squadron under Francesco Mimbelli. It consisted of four motor torpedo boats, five explosive motorboats, six CB class midget submarines, and a number of 35-ton coastal submarines and MAS boats. This force was the only Axis naval force deployed during the siege.Forczyk 2008, p. 48. Although Bulgaria was not technically at war with the Soviet Union, its naval staff worked closely with the Wehrmacht, and despite not being committed to combat, they provided bases for the Axis naval command (Admiral Schwarzes Meer, Admiral of the Black Sea) to operate in the waters of the Black Sea.Hayward 1998, pp. 50–51.

The defence of Sevastopol was provided mainly by the Black Sea Fleet and the Separate Coastal Army under Ivan Yefimovich Petrov (which had been shipped in from the Siege of Odessa). The Black Sea Fleet sent 49,372 personnel to fight as infantry. Most were not trained for ground combat, and the act was an ad hoc emergency measure. The naval brigades formed had four to six battalions of 4,000 men, allowing them to absorb significant losses. These forces were well armed, having a variety of artillery and mortar battalions. Almost 20 percent of the Coastal Army were naval personnel. In the Separate Coastal Army, the strongest divisions were the 95th, 109th, 172nd, and 388th Rifle Divisions. They each had around 7,000 soldiers, the rest of the Red Army units having around 5,000 personnel. Some 5,000 reinforcements made it into Sevastopol in May 1942. However, Petrov's army lacked tanks and anti-aircraft guns. The garrison also lacked food supplies and mortar ammunition, which would severely sap Soviet strength. Poor communications between headquarters and the front lines were also an issue. Petrov found it difficult to respond to Axis attacks quickly.Forzcyk 2008, pp. 30–31.

The cities of Perekop and Ishun guarded the narrow corridor of land which linked the Crimea to the bulk of Ukraine. Erick-Oskar Hansen's LIV Corps, with its 45th and 73rd Infantry Divisions, broke through at Perekop at the cost of 2,641 casualties in six days of fighting. The Soviet forces launched a counteroffensive against the 11th Army's flank at Melitopol. Manstein withdrew his other corps in order to deal with it. The resulting battle ended with the destruction of two attacking Soviet Armies. By the time that this threat had been dealt with, the Stavka had rushed in reinforcements and established another defence line at Ishun. Ordered to concentrate on the Crimea once more, Manstein launched his LIV Corps, this time with the support of the German 22nd Infantry Division, into the assault. The Soviet forces enjoyed local air superiority and armored reserves. They also outnumbered the attacking Wehrmacht. In spite of this, the defending Soviet 51st Army was pushed back. The Wehrmacht suffered 5,376 casualties in 12 days of combat, and the Red Army many more. By the end of October, the 51st Army was crushed and in full retreat into the Crimea. The situation in the air also changed. Arriving Jagdgeschwader (Fighter Wings) won air superiority for the Axis.Forczyk 2008, pp. 8–9. On 22 and 23 October, Jagdgeschwader 3 (JG 3), JG 52, and JG 77 crippled the Soviet air strength in the Crimea. Over the two days they destroyed 33 Soviet aircraft for one loss. In the six days from 18 to 24 October 140 Soviet aircraft were lost, 124 of them to Luftwaffe fighters. Heinkel He 111s of KG 26 and KG 51 and Junkers Ju 87 Stukas of StG 77 were free to attack Soviet ground positions, contributing to the collapse of the Soviet Crimean Front on 27 October.Bergstrom 2007, p. 103. ===Sevastopol offensive=== ====Initial battles==== StG 77 on 12 November. With the front collapsing and the Axis closing in on Sevastopol, Vice-Admiral Oktyabrsky assumed command of the port on 4 November 1941. The city had a civilian population of 111,000 in 1941, and most were sent to work on the three defence lines around the port. Only the 7th and 8th Naval Infantry Brigades were available for combat in the port. More naval infantry were formed from ships in the harbor. The 8th Naval Infantry Brigade was sent to guard the northeastern approaches near the Mamachai-Belbek line. The 7th (5,200 men) was deployed in the center, near Mekenzyya. With only 20,000 soldiers, Oktyabrsky relied heavily on his 12 coastal battalions to slow down the Axis. The 62nd Fighter Brigade contributed 61 fighters, which were able to achieve temporary air superiority. On 30 October, the Soviet defences detected the spearhead of the German 132nd Infantry Division and shelled it at 12:30 on 1 November using Battery 30's 305mm coastal guns. The Germans designated the fort as Fort Maxim Gorky I. Wehrmacht lacked sufficient air and mobile units to force a decision. Instead, Manstein ordered Hansen's LIV Corps to head east down the Sevastopol- Simferopol rail line towards Yalta, while the 72nd Infantry Division was to head to Balaklava, effectively encircling Sevastopol. Once there, it would attack Sevastopol from the east. The 132nd made reasonable progress, but was stopped on 2 November by the 8th Naval Brigade. The Wehrmacht suffered 428 casualties. Manstein ordered a halt for a week, whilst bringing up reserves. Oktyabrsky used his fleet to bring in a further 23,000 men from the Caucasus. On 9 November, Petrov's Army was brought in, bringing 19,894 soldiers, ten T-26 tanks, 152 artillery pieces, and 200 mortars. The Red Army now had 52,000 troops in the area of the city. The Luftwaffe was considered weak (the bulk of it was engaged in the Battle of Moscow), so the Soviet Navy kept the heavy cruiser Krasny Kavkaz, light cruisers Krasny Krym and Chervona Ukraina, and seven destroyers to protect the port.Forczyk 2008, pp. 10–11. Soldiers from German supply units take cover among the rocks near Sevastopol, November 1941. The Luftwaffe did what it could to disrupt the Soviet defences. On 31 October, the destroyer Bodryy shelled German positions along the coastline. StG 77 Ju 87s attacked and wounded 50 of its crew by strafing her deck and superstructure with machinegun fire. On 2 November Junkers Ju 88s of KG 51 scored several hits on the cruiser Voroshilov, and put it out of action for months. On 7 November He 111s from KG 26 sank the liner Armeniya evacuating soldiers and civilians from Sevastopol, with only eight of the 5,000 passengers surviving. On 12 November, StG 77 sank the cruiser Chervona Ukraina, and KG 26 damaged the destroyers Sovershennyy and Besposhchadnyy. But with the Luftwaffe units being dispatched to other sectors and theatres, the Soviet forces again achieved air superiority with 59 aircraft (39 serviceable).Bergstrom 2007, p. 104. Manstein wanted to launch an attack as soon as possible, but his logistical lines were poor. Wanting to avoid strong Soviet forces protecting the north of the port, including the 95th Rifle Division, Manstein chose to press the center and southern Soviet defences. He ordered the German 50th Infantry Division to probe the center of the Soviet line east of the Chernaya river. The 132nd Infantry Division supported the probe and was able to push to within 4 kilometres of Severnaya Bay. The 72nd Rifle Division, with the support of the coastal batteries, moved in to stop the attack. The 72nd Infantry Division continued towards Balaklava, and the 22nd Infantry Division joined the assault. Assisted by shelling from two light cruisers and the battleship Parizhskaya Kommuna, the Red Army halted this attack, and Manstein called off the offensive on 21 November, having lost 2,000 men.Forczyk 2008, p. 11. ====December offensive==== Two German soldiers near Sevastopol, December 1941. Manstein recognised that he could not take the port quickly, and was going to have to organise a proper set-piece offensive. With German offensive operations suspended in December, Manstein found himself the only commander on the Eastern Front with an offensive mission. He was not ready to carry out his attack until 17 December. In the meantime, Oktyabrsky used the interval to sail the 11,000 soldiers of the 388th Rifle Division into Sevastopol between 7–13 December. Soviet engineers began laying extensive minefields and barbed-wire belts. By the time of the Axis attack, Petrov's force held a strong defensive position. The naval commander demanded that Petrov hold the coast along the northern flank of Sevastopol on the Belbek River in order to retain Coastal Battery 10, an artillery complex near Mamaschai. On the other hand, the German LIV Corps had only 15,551 men in its four infantry divisions (22nd, 24th, 50th, and 132nd). Over 7,000 soldiers in the German 11th Army were on the sick list at that time. It was also short of artillery ammunition and heavy artillery. In order to commit as many forces to the battle as possible, Manstein left the weak XLII Corps, containing just the 46th Infantry Division and two Romanian brigades, to protect the entire front from Yalta to Kerch.Forczyk 2008, p. 12. The attack began at 06:10 on 17 December. The 22nd Infantry Division attacked the 8th Naval Brigade on the Belbek River, pushing west towards the coast, while the 50th and 132nd Infantry Divisions conducted fixing attacks on the Soviet center. The 22nd succeeded in rolling up the flank of the Naval Brigade after five days of fighting. However, Oktyabrsky ordered its retirement south towards Sevastopol, abandoning Mamaschai and forming a new front north of Belbek city and the Belbek river. In the south, XXX Corps tried and failed to break through with the 72nd and 170th Infantry Divisions. Only minor gains were made against the 172nd Rifle Division, even with help from the Romanian 1st Mountain Brigade. The 79th Naval Brigade and 345th Rifle Division arrived by sea as reinforcements, using the long winter nights and their naval superiority. Meanwhile, the battleship Parizhskaya Kommuna shelled German forces whenever they threatened a breakthrough. The offensive came to an abrupt end when the Red Army staged an amphibious landing at Kerch.Forczyk 2008, p. 13. ===Kerch landing=== Between 26 and 30 December 1941, the USSR launched an amphibious assault on the Kerch peninsula to relieve the encircled Soviet forces at Sevastopol. It succeeded in gaining and sustaining a bridgehead for five months. However, a German−led counteroffensive named Operation Bustard Hunt destroyed the bridgehead and the three Soviet Armies supporting the landing in May 1942. This allowed Manstein to concentrate all of his resources against Sevastopol for the first time. The front over Sevastopol grew quiet and a stalemate ensued. The Luftwaffe kept up the pressure on Soviet sea communications and although supplies still made it through, Vice Admiral Oktyabrsky, commanding the Black Sea Fleet, was forced to reduce the number of coastal bombardment missions.Hayward 2001, p. 102. ==Second Axis offensive== ===Unternehmen Störfang=== ====Soviet defence==== A Soviet commissar with a machine gun team in Sevastopol in May 1942. Sevastopol was still a formidable obstacle. Its airfields provided a base for the Red Air Force to attack the Axis-held Soviet coastline and Romania proper. It was also home to the Black Sea Fleet. Its main fortifications were pointed seaward, while the land defences encircled the city at a distance of 15–20 km, with an inner defense belt at a range of 5 km. Enhancing the manmade defences was the forested, rugged terrain. To the north of Severnaya Bay there were 11 batteries and strongpoints. They were given morale-boosting names such as Stalin, Maxim Gorky I, Molotov, and Lenin. They were defended by the First Coastal Army.Brookes 2003, p. 80. Elsewhere, the Red Army had constructed hundreds of timber bunkers with machinegun nests and 45 mm anti-tank artillery. Along the outer belt, concrete bunkers were less common, 19 being stretched across its 37 km. Soviet engineers laid thousands of mines, including PMD-6 wooden anti- personnel mines, TMD-40 wooden anti-tank mines, and barbed-wire obstacle belts.Forczyk 2008, p. 31. Petrov, commanding the Independent Coastal Army, had a powerful artillery pool. Petrov had on strength some 455 artillery pieces and howitzers. Among those were 34 152 mm and 40 122 mm howitzers and 918 mortars. Ammunition was adequate for a battle of two weeks for these calibers, but 82 mm mortar ammunition was in short supply. The battles of the Crimean campaign had taken their toll, and scarcely any tank and anti-aircraft artillery support were available. A further force, under Major-General Petr Morgunov, was added. The Coastal Artillery Force was semi-independent for much of the siege, and had an initial strength of 12 batteries and 45 guns, although more were added during 1942. By the time of the German June offensive, the Soviet forces had available eight 305 mm, one 188 mm, 10 152 mm and 17 130 mm, three 120 mm, eight 100 mm, and four 45 mm guns. ====Axis forces==== German 11th Army soldiers approach burning Sevastopol in June 1942. By this time, the Axis was facing a serious manpower and artillery shortage. The German 11th Army's divisions had anywhere between 35 and 75 percent of their initial strength. The German 22nd Infantry Division was the strongest division, and was only short 1,750 personnel, while the weakest was the 132nd Infantry Division, which was short 2,300 men. The 170th Infantry Division had to collapse one of its regiments to bring the others up to strength. The German infantry force was a fragile force at Sevastopol and Manstein could not afford to squander it. German doctrine stressed bypassing strongpoints, but since this was not possible, German infantry were forced to reduce one fort after another. Some 65 Sturmgeschütz III assault guns were available to support them.Forczyk 2008, p. 26. The assault was based around battalion- strength infantry assault groups supported by a platoon of engineers and a few assault guns. Two pioneer battalions were attached to each division to spearhead the attack and break through fixed and fortified defences. The eight battalions of LIV Corps each contained around 386 men on average, and were equipped with 10–12 flame throwers, 28–30 mine detectors, 3,000 kg of high explosives, 2,200 hand grenades, and 500 smoke grenades. The 300th Panzer Battalion, a remote-controlled tank unit using the Goliath tracked mine, was made available for destroying fortifications. The total number of artillery pieces came to 785 German and 112 Romanian medium and heavy guns. Most of these were under the command of LIV Corps, the main assault force. To increase this arsenal, a number of super-heavy artillery pieces were made available. Three 600 mm Karl-Gerät self-propelled mortars (Thor, Odin, and one other) and one 800 mm gun (Schwerer Gustav), delivering 1.4 and 7 ton shells, respectively, and capable of destroying any fortification. However, the Karl- Gerät guns only had a range of between 4–6,000 meters, which made them vulnerable to counter-battery fire. Moreover, only 201 rounds of 600 mm and 48 round of 800 mm ammunition were available. Most of it was used up before the infantry assault.Forczyk 2008, pp. 27–28. He 111H on a torpedo training exercise, 10 October 1941. KG 26 gave the Luftwaffe some striking power against the Black Sea Fleet. More useful to the German infantry were the two 280 mm railway guns. Two 420 mm, two 355 mm howitzers were also available, along with four 305 mm mortars. Both of the 420 mm guns were of First World War vintage, short in range and with limited ammunition. Some nine 283 mm mortars were also available, but they were pre-1914 weapons and six had burst during firing. Artillery acquired from Czechoslovakia after the Munich Agreement, the Skoda 305 mm Model 1911 howitzer was also available. At the divisional level, 268 105 mm and 80 150 mm weapons were in service, including 126 Nebelwerfer infantry barrage rocket launchers. Overall, the German 11th Army's artillery was a collection of modern, obsolete, and foreign-built weapons.Forczyk 2008, p. 28. For the offensive, 183,750 rounds of 105 mm and 47,300 rounds of 150 mm ammunition were stockpiled, enough for 12 days of firing.Forczyk 2008, p. 29. To reinforce the 11th Army, the Romanians were committed to the assault. The Romanian 18th Infantry Division was at full strength, and plenty of Romanian infantry were available. However, the 18th Division was inexperienced and made up of reservists. The Romanian 1st Mountain Division was considered an elite force, and its addition was to prove useful. They had 112 guns available, but virtually no engineers. The weakness of their artillery and supporting arms made the Romanian X Corps reliant on the German forces for anything other than set-piece infantry attacks. The Luftwaffe had to compensate for the Axis artillery limitations. A powerful air armada was brought together. Under the 8th Air Corps, von Richthofen assembled six Kampfgruppen (Bomber Groups) originating from six different Kampfgeschwader (Bomber Wings): KG 51 Edelweiß, KG 76, KG 100, and III.Gruppe/LG 1 specialist training wing. Dive-bomber support from StG 77 was also given to Richthofen. He could call upon three gruppen of Ju 87s. Jagdgeschwader (Fighter Wings) JG 3 Udet and JG 77 Herz As were available for air superiority operations. II.Gruppe/KG 26 Löwe was also available for anti- shipping operations, in addition to the air-land effort carried out by the 8th Air Corps. Motoscafo Armato Silurante (MAS) boat. The Luftwaffe could not support the land assault and maintain pressure on Soviet sea communications alone. With only KG 26 engaged in anti-shipping operations against Soviet sea communications, the OKW looked to the Kriegsmarine to supply Schnellboot (S-Boat) motor torpedo boats to help eliminate Soviet shipping supplying and evacuating the port. The time it took to dismantle and move the 92-ton boats by rail to Romanian ports was going to be too long. In a rare appeal for help, the German forces turned to their Italian allies, aware of their expertise with motor torpedo boat operations. The Regia Marina sent the 101st Naval Squadron, which brought nine torpedo boats and nine coastal submarines under the command of the highly competent Capitano di Fregata Francesco Mimbelli. The Italian boats were only 24 tons and the submarines were 35 tons, which made them easier to transport by truck and barge. The squadron was based at Feodosiya and Yalta, which made it the only Axis naval force to participate in the siege.Forczyk 2008, p. 41. ===Battle=== ====Air offensive==== Satellite image of the Sevastopol area. Note the dense forest terrain situated on high ground and valleys to the east of the port. Manstein demanded an all-out assault by the Luftwaffe before the main ground action began. Situated only 70 km from Sevastopol, the German formations had barely enough time to reach altitude before reaching their targets. The 8th Air Corps began its bombing campaign along the north and southeast of the city. At the same time, German medium bombers conducted rolling attacks on the city, which included all units except LG 1, which engaged in suppressing anti-aircraft installations. Oil, electricity, water pumps, harbor facilities, and submarine bases were attacked by StG 77 Ju 87s. Von Richthofen watched the bombing from an observation post close to the front. The targets were badly damaged, and fires broke out all over the port city. The Luftwaffe flew 723 missions and dropped 525 tons of high explosive on the first day. Despite heavy anti-aircraft fire, just one Ju 87 was lost.Hayward 2001, p. 96. While the bulk of the Luftwaffe was busy with the land battle, III./KG 26 sought to break Soviet sea communications. They sank the tanker Mikhail Gromov, but the flotilla leader Tashkent, the destroyer Bezuprechnyy, and transport Abkhaziya escaped to bring 2,785 soldiers into the fortress. Air support continued with 643 sorties on 3 June, 585 on 4 June, and 555 on 5 June, with some German crews flying daily averages of 18 missions.Bergstrom 2007, p. 43. Stalingrad. By the start of the ground attack on 7 June, the Luftwaffe had flown 3,069 sorties and 2,264 tons of high explosive and 23,800 incendiary bombs were dropped. Many of the bombs dropped were 1,000 kg SC 1000, 1,400 kg SC 1400, and 2,500 kg SC 2500 bombs. The heavy-caliber weapons were aimed at Soviet concrete bunkers. Ivan Laskin, commanding the 172nd Rifle Division in the northern sector recalled, \\"Bombers in groups of twenty to thirty attacked us without caring for their targets. They came in, wave after wave, and literally ploughed up the earth throughout our defence area. German aircraft were in the air above our positions all day long. The sky was clouded by smoke from explosions of thousands of bombs and shells. An enormous dark grey cloud of smoke and dust rose higher and higher and finally eclipsed the sun\\". The German air campaign against Sevastopol in June 1942 surpassed by far the German bombings of Warsaw, Rotterdam or London. From 3 to 6 June, the Luftwaffe carried out 2,355 operations and dropped 1,800 tons of high explosives. On 7 June, Manstein ordered the ground assault. The Luftwaffe carried out 1,368 sorties and dropped 1,300 tons of bombs on Soviet positions, but the Soviet infantry clung on. ====Ground fighting: 7–10 June==== Destroyed Soviet bunker after the battle. LIV Corps was to strike the main blow. Situated on the northeast edge of the city, they struck along the lines of least resistance, across the Belbek river while the German XXX and Romanian Mountain Corps conducted holding attacks in the south and center, respectively. Both the latter corps did not start major operations until 8 June. The artillery bombardment targeted bunkers with 105 mm fire, which usually received 10–25 rounds. German Flak 36 37 mm guns also did an effective job of eliminating machinegun nests. The German forces were also quick to bring up 88 mm artillery guns to fire directly into bunker apertures. Between 2 and 6 June, the German 11th Army expended nine percent of its munitions (42,595 rounds, amounting to 2,449 tons of munitions) on pre-advance shelling. The railway guns also fired a few rounds at the main fortifications and rail lines, but most missed by some distance. The closest shell landed 80 meters away from its target. Soviet ammunition dumps were also targeted by these weapons, with no effect. The main fortifications, forts Stalin, Molotov, and Maxim Gorky (which lay in the path of LIV Corps) remained active. It was not until the afternoon of 6 June when a single 60 cm calibre mortar shell from the Karl-Gerät self-propelled mortar no. III, nicknamed Thor, knocked out Maxim Gorky's second turret, damaging the weapon. This was the only success of the German super-heavy guns, which did not have an impact commensurate with their expense. The Luftwaffe had a greater impact, using its Ju 87s to knock out the communications systems of the fort. A burning Soviet position. On the morning of 7 June 1942, the German infantry began advancing cautiously. XXX Corps attacked the southern positions held by the 7th Naval Brigade and 388th Rifle Division. The German infantry advanced behind air and artillery support. The infantry seemed afraid of their fire support and did not advance close enough behind it. The bombardment also failed to have enough of an effect. The Soviet forces held their fire until the German forces were well within range before opening fire, and little progress was made. Von Richthofen was angered by the fear of the infantry and called the day \\"a real disappointment\\".Hayward 2001, pp. 98–99 The next few days were not much better, despite the Luftwaffe flying 1,200 sorties. The pace of operations exhausted the machines and men. Often crews did not get out of their aircraft and made three or four sorties without rest.Hayward 2001, p. 99. LIV Corps began its assault in the north on the seam of the Soviet defence sectors III and IV. The 'Schwerer Gustav' weapon continued to fire against ammunition dumps, which produced no effect. Nevertheless, the 132nd Infantry Division was able to work its way up to the river. The 600 mm guns concentrated on the coastal batteries and Maxim Gorky fortress. Meanwhile, the German 22nd Infantry Division attacked further to the east. Some 200 Soviet reinforcements of the 79th Naval Infantry Brigade, protecting this sector, were lost in the bombardment, but the main defences held out. The brigade held most of its forces in reserve, while committing only a single company to cover the hilly terrain on the Belbek river front. German assault groups breached the first and reserve lines by 08:15. The German forces had to negotiate heavily mined areas, slowing them down and allowing the Soviet forces to make a partial recovery.Forzcyk 2008, p. 51. Supporting operations by the 50th and 24th German Infantry Divisions failed, which cost the Wehrmacht 12 StuG assault guns. The remote-control demolition units were not effective as the terrain was unsuitable.Forczyk 2008, p. 54. By 17:15 the town of Belbek was secured. The 22nd Infantry Division made considerable progress in breaking through the defenses of the 25th Rifle Division. The 50th Infantry Division supported the 22nd's left flank. Now facing the Germans was the Haccius Ridge, on which the fortress Maxim Gorky was located. It was flanked by several smaller forts to the east.Forzcyk 2008, p. 53. Now the 132nd Infantry Divisions was ordered to conduct a converging pincer movement on the Maxim Gorky fortress in conjunction with the 22nd and 50th Infantry Divisions, to trap its defenders against the coast. The 132nd pushed into the 95th Rifle Division's positions north of the fort, while the other two divisions attacked in a flanking move. While the Germans did make progress, nearing the main railway station just southeast of Maxim Gorky, they were stopped from achieving a full-scale breakthrough by the 172nd Rifle Division. The 22nd and 50th Infantry Divisions had been heavily shelled by mortar fire from the 25th Rifle Division facing them east of the Haccius Ridge, which caused heavy casualties. By 18:00 hours, the German attack was spent.Forzcyk 2008, p. 55. German soldier in Sevastopol harbor next to a sunken Soviet destroyer. LIV Corps' losses on 7 June amounted to 2,357 casualties in four divisions, including 340 killed. It had also expended 3,939 tons of ammunition. The 132nd Division had exhausted all of its basic munitions load by midday. On the other side, the formidable Soviet defence lines east and southeast of Belbek had been overrun, and the Germans succeeded in advancing 2 km through dense Soviet defences. The Soviet casualties had also been severe. It is estimated that three battalions were effectively destroyed. Manstein recognised the seriousness of the failure on 8 June. He was worried that the 132nd Infantry Division, locked in combat with the 79th Naval Brigade and 95th and 172nd Rifle Divisions north of the city on the Belbek river front, was \\"approaching the end of its strength\\". Once again, the army turned to the Luftwaffe for support. Richthofen responded by ordering attacks against Soviet supply lines. The same day, German bombers, including KG 100, began attacks on Soviet shipping. They sank the destroyer Sovershennyy and the survey vessel Gyuys, with the 4,727 ton transport Abkhaziya and destroyer Svobodnyy following them on 10 June. The period between 8–12 June descended into a battle of attrition. Several Soviet counterattacks were repulsed with heavy losses. The German LIV Corps extended the salient on the seam of the III and IV sector to 3 km, determined to break through before Petrov could reinforce his lines. The 132nd Infantry Division cleared the Haccius Ridge while the 22nd Infantry Division overran most of the Soviet 79th Naval Infantry Brigade. The Soviet unit tried counterattacking on 10 June, but was repulsed. The Soviet formation was effectively destroyed, with the support of the Luftwaffe, which used anti-personnel bombs against Soviet infantry caught in the open. Only one battalion (the Soviet 1st Batt./241st Rifle Regiment) was in a position to block the Germans from encircling the Maxim Gorky fort. Still, on 8 June LIV Corps had lost 1,700 men. In return, the lodgement in Soviet lines was extended to 3 km deep and 5 km wide.Forzcyk 2008, pp. 58–59. In the south, XXX Corps made no progress in four days of attacks. They suffered 496 casualties at the hands of the 109th Rifle Division. The 28th Light and 72nd Infantry Divisions had succeeded in puncturing the Soviet lines opposite the 109th and 388th Rifle Divisions. The outer defences were broken in some parts, but the most were still in Soviet hands on 12 June. The main belt on the Sapun Ridge (Sapun-gora) was unbroken. Soviet casualties amounted to 2,500, including 700 captured. By 13 June, XXX Corps had lost 2,659 men, including 394 killed.Forzcyk 2008, p. 61. ====Air- land operations: 11–15 June==== StuGIII. These vehicles helped knock out Fort Stalin. As the Germans made slow progress toward the main train station, Petrov withdrew the battered 172nd Rifle Division and replaced it with 345th Rifle Division. The 95th Rifle Division halted the 132nd Division's progress in the north. Although a relatively quiet day, 10 June saw the elimination of the Soviet 79th Naval Brigade and LIV Corps lost 2,772 men. Counterattacks by the Soviet 345th Division aimed at the hinge between the German 132nd and 50th Divisions were repulsed by the Luftwaffe. On 11–12 June, LIV Corps lost another 1,957 men. The Red Army had committed all of its reserves and were stretched dangerously thin. One more push might collapse the northern sector. But at this time, the tired German infantry were running short on reinforcements and ammunition.Forzcyk 2008, pp. 60–61 and Bergstrom 2007, p. 43. Stalingrad In contrast, the Black Sea Fleet was bringing in reinforcements through Luftwaffe attacks. On 12 June the cruiser Molotov and destroyer Bditel'nyy brought in 2,314 soldiers, 190 tons of ammunition and 28 artillery pieces. The Luftwaffe turned its attention to these convoys. On 13 June it sank the transports Gruzyia and TSch-27, patrol boat SKA-092, motor boat SP-40, five barges, and a floating crane. On 15 June another 3,400 soldiers, 442 tons of ammunition, 30 tons of fuel and 12 tons of provisions reinforced the Soviet positions. The Luftwaffe had flown 1,044 sorties on 11 June, dropping 954 tons of bombs. The consumption rate of ammunition was putting von Richthofen's logistical network under strain and he could no longer afford to fly massed bombing raids. On 11 June, he surmised there was less than two days worth of munitions left, requiring a change of tactics. Instead of carpet bombing, fewer targets would be attacked simultaneously, and aircraft would strike at designated targets in long and narrow lines. This was designed to maintain accurate pressure without wasting ordnance. Even this failed to alleviate shortages in the long term. By 17 June, scarcity of aviation fuel meant the Luftwaffe dropped only 800 instead of the planned 1,000 tons of bombs. Adding to the Luftwaffe's troubles in the sector, von Richthofen was transferred to prepare the Corps' Headquarters near Kursk support the nearing Operation Blue. He retained formal command, at least until given control of Luftflotte 4, but Wolfgang von Wild took over air operations over Sevastopol.Hayward 2001, p. 101. The primary objective for the 22nd Infantry Division on 13 June was Fort Stalin, blocking the advance to Severnaya Bay. It was a tough position. The fortifications allowed the Soviet forces to concentrate artillery against breakthroughs and machine gun posts protected the fort from southern and eastern attacks, but it was vulnerable from a northern assault. In addition, only 200 men from the 345th Rifle Division were stationed there. The Germans launched their assault on the position at 03:00 on 13 June with just 813 men. The 3rd Battalion was assigned to suppress Soviet machine gun and mortar positions located on the southeast as a diversion. The 1st Battalion, supported by five StuG assault guns, two 37mm guns and an Engineer Company were to serve as the main effort. Some 200 and 110 men were committed respectively in each unit.Forzcyk 2008, pp. 62–63. German bombardment began on 12 June. Artillery fire from 'Dora' had failed to neutralise the fort. Nevertheless, a combined arms attack from eleven 420 mm mortars and dive-bombing by Ju 87s of StG 77 knocked out the fort's main armament (three of the four 76.2 mm guns). At 19:00 the 22nd divisional artillery began shelling the fort and its smaller supporting fortress, Volga, located to Stalin's rear, with 210, 280 and 305 mm weapons. At 03:00 the German infantry attacked. The fog of war intervened. The Soviet mortar teams were not suppressed, and a fierce battle developed which lasted until 05:30. The Germans, with the support of five assault guns and a few 37 mm weapons, silenced the fort, bunker by bunker. In the heavy fighting a large number of company commanders were killed. As the Germans seized this vital fort, the neighbouring Volga fort realised it had fallen and shelled the position. A company-sized counterattack by the Soviet forces was wiped out by German small arms fire. The Germans declared the position secured at 07:00, though some bunkers held out until 15:00. German casualties amounted to 32 dead, 126 wounded and two missing – half of the force committed. Soviet casualties amounted to 20 captured, the remainder were killed.Forzcyk 2008, p. 66. With only 91 men left near the fort, Petrov did not order a recovery attempt – a grave mistake. The fall of Fort Stalin meant the Soviet defenses in the north were on the verge of collapse. Hansen ordered LIV Corps to divert its attention to Fort Maxim Gorky and the elimination of the Soviet 95th Rifle Division. The 95th Rifle Division had been halting the 132nd Infantry Division's progress since the start of the offensive. The 132nd was reinforced by one Regiment from the idle 46th Infantry Division near Kerch. The German 24th, 50th and Romanian 4th Mountain Divisions were to maintain pressure in the central sector while they pushed towards the Mekensia and Gatani Valley and the Chernaya River opening at Severnaya Bay. For three days, 14–16 June, the battle continued as the Axis advanced towards Sevastopol in the face of Soviet resistance. On 15 June the 132nd was within 900 metres of the Maxim Gorky's outer bastion (Bastion I). The front opposite the 25th Soviet Rifles was still strong, but the northern flank was giving way. The 79th Naval Brigade had only 35 percent of its fighting strength remaining. Blocking the way to Maxim Gorky was just 1,000 men of the 95th Rifle Division and 7th Naval Brigade. In the south the Soviet 109th and 388th Rifle Divisions were forced back along the coast by the German 72nd and 170th Infantry Divisions while the Romanian Corps' 18th Mountain Division dislodged the Soviet 386th Rifle Division threatening XXX Corps' right flank. The battles continued to grind on until 20 June. In six days, XXX Corps had lost 2,646 men. In exchange the outer defences of the 388th Rifle Division had been broken and the formation effectively destroyed. Still, the German advance on Balaklava had been halted. The Germans had not yet reached its outer defences and the Sapun Ridge to the east of the town was still under Soviet control. By 15 June, some 1,000 Soviet soldiers and 1,500 mortar bombs had been captured indicating the Soviet forces had plenty of ammunition after two weeks of battle.Forzcyk 2008, p. 67. Despite shortages of aviation fuel and ordnance, the Luftwaffe had played a significant part in the success of the German operations. From 13 June, up until 17 June, it flew 3,899 sorties and dropped 3,086 tons of bombs. This average of 780 sorties per day was only a slight drop from the opening 11 days.Hayward 2001, p. 108. Massed sorties were made on the city of Sevastopol itself. Bombing targeted hangars, port facilities, flak and artillery batteries, barracks, and supply depots with high explosive bombs. Most of the city was engulfed in flames. The smoke rose to 1,500 meters and stretched as far as Feodosiya, 150 kilometers away.Hayward 2001, p. 109. ====Ground fighting: 16–28 June==== Destroyed Soviet \\"Maxim Gorky\\" naval battery As Hansen poised his corps for the breakthrough against the 95th Rifle Division, 27 Ju 87s of II./StG 77 attacked Maxim Gorky's main battery. The Germans believed the strike had knocked it out as it stopped firing its artillery. The artillery bombardment began on 16 June. In the morning the attack by the reinforced 132nd Division collapsed the line. The Soviet garrison held out in tunnels, capitulating on 20 June. The 22nd and 24th Infantry Divisions advanced from the northeast. They employed their Goliath remote control demolition vehicles with success against the timber bunkers. One exploded prematurely and two were knocked out by a minefield. Two Panzer III control vehicles were knocked out by Soviet anti-tank fire. By 19:30, Forts Maxim Gorky, Molotov, Schishkova, Volga and Siberia were overrun. The 24th Infantry Division in particular made extensive use of its Nebelwerfer rockets. The 95th and 172nd Rifle Divisions had been lost, as well as the majority of the fortified defences. Only the 25th Rifle remained in the line. Petrov rushed up the 138th Naval Brigade with an extra 2,600 men, which was landed on the 12–13 June. It prevented German forces reaching Severnaya Bay that day.Forzcyk 2008, p. 70. The Luftwaffe was also engaged in applying pressure to Soviet naval forces. On 18 June the cruiser Kharkov was severely damaged. Attacks on 19 June by KG 51 destroyed the anti-aircraft platform in Severnaya Bay, allowing air operations to continue unopposed. The lack of anti-aircraft cover made it impossible for the minelayer Komintern to enter the harbour with reinforcements. The lack of supplies resulted in Soviet ammunition and fuel supplies slipping to critical levels on 20 June. The Luftwaffe was experiencing shortages of its own. The daily average of sorties was now reduced by 40 percent. Due to the shortages of bombs, all ordnance had to be dropped individually to minimise wastage. Some experienced crews had to conduct dive-bombing attacks 25–30 times a day. KG 51's Ju 88 crews in particular had felt the strain. Three German soldiers transport a wounded comrade on 22 June during the battle for Sevastopol. The pressure took its toll, and between the 18–23 June, the entire Soviet defence line in the north collapsed. The remnants of the 95th Rifle Division was huddled into a 2 km square portion of coast line near Coastal Battery 12, north of the Bay. At 09:00 the battery and the division surrendered to the 132nd Infantry Division. Further south the 24th Infantry Division captured Bartenyevka, on the mouth of the Bay. The 22nd Infantry Division had reached the north of the Bay on the same day. The Soviet 138th Naval Brigade counterattacked, but it was destroyed without artillery and air support. On 20 June, the 24th Infantry Division tackled the main obstacle remaining on the north side of the Bay. The Lenin anti-aircraft position protected by the Northern Fort, a position which had a 5 metres wide anti-tank ditch, 1,000 mines, 32 concrete bunkers, seven armoured cupolas, and 70 earth-and-timber bunkers making it a formidable defensive position. The Lenin defences surrendered, having already lost three of their four 76 mm weapons. The Germans tried to use the remote-controlled mines to break into the North Fort, but they were knocked out. At 11:30 on 21 June the Fort fell after a sustained infantry attack. Around 182 Soviet prisoners were taken.Forzcyk 2008, p. 71. The Germans began mopping up operations and clearing the northern shore. Most Soviet units were exhausted and out of ammunition, surrendering quickly. Others made attempts at a last stand. Some tried to evacuate across to the southern side by boat, but they were picked off by German artillery.Forzcyk 2008, p. 75. The destroyed Sevastopol harbor. While the main actions were playing out in the north, XXX Corps alternated between attack and defence. The Soviet forces held the Sapun Ridge and could observe German movements. On occasion they could deliver effective counter battery fire. Between the 21–28 June, the Germans lost 10 artillery pieces, including five 150 mm s. FH 18 medium howitzers. In the centre, the Romanians took up the slack. The 18th Infantry, 1st, and 4th Mountain Divisions, supported by 100 guns, gradually advanced up the Chernaya River towards the mouth of the river and Severnaya Bay. With support from LIV Corps on its left, the Axis captured all the Soviet defensive lines east of the Chernaya River.Forzcyk 2008, pp. 76–77. The Luftwaffe had contributed 4,700 sorties in seven days up until 26 June. They dropped 3,984 tons of bombs. The daily average sorties had decreased 15 percent from the week before and 10 percent the week before that. The increasing operational readiness (49.8 to 64.5 percent) revealed the severity of bomb and fuel shortages.Hayward 2001, p. 110. Von Wild, despite the withdrawal of some Geschwader for Operation Blue, did succeed in bringing in much needed reinforcements to bring the strength levels up to a standard not seen since the start of the offensive. The Luftwaffe continued the intense bombardment. On 26 June, its attacks supporting XXX Corps, devastated Soviet defences on the Sapun Ridge. It was the last Soviet defensive line between the Axis and Sevastopol.Bergstrom 2007, p. 45. Stalingrad ====Axis land, sea and air offensive: 29 June==== ====Fall of Sevastopol: 30 June – 4 July==== Oktyabrsky and Petrov were flown out at the last moment.Erickson, Road to Stalingrad, 2003 Cassel Military Paperbacks Edition, p. 351 Major General Pyotr Georgyevich Novikov took command of the defense. On 30 June, LIV Corps launched a heavy assault, supported by heavy Luftwaffe bombardment and several dozen guns. Heavy fighting took place for the next three days, but it was becoming clear that the Red Army could not hold their increasingly untenable positions for more than a day, at most. On 3 July, the last line of Soviet defense was breached. The following day, the last of the Soviet defenses were overrun and all organised resistance collapsed. The few remaining Red Army units continued to put up scattered resistance to the south of the city, which lasted until 9 July. The fall of Sevastopol was announced by a special radio communique: > Above the city and port flutter the German and Romanian flags. German and > Romanian troops under the command of Colonel General von Manstein, > steadfastly supported by Colonel General von Richthofen's battle-hardened > air corps, after twenty-five days of fierce battle, have as of midday today, > taken the most powerful land and sea fortress of all that have ever existed > in the world.Mungo Melvin CB OBE, Sevastopol’s Wars: Crimea from Potemkin to > Putin, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2017 ==Aftermath== The Mount Sapun memorial The Germans claimed that over 90,000 Red Army soldiers had been taken prisoner, and a greater number killed. This claim appears to be overstated as, according to Soviet sources, the Soviet garrison defending Sevastopol totaled 106,000 men at the start of the siege plus 3,000 reinforcements during the attack. Further, it is known that 25,157 persons were evacuated, the overwhelming majority either wounded soldiers or officers evacuated on Stalin's orders. Romania's contribution was honored when the Crimea Shield in gold was first bestowed upon Marshal Ion Antonescu on 3 July 1942. It was awarded to him in Bucharest by Manstein, on Hitler's behalf. The second and last Golden Krimschild was awarded to Manstein himself, on 24 November 1942.Gordon Williamson, World War II German Battle Insignia, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2012, p. 19David Schranck, Thunder at Prokhorovka: A Combat History of Operation Citadel, Kursk, July 1943, Helion and Company, 2014, p. 25Paul Carell, Scorched earth; Hitler's war on Russia, G.

German artillery had fired a further 46,750 tons of munitions, with total Axis munitions consumption coming to 67,278 tons over the course of one month. The Luftwaffe claimed to have destroyed 611 motor vehicles, 123 aircraft of which 18 on the ground, 38 artillery pieces, 10 tanks, a locomotive and a flak barge. Further destroyed were 48 Soviet artillery batteries, 28 barracks and industrial buildings, 20 bunkers, 11 ammunition depots, 10 fuel depots, a bridge and an observation post. Hundreds more motor vehicles had been damaged along with 7 artillery pieces, 43 artillery batteries, 2 barracks and another bridge. German aerial attacks had sunk 10,800 tons of Soviet shipping including 4 destroyers, a submarine, 3 motor torpedo boats, 6 coastal vessels and 4 freighters. 12,000 tons of shipping were also damaged, with 2 destroyers, 10 coastal vessels and 2 freighters among the losses.Hayward 2001, pp. 116-118. Although ultimately a German success, the operation took much longer than the Germans had expected. Operation Blau, Army Group South's advance toward Stalingrad and the Caucasus was just beginning, and the German offensive did not have the 11th Army to support it. Instead, the German 6th Army under Paulus was without crucial support, ultimately contributing to its defeat. ==References== Citations Gottob Herbert Bidderman of the German 132nd Infantry division, his book \\" In deadly combat\\" tells the story of the siege of Sevasstopol through the eyes of an ordinary soldier.

His mother began teaching him the piano when he was seven. Mørk also played the violin, but soon switched to the cello, taking lessons from his father. Mørk began his studies with Frans Helmerson at 17 at Edsberg Music Institute. An admirer of Mstislav Rostropovich and the Russian school of cello, Mørk went on to study with the Russian cellist Natalia Shakhovskaya. In 1982, Mørk became the first Scandinavian musician to reach the finals of the Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow since Arto Noras in 1966, and won the sixth prize. He subsequently went on to win second prize at the 1986 Naumburg Competition in New York City and, in 1986, the Cassado Cello Competition in Florence. In 1989, he embarked on his first major concert tour, soloing with many of the finest orchestras of Europe. In 1994, he toured the United States with the Oslo Philharmonic, including debuts at Carnegie Hall and the Kennedy Center. Mørk, Marriner, Orquesta Nacional de España, Auditorio Nacional, Madrid, 1 February 2015. Mørk's discography includes an award-winning recordings of the Shostakovich Cello Concertos and of Bach's Suites for Solo Cello. He has recorded for such labels as Virgin Classics and harmonia mundi. Mørk's interest in chamber music led to the foundation of the International Chamber Music Festival of Stavanger. In April 2009, Mørk experienced an infection of the central nervous system, presumably caused by a tick bite he received in the United States in 2006, with subsequent encephalitis, and paralysis in the shoulder muscles of the left arm. In the autumn of 2009, he expressed concern that he might never be able to perform again. After 18 months away from concert activity, during which time he was awarded the 2010 Sibelius Prize, Mørk resumed his career. Mørk holds a Professorship at the Norwegian Academy of Music, Oslo. He performs on a rare Domenico Montagnana cello (Venice, 1723), whose scroll was made by Stradivarius. Norway's SR-Bank purchased the cello, which is on loan to him. == Honors == *1991: Spellemannprisen in the category Chamber music, together with Håkon Austbø for the album Verker av Franck, Chausson, Debussy, Poulenc *1992: Spellemannprisen in the category Orchestral music for the album Joseph Haydn: Cello concerts, with Det Norske Kammerorkester cond Iona Brown *1993: Spellemannprisen in the category Orchestral music for the album Dvorák; Cello-konsert/Tsjaikovskij: Rokokko-variasjoner, with Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra cond.

Typically this means having a separate card that plugs into a PCI slot in a computer that contains one or more coprocessors able to handle much of the SSL processing. TLS accelerators may use off-the-shelf CPUs, but most use custom ASICs and RISC chips to do most of the difficult computational work. == Principle of TLS acceleration operation == The most computationally expensive part of a TLS session is the TLS handshake, where the TLS server (usually a webserver) and the TLS client (usually a web browser) agree on a number of parameters that establish the security of the connection. During the TLS handshake the server and the client establish session keys (symmetric keys, used for the duration of a given session), but the encryption and signature of the TLS handshake messages itself is done using asymmetric keys, which requires more computational power than the symmetric cryptography used for the encryption/decryption of the session data. Typically a hardware TLS accelerator will offload processing of the TLS handshake while leaving it to the server software to process the less intense symmetric cryptography of the actual TLS data exchange, but some accelerators handle all TLS operations and terminate the TLS connection, thus leaving the server seeing only decrypted connections. Sometimes data centers employ dedicated servers for TLS acceleration in a reverse proxy configuration. === Central processor support === Modern x86 CPUs support Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encoding and decoding in hardware, using the AES instruction set proposed by Intel in March 2008. Allwinner Technology provides a hardware cryptographic accelerator in its A10, A20, A30 and A80 ARM system-on-chip series, and all ARM CPUs have acceleration in the later ARMv8 architecture. The accelerator provides the RSA public-key algorithm, several widely used symmetric-key algorithms, cryptographic hash functions, and a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator.[PATCH v5] crypto: Add Allwinner Security System crypto accelerator on Linux ARM kernel mailing list ==See also== * Coprocessor * Public-key cryptography * Stunnel * Transport Layer Security * Application delivery controller * Hardware security module ==References== ==External links== * Information Site Dedicated to SSL Acceleration * SSL Acceleration and Offloading: What Are the Security Implications?

This will be a surface except along a single line. Now, pick another copy C of ℝ and glue it and A together along halfspaces so that the singular line of this gluing is transverse in A to the previous singular line. Call this complicated space K. A branched surface is a space that is locally modeled on K.Li, Tao. \\"Laminar Branched Surfaces in 3-manifolds.\\" Geometry and Topology 6.153 (2002): 194. ==Weight== A branched manifold can have a weight assigned to various of its subspaces; if this is done, the space is often called a weighted branched manifold.Shields, Sandra. \\"The stability of foliations of orientable 3-manifolds covered by a product.\\" Transactions of the American Mathematical Society 348.11 (1996): 4653-4671. Weights are non-negative real numbers and are assigned to subspaces N that satisfy the following: *N is open. *N does not include any points whose only neighborhoods are the quotient space described above. *N is maximal with respect to the above two conditions. That is, N is a component of the branched surface minus its branching set. Weights are assigned so that if a component branches into two other components, then the sum of the weights of the two unidentified halfplanes of that neighborhood is the weight of the identified halfplane. ==See also== *Branched covering *Branched manifold ==References== Category:Geometric topology Category:3-manifolds Category:Generalized manifolds ","title":"Branched surface"},{"id":"1277369","text":"In mathematics, a branched manifold is a generalization of a differentiable manifold which may have singularities of very restricted type and admits a well-defined tangent space at each point. A branched n-manifold is covered by n-dimensional \\"coordinate charts\\", each of which involves one or several \\"branches\\" homeomorphically projecting into the same differentiable n-disk in Rn. Branched manifolds first appeared in the dynamical systems theory, in connection with one-dimensional hyperbolic attractors constructed by Smale and were formalized by R. F. Williams in a series of papers on expanding attractors. Special cases of low dimensions are known as train tracks (n = 1) and branched surfaces (n = 2) and play prominent role in the geometry of three-manifolds after Thurston. == Definition == Let K be a metrizable space, together with: # a collection {Ui} of closed subsets of K; # for each Ui, a finite collection {Dij} of closed subsets of Ui; # for each i, a map πi: Ui → Din to a closed n-disk of class Ck in Rn. These data must satisfy the following requirements: # ∪j Dij = Ui and ∪i Int Ui = K; # the restriction of πi to Dij is a homeomorphism onto its image πi(Dij) which is a closed class Ck n-disk relative to the boundary of Din; # there is a cocycle of diffeomorphisms {αlm} of class Ck (k ≥ 1) such that πl = αlm · πm when defined. The domain of αlm is πm(Ul ∩ Um). Then the space K is a branched n-manifold of class Ck. The standard machinery of differential topology can be adapted to the case of branched manifolds. This leads to the definition of the tangent space TpK to a branched n-manifold K at a given point p, which is an n-dimensional real vector space; a natural notion of a Ck differentiable map f: K → L between branched manifolds, its differential df: TpK → Tf(p)L, the germ of f at p, jet spaces, and other related notions. == Examples == Extrinsically, branched n-manifolds are n-dimensional complexes embedded into some Euclidean space such that each point has a well-defined n-dimensional tangent space. * A finite graph whose edges are smoothly embedded arcs in a surface, such that all edges incident to a given vertex v have the same tangent line at v, is a branched one-manifold, or train track (there are several variants of the notion of a train track — here no restriction is placed on the valencies of the vertices). As a specific example, consider the \\"figure eight\\" formed by two externally tangent circles in the plane. * A two- complex in R3 consisting of several leaves that may tangentially come together in pairs along certain double curves, or come together in triples at isolated singular points where these double curves intersect transversally, is a branched two-manifold, or branched surface. For example, consider the space K obtained from 3 copies of the Euclidean plane, labelled T (top), M (middle) and B (bottom) by identifying the half-planes y ≤ 0 in T and M and the half- planes x ≤ 0 in M and B. One can imagine M being the flat coordinate plane z=0 in R3, T a leaf curling upward from M along the x-axis to the right (positive y-direction) and B another leaf curling downward from M along the y-axis in front (positive x-direction). The coordinate axes in the M plane are the double curves of K, which intersect transversally at a unique triple point (0,0). == References == * Robert F. Williams, Expanding attractors, Publ. Math.

The Malacca Sultanate of the 1500s was recorded to have practiced syariah (sharia) law, as well as its Johor successor of which Singapore was a part until 1824. When the British started governing Singapore, syariah law was relegated to the realm of personal law (Shariat). In 1915 the British colonial authorities established the Mohammedan Advisory Board. The Board was tasked to advise the colonial authorities on matters connected with the Islamic religion and custom.

Because of Article 152 Section 2, the Singapore government discourages missionaries from proselytizing the Malay population from Islam to other religions - to avoid racial and religious tensions within the Muslim population and because of the Malay Islamic identity, whereby Malay culture has close and strong identification with Islam. Article 153 states: > The Legislature shall by law make provision for regulating Muslim religious > affairs and for constituting a Council to advise the President in matters > relating to the Muslim religion. In 1966 the Singaporean Parliament passed the Administration of the Muslim Law Act (AMLA). The Act came into effect in 1968 and defined the powers and jurisdiction of three key Muslim institutions: # the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore # the Syariah (Shariah) Court # the Registry of Muslim Marriages These institutions come under the purview of the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) though the minister responsible for these institutions is the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs.

The duties and powers of the Secretary is delineated in section 20 of AMLA. It states: Subject to such directions as may be given to him by the President, the Secretary shall — (a) have charge of all correspondence and documents of the Majlis, including all books of account thereof and all title deeds and securities; (b) be generally responsible for the proper collection of, accounting for and disposal of all funds of the Majlis; and (c) in all other respects carry out such duties as may be imposed upon him by this Act or allotted to him by direction of the President. ====Office of the Mufti==== Apart from the President and Secretary of MUIS, another important office is that of the Mufti. Under section 30(3), the \\"Mufti shall be ex-officio a member of the Majlis.\\" Section 30(1) authorises the President of Singapore to appoint a fit and proper person to be the Mufti after consultation with the Majlis. In 1967, Mohamed Sanusi Mahmood was appointed as Singapore's first Mufti. He was succeeded by Syed Isa Semait in 1972. ====Legal Committee==== The President of Singapore also appoints the members of the Legal Committee (also known as the Fatwa Committee). The relevant provision relating to the Legal Committee is section 31 which states: (1) There shall be a Legal Committee of the Majlis, consisting of — (a) the Mufti; (b) 2 other fit and proper members of the Majlis; and (c) not more than 2 other fit and proper Muslims who are not members of the Majlis. (2) The members of the Legal Committee, other than the Mufti, shall be appointed by the President of Singapore on the advice of the Majlis for such period as he thinks fit. (3) A notification of every such appointment shall be published in the Gazette. (4) The Mufti shall be chairman of the Legal Committee. Under section 33, the Legal Committee is authorised to follow the tenets of the Shafi'i school of thought. It states: (1) Subject to this section, the Majlis and the Legal Committee in issuing any ruling shall ordinarily follow the tenets of the Shafi’i school of law. (2) If the Majlis or the Legal Committee considers that the following of the tenets of the Shafi\\"i school of law will be opposed to the public interest, the Majlis may follow the tenets of any of the other accepted schools of Muslim law as may be considered appropriate, but in any such ruling the provisions and principles to be followed shall be set out in full detail and with all necessary explanations. (3) In any case where the ruling or opinion of the Majlis or the Legal Committee is requested in relation to the tenets of a particular school of Muslim law, the Majlis or the Legal Committee shall give its ruling or opinion in accordance with the tenets of that particular school of Muslim law. ===Syariah Court=== In 1880, the British colonial authorities introduced the Mahomedan Marriage Ordinance which officially recognised the status of Muslim personal law in Singapore. In 1958, pursuant to the 1957 Muslim Ordinance, a Syariah Court with jurisdiction to hear and determine disputes pertaining to Muslim marriages and divorce cases was established. The Court replaced a set of government-licensed but otherwise unsupervised qadhi (Muslim judges) who had previously decided on questions of divorce and inheritance, following either the traditions of particular ethnic groups or their own interpretations of Muslim law. Today, the Syariah Court continues to exist as a court of competent jurisdiction with power and jurisdiction to hear and determine disputes defined by AMLA. ===Registry of Muslim Marriages (ROMM)=== The ROMM registers marriages when the couple are both Muslims. In the case of mixed-religion marriages, the marriage is registered at the Registry of Marriages. Previously, the registration of Muslim marriages as well as divorces were conducted under one unit, which is the Syariah Court. It was first located in a bungalow at Fort Canning and later moved to Canning Rise in 1983. Appeals on decisions of the Syariah Court and the ROMM are heard and determined by the Appeal Board. Unlike Muis, the Syariah Court and ROMM are not statutory boards but constitute a part of MSF (Ministry of Social and Family Development). ==Muslim organisations== ===Ahmadiyya=== Ahmadiyya is a small branch of Islam in Singapore. The Community was established during the era of the Second Caliphate, shortly before the Second World War. Ghulam Ahsan Ayyaz was the first missionary to the country, who under the directive of the caliph arrived in 1935, in a period when the territory was part of the Straits Settlements. In the 1970s, the Community had roughly 200 followers, represented by 1-2% of the Muslim population. ===Malay-Muslim organisations=== Apart from these key Muslim institutions, there are also community self-help groups, voluntary welfare organisations and civic groups like the Young Women Muslim Association of Singapore (YWMA), Association of Muslim Professionals, Yayasan Mendaki, Muslim Missionary Society (Jamiyah), PERDAUS, Singapore Islamic Scholars and Islamic Teachers Association (PERGAS), Muhammadiyah and Islamic Theological Association of Singapore (Pertapis). ===Indian-Muslim organisations=== There are also many Indian-Muslim organisations in Singapore e.g. Federation of Indian Muslims, Singapore Kadayanallur Muslim League, Koothanallur Association, Singapore Tenkasi Muslim Welfare Society, Thiruvithancode Muslim Union, and United Indian Muslim Association. ===Religio-cultural groups=== There are also religio-cultural groups like Al Usrah Al Dandaraweyah, formed in the structure of a family. Others are like the Tariqah group at-Tariqah al- Ahmadiah al-Idrisiah ar-Rasyidiah, and Naqshbandi Haqqani Singapore. This first established religio-cultural group; of Qadriah, Chistia, Naqshabandiyah, Sanusiyyah, Suharwadiyah; is now named as Khanqah Khairiyyah which was formed in 1971 and they have since been at the same location in Siglap Road Singapore. ===Shi'ite organisations=== The Shi'ite community consists of Twelver Shi'ites, Ismailis and Dawoodi Bohras. In Singapore, the history of the Twelver Shi'ites began with the immigration of the Khoja community from India. A member of Khoja community spearheaded the founding of the Jaafari Muslim Association. During the 1980s, Malays from the Muslim Youth Assembly (Himpunan Belia Islam) joined the Shi'ite community. A centre known as Hussainiyah Azzahra was later established. The Jaafari Muslim Association and Muslim Youth Assembly cater to the Twelver Shi'ites. The spiritual leader (Da'i al-Mutlaq) of the Dawoodi Bohras is Mohammed Burhanuddin, who represents the twenty-first imam. The Anjuman-E-Burhani caters to the Dawoodi Bohra community in Singapore. Bohra traders started settling in Singapore in the 1820s. The mosque for the Bohra community is the Burhani Mosque which was established in 1829. It has since been rebuilt and is now an 11-storey complex comprising prayer halls, function halls, meeting rooms and offices. The Ismailis are followers of Aga Khan. The Aga Khan has decided to establish an Ismaili Centre and regional representative office of the Aga Khan Development Network in Singapore.Jan 20, 2009, The Straits Times ===Hanafi Muslim Community=== There is also a significant proportion of the Sunni Hanafi Muslims in Singapore. Generally most Pakistanis in Singapore are Hanafi. While they often inter-mix with the Malay who follow the Shafi'i madhab, Indian mosques in Singapore such as Angullia Mosque, Abdul Gaffor Mosque, Bencoolen Mosque, Moulana Mohamed Ali Mosque cater for the needs of the Hanafi Muslim in Singapore. == Dawah Organisations == ===Hikmah Times=== In Singapore there is a significant impact of the Islamic Dawah (Invitation/conversion) movement. There are many local/international organisations (e.g., Hikmah Times). ===Converts=== The Muslim Converts' Association of Singapore (also known as Darul Arqam) provides support for converts. ==Mosques== There are 75 mosques in Singapore. With the exception of Masjid Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim (which is administered by the State of Johor), all the mosques in Singapore are administered by MUIS. Twenty-three mosques were built using the Mosque Building and Mendaki Fund (MBMF). Masjid Al-Mawaddah, the twenty-third MBMF mosque, was officially opened in May 2009. The speakers for broadcasting the Islamic call to prayer was turned inwards to broadcast towards the interior of the mosques as part of a noise abatement campaign in 1974.Lysloff, René T. A. Music and technoculture. ==Madrasahs== Students of Madrasah Aljunied Al- Islamiah in Singapore In Singapore, madrasahs are private schools which are overseen by Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS, Islamic Religious Council of Singapore). There are six full-time madrasahs in Singapore, catering to students from Primary 1 to Secondary 4 (and junior college equivalent, or \\"Pre-U\\", at several schools). Four Madrasahs are coeducational and two are for girls. Students take a range of Islamic Studies subjects in addition to mainstream MOE curriculum subjects and sit for the PSLE and GCE 'O' Levels like their peers. In 2009, MUIS introduced the \\"Joint Madrasah System\\" (JMS), a joint collaboration of Madrasah Al-Irsyad Al-Islamiah primary school and secondary schools Madrasah Aljunied Al-Islamiah (offering the ukhrawi, or religious stream) and Madrasah Al-Arabiah Al-Islamiah (offering the academic stream). The JMS aims to introduce the International Baccalaureate (IB) programme into the Madrasah Al-Arabiah Al-Islamiah by 2019. Students attending a madrasah are required to wear the traditional Malay attire, including the songkok for boys and tudong for girls, in contrast to mainstream government schools which ban religious headgear as Singapore is officially a secular state. For students who wish to attend a mainstream school, they may opt to take classes on weekends at the madrasah instead of enrolling full-time. ==See also== * Religion in Singapore ==References== * == External links == Singapore ","title":"Islam in Singapore"},{"id":"1277378","text":"Nyrölä Observatory () is an amateur astronomical observatory in Finland.

In the mathematical area of topology, a train track is a family of curves embedded on a surface, meeting the following conditions: #The curves meet at a finite set of vertices called switches. #Away from the switches, the curves are smooth and do not touch each other. #At each switch, three curves meet with the same tangent line, with two curves entering from one direction and one from the other. The main application of train tracks in mathematics is to study laminations of surfaces, that is, partitions of closed subsets of surfaces into unions of smooth curves. Train tracks have also been used in graph drawing. == Train tracks and laminations == A switch in a train track, and the corresponding portion of a lamination. A lamination of a surface is a partition of a closed subset of the surface into smooth curves. The study of train tracks was originally motivated by the following observation: If a generic lamination on a surface is looked at from a distance by a myopic person, it will look like a train track. A switch in a train track models a point where two families of parallel curves in the lamination merge to become a single family, as shown in the illustration. Although the switch consists of three curves ending in and intersecting at a single point, the curves in the lamination do not have endpoints and do not intersect each other. For this application of train tracks to laminations, it is often important to constrain the shapes that can be formed by connected components of the surface between the curves of the track. For instance, Penner and Harer require that each such component, when glued to a copy of itself along its boundary to form a smooth surface with cusps, have negative cusped Euler characteristic. A train track with weights, or weighted train track or measured train track, consists of a train track with a non-negative real number, called a weight, assigned to each branch. The weights can be used to model which of the curves in a parallel family of curves from a lamination are split to which sides of the switch. Weights must satisfy the following switch condition: The weight assigned to the ingoing branch at a switch should equal the sum of the weights assigned to the branches outgoing from that switch. Weights are closely related to the notion of carrying. A train track is said to carry a lamination if there is a train track neighborhood such that every leaf of the lamination is contained in the neighborhood and intersects each vertical fiber transversely. If each vertical fiber has nontrivial intersection with some leaf, then the lamination is fully carried by the train track. == References == * Category:Topology ","title":"Train track (mathematics)"},{"id":"1277406","text":"Richard Shilleto (25 November 1809 – 24 September 1876), English classical scholar, was born at Ulleskelf in Yorkshire. He was educated at Repton and Shrewsbury, then Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated second classic in 1832. Though Shilleto did not become a fellow of Trinity, marrying Isabella S. H. Snelgar in 1834, he spent the rest of his life in Cambridge as a 'coach'(private tutor) in classics. In 1867 he was elected a fellow of Peterhouse. Shilleto was one of the greatest Greek scholars that England has produced; in addition, he had an intimate acquaintance with the Latin and English languages and literature. He published little, being obliged to devote the best years of his life to private tuition. He was the most famous classical coach of his day, and almost all the best men passed through his hands. His edition of the De false legatione of Demosthenes will always remain a standard work, but his first two books of Thucydides (an instalment of a long-contemplated edition) hardly came up to expectation. His pamphlet Thucydides or Grote? excited a considerable amount of feeling. While it undoubtedly damaged Grote's reputation as a scholar, it was felt that it showed a want of appreciation of the special greatness of the historian.

Carrying the Glidrose Publications copyright, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Hodder & Stoughton and in the United States by Putnam. In the United States, the book was retitled Cold Fall. This was the first time an original Bond novel had been given a different title for American book publication, other than for reasons of spelling, since Fleming's Moonraker was initially published there under the title Too Hot to Handle in the mid-1950s.

The time between each book appears to be the time period allotted to Gardner's previous Bond outings, Never Send Flowers and SeaFire. The story opens with the crash of a Boeing 747-400 at Dulles International Airport in Fairfax and Loudoun counties, Virginia, near Washington, D.C., and the apparent death of Bond's friend and lover, the Principessa Sukie Tempesta. Bond is then sent by M to the airport with an investigation team which leads to meetings with FBI agent Eddie Rhabb. The main action takes place in Italy at the home of the Tempesta brothers, Luigi and Angelo, where Bond gets caught in the act with one of the brothers' wives.

Features include a Grand Feature Parade, Firefighters' Parade (first held on Thursday, April 18, 1929), a carnival and midway, luncheons, races, walks, dances and concerts, as well as a field show competition which formerly gave out the Queen's Cup trophy to the winner (although the trophy was retired in 1977, by Princess Anne High School of Virginia Beach, Virginia after winning the competition three straight years). The Queen, Queen Shenandoah, has been crowned every year at John Handley High School (with the exception of 2007, due to ongoing renovations), starting with the original Queen, Elizabeth Steck (Arthur). A loss of interest during the 1930s, prompted the appointment of Tom Baldridge to the seat of Executive Director of the festival. He was also employed at MGM in the publicity department, which allowed him the opportunity to schedule celebrities, in turn renewing public interest in the festival. The period of the 1960s and 1970s introduced various new aspects to the festival including: the first visit by a U.S. President, Lyndon B. Johnson (1964), the beginning of attendance by sports celebrities Jack Dempsey (1965), and the premier of Sunday in the Park (1975). The Cole Brothers Circus of the Stars, still a favorite of children, first appeared at the festival in 1981. ==The festival today== The festival is run by the private Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival organization and attracts over 250,000 people. Highlights include the Old Town Wine & Fine Arts Festival and the Apple Blossom Carnival. The festival is known for its many guest celebrities and events. During the spring, in preparation for the festival, the citizens of Winchester hold an annual clean-up, followed by decoration of the city in green, pink and white (festival colors), in order to make Winchester more presentable for its anticipated guests.

However by the late 1860s in border state conferences, the MEC North moved well away from their work with the Freedmen's Bureau and often sided with the grievances of Southern white members. Bishop Simpson played a leading role in mobilizing the Northern Methodists for the cause. His biographer calls him the \\"High Priest of the Radical Republicans.\\"Robert D. Clark, The Life of Matthew Simpson (1956) pp 245-67 ==Early life and family== Matthew was born in Cadiz, Ohio. His grandfather, Thomas Simpson, was a British soldier who emigrated to Ireland. Matthew's father came to America in 1793. Matthew's grandfather Tingley was a Revolutionary soldier. Matthew's uncle also was Matthew Simpson, who also emigrated from Ireland to America in 1793. This Matthew Simpson represented Harrison County, Ohio, in the Ohio State Senate for ten years, and served as judge of the county court for seven years. In later life, he lived with his nephew, reaching the advanced age of ninety-eight. Matthew, the nephew, married Ellen H. Verner of Pittsburgh. Matthew was consecrated at birth for the ministry by both of his parents. He was baptized as an infant by Bishop Francis Asbury. He was converted to Christ in 1829. Matthew received an academic education in his hometown. He then attended Madison College in Pennsylvania. Madison subsequently merged into Allegheny College in 1833. Matthew was elected to the office of Tutor in his eighteenth year, then engaging in teaching. Having also studied medicine in 1830–1833, he began medical practice. ==Ministry== Shortly thereafter, feeling it his duty to enter the ministry, Matthew was licensed to preach in the M.E. Church, and was received on-trial in the Pittsburgh Annual Conference in 1833. He was ordained by Bishop Robert Richford Roberts. Matthew was appointed pastor of the Liberty Street Methodist Church in Pittsburgh in 1835, and of a church at Monongahela, Pennsylvania, in 1836. He was ordained elder in 1837. The Rev. Simpson was appointed Professor of Natural Science and elected Vice-President of Allegheny College, Meadville, Pennsylvania. In 1838 he was elected professor, and in 1839 president of the newly established Indiana Asbury University (now DePauw University) in Greencastle, Indiana, remaining until 1848. The Rev. Simpson was then elected editor of the Western Christian Advocate, which he made a strong temperance and anti-slavery organ, from 1848 to 1852. The Rev. Dr. Matthew Simpson was elected to the Episcopacy of his denomination by the M.E. General Conference, May 1852. In discharging his duties, Bishop Simpson visited and presided over conferences in all of the states encompassing the M.E. Church as well as most of the related U.S. Territories. He was sent by the General Conference as a delegate to the Irish and British Wesleyan (i.e., Methodist) Conferences in 1857, as well as to the Evangelical Alliance in Berlin the same year. He traveled with John McClintock. From Berlin, Bishop Simpson extended his travels through Turkey, the Holy Land, Egypt, and Greece, returning to the United States in 1858. In 1859, Bishop Simpson changed his residence from Pittsburgh to Evanston, Illinois, where he accepted the position of president of the Garrett Biblical Institute (now, Garrett–Evangelical Theological Seminary). ==American Civil War== Before the Civil War, debates over slavery were highly contentious among Northern Methodists, but Simpson did not take sides, playing instead a moderate and cautious role. With the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861, he became a staunch champion of the Union and helped his denomination take a leading role in providing chaplains, volunteers and civilian support for the war effort.Clark, The Life of Matthew Simpson (1956) pp 213, 219 Simpson became a trusted friend of President Abraham Lincoln, who considered his advice of great value. He attended the family at Lincoln's death and gave the sermon at his funeral in Springfield. During the War, Bishop Simpson delivered a number of speeches in behalf of the Union. He was urged by the Secretary of War to undertake the organization of the freedmen at the establishment of the Freedman's Bureau. After the war, Bishop Simpson was invited by President Grant to go as a commissioner to San Domingo but he declined both offers. ==More foreign travel== In 1870, at the death of Bishop Kingsley, Bishop Simpson again visited Europe to complete the work which had been assigned to him on the continent. He also went as a delegate again to the English Wesleyan Conference. In 1874, Bishop Simpson visited Mexico. He returned to Europe in 1875, presiding over the Annual Conference of Germany and Switzerland. He also met with the M.E. missionaries in different parts of Europe. He then addressed the Garfield Memorial Meeting at Exeter Hall, London, on September 24, 1881. Bishop Simpson was also a gifted orator and throughout the war he gave his much forgotten \\"Great War Speech\\" which was so powerful and stirring it could move entire audiences to tears and cheering pride. He delivered this speech over 60 times throughout the war, and it easily motivated and inspired cities wary of the long war. ==Death and burial== Bishop Matthew Simpson was taken ill at San Francisco in 1880, but recovered to preach the opening sermon at the First Ecumenical Methodist Conference in London (1881). He was present at the M.E. General Conference in 1884, but took little part. He died 18 June 1884 in Philadelphia and was buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery, Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. ==Selected writings== * Sermon: Influence on the Human Mind of the Manifestation of God's Glory - The Methodist Pulpit, in Clark, D.W., Sermons for the College, Akers, 1851. *Sermon in Sermons for the Home Circle, T.P.

He had 17 career grand slams, ranking him seventh in MLB history (tied with Jimmie Foxx and Ted Williams). ==Professional career== ===Chicago White Sox=== Lee made his major league debut with the Chicago White Sox on May 7, 1999, hitting a home run in his first Major League at-bat. In his rookie year, Lee hit .293 while driving in 84 runs in 127 games. He finished 7th in the AL Rookie of the Year voting. In 2000, Lee drove in 92 RBI while hitting 24 home runs. In 2001, Lee once again hit for power, hitting 24 home runs and driving in 84 runs but his average dipped from .301 the previous year to .269 in 150 games. In 2002, Lee played in just 140 games but was consistent once again, driving in 80 runs while hitting 26 home runs. In 2003, Lee had his breakout season for the White Sox, playing in 158 games, Lee drove in 113 RBI while homering 31 times and scoring 100 runs. The following year, Lee continued his success, hitting 31 home runs and scoring 103 runs. He also drove in 99 RBI while hitting .305 for the White Sox. After the season, Lee was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers in exchange for outfielder Scott Podsednik and pitcher Luis Vizcaíno. ===Milwaukee Brewers=== Lee's best showing was in the National League with 114 RBIs. He was selected for the National League All-Star team in his first two seasons as a Brewer, and participated in the Home Run Derby in 2005. On July 28, 2006, he was traded to the Texas Rangers with minor league outfielder Nelson Cruz for outfielders Kevin Mench and Laynce Nix, relief pitcher Francisco Cordero, and minor league pitcher Julian Cordero.JS Online: So long, slugger According to Brewers General Manager Doug Melvin, the Brewers attempted to re-sign Lee, but by July 27, it became apparent he would not sign a contract extension. The Brewers reportedly offered a four-year, $48 million contract extension, close to the four-year, $50 million extension David Ortiz signed earlier in 2006. Lee's agent Adam Katz said the two parties were too far away in negotiations.  In 59 games for the Rangers, Lee hit 9 home runs while hitting .322 while serving as their DH and left fielder. Between both the Brewers and the Rangers, Lee hit a career high 37 home runs while compiling 116 RBI in 161 games. ===Houston Astros=== On November 24, 2006, Lee agreed to a six-year, $100 million contract with the Houston Astros.best baseball player Astros reel in Lee, Williams  astros.com: News Lee had a productive first year in Houston, hitting .303 with 32 home runs and driving in 119 runs, which was good for a three-way tie in the National League with Miguel Cabrera and Prince Fielder.http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/joe_posnanski/08/12/worst.contracts/index.html In his second year, despite playing in just 115 games due to injury, Lee drove in 100 runs and homered 28 times for the Astros. In 2009, he had the lowest range factor of all starting major league left fielders (1.56).\\"MLB Player Fielding Stats – As lf – 2009\\" ESPN, accessed October 6, 2009 Despite his limited range, Lee was a force once again at the plate, driving in 102 RBIs while hitting exactly .300 in 160 games. In 2010 after Lance Berkman was traded to the New York Yankees, Lee played a handful of games at first base. While this was not the first time in his career he had played first, it was the first time he did so on a regular basis. Lee hit a career low .246 despite driving in 89 runs and homering 24 times for the Astros. In 2011, he was an above average defender according to UZR and other statistical measurements. Through 66 games in 2012 for Houston, Lee struck out just 17 times in 258 at bats. During his 6-year tenure with the Astros, Lee never struck out over 65 times in a season. ===Miami Marlins=== On July 4, 2012, Lee was traded to the Miami Marlins for minor leaguers Matt Dominguez and Rob Rasmussen. He played his first game as a Marlin the next day against the Milwaukee Brewers, and went 2-for-4 with a run in a win. He hit his first home run as a Marlin, a grand slam, on July 17 against the Chicago Cubs. In 81 games for the Marlins, Lee failed to produce as Miami expected, hitting just .243 while homering just 4 times in 338 plate appearances. ==Career statistics== In 2,099 games over 14 seasons, Lee compiled a .285 batting average (2,273-for-7,983) with 1,125 runs, 469 doubles, 19 triples, 358 home runs, 1,363 RBI, 125 stolen bases, 655 base on balls, 984 strikeouts, .339 on-base percentage and .483 slugging percentage. Defensively, he recorded a .988 fielding percentage playing left field and first base. ==Personal life== In reference to his nickname, Carlos has a fan club called \\"Los Caballitos,\\" which means \\"Little Horses.\\" He is married and has two daughters, Cassandra and Karla and two sons, named Carlos and Carlito. Lee owns and operates cattle ranches in Aguadulce and Houston. His younger brother, also named Carlos, Carlos Humberto Lee, played professional baseball in the Chicago White Sox and Milwaukee Brewers' minor league systems from 2001–2007. ==See also== * List of Major League Baseball career home run leaders * List of Major League Baseball players with a home run in their first major league at bat * Grand slam (baseball) ==References== ==External links== Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:Birmingham Barons players Category:Bristol White Sox players Category:Charlotte Knights players Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:Corpus Christi Hooks players Category:Gulf Coast White Sox players Category:Hickory Crawdads players Category:Houston Astros players Category:Major League Baseball first basemen Category:Major League Baseball left fielders Category:Major League Baseball players from Panama Category:Miami Marlins players Category:Milwaukee Brewers players Category:National League All-Stars Category:Panamanian expatriate baseball players in the United States Category:Panamanian people of Chinese descent Category:People from Aguadulce District Category:Silver Slugger Award winners Category:Texas Rangers players Category:Winston-Salem Warthogs players Category:2006 World Baseball Classic players Category:2009 World Baseball Classic players ","title":"Carlos Lee"},{"id":"1277477","text":"The Facts of Death, first published in 1998, was the third novel by Raymond Benson featuring Ian Fleming's secret agent, James Bond (including Benson's novelization of Tomorrow Never Dies). Carrying the Glidrose Publications copyright—the final James Bond novel to do so—it was first published in the United Kingdom by Hodder & Stoughton and in the United States by Putnam. The novel's title was originally The World Is Not Enough, an English translation of the Latin phrase Orbis non sufficit, which appears in the novel and film On Her Majesty's Secret Service. The title was later used for the nineteenth James Bond film, released in 1999.Benson on Bond - The International Association of Media Tie-In Writers ==Plot summary== The Facts of Death starts off with several deaths from mysterious diseases. We first find Bond in Cyprus, where a number of British troops have been discovered murdered under mysterious circumstances. Bond gets too close for comfort to the group behind the murders and is attacked, but rescued by a fiery Greek agent, Niki Mirakos, who becomes Bond's love interest. Bond then returns to Britain, where he is invited to attend a dinner party being held by Sir Miles Messervy, the former M. The current M and her boyfriend are also in attendance, and the latter is murdered after the party. M then tells Bond that all of the killings are connected--near all the bodies were statues of Greek deities and numbers, keeping a running count of the victims. Bond is sent to Greece and partnered with Niki. They are both suspicious of an internationally-known mathematic cult called the Decada. The head of the group is a Greek mathematician, Konstantine Romanos. Bond goes to a casino about two hours away from Athens and beats Romanos in a game of bacaraat, catching the attention of an attractive woman named Hera Volopoulos, also a member of the Decada. After she and Bond make love, she drugs Bond and takes him to Konstantine. Konstantine orders Hera to kill Bond, but he manages to escape. Bond realizes that Konstantine plans to start a major war between Greece and Turkey, and locates his hideout just in time to witness Hera murder Konstantine. She leaves Bond to stop a nuclear missile that will be fired from Greece into Turkey. Hera's plan is to profit the chaos ensuing after she releases a new virus worldwide. Bond, with assistance from the Greek military, kills her and stops the missile. ===Locations=== Locations where the book takes place include: * Los Angeles * Tokyo * Austin, Texas * Cyprus * London * Greece ==Publication history== * UK first hardback edition: May 1998 Hodder & Stoughton * U.S. first hardback edition: June 1998 Putnam * UK first paperback edition: November 5, 1998 Coronet Books * U.S. first paperback edition: August 1999 Jove Books ==See also== * Outline of James Bond ==References== Category:1998 British novels Category:James Bond books Category:Novels by Raymond Benson Category:Novels set in Greece Category:Hodder & Stoughton books ","title":"The Facts of Death"},{"id":"1277485","text":"Thomas John MacLagan (1838- 20 March 1903) was a Scottish doctor and pharmacologist from Perthshire who pioneered the clinical use of thermometers and the use of salicin as an anti-inflammatory and treatment for rheumatism. == Personal life == MacLagan was born in Scone, Perthshire in 1838. He married Isabella Scudamore, from Kent, in 1869. Between the years of 1870 and 1880 they had four children, three sons and a daughter. == Education == He attended Glasgow University at the age of 15, to study humanities before going on to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh. He graduated from there with an MD in 1860, entitled 'On Oxaluria'. He then spent two years in Europe, visiting medical schools in Paris, Vienna and Munich, where he learned French and German. == Medical career == On his return to Britain MacLagan spent a brief period as resident medical officer at a dispensary in Jersey before returning to Scotland to take up a post in Dundee. He was medical superintendent at Dundee Royal Infirmary from 1864 to 1866, during which time he had to cope with several major fever epidemics of typhus, typhoid, cholera and smallpox and became noted for pioneering the clinical use of thermometers. He carried out research into the effect of salicin, an extract from willow bark and a known anti-rheumatic treatment. This work was followed by Carl Thiersch, and in 1874 salicylic acid was synthesised, the active ingredient in Aspirin.

Pressure vessels, such as pressurized water (nuclear) reactors, that operate above atmospheric pressure can also provide the conditions for a steam explosion. The water changes from a liquid to a gas with extreme speed, increasing dramatically in volume. A steam explosion sprays steam and boiling-hot water and the hot medium that heated it in all directions (if not otherwise confined, e.g. by the walls of a container), creating a danger of scalding and burning. Steam explosions are not normally chemical explosions, although a number of substances react chemically with steam (for example, zirconium and superheated graphite react with steam and air respectively to give off hydrogen, which burns violently in air) so that chemical explosions and fires may follow. Some steam explosions appear to be special kinds of boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE), and rely on the release of stored superheat. But many large-scale events, including foundry accidents, show evidence of an energy-release front propagating through the material (see description of FCI below), where the forces create fragments and mix the hot phase into the cold volatile one; and the rapid heat transfer at the front sustains the propagation. If a steam explosion occurs in a confined tank of water due to rapid heating of the water, the pressure wave and rapidly expanding steam can cause severe water hammer. This was the mechanism that, in Idaho, USA, in 1961, caused the SL-1 nuclear reactor vessel to jump over in the air when it was destroyed by a criticality accident. In the case of SL-1, the fuel and fuel elements vaporized from instantaneous overheating. Events of this general type are also possible if the fuel and fuel elements of a liquid-cooled nuclear reactor gradually melt. Such explosions are known as fuel–coolant interactions (FCI). In these events the passage of the pressure wave through the predispersed material creates flow forces which further fragment the melt, resulting in rapid heat transfer, and thus sustaining the wave. Much of the physical destruction in the Chernobyl disaster, a graphite-moderated, light-water- cooled RBMK-1000 reactor, is thought to have been due to such a steam explosion. In a nuclear meltdown, the most severe outcome of a steam explosion is early containment building failure. Two possibilities are the ejection at high pressure of molten fuel into the containment, causing rapid heating; or an in-vessel steam explosion causing ejection of a missile (such as the upper head) into, and through, the containment. Less dramatic but still significant is that the molten mass of fuel and reactor core melts through the floor of the reactor building and reaches ground water; a steam explosion might occur, but the debris would probably be contained, and would in fact, being dispersed, probably be more easily cooled. See WASH-1400 for details. Steam explosions are often encountered where hot lava meets sea water. Such an occurrence is also called a littoral explosion. A dangerous steam explosion can also be created when liquid water encounters hot, molten metal. As the water explodes into steam, it splashes the burning hot liquid metal along with it, causing an extreme risk of severe burns to anyone located nearby and creating a fire hazard. ==Practical uses== ===Steam turbines=== A water vapor explosion creates a high volume of gas without producing environmentally harmful leftovers. The controlled explosion of water has been used for generating steam in power stations and in modern types of steam turbines. Newer steam engines use heated oil to force drops of water to explode and create high pressure in a controlled chamber. The pressure is then used to run a turbine or a converted combustion engine. Hot oil and water explosions are becoming particularly popular in concentrated solar generators, because the water can be separated from the oil in a closed loop without any external energy. Water explosion is considered to be environmentally friendly if the heat is generated by a renewable resource. ===Flash boiling in cooking=== A cooking technique called flash boiling uses a small amount of water to quicken the process of boiling. For example, this technique can be used to melt a slice of cheese onto a hamburger patty. The cheese slice is placed on top of the meat on a hot surface such as a frying pan, and a small quantity of cold water is thrown onto the surface near the patty. A vessel (such as a pot or frying-pan cover) is then used to quickly seal the steam-flash reaction, dispersing much of the steamed water on the cheese and patty. This results in a large release of heat, transferred via vaporized water condensing back into a liquid (a principle also used in refrigerator and freezer production). ===Other uses=== Internal combustion engines may use flash-boiling to aerosolize the fuel. ==Other rapid boiling phenomena== A jet of steam rising higher than the Chrysler Building during the 2007 New York City steam explosion High steam generation rates can occur under other circumstances, such as boiler-drum failure, or at a quench front (for example when water re- enters a hot dry boiler). Though potentially damaging, they are usually less energetic than events in which the hot (\\"fuel\\") phase is molten and so can be finely fragmented within the volatile (\\"coolant\\") phase. Some examples follow: Steam explosions are naturally produced by certain volcanoes, especially stratovolcanoes, and are a major cause of human fatalities in volcanic eruptions. The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union was feared to cause major steam explosion (and resulting Europe-wide nuclear fallout) upon melting the lava-like nuclear fuel through the reactor's basement towards contact with residue fire-fighting water and groundwater. The threat was averted by frantic tunneling underneath the reactor in order to pump out water and reinforce underlying soil with concrete. When a pressurized container such as the waterside of a steam boiler ruptures, it is always followed by some degree of steam explosion. A common operating temperature and pressure for a marine boiler is around and at the outlet of the superheater. A steam boiler has an interface of steam and water in the steam drum, which is where the water is finally evaporating due to the heat input, usually oil-fired burners. When a water tube fails due to any of a variety of reasons, it causes the water in the boiler to expand out of the opening into the furnace area that is only a few psi above atmospheric pressure. This will likely extinguish all fires and expands over the large surface area on the sides of the boiler. To decrease the likelihood of a devastating explosion, boilers have gone from the \\"fire-tube\\" designs, where the heat was added by passing hot gases through tubes in a body of water, to \\"water-tube\\" boilers that have the water inside of the tubes and the furnace area is around the tubes. Old \\"fire-tube\\" boilers often failed due to poor build quality or lack of maintenance (such as corrosion of the fire tubes, or fatigue of the boiler shell due to constant expansion and contraction). A failure of fire tubes forces large volumes of high pressure, high temperature steam back down the fire tubes in a fraction of a second and often blows the burners off the front of the boiler, whereas a failure of the pressure vessel surrounding the water would lead to a full and entire evacuation of the boiler's contents in a large steam explosion. On a marine boiler, this would certainly destroy the ship's propulsion plant and possibly the corresponding end of the ship. In a more domestic setting, steam explosions can be a result of trying to extinguish burning oil with water in a process called boilover. When oil in a pan is on fire, the natural impulse may be to extinguish it with water; however, doing so will cause the hot oil to superheat the water. The resulting steam will disperse upwards and outwards rapidly and violently in a spray also containing the ignited oil. The correct method to extinguish such fires is to use either a damp cloth or a tight lid on the pan; both methods deprive the fire of oxygen, and the cloth also cools it down. Alternatively, a non-volatile purpose designed fire retardant agent or simply a fire blanket can be used. ==See also== * BLEVE * Boiler explosion * Multiphase flow * 2007 New York City steam explosion ==Bibliography== *Triggered Steam Explosions by Lloyd S.

They are the largest form of thangka paintings in the tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. Thongdrels typically depict a seated Guru Rinpoche surrounded by holy beings in a composition that, unlike most smaller thangkas, is in a \\"landscape\\" format, somewhat wider than it is tall. Thongdrels are composed of several layers, mostly of silk. These begin with a backing, then the image itself, made up of appliqué pieces sewn to a background. Finally there is a yellow drape that covers and protects it when not on display. Thongdrels are stored rolled up. Thongdrels are displayed once a year as the highlight of the tsechu festival of a district or dzongkhag (although not every district has a thongdrel). Typically they are displayed on the last day of the tsechu. The painting is not allowed to be struck by the direct rays of the sun, thus it may be unfurled at around 3:00 in the morning and rolled back up by 7:30 AM. Usually the architecture of the dzong provides a wall with access above, down which they may be unrolled, but sometimes metal hanging frames may be used. Major Tibetan centres have structures built into the defensive walls or other buildings specifically designed to give a large space for the display of festival thangkas.

This is the first James Bond novel copyrighted by Ian Fleming Publications (formerly Glidrose Publications). It was published in the United Kingdom by Hodder & Stoughton and in the United States by Putnam. The novel's working title was A Better Way to Die.Benson on Bond - The International Association of Media Tie-In Writers ==Plot summary== Bond faces off against a ruthless terrorist organization called \\"The Union\\", whose trademark assassination technique is throat-slitting. Bond and his girlfriend Helena are attending a dinner party thrown by a former Governor of the Bahamas. The Governor, who owes a gambling debt to a member of The Union, has refused to pay up since he believes he was cheated. Accordingly, there is a heightened security presence at the event. However, an assassin disguises himself as one of the guards and kills the Governor, just as Bond realizes the danger. Bond almost catches the assassin, who commits suicide before he can be interrogated. A top secret British formula hidden in microfilm, codenamed \\"Skin 17\\", is stolen by two traitors, scientist Steven Harding and RAF officer Roland Marquis. The microdot is surgically implanted in the pacemaker of an unhealthy old man, a former Chinese intelligence agent. Bond is sent to recover it before the Union can sell the microfilm to a foreign power. Bond tracks Harding and the Chinese ex-agent to Belgium, but they slip away while Bond kills Harding's bodyguard Basil. MI6 tracks the Chinese man to Nepal. It turns out, however, that Harding plans to double-cross the Union by having the plane of the pacemaker's host hijacked. Le Gerrant, the blind leader of The Union, immediately deduces Harding's double-cross and has him executed; Harding's body later washes up on the beach at Gibraltar. The plane containing the pacemaker's host crashed in the Himalayas, so a deadly race commences to recover Skin 17. Bond, sexy mountaineer Hope Kendal, and Roland Marquis, also Bond's rival from schoolboy days, lead one of the expeditions. Early on, they destroy the Chinese base camp, forcing that team to withdraw. Not long after, however, everyone on the British expedition has been killed, save for Bond, Hope, and Marquis. It turns out that Marquis is in on the theft with Harding, though they don't plan to sell it to The Union. The race climaxes with Bond battling Marquis atop the peak of Kangchenjunga. After a physical high- elevation fight, Bond trades oxygen from a mortally wounded Marquis for Skin 17. Bond and Hope return to base camp to find Paul Baack, a team member believed to have died with the rest, who reveals his affiliation with the Union and demands Skin 17. Bond and Hope manage to kill Baack and Skin 17 is returned to the British. Bond's now-estranged girlfriend Helena reveals herself to be in the employ of The Union due to blackmail and threats of violence to her family. However, she is killed just before Bond can reach her. ===Locations=== Locations where the book takes place include: * The Bahamas * London * Buckinghamshire * Hampshire * Belgium * Delhi, India * Morocco * Nepal * Mt.

The band describes their style as \\"razorgrind\\", a combination of grindcore with death metal, stoner rock and metalcore. The band's name is an alternate romanisation of \\"língchí\\", a method of torture and execution originating from Imperial China that is also known as \\"death by a thousand cuts\\". Death by a Thousand Cuts is also the name of one of the band's albums. ==Biography== Leng Tch'e drummer Sven is Aborted frontman Gurgloroth 'Svencho' Sven De Caluwé. The band began life under the billing of Anal Torture, forged by Sven and Dark Ages guitarist Glen along with vocalist Isaac and bass player Kevin in early 2002. Leng Tch'e signed to the Italian Spew label for the opening 2002 album Death by a Thousand Cuts. After that album, the band released a split 7\\" single with Black Ops. The band would employ Israeli guitarist Nir 'The Goat' Doliner of Lehavoth, even undertaking gigs in Israel opening for Amon Amarth. Unable to secure a bassist Nicolas would switch from guitar to cover this role. Eventually the distance factor for Doliner prevented a full-time role. In early 2004 therefore the band inducted Geert as second guitarist. The band enrolled former Pyaemia bassist Frank Rizzo as guitarist in late 2003. Meantime, Isaac fired up a Noise side project billed as Permanent Death whilst vocalist Sven De Caluwé would front In-Quest for an album. The band's second album, ManMadePredator, would be scheduled for May 2003 release. Leng Tch'e proposed split releases in 2004 with Fuck...I'm Dead for No Escape Records and a split 7\\" single with Gronibard on Bones Brigade Records. Guitarist Rizzo decamped in August, being replaced in November by Jan of Spleen. In early 2005 the band inducted Boris of Suppository as new frontman, debuting this revised line-up at the 30th April 'Face Your Underground' festival in Antwerp. Leng Tch'e contracted to Relapse Records in March, scheduling a summer release date for new album The Process of Elimination. The band played May US East Coast dates along with Impaled, Malignancy and Aborted. The band partnered with Fuck the Facts and Beneath the Massacre for a Canadian tour in 2006. On March 9, 2007, a new album, Marasmus, was released on Relapse Records. Some commentators noted that the album was closer to the deathcore sound.Cosmo Lee, Metal Injection, March 19, 2007. CD Review: Leng Tch'e - Marasmus - Metal Injection Access date: October 5, 2008. On May 16, 2008, The band announced that Boris had decided to quit the band. A successor was found in Serge Kasongo, formerly of Ackros with whom the band toured Canada in 2008 alongside Krisiun. Recording for the followup to Marasmus started in 2009 with a release planned for the spring of 2010 on new record label Season Of Mist. The album was named Hypomanic and mixed and mastered by Russ Russell (Napalm Death, Brujeria, Evile). The band toured with Origin and Psycroptic in early 2012 in support of Hypomanic. ==Influences== The band's Myspace page credits Regurgitate, Hemdale, Nasum and Blood Duster as formative influences for the group.

Still smarting from their last encounter with 007 when he foiled their plans to get Skin 17 in High Time to Kill, the Union has decided that Britain and James Bond are their new number one priority, and targets. Coming up with an elaborate plan to plunge Britain into war and destroy Bond's reputation in the process, the Union sets up their scheme. Domingo Espada, a Spanish Nationalist/Gangster/Ex-Matador who wishes to see Gibraltar returned to Spain from Britain, is approached by Nadir Yassasin, the Union's master strategist, as the centrepiece to their plan. They plan to help Espada forcefully take control of Gibraltar, killing the British Prime Minister and the Governor of Gibraltar, and having a Bond-Double do it, thus ruining Bond's career and life. But first, through an elaborate series of events, they convince Bond he is losing his mind, and force him to investigate these happenings on his own, without approval from M or SIS. Since Bond's return from the Himalayas, he begins experiencing terrible headaches, hallucinations, and black-outs. This leads him to Dr. Kimberly Feare. She diagnoses a lesion on the back of Bond's skull that is causing these symptoms. After getting Dr. Feare in bed, Bond wakes up to find her murdered, her throat slit ear-to-ear, the Union's mark. This causes Bond to leave England. Bond's trek takes him from England to Tangier, where he encounters the Taunt twins, Heidi and Hedy, CIA agents asked by M to bring him back to London. Here Bond finds the connection between the Union and Espada, and that he has some part in the Union's plan. Convincing M and the Taunts to play out his hand, Bond goes to Spain. On arrival in Spain, he encounters Margareta Piel, Espada's female assassin and a member of the Union. Followed closely by the climax of Bond vs. his double in Espada's practice bullfighting ring, and the culmination of the Union's plot at the Gibraltar peace conference, Bond takes his double's place and along with the Taunt twins, prevent the assassinations, kills Espada, Piel, Jimmy Powers (a high-ranking American in the Union, and their number one expert in stealth and tailing), and captures Yassasin, foiling the Union's plans once again. ==Publication history== * UK first hardback edition: April 2000 Hodder & Stoughton * U.S. first hardback edition: June 2000 Putnam * UK first paperback edition: August 3, 2000 Coronet Books * U.S. first paperback edition: June 2001 Jove Books ==See also== * Outline of James Bond ==References== Category:2000 British novels Category:James Bond books Category:Novels by Raymond Benson Category:Hodder & Stoughton books ","title":"DoubleShot"},{"id":"1277537","text":"Feenmärchen (Fairy-tales) waltz op. 312 is composed by Johann Strauss II in 1866. The same year had witnessed the glaring military weakness of the ailing Habsburg dynasty after a bitter defeat to the hands of the Prussian army at the fateful Battle of Königgrätz. Almost immediately, various Vienna's establishments usually packed with music-lovers dancing the night away took the news with foreboding and many of the year's festivities were cancelled or with-held. It was during these difficult social times that Strauss and his famous brothers entertained and coaxed the Viennese into enjoying their once- enviable lifestyle again. One such work, the 'Feenmärchen' waltz was first performed at the Vienna Volksgarten on 18 November 1866 during a benefit concert for brothers Josef and Eduard before an adoring public. Themes from the work was also included by Antal Doráti in his pastiche ballet Graduation Ball (1940) where the plaintive Introduction makes a contribution. The work starts off in a plaintive mood, with the clarinet playing the principal melody. Further themes were suggested before a loud chord introduces the first waltz theme. The entire 'fairy-tale' work was given inspiration throughout its light-hearted menagerie with various instruments of the orchestra. The first waltz theme was played again at the end before a furious section rounds off the work with a strong chord and drumroll. ==References== Category:Waltzes by Johann Strauss II ","title":"Feenmärchen waltz"},{"id":"1277538","text":"Seamonkey may refer to: * Sea-Monkeys, a certain hybrid of brine shrimps * SeaMonkey, a web browser suite * The Amazing Live Sea Monkeys, a television series ","title":"Seamonkey"},{"id":"1277542","text":"Stephen Osborne (born September 11, 1947) is a Canadian writer and editor.

He was born in Mansfield, Connecticut. ==Early life== Mrs Charles Emory Smith In 1849 his family removed to Albany, New York, where he attended the public schools and The Albany Academy. He graduated from Union College in 1861, was a recruiting officer on the staff of General John F. Rathbone (1819–1901) in 1861-1862, taught in the Albany Academy in 1862-1865, and was editor of the Albany Express in 1865-1870. He joined the staff of the Albany Journal in 1870, and was editor-in-chief of this paper from 1876 to 1880. In 1879-1880 he was a regent of the University of the State of New York. From 1880 until his death he was editor and part proprietor of the Philadelphia Press. ==Career== He was active as a Republican in state and national politics; was chairman of the Committee on Resolutions of the New York State Republican Conventions from 1874 to 1880 (excepting 1877), and was president of the convention of 1879; and was a delegate to several Republican National Conventions, drafting much of the Republican platforms of 1876 and 1896. In 1890 to 1892 he was United States minister to Russia, and during that period had charge of distributing among the Russian famine sufferers five shiploads of food and other supplies, valued at an estimated $750,000. He was Postmaster General in the cabinet of Presidents McKinley and Roosevelt from April, 1898 until January, 1902, and did much to develop the rural free delivery system. He died in Philadelphia on January 19, 1908. He is buried at West Laurel Hill Cemetery in Bala Cynwyd, River Section, Lot 726. ==Notes== ==References== * ==External links== * Men of Mark in America Biography & Portrait * Category:1842 births Category:1908 deaths Category:United States Postmasters General Category:Union College (New York) alumni Category:Politicians from Philadelphia Category:Ambassadors of the United States to Russia Category:American newspaper editors Category:Theodore Roosevelt administration cabinet members Category:20th-century American politicians Category:McKinley administration cabinet members Category:19th- century American politicians Category:Regents of the University of the State of New York Category:19th-century American diplomats Category:New York (state) Republicans Category:The Albany Academy alumni ","title":"Charles Emory Smith"},{"id":"1277585","text":"North Eastern Railway Dynamometer Car at the National Railway Museum in York Victorian and South Australian Railways joint stock Dynamometer Car (coupled between the locomotive tender and the train) being used to record the performance of a VR X class locomotive running on pulverised brown coal. A dynamometer car is a railroad maintenance of way car used for measuring various aspects of a locomotive's performance. Measurements include tractive effort (pulling force), power, top speed, etc. ==History== The first dynamometer car was probably one built in about 1838 by the \\"Father of Computing\\" Charles Babbage.* Working for the Great Western Railway of Great Britain, he equipped a passenger carriage to be placed between an engine and train and record data on a continuously moving roll of paper. The recorded data included the pulling force of the engine, a plot of the path of the carriage and the vertical shake of the carriage. The work was undertaken to help support the position of the Great Western Railway in the controversy over standardizing the British track gauge. In the United States, the Pennsylvania Railroad began using dynamometer cars in the 1860s. The first modern dynamometer car in the United States was built in 1874 by P. H. Dudley for the New York Central Railroad. The early cars used a system of springs and mechanical linkages to effectively use the front coupler on the car as a scale and directly measure the force on the coupler. The car would also have a means to measure the speed of the train. Later versions used a hydraulic cylinder and line to transmit the force to the recording device. Modern dynamometer cars typically use electronic solid state measuring devices and instrumentation such as strain gauges. A LNER dynamometer car was used to record No 4468 Mallard's speed record in 1938, and has been preserved at the National Railway Museum in York, England. This was also used for British Railways 1948 Locomotive Exchange Trials along with two other dynamometer cars, both of which have also survived into preservation. A car originally belonging to the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, is preserved at the National Railroad Museum located in Green Bay, Wisconsin. == Usage == While the principal purpose of the dynamometer car was to measure the power output of locomotive, other data were typically collected, such as smoke box data, throttle settings and valve cut offs, fuel burn rates, and water usage to determine the overall performance and efficiency of the locomotive. Data would typically be recorded on time-indexed continuous paper recording rolls for the pull and velocity. Power would later be manually calculated from these data on early cars. Some later cars were equipped with a mechanical integrator to directly record the power. A separate use for the car was to test a particular rail route to rate it for tonnage based on a run with a dynamometer car and recording the effect of the grades and curvature on the capacity and resulting power requirements for that line. == Power calculations == The operating principle of the dynamometer car is based on the basic equation for power being equal to force times distance over time. :P = \\\\frac{F\\\\cdot d}{t} This equation can be reduced to power equals force times velocity: :P = F\\\\cdot\\\\frac{d}{t}=F\\\\cdot V In other words, the instantaneous power output of the locomotive can be calculated by measuring the pull on the coupler and multiplying by the current speed. :P =50,000 ~ \\\\text{lbf} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{30 ~ \\\\text{mi}} {\\\\text{h}} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{5280 ~ \\\\text{ft}}{\\\\text{mi}} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\text{h}}{3600 ~ \\\\text{s}} = 2,200,000 ~ \\\\frac{\\\\text{ft} \\\\cdot \\\\text{lbf}}{\\\\text{s}} Converting to horse power gives: :P = 2,200,000 ~ \\\\frac{\\\\text{ft} \\\\cdot \\\\text{lbf}} {\\\\text{s}} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1 ~ \\\\text{hp}}{550 ~ \\\\text{ft} \\\\cdot \\\\text{lbf} / \\\\text{s}} = 4,000 ~ \\\\text{hp} == References == == External links == * Testing a Locomotive — Comprehensive details of how a dynamometer car is used for performance testing * Rail Training & Test Cars photos of some prototype cars. * Carriages of LNWR: 6-wheeled Dynamometer Car * Laboratory on Wheels Details (including publicity article from February 1951) of the Victorian & South Australian Railways' dynamometer car * Esoteric Test Equipment * Norfolk & Western dynamometer car drawings Category:Maintenance of way equipment Category:Dynamometers Category:Charles Babbage ","title":"Dynamometer car"},{"id":"1277590","text":"The Man with the Red Tattoo, first published in 2002, was the sixth and final original novel by Raymond Benson featuring Ian Fleming's character James Bond.

The novel's working title was Red Widow Dawn.Benson on Bond - The International Association of Media Tie-In Writers After the publication of The Man with the Red Tattoo, Benson wrote the novelisation of Die Another Day, which was published later in the year. Die Another Day is considered Benson's final James Bond novel, the following Bond stories being a series of novels about a teenage James Bond in the 1930s by Charlie Higson (see Young Bond), and a trilogy of faux-autobiographies by Samantha Weinberg entitled The Moneypenny Diaries, focusing on Miss Moneypenny. On 28 August 2005 Ian Fleming Publications confirmed that it was planning to publish a one-off adult Bond novel in 2008 to mark the 100th anniversary of Ian Fleming's birth. In July 2007 it was confirmed that the book had been completed by Sebastian Faulks, titled Devil May Care. Benson at one time had plans to release a collection of short Bond stories, but after abruptly announcing his retirement in early 2003 from writing Bond novels, the project was never pursued. Not counting novelisations, The Man with the Red Tattoo marks the 35th original James Bond novel (including short story collections) since Ian Fleming introduced the character nearly 50 years earlier. ==Plot introduction== On a flight from Japan to the United Kingdom, a young Japanese woman dies of a mysterious illness. The illness is a mutated version of the West Nile virus. James Bond finds out that not only was she the daughter of an important Japanese businessman, her entire family is also dead. James Bond travels to Japan in search of the killer. Here Bond reunites with his longtime friend Tiger Tanaka, who introduces him to a female Japanese agent who is later killed by the mutant virus. ==Publication history== * UK first hardback edition: 2 May 2002 Hodder & Stoughton * U.S. first hardback edition: 6 June 2002 Putnam * UK first paperback edition: 9 June 2003 Coronet Books * U.S. first paperback edition: May 2003 Jove Books ==See also== * Outline of James Bond ==References== ==External links== * Official Japanese 007 museum website * CBn The Man With The Red Tattoo Review * CBn Raymond Benson Interview, Part III * \\"Her Majesty's Secret Servant: Return of the Gaijin\\" (Michael Reed reviews The Man with the Red Tattoo) Category:2002 British novels Category:James Bond books Category:Novels by Raymond Benson Category:Hodder & Stoughton books Category:Novels set in Japan Category:Japan in non-Japanese culture ","title":"The Man with the Red Tattoo"},{"id":"1277597","text":"Stapelia is a genus of low-growing, spineless, stem succulent plants, predominantly from South Africa with a few from other parts of Africa.

Most Stapelia flowers are visibly hairy and generate the odour of rotten flesh when they bloom. == Description == The hairy, oddly textured and coloured appearance of many Stapelia flowers has been claimed to resemble that of rotting meat, and this, coupled with their odour, has earned the most commonly grown members of the genus Stapelia the common name of carrion flowers. A notable exception is the sweetly scented Stapelia flavopurpurea. Such odours serve to attract various specialist pollinators including, in the case of carrion-scented blooms, blow flies of the dipteran family Calliphoridae. They frequently lay eggs around the coronae of Stapelia flowers, convinced by the plants' deception.PlantZAfrica.com, Stapelia Info == Cultivation == A handful of species are commonly cultivated as pot plants and are even used as rockery plants in countries where the climate permits.

The citizen spirit was vividly invoked with its Viennese light-heartedness, but more so with its gentle pastoral Introduction where anticipation of an exciting waltz was at hand. Even the first theme of the waltz was quintessentially Viennese with its chorded melody.

It was led by William Ewart Gladstone of the Liberal Party upon his reappointment as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom by Queen Victoria. It lasted five months until July 1886. ==Formation== Gladstone speaking during a Commons debate on Irish Home Rule on 8 April 1886. The Liberal Party under the leadership of William Ewart Gladstone came to power in the United Kingdom in February 1886 after they, with the support of the Irish Nationalists, defeated the Conservative government of Lord Salisbury. The ministry was to become one of the most short-lived in British history. Gladstone, aged 76, became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom for the third time. Sir William Vernon Harcourt became Chancellor of the Exchequer, Hugh Childers Home Secretary and future Prime Minister the Earl of Rosebery Foreign Secretary. Lord Selborne and Sir Henry James both rejected the Lord Chancellorship, a post, which, however, was accepted by Sir Farrer Herschell, who was ennobled as Baron Herschell. Former Foreign Secretary Lord Granville became Secretary of State for the Colonies, while another political veteran, Lord Kimberley, resumed the post of Secretary of State for India which he had held from 1882 to 1885. The influential Joseph Chamberlain was appointed President of the Local Government Board while future party leader and Prime Minister Henry Campbell-Bannerman was made Secretary of State for War. The government also saw John Morley hold his first ministerial post as Chief Secretary for Ireland. The ministry is chiefly remembered for Gladstone's first attempt to introduce the Home Rule Bill for Ireland. The bill was defeated by a majority of 30 (93 Liberal MP's having voted against it) on 8 June and on 26 June Parliament was dissolved. The issue split the Liberal Party. Lord Hartington, who had refused to serve under Gladstone because of his Irish policies, became leader of the Liberal Unionists. He was joined by Joseph Chamberlain, who had resigned over Home Rule in April. ==Fate== The Conservative Party, with the support of the Liberal Unionists, gained a decisive victory in the July 1886 general election, and Lord Salisbury once again became Prime Minister. The Liberals were to remain out of office until 1892, when Gladstone became Prime Minister for a fourth time. ==Cabinet== ===February 1886 to August 1886=== ====Changes==== April 1886: James Stansfeld succeeds Joseph Chamberlain at the Local Government Board.

This article is a collection of critical quotations and other criticism against William Shakespeare and his works. Shakespeare enjoyed recognition in his own time, but in the 17th century, poets and authors began to consider him as the supreme dramatist and poet of all times of the English language. In fact, even today, no other dramatist has been performed even remotely as often on the British (and later the world) stage as Shakespeare Since then, several editors and critics of theater began to focus on the dramatic text and the language of Shakespeare, creating a study that focused on extracting all the power of his literary texts, being used in studies on the printed page rather than in the theater. This attitude reached a high point with the Romantics, which saw his figure as a genius, prophet, and Bard—and continued to be important into the last century, receiving analysis not only by poets and authors, but also by psychoanalysts, psychologists and philosophers. ==17th century== Ben Jonson: \\"He was not of an age, but for all time.\\"Jonson, Ben (1996), \\"To the memory of my beloued, The AVTHOR MR. WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE: AND what he hath left vs\\", in Shakespeare, William; Hinman, Peter W. (ed.); Blayney, The First Folio of Shakespeare (2nd ed.), New York: W.W. Norton & Company, . Ben Jonson, 1630: \\"I remember the players have often mentioned it as an honor to Shakespeare, that in his writing, whatsoever he penned, he never blotted out a line. My answer hath been, 'Would he had blotted a thousand,' which they thought a malevolent speech. I had not told posterity this but for their ignorance, who chose that circumstance to commend their friend by wherein he most faulted; and to justify mine own candor, for I loved the man, and do honor his memory on this side idolatry as much as any. He was, indeed, honest, and of an open and free nature; had an excellent fancy, brave notions, and gentle expressions, wherein he flowed with that facility that sometime it was necessary he should be stopped. 'Sufflaminandus erat,' as Augustus said of Haterius. His wit was in his own power; would the rule of it had been so too. Many times he fell into those things, could not escape laughter, as when he said in the person of Caesar, one speaking to him: 'Caesar, thou dost me wrong.' He replied: 'Caesar did never wrong but with just cause;' and such like, which were ridiculous. But he redeemed his vices with his virtues. There was ever more in him to be praised than to be pardoned.\\" \\"Timber\\" or \\"Discoveries\\" John Milton, 1632: \\"What need'st thou such weak witnes of thy name?\\" John Milton, 1632: \\"On Shakespeare\\" was Milton's first published poem & appeared (anonymously) in the 2nd folio of plays by Shakespeare (1632) as \\"An Epitaph on the admirable Dramaticke Poet, W.SHAKESPEARE\\". Samuel Pepys, 1662: \\"...it is the most insipid ridiculous play that ever I saw in my life...\\" Samuel Pepys, diary entry for 29 September, 1662: \\"This day my oaths of drinking wine and going to plays are out, and so I do resolve to take a liberty to-day, and then to fall to them again. To the King's Theatre, where we saw \\"Midsummer's Night's Dream [sic],\\" which I had never seen before, nor shall ever again, for it is the most insipid ridiculous play that ever I saw in my life. I saw, I confess, some good dancing and some handsome women, which was all my pleasure.\\" John Dryden, 1668: \\"All the Images of Nature were still present to him...\\" John Dryden, 1668: \\"To begin then with Shakespeare; he was the man who of all Modern, and perhaps Ancient Poets, had the largest and most comprehensive soul. All the Images of Nature were still present to him, and he drew them not laboriously, but luckily: when he describes any thing, you more than see it, you feel it too. Those who accuse him to have wanted learning, give him the greater commendation: he was naturally learn'd; he needed not the spectacles of Books to read Nature; he look'd inwards, and found her there.\\" Essay of Dramatic Poesy Thomas Rymer (neo-classical \\"rules\\" and \\"classical unities\\" extremist), 1692: \\"The Moral, sure, of this Fable [Othello] is very instructive. First, This may be a caution to all Maidens of Quality how, without their Parents consent, they run away with Blackamoors. Secondly, This may be a warning to all good Wives, that they look well to their Linnen. Thirdly, This may be a lesson to Husbands, that before their Jealousie be Tragical, the proofs may be Mathematical\\". (Rymer's notorious attack on Othello ultimately did Shakespeare's reputation more good than harm, by firing up John Dryden, John Dennis and other influential critics into writing eloquent replies.) Samuel Cobb (1675–1713), translator and master at Christ's Hospital: From Poetica Brittanici (1700). Cobb provides an example of the diffusion of Jonson's concept of Shakespeare as the \\"child of nature.\\" ==18th century== Bevill Higgons: From the preface to the revision of The Merchant of Venice (1701) by George Granville, 1st Baron Lansdowne. Here, Shakespeare is made both to recognize his own lack of sophistication and to approve the neoclassical polish added by Granville. Joseph Addison, 1712: \\"Among the English, Shakespeare has incomparably excelled all others.\\" Joseph Addison, 1712: \\"Among the English, Shakespeare has incomparably excelled all others. That noble extravagance of fancy, which he had in so great perfection, thoroughly qualified him to touch... his reader's imagination, and made him capable of succeeding, where he had nothing to support him besides the strength of his own genius.\\" Spectator no. 419 Alexander Pope, 1725: \\"His Characters are so much Nature her self that 'tis a sort of injury to call them by so distant a name as Copies of her. Those of other Poets have a constant resemblance, which shews that they receiv'd them from one another and were but multiplyers of the same image: each picture like a mock-rainbow is but the reflexion of a reflexion. But every single character in Shakespeare is as much an Individual as those in Life itself; it is as impossible to find any two alike; and such as from their relation or affinity in any respect appear most to be Twins will upon comparison be found remarkably distinct. To this life and variety of Character we must add the wonderful Preservation of it; which is such throughout his plays that had all the Speeches been printed without the very names of the persons I believe one might have apply'd them with certainty to every speaker. . . . I will conclude by saying of Shakespeare, that with all his faults, in comparison of those that are more finished and regular, as upon an ancient majestick piece of Gothick architecture, compared with a neat modern building: the latter is more elegant and glaring, but the former is more strong and more solemn . . Nor does the whole fail to strike us with greater reverence, though many of the parts are childish, ill-placed, and unequal to its grandeur.\\" Preface to Pope's edition of Shakespeare's works Samuel Johnson, 1775: \\"The form, the characters, the language, and the shows of the English drama are his.\\" Voltaire, 1733 Letters concerning the English nation: He created theatre. He had a genius full of strength and fertility, natural and without any spark of good taste and any knowledge of the rules. I'll tell you something hazardous but true: the merit of this author has lost the English theatre; there are such beautiful scenes, such great and at the same time so terrible pieces widespread in his monstrous farces which go by the name of tragedies; these plays have always been performed with great success. The Time, which alone makes the reputation of men, at the end made their faults respectable. The most gigantic and bizarre ideas of this author have earned, after two hundred years, the right to be considered sublime. Samuel Johnson, 1765 The Plays of William Shakespeare: \\"[Shakespeare's] adherence to general nature has exposed him to the censure of criticks, who form their judgments upon narrower principles. Dennis and Rymer think his Romans not sufficiently Roman; and Voltaire censures his kings as not completely royal. ... These are the petty cavils of petty minds.\\" \\"That it [mixing tragedy and comedy] is a practice contrary to the rules of criticism will be readily allowed; but there is always an appeal open from criticism to nature.\\" \\"To the unities of time and place he has shewn no regard, and perhaps a nearer view of the principles on which they stand will diminish their value, and withdraw from them the veneration which, from the time of Corneille, they have very generally received by discovering that they have given more trouble to the poet, than pleasure to the auditor.\\" \\"Perhaps it would not be easy to find any author, except Homer, who invented so much as Shakespeare, who so much advanced the studies which he cultivated, or effused so much novelty upon his age or country. The form, the characters, the language, and the shows of the English drama are his.\\" \\"The work of a correct and regular writer is a garden accurately formed and diligently planted, varied with shades, and scented with flowers; the composition of Shakespeare is a forest, in which oaks extend their branches, and pines tower in the air, interspersed sometimes with weeds and brambles, and sometimes giving shelter to myrtles and to roses; filling the eye with awful pomp, and gratifying the mind with endless diversity. Other poets display cabinets of precious rarities, minutely finished, wrought into shape, and polished unto brightness. Shakespeare opens a mine which contains gold and diamonds in unexhaustible plenty, though clouded by incrustations, debased by impurities, and mingled with a mass of meaner minerals.\\" Goethe: \\"There is no pleasure greater and purer than, with eyes closed, accompany a Shakespeare's play, not declaimed, but recited by a safe and natural voice.\\"Goethe, Writings on literature, p. 36 Johann Wolfgang Goethe, 1795–1796 Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship (book IV, chap. 3 and 13): \\"Prince Hamlet is suddenly facing the need for a great action imposed upon your soul that is unable to do it.\\" / \\"He [the character] is a beautiful being that succumbs under the load he can't distance itself without it.\\" J. W. Goethe, Writings on literature: \\"Much has been said about Shakespeare that does not seem anything left to say, but the spirit has features to stimulate the spirit forever...\\" \\"Shakespeare make effect with vitality of the word, and this is what becomes apparent in reading aloud, when the listener is distracted, not by a flawed or right presentation. There is no pleasure greater and purer than, with closed eyes, accompanied a Shakespeare's play, not declaimed, but recited by a safe and natural voice. Follow up the wires with it simple plot developments. For the description of the characters we can to imagine certain pictures, but we must, indeed, through a series of words and speeches, to experiment what is happening internally, and here all who are part of the story seem to have combined not leave anything obscure or in doubt.\\" \\"Shakespeare meets with the spirit of the world. He enters the world as it is spirit. For both, nothing is hidden; but as the work of the spirit of the world is to store mysteries before the action, or even after, the meaning of the poet is going to reveal the mystery, making us confident before the action, or just in run it.\\" \\"Shakespeare stands out singularly, linking the old and new in a lush. Wish and duty trying to put itself in balance in his plays; both are faced with violence, but always so that the wish is at a disadvantage.\\" \\"Perhaps no one has made so great as the first major link of wish and duty in the individual character as Shakespeare did.\\" ==19th century== Machado de Assis, 1896: \\"when we stop speaking English, we will speak Shakespeare.\\" Machado de Assis, 1896: \\"One day, when there is no more British Empire or North-American Republic, there will be Shakespeare; when we stop speaking English, we will speak Shakespeare.\\". Revista dEsEnrEdoS: \\"\\". Charles Lamb, 1811: \\"We talk of Shakespeare's admirable observation of life, when we should feel, that not from a petty inquisition into those cheap and every-day characters which surrounded him, as they surround us, but from his own mind, which was, to borrow a phrase of Ben Jonson's, the very 'sphere of humanity' he fetched those images of virtue and of knowledge, of which every one of us recognizing a part, think we comprehend in our natures the whole; and often mistake the powers which he positively creates in us, for nothing more than indigenous faculties of our own minds, which only waited the application of corresponding virtues in him to return a full and clear echo of the same.\\" On the Tragedies of Shakespeare Thomas de Quincey, 1823: \\"O, mighty poet! Thy works are not as those of other men, simply and merely great works of art; but are also like the phenomena of nature, like the sun and the sea, the stars and the flowers,—like frost and snow, rain and dew, hail-storm and thunder, which are to be studied with entire submission of our own faculties, and in the perfect faith that in them there can be no too much or too little, nothing useless or inert—but that, the further we press in our discoveries, the more we shall see proofs of design and self-supporting arrangement where the careless eye had seen nothing but accident!\\" \\"On the Knocking at the Gate in Macbeth\\". Thomas Carlyle, 1841: \\"Nay, apart from spiritualities; and considering him merely as a real, marketable, tangibly useful possession. England, before long, this Island of ours, will hold but a small fraction of the English: in America, in New Holland, east and west to the very Antipodes, there will be a Saxondom covering great spaces of the Globe. And now, what is it that can keep all these together into virtually one Nation, so that they do not fall out and fight, but live at peace, in brotherlike intercourse, helping one another? This is justly regarded as the greatest practical problem, the thing all manner of sovereignties and governments are here to accomplish: what is it that will accomplish this? Acts of Parliament, administrative prime- ministers cannot. America is parted from us, so far as Parliament could part it. Call it not fantastic, for there is much reality in it: Here, I say, is an English King, whom no time or chance, Parliament or combination of Parliaments, can dethrone! This King Shakespeare, does not he shine, in crowned sovereignty, over us all, as the noblest, gentlest, yet strongest of rallying-signs; indestructible; really more valuable in that point of view than any other means or appliance whatsoever? We can fancy him as radiant aloft over all the Nations of Englishmen, a thousand years hence. From Paramatta, from New York, wheresoever, under what sort of Parish-Constable soever, English men and women are, they will say to one another: 'Yes, this Shakespeare is ours; we produced him, we speak and think by him; we are of one blood and kind with him.'\\" On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and the Heroic in History Victor Hugo, 1859: \\"Two exiles, father and son, are on a desert island serving a long sentence. In a morning, sitting in front of the house, the young man asks: 'What do you think of this exile?' 'It will be long... \\", replied the father. 'And how occupy it?', continues the young son. The old serene man reply: 'I will look the ocean, and you?' It is a long silence before the son's answer: 'I will translate Shakespeare.' Shekespeare: the ocean.\\"Hamlet, translated to Portuguese by Péricles Eugênio da Silva Ramos, 1976. Abril Cultural, Teatro Vivo, 3rd Edition. ==Twentieth century== Leo Tolstoy, 1906: \\", but having read, one after the other, works regarded as his best, ...not only did I feel no delight, but I felt an irresistible repulsion and tedium.\\" Leo Tolstoy, 1906: \\"I remember the astonishment I felt when I first read Shakespeare. I expected to receive a powerful aesthetic pleasure, but having read, one after the other, works regarded as his best: \\"King Lear,\\" \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" \\"Hamlet\\" and \\"Macbeth,\\" not only did I feel no delight, but I felt an irresistible repulsion and tedium... Several times I read the dramas and the comedies and historical plays, and I invariably underwent the same feelings: repulsion, weariness, and bewilderment. At the present time, before writing this preface, being desirous once more to test myself, I have, as an old man of seventy-five, again read the whole of Shakespeare, including the historical plays, the \\"Henrys,\\" \\"Troilus and Cressida,\\" \\"The Tempest\\", \\"Cymbeline\\", and I have felt, with even greater force, the same feelings,—this time, however, not of bewilderment, but of firm, indubitable conviction that the unquestionable glory of a great genius which Shakespeare enjoys, and which compels writers of our time to imitate him and readers and spectators to discover in him non- existent merits,—thereby distorting their aesthetic and ethical understanding,—is a great evil, as is every untruth.\\" Tolstoy on Shakespeare. D. H. Lawrence, 1928: :\\"When I read Shakespeare I am struck with wonder :that such trivial people should muse and thunder :in such lovely language :. . . :How boring, how small Shakespeare's people are! :Yet the language so lovely! like the dyes from gas-tar.\\" \\"When I Read Shakespeare\\" in The Complete Poems of D.

Note added in The Interpretation of Dreams (1900) – Freud, 1900/1987: 260 Sigmund Freud, 1930: \\"I stopped to believe that the author of Shakespeare's works was the man of Stratford.\\" Freud, 1939: \\"It is well known that the genius is incomprehensible and irresponsible; so we should bring it to the dance as a full explanation to what the other solution has failed. The same consideration applies also to the remarkable case of William Shakespeare of Stratford.\\" Moses and Monotheism, 1939/1987: 83 W. H. Auden, 1947: \\"There is a continual process of simplification in Shakespeare's plays. What is he up to? He is holding the mirror up to nature. In the early minor sonnets he talks about his works outlasting time. But increasingly he suggests, as Theseus does in A Midsummer Night's Dream, that \\"The best in this kind are but shadows\\" (V.i.214), that art is rather a bore. ... I find Shakespeare particularly appealing in his attitude towards his work. There's something a little irritating in the determination of the very greatest artists, like Dante, Joyce, Milton, to create masterpieces and to think themselves important. To be able to devote one's life to art without forgetting that art is frivolous is a tremendous achievement of personal character. Shakespeare never takes himself too seriously.\\" Lectures on Shakespeare (ed. by Arthur Kirsch) T. S. Eliot: \\"Dante and Shakespeare divide the modern world between them, there is no third.\\" T. S. Eliot, 1922 : \\"We must simply admit that here Shakespeare tackled a problem which proved too much for him. Why he attempted it at all is an insoluble puzzle; under compulsion of what experience he attempted to express the inexpressibly horrible, we cannot ever know. We need a great many facts in his biography; and we should like to know whether, and when, and after or at the same time as what personal experience, he read Montaigne, II. xii., Apologie de Raimond Sebond. We should have, finally, to know something which is by hypothesis unknowable, for we assume it to be an experience which, in the manner indicated, exceeded the facts. We should have to understand things which Shakespeare did not understand himself.\\" Hamlet and His Problems, in The Sacred Wood: Essays on Poetry and Criticism.

R. R. Tolkien, letter no. 163 Allan Bloom, 1964: \\"Shakespeare devotes great care to establishing the political setting in almost all his plays, and his greatest heroes are rulers who exercise capacities which can only be exercised within civil society. To neglect this is simply to be blinded by the brilliance of one's own prejudices. As soon as one sees this, one cannot help asking what Shakespeare thought about a good regime and a good ruler.\\" on his Shakespeare's Politics (with Harry V. Jaffa). Kenneth Burke: \\"Shakespeare found many ingenious ways to make it seem that his greatest plays unfolded of themselves, like a destiny rather than by a technical expert’s scheming. . . . He spontaneously knew how to translate some typical tension or conflict of his society into terms of variously interrelated personalities—and his function as a dramatist was to let that whole complexity act itself out, by endowing each personality with the appropriate ideas, images, attitudes, actions, situations, relationships, and fatality. The true essence of his “beliefs” was thus embodied in the vision of that complexity itself. . . . Perhaps in this sense Shakespeare never wrote the ideal Shakespearean play; but again and again he came close to it. . . . he was the sort of craftsman who, if we believed such-and-such, could make a great play out of such beliefs, and could as easily have made a great play out of the opposite beliefs, if those others were what moved us. For what he believed in above all was the glory of his trade itself, which is to say, the great humaneness of the word . . . so masterfully embodied in Shakespeare’s blithe dramaturgic schemings.\\" Kenneth Burke on Shakespeare Stephen Booth, 1994: \\"A good metaphor for ... the action of casual, incidental relationships among words and ideas in Shakespeare is patina. Networks of nonsensical relationship act upon speeches and plays the way a patina does upon artwork in metal. They smooth across seams and deny them without obliterating them. Grosser examples of the effect have been noted in literature ever since people started analyzing double plots and noticing echoing situations and spotting thematic common denominators and sustained patterns of imagery.\\" Close Reading Without Readings Harold Bloom, 1994: \\"...Shakespeare is the Canon.

He engaged in business in California, and entered the Harvard Divinity School in 1867 but soon left for a position on the staff of the New York Evening Mail. After teaching at Wadsworth and Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio (1868–1871), he became principal of Oakland High School in Oakland, California. From 1874 to 1882, Sill was professor of English literature at the University of California. His health failing, he returned to Cuyahoga Falls in 1883. He devoted himself to literary work, abundant and largely anonymous, until his death in 1887 in Cleveland, Ohio. ==Works== Much of his poetry was contributed to The Atlantic Monthly, the Century Magazine, and the Overland Monthly. Many of his prose essays appeared in The Contributors Club, and others appeared in the main body of the Atlantic. Among his works are: * A translation of Rau's Mozart (1868). * The Hermitage and Other Poems (1868). * The Venus of Milo and Other Poems (1883), a farewell tribute to his California friends. * Poems (1887). * The Hermitage and Later Poems (1889). * Hermione and Other Poems (1900). * The Prose of Edward Rowland Sill (1900). * Poems (1902).

Oakley was a member of the National Basketball Association's Chicago Bulls, New York Knicks, Toronto Raptors, Washington Wizards and Houston Rockets. A power forward, he consistently ranked as one of the best rebounders in the NBA. Since 2017, he has been the coach of the Killer 3's of the BIG3. ==Early life and college career== Born and raised in Cleveland, Oakley attended John Hay High School and Virginia Union University, a Division II historically black university in Richmond, Virginia. As a senior in 1984–85, Oakley led Virginia Union to the 1985 CIAA championship. The Panthers had a 31-1 overall record that year, with Oakley averaging 24 points and 17.3 rebounds a game. Oakley was named the NCAA Division II Player of the Year. He scored 2,379 points and grabbed 1,642 rebounds in his college career. ==NBA== === Chicago Bulls (1985–1988) === Oakley was drafted with the 9th overall pick in the 1985 NBA draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers, but his draft rights were traded to the Chicago Bulls. Oakley provided another scoring option and steady offensive and defensive performances to an up-and-coming Bulls squad led by Michael Jordan. He also assumed the role of the team \\"cop\\" whose duty primarily was to protect young Jordan against cheap shots and roughhousing tactics of opposing players. He was given the nickname, \\"Oak Tree\\", for his rugged demeanor and no-nonsense attitude. Oakley was selected as a part of the NBA All-Rookie First Team in 1986. Charles Oakley during the 1986-87 season with the Chicago Bulls ===New York Knicks (1988–1998)=== With the drafting and development of Horace Grant, the Bulls traded Oakley to the New York Knicks for 7'1\\" center Bill Cartwright. Oakley eventually became a part of the core which the Knicks built around, which also featured Patrick Ewing, John Starks, and point guard Mark Jackson. During the Knicks' 1994 season, which included a record 25 playoff games, Oakley started every regular season and playoff game for a record 107 starts in a single season. During his tenure with the Knicks, Oakley was primarily known as a defensive specialist. ===Toronto Raptors (1998–2001)=== In 1998, Oakley was traded by New York to the Toronto Raptors for blossoming star Marcus Camby. For the Raptors, he provided a veteran presence to a young team that included Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady. ===Return to Chicago (2001–2002)=== In 2001, Oakley was traded by the Toronto Raptors with a 2002 2nd-round pick to the Chicago Bulls for Brian Skinner. This was his second tenure with the Bulls. Starting 36 of his 57 played games, he averaged 3.8 points per game, 6 rebounds per game, and 2 assists per game. ===Washington Wizards (2002–2003)=== In 2002, Oakley signed as a free agent with the Washington Wizards. He was reunited with former teammate Michael Jordan. Oakley played 42 games during the 2002–03 season, averaging 1.8 points per game, 2.5 rebounds per game, and 1 assist per game. ===Houston Rockets (2004)=== The 2003–04 season was Oakley's last season. On March 18, 2004, Oakley signed the first of two 10-day contracts with the Houston Rockets. Oakley only played 7 games, in which he averaged 1.3 points per game, 0.7 rebounds per game, and 0.3 assists per game. At the end of the season, Oakley retired from the NBA. ===Rumors of a return to the NBA=== In 2007 Oakley was reported to be attempting an NBA comeback, at age 44. He claimed Dallas, Miami, Cleveland and New York were interested but said he would \\"not [come] back cheap\\". ===Post-playing career=== On December 26, 2010, Oakley was hired as an assistant coach for the Charlotte Bobcats under then- head coach Paul Silas. He left that position on December 1, 2011 after experiencing health issues with back pain, during the 2010–11 season. Oakley owns several commercial enterprises, including: * Hair Solutions and Nails EtCetera in east Cleveland, Ohio, \\"salons started with seed money from Oakley and run by his sisters\\" * Oakley's car wash, oil change, and detail centers in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn and Yonkers, New York * Oakley's Wash House, a combination car wash and laundromat Oakley founded in east Cleveland, Ohio, overseen by his sister Carolyn and mother Corine * Red, The Steakhouse, restaurants in Cleveland, Ohio and South Beach, Miami, Florida ==Legacy== Oakley was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame and Museum in honor of his 19-year professional basketball career. The induction ceremony was held on April 30, 2016. In September 2016, a portion of Deering Street in Oakley's hometown of Cleveland (near his alma mater of John Hay High School) was renamed Charles Oakley Way in his honor. He was inducted into the CIAA Hall of Fame in 2005 after his career at Virginia Union University. ===Career highlights=== *He placed in the top ten in rebounds per game five times between 1987 and 1994 (second in 1987 and 1988). *Due to his durability he actually placed in the top ten in total rebounds 6 times and led the league in total rebounds twice (1987 and 1988). *In 1994, he became an NBA All-Star and was chosen to the league's All-Defense 1st team. *Oakley currently ranks 25th all-time in NBA games played with 1,282 games, and 22nd all-time in career rebounds with 12,205 rebounds. ==Personal life== In 2011, Oakley filed a lawsuit against the Aria Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, alleging a group assault by five security guards employed by the casino on May 28, 2010. On July 30, 2016 Oakley married his wife Angela Reed. === Madison Square Garden arrest === On February 8, 2017, Oakley was involved in an altercation at Madison Square Garden as the Knicks faced the visiting Los Angeles Clippers. According to the Knicks, Oakley was ejected from the arena after he is alleged to have yelled at James L. Dolan, the Executive Chairman of Madison Square Garden and MSG Networks, and refused to stop, an allegation he denies. There were also accounts of him hitting a security guard in his face and shoving another guard before being dragged away from the game and handcuffed. He was charged with three counts of misdemeanor assault and criminal trespassing. In a statement, the Knicks stated that Oakley \\"came to the game tonight and behaved in a highly inappropriate and completely abusive manner. He was ejected and was then arrested by the New York City Police Department.\\" In response, Oakley claimed that he sat down in his seat and he saw the Knicks owner James Dolan look at him and within four minutes he was being asked to leave the arena. He says that he didn't become combative until he was asked to leave for no apparent reason. While admitting \\"I shouldn't have put my hands on anyone,\\" Oakley disputed the Knicks' rendition of events in an interview with ESPN's \\"The Undefeated,\\" which reported that Oakley says he \\"never said a word to Dolan\\" and \\"was minding his own business when he was confronted by Madison Square Garden Security, who asked why he was sitting so close to Dolan before demanding that he leave the building.\\"Mike Wise, \\"Former New York Knick Charles Oakley recounts his side of the arrest at Madison Square Garden,\\" February 9, 2017, http://theundefeated.com/features/new-york-knicks-charles- oakley/ On February 13, 2017, NBA legend Michael Jordan and NBA commissioner Adam Silver met with both Dolan and Oakley at NBA headquarters. Oakley and Dolan both apologized for the fallout and both were currently negotiating a truce. \\"Both Mr. Oakley and Mr. Dolan were apologetic about the incident and subsequent comments, and their negative impact on the Knicks organization and the NBA,\\" Silver said. The statement says Dolan hopes Oakley can return to MSG as his guest in the near future. On February 14, 2017, the ban from Madison Square Garden was lifted. On September 12, 2017, it was reported that Oakley was filing a civil lawsuit over the incident. Oakley later retorted on March 11, 2019 that Dolan is someone who tries to bully everyone because he has money and power as an owner of the Knicks, quoting that \\"it doesn't make sense.\\" He also admits he has very little reason to hold any reconciliation with Dolan, noting his relationship with the Knicks was frayed before the incident occurred (though he still bought himself tickets for Knicks games a few times each season before the incident), while also saying nothing was really resolved from his meeting with Adam Silver. Oakley further notes the incident caused a damaged relationship with the team, to the point where the possibility of his jersey being retired was in jeopardy. This all came out after Dolan threatened to ban a fan from the arena for yelling at him to \\"sell the team\\" a few days prior. == NBA career statistics == === Regular season === -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Chicago  77  30  23.0  .519  .000  .662  8.6  1.7  .9  .4  9.6 -

The university had two campuses in Newport, Caerleon on the northern outskirts of the city, which was subsequently closed during July 2016, and a £35 million campus on the east bank of the River Usk in the Newport city centre which opened in 2011.University of Wales, Newport In 2012 the university was ranked 111th out of 120 UK universities in the Guardian League Table for university rankings, 105th out of 116 in The Complete University Guide and 104th out of 116 UK universities in the Times Good University Guide. ==History== Newport had been involved in higher education since 1841. Originally a Mechanics Institute, set up to provide further education for workers and tradesmen, the institution was based in Newport's Town Hall on Commercial Street. Working men and women were able to attend a variety of lectures for two shilling per quarter to study subjects including \\"The Pursuit of Attainment and Knowledge\\" and \\"Popular Superstition\\". The institution was later formed as Gwent College of Higher Education by a merger of the Caerleon College of Education (the former Monmouthshire Training College), the Newport College of Art and Design and the Gwent College of Technology in 1975. All three former institutions had established regional and national reputations, most notably the College of Art with many of its students gaining commissions from the BBC and other major organisations in light of the College being amongst a select number of art colleges in the country awarded Diploma in Art and Design status. The college became an affiliated institution of the University of Wales in 1992, being admitted as a university college in 1996 where there was a ceremony at which trumpeters of the Prince of Wales Division played a fanfare from the top of the university clocktower and balloons were released in the faculty colours. In May 2004 the University of Wales College, Newport secured Privy Council Approval to use the title University of Wales, Newport, as a full constituent of the federal university. As of 1 August 2011, the University was restructured, creating two new faculties, each containing three schools: The Faculty of Arts and Business * School of Design, Engineering, Fashion and Technology * School of Film, Photography and Digital Media * Newport Business School The Faculty of Education and Social Sciences * School of Education * School of Humanities and Lifelong Learning * School of Sport, Health and Applied Social Sciences The Centre for Community and Lifelong Learning (CCLL) continued to be based in Tredegar and focused on the University's work to widen participation within the Heads of the Valleys and the wider Gwent region. CCLL was also a key deliverer of the UHOVI (Universities, Heads of the Valleys Institute) project in partnership with the University of Glamorgan and Further Education Colleges.University of Wales, Newport ===Notable dates=== * 1841 Opening of Mechanics Institute, Newport * 1872 Classes in Art and Science begin under the Free Library Committee * 1882 New building opened in Dock Street, Newport * 1886 Teacher training classes begin * 1891 Newport Technical School opened * 1898 New premises opened at 24 Bridge Street Separation of Art Department and Science, Technology & Commerce Two Heads appointed * 1899 Clarence Place land bought from Lord Tredegar * 1909 Foundation stone laid at Clarence Place * 1910 Newport Technical Institute opened at Clarence Place * 1912 Foundation stone laid at Caerleon Training College * 1914-18 World War One 12 Caerleon students killed in the war * 1915 Schools of Art and Science, Technology and Commerce combined under single Principal * 1919 Newport Technical Institute renamed \\"The County Borough of Newport Technical College and Institute\\" * 1923 Ordinary National Certificates offered for the first time * 1934 Name changed to \\"Newport Technical College\\" * 1938 Higher National Certificates offered for the first time * 1939 – 45 World War Two College used to troop lectures and evacuees 19 Caerleon students killed in the war * 1940 – 41 Classes run by Ministry of Labour * 1950 Board of Governors given more power to run Caerleon College of Education * 1958 Opening of Newport and Monmouthshire College of Technology which later became the Allt-yr-ynn campus.

The plans proved to be highly controversial, with Cardiff Metropolitan opposing any merger, citing the lack of a business case, concerns that the new institution (which would be the largest campus university in Britain) would simply be too big to manage properly, and the 'predatory' attitude of Glamorgan. Newport, however, welcomed the plans, providing they created a genuinely new institution. Professor Stephen Hagen, appointed Acting Vice-Chancellor by the Newport Board from 1 June 2012 to lead the merger upon the sudden resignation of Dr Peter Noyes, circulated a proposal for the new university to focus on entrepreneurialism,http://www.unialliance.ac.uk/blog/2012/12/10/university-of- wales-newport/ generating start-ups, equipping students with entrepreneurial skillshttp://ncee.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/From-Concept-To-Action.pdf and supporting the industries of South Wales,http://www.unialliance.ac.uk/blog/2012/12/10/creating-the- entrepreneurial-university-the-educational-rationale a concept which was initially well-received by the Minister's Office.https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/local-news/ministers-office-finds- entrepreneurial-university-2658680/ In July 2012, Newport and Glamorgan announced talks to create a new University for South Wales, citing the opportunity to: \\"build on their respective strengths to develop a new, entrepreneurial model of higher education across south Wales\\". The university was dissolved on 11 April 2013 absorbed into University of Glamorgan and renamedsought University of South Wales.University merger 11 April 2013 In response to Cardiff Metropolitan's opposition to their involvement in any merger plans, Leighton Andrews (a strong proponent of mergershttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-11911375/) threatened to forcibly dissolve Cardiff Metropolitan and hand its assets over to the new University formed by Glamorgan. Cardiff Metropolitan still demanded more evidence before committing to further talks and in November 2012, Leighton Andrews withdrew a consultation on plans to force a merger. ==City campus== Newport city centre campus The University opened a new £35 million campus in Newport's City Centre formally on 10 January 2011. The project was a collaboration between the University, Newport City Council and the Welsh Assembly Government operating through Newport Unlimited, the urban regeneration company for the City. The campus is situated on the east bank of the River Usk in the City Centre and it was the first phase of an intended £50m development for the University. It housed the Faculty of Arts and Business whilst the Caerleon Campus housed the Faculty of Education and Social Sciences. The campus was part of a major redevelopment of Newport City Centre.Newport City Council Redevelopment The old city campus at Allt-yr-yn was closed and demolished. ==Reputation== The University had been involved in higher education since 1841. In 2009 It was rated the number one university in Wales for enterprise education by the Knowledge Exploitation Fund. The School of Film, Photography and Digital Media taught a documentary photography degree programme as well as housing the Newport Film School, founded by John Grierson in 1966 and producing many award-winning film-makers since then. The 2010 CILECT Congress (the international association for film and television schools around the world) unanimously voted in Newport Film School as a full member – only two of the ten new applicant schools for full membership were given this accolade.Newport film school joins international elite ==Facilities== The accommodation facilities on the Caerleon Campus consisted of 661 rooms with a choice of standard or en-suite facilities. En-suite halls were arranged into flats of five rooms whilst the standard halls had approximately 15 residents per floor. Bedrooms were centrally heated and equipped with furniture, whilst hall kitchens were equipped with standard kitchen appliances. The university had a sports centre housing a large sports hall, a gym/fitness suite and outdoor pitches and courts. The University Library was open seven days a week and computer suites were open 24 hours a day. ==Students' Union== Newport Students' Union was the union representing all students at the University. From the moment students enrolled they were automatically a member of the Students’ Union.Newport Students' Union It was intended that for every year of every course there should have been at least one course representative. The union was run day-to-day by a team of sabbatical officers – students who were taking an extra year or year out from their studies to develop the union. Alongside this sabbatical team full-time and part-time staff were employed to assist in the operation of the union and part-time officers, team captains, society presidents and student managers who all work alongside their studies to assist the union. Newport Students' Union provided a range of sports teams, societies and entertainment for students to get involved in. The union also housed a newspaper (NewsPort), magazine (newtwo), TV station (NTV) and radio station (Radio Noize), all of which students managed and ran. As well as weekly social events and club nights, the union organised Freshers' Fortnight, Freshers' Fayre, Re: Freshers Week, RAG (Raising and Giving Week) and the May Ball which has previously had headline acts including Supergrass, Girls Aloud, Electric Six, Scouting for Girls, The Zutons and Feeder.Newport Students Union http://www.newportunion.com/ ==Notable alumni== (View University of South Wales for further alumni ) http://www.southwales.ac.uk/about/our-history/ *Christopher Chung Shu-kun, BBS, JP, a member of Hong Kong Legislative Council *Roger Cecil *Ken Elias (born 1944), artist * Tom Gately, writer, director and cameramanhttp://www.tomgatley.com/Home.html *Harry Greene, television personality *Paul Groves (born 1947), poet *Philip John http://www.philipjohn.net/ *Kirk Jones (director) *Asif Kapadia *Justin Kerrigan *Jon Maguire songwriter and former member of duo Lilygreen & Maguire *Tracey Moberly *Teddy Soeriaatmadja *Ian Watkins, former singer in the rock band Lostprophets; convicted sex offender *Green Gartside, the frontman of the band Scritti Politti * Helen Murphy, author ==See also== *Newport Technical Institute, the landmark former Newport Art College building ==External links== *University of Wales, Newport *Newport Students Union *University of Wales, Newport YouTube Channel ==References== Category:1841 establishments in Wales Category:Educational institutions established in 1841 Category:Universities in Wales Category:Buildings and structures in Newport, Wales Category:Landmarks in Newport, Wales Category:History of Newport, Wales Category:Educational institutions disestablished in 2013 Category:Defunct universities and colleges in Wales ","title":"University of Wales, Newport"},{"id":"1277626","text":"The Pulaski Day Parade is a parade held annually since 1936 on Fifth Avenue in New York City to commemorate Kazimierz Pulaski, a Polish hero of the American Revolutionary War.

He studied at the University of Leipzig, where he also received a Magister degree. Despite having converted to Protestantism, he became the chancellor of Bishop Tiedemann Giese between 1540 and 1549. After Giese received the Diocese of Warmia, David joined the ducal court of Albert, Duke of Prussia, in Königsberg (Królewiec) (today Kalingrad) in 1549, taking his oath on 26 March 1550. Albert commissioned a work on the history of Prussia, mainly to counter the - in his view - biased Polish and Catholic works. However, he was only able to produce a recent history of Prussia before he died. His son, Albert Frederick, however, continued the efforts, and instructed David to compile a history of Prussia. This was also supported by various social classes, which believed that the Polish histories belittled Prussian achievements. Hence David researched documents of Prussian history, and started to write his Prussian Chronicles (\\"Preußische Chronik\\") from ca. 1575. While David utilized large parts of the work of Simon Grunau, he also frequently corrected errors by Grunau. David married a wealthy widow in Leipzig. He instituted scholarships at the University of Leipzig, mainly for poor students from his hometown. Before David was able to complete his chronicles, he died at Königsberg in 1583 at the age of 80. The chronicle ends with the events preceding the Battle of Grunwald (or Tannenberg) in 1410; other sources state that his works extend till 1475. His works were largely unknown to his contemporaries, and were re-discovered only around 1720, with another 100 years before its first publication in the years between 1812–17 in eight volumes. Since then he has become well known past the borders of his homeland for these Prussian Chronicles. He is ranked as a 'modern' historian, as he based his studies on historic sources. The Prussica-Sammlung Trunz started by another Allenstein native, Dr. August Trunz (1875-1963), contains works by David. It is housed in the library of the University of Münster. ==Works== *Hennig, Ernst (ed): Preussische Chronik. - Königsberg : Haberland, 1.1812 - 6. 1814 ==Literature== * Udo Arnold: Studien zur preussischen Historiographie des 16.

On the Asclepiadeae 11 The flowers are five-lobed, usually somewhat more funnel- or bell-shaped than in the closely related genus Stapelia, and often striped vividly in contrasting colors or tones, some glossy, others matte and wrinkled depending on the species concerned. Frequently the flowers are colored a variation of red, yellow or brown. To pollinate, the flowers attract flies by emitting a scent similar to that of carrion. The genus is considered close to the genera Stapelia and Hoodia. Phylogenetic studies have shown the genus to be monophyletic, and most closely related to the genus Tavaresia, and to a widespread branch of stapeliads comprising the genera Orbea, Piaranthus and Stapelia.P.

Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution. 2014. v. 77, no. 1, p. 251--263. ISSN 1055-7903. The name of the plant is in honor of Justus van Heurne (1587–1653?) a Dutch missionary, botanist, and doctor, who is reputed to have been the first European to document and collect South African Cape plants. His surname has variations (van Horne, Heurnius, van Heurnius), however it was misspelled by the plant collector. Various species of Huernia are considered famine food by the inhabitants of Konso special woreda in southern Ethiopia. The local inhabitants, who call the native species of this genus baqibaqa indiscriminately, eat it with prepared balls of sorghum (kurkufa); they note that baqibaqa tastes relatively good and has no unpleasant side-effects when boiled and consumed. As a result, local farmers encouraged it to grow on stone walls forming the terraces, where it does not compete with other crops. == Species == Sixty four species of Huernia are found in Africa (East Africa, South Africa and Ethiopia) and Arabia (Saudi Arabia, Yemen).The Plant List genus Huernia ;formerly included moved to Angolluma *Huernia sprengeri now Angolluma sprengeri File:Huernia aspera.jpgalt=Huernia asperiaHuernia asperia File:Huernia guttata ericbrian.jpgalt=Huernia guttataHuernia guttata File:Huernia piersii1.JPGalt=Huernia piersiiHuernia piersii File:Huernia primulina (Vermont).jpgalt=Huernia primulinaHuernia primulina File:Huernia quinta.JPGalt=Huernia quintaHuernia quinta File:Flower of Huernia schneideriana.jpgalt=Huernia schneiderianaHuernia schneideriana File:Huernia striata1.JPGalt=Huernia striataHuernia striata File:Huernia zebrina kwiat.jpgalt=Huernia zebrinaHuernia zebrina ==References== ==External links== *Images of Stapeliads *Plant care Category:Apocynaceae genera Category:Flora of Africa ","title":"Huernia"},{"id":"1277635","text":"Murfatlar () is a town in Constanța County, Northern Dobruja, Romania. ==Etymology== The name of the town originates from the Turkish word murvet (meaning \\"generous man\\").

Statues (also known as Red Light, Green Light in the United States, and Grandmother's Footsteps in the United Kingdom) is a popular children's game, often played in different countries. How the game is played varies throughout different regions of the world. == General rules == # A person starts out as the \\"Curator\\" (It, Granny, Pooh, etc.) and stands at the end of a field. Everyone else playing stands at the far end (distance depends upon playing area selected). The object of the game is for a \\"Statue\\" to tag the Curator, thereby becoming the Curator and resetting the game. # The Curator turns their back to the field, and the \\"Statues\\" attempt to race across and tag the Curator. # Whenever the Curator turns around, the Statues must freeze in position and hold that for as long as the Curator looks at them. The Curator can even walk around the Statues, examining them. However, the Curator needs to be careful - whenever the Curator's back is turned, Statues are allowed to move. # If a Statue is caught moving, they are sent back to the starting line to begin again (or thrown out of that round, whichever way is preferred) and if a statue gets sent back they must go all the way back. Usually, the honesty of the Curator is not enforced, since being a Statue is more desirable. == Variations == === Red Light/Green Light === Red Light/Green Light (sometimes abbreviated as RLGL) is a variation of statue. The title of the game refers to the colors of a traffic light. The \\"it\\" person stands at one end of the playing field, with the rest of the players at the other end. \\"It\\" turns their back to the others and calls out \\"Green Light!\\" The others then run as fast as they can towards \\"it.\\" At any time, \\"it\\" can call out \\"Red Light!\\" and turn to face the others; and the others must freeze in place. If anyone fails to stop, they are out or must return to the starting line. The first player to reach the person who is \\"it\\" wins and becomes \\"it\\" for the next round. In another variation, when the \\"it\\" person calls out \\"Yellow Light!\\" the other players must slowly approach the \\"it\\" person. In the Dutch version, instead of \\"Green light!\\" the \\"it\\" person sings in a slow voice \\"Annemaria\\", followed by a quick and loud \\"Koekkoek!\\" (\\"Cuckoo!\\") when he/she turns around (like \\"Red Light!\\"). \\"Koekkoek!\\" is also the Dutch equivalent of a Peek-a-boo game played with babies, where the parents hide their face with their hands, then reveal themselves whilst saying \\"Peek-a-boo!\\" (also known in Dutch as \\"Kiekeboe!\\"). === Grandmother's Footsteps === In this version the Curator is the \\"Granny\\" and does not call out anything before facing the players. === Winnie the Pooh === Winnie the Pooh is a variation of Statues where the person playing \\"Pooh\\" (the Curator) usually leans against a wall and has to shout \\"1, 2, 3, Winnie the Pooh, stop!\\" (so it is long enough for the players to reach some distance and because of the rhyme it provides in Bulgarian, where this version comes from) before turning to face the players. Whenever a player tags Pooh they have to run so it doesn't catch them. If they manage to go back to the wall where Pooh was leaning before it catches them, they become Pooh and the game starts over. In this variation the role of Pooh is more desirable. === Team building exercise === Another variation of the Red Light / Green Light game was altered as a team building exercise. It follows RLGL rules with exception that if anybody moves after the red light the whole team must return to the starting line. Also, the object of the game is for the players to \\"steal\\" an \\"object\\" positioned near the \\"it\\" person and return with it to the other side of the field. Once the \\"object\\" is moved it has to stay hidden from \\"it\\" who has several guesses as to who has it at the moment. If guessed successfully then the whole team must return to the starting line.

The men, including many coal-miners, most with home-made arms, were intent on liberating fellow Chartists who were reported to have been taken prisoner in the town's Westgate Hotel. About 22 demonstrators were killed when troops opened fire on them. The leaders of the rebellion were convicted of treason and were sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered. The sentence was later commuted to transportation. == Causes == The origins of Chartism in Wales can be traced to the foundation in the autumn of 1836 of Carmarthen Working Men's Association. Among the factors that precipitated the rising were the House of Commons' rejection of the first Chartist petition, the People's Charter of 1838 (which called for universal suffrage, secret ballot, a salary for MPs, giving those who did not own property the right to vote, etc.) on 12 July 1839, and the conviction of the Chartist Henry Vincent for unlawful assembly and conspiracy on 2 August.The Welsh Academy Encyclopædia of Wales. Cardiff: University of Wales Press 2008. Some kind of rising had been in preparation for a few months and the march had been gathering momentum over the course of the whole weekend, as John Frost and his associates led the protesters down from the industrialised valley towns to the north of Newport. Some of the miners who joined the march had armed themselves with home-made pikes, bludgeons and firearms. The march was headed by Frost leading a column into Newport from the west, Zephaniah Williams leading a column from Blackwood to the northwest and William Jones leading a column from Pontypool to the north. The exact rationale for the confrontation remains opaque, although it may have its origins in Frost's ambivalence towards the more violent attitudes of some Chartists, and the personal animus he bore towards some of the Newport establishment. The Chartist movement in southeast Wales was chaotic in this period and the feelings of the workers were running extremely high. == Events leading up to the Rising == Heavy rainfall delayed the marchers and there were delays in the planned meeting of each contingent at the Welsh Oak in Rogerstone. Jones and his men from Pontypool in fact never arrived, delaying the final march into Newport into the daylight hours and thus contributing to its defeat. As the march progressed down the valleys on the Sunday morning, even one entire chapel congregation was pressed into swelling the ranks of the marchers. After spending Sunday night mostly out of doors in the rain, the commitment of many of the marchers was lukewarm. Many had been ambivalent to the Chartist cause in the first place, more concerned with the immediate problems of their own employment conditions. Thus many marchers did not participate in the final assault on Newport and simply waited in the outskirts of the town. Westgate Hotel, Newport Rumours of a possible Chartist rising and previous violence elsewhere, following the earlier arrest of Chartist leader Henry Vincent and his imprisonment at the gaol in Monmouth, meant that the authorities had suspected there might be a riot. The sheer scale of the rising, however was not fully appreciated until 3 November, the day before the riot. The authorities then quickly started to prepare. The Mayor of Newport Thomas Phillips had sworn in 500 Special Constables and asked for more troops to be sent. There were about 60 soldiers stationed in Newport already, and he gathered 32 soldiers of the 45th (Nottinghamshire) Regiment of Foot in the Westgate Hotel where the Chartist prisoners were held. == Climax of the Rising == It is estimated that nearly 10,000 Chartist sympathisers marched on the town. The Chartists were convinced that some of their fellows had been imprisoned at the Westgate Hotel. Filing quickly down the steep Stow Hill, the Chartists arrived at the small square in front of the hotel at about 9.30 am. The flash point came when the crowd demanded the release of the imprisoned Chartists. A brief, violent and bloody battle ensued. Shots were fired by both sides, contemporary accounts indicating that the Chartists attacked first. But the soldiers defending the hotel despite being greatly outnumbered by the large and very angry crowd, had vastly superior firepower, training and discipline, all of which soon broke the crowd. The Chartists did manage to enter the building temporarily, but were forced to retreat in disarray. After a fiercely fought battle, lasting approximately half an hour, between 10 and 24 of their number (a fair estimate is 22) had been killed by the troops and upwards of 50 had been wounded. Amongst the defenders of the hotel, Mayor Thomas Phillips was badly wounded and one soldier was seriously hurt, along with two of the special constables. As the chartists fled they abandoned many of their weapons, a selection of which can still be seen in Newport Museum. An eyewitness report spoke of one man, wounded with gunshot, lying on the ground, pleading for help until he died an hour later. Some of the Chartist dead were buried in St. Woolos parish church (now Newport Cathedral) in the town where there is still a plaque to their memory. An urban myth persists that some of the bullet holes from the skirmish remained in the masonry of the hotel entrance porch until well into modern times. In reality the Westgate Hotel has been rebuilt since the uprising. The \\"bullet holes\\" may be bomb damage from the Second World War. == Aftermath == Dramatisation of the trial of the Chartists at Shire Hall, including background information. In the aftermath 200 or more Chartists were arrested for being involved and twenty- one were charged with high treason. All three main leaders of the march, John Frost, Zephaniah Williams, and William Jones, were found guilty on the charge of high treason and were sentenced at the Shire Hall in Monmouth to be hanged, drawn and quartered. They were to be the last people to be sentenced to this punishment in England and Wales. After a nationwide petitioning campaign and, extraordinarily, direct lobbying of the Home Secretary by the Lord Chief Justice the government eventually commuted the sentences of each to transportation for life.Malcolm Chase, Chartism: A New History (Manchester UP, 2007), pp. 137–40. Other Chartists involved in some way included James Stephens, John Lovell, John Rees and William Price, and according to some accounts Allan Pinkerton. Testimonies exist from contemporaries, such as the Yorkshire Chartist Ben Wilson, that a successful rising at Newport was to have been the signal for a national uprising. Older histories suggested that Chartism slipped into a period of internal division after Newport. In fact the movement was remarkably buoyant (and remained so until late 1842). Initially, while the majority of Chartists, under the leadership of Feargus O'Connor, concentrated on petitioning for Frost, Williams and Jones to be pardoned, significant minorities in Sheffield, East End of London and Bradford planned their own risings in response. Samuel Holberry led an aborted rising in Sheffield on 12 January; police action thwarted a major disturbance in the East End of London on 14 January, and on 26 January a few hundred Bradford Chartists staged a rising in the hope of precipitating a domino effect across the country.Chase, Chartism, pp. 135–38, 152–57. After this Chartism turned to a process of internal renewal and more systematic organisation, but the transported and imprisoned Newport Chartists were regarded as heroes and martyrs amongst workers. Meanwhile, the Establishment and middle classes became convinced that the rising meant all Chartists were dangerously violent. Newport Mayor Thomas Phillips was proclaimed a national hero for his part in crushing the rising and was knighted by Queen Victoria barely six weeks later. Frost himself was eventually given an unconditional pardon in 1856 and allowed to return to Britain, receiving a triumphant welcome in Newport.Williams, David. John Frost: A Study in Chartism. 1939. p.318 But he never lived in Newport again, settling instead in Stapleton near Bristol, where he continued to publish articles advocating reform until his death, aged 93, in 1877. == Commemoration == Interest in the Newport Rising was kept alive through occasional articles in the Monmouthshire Merlin and South Wales Argus. In 1939, to commemorate the centenary of the Rising, Newport Borough Council erected a plaque on the Post Office building near the birthplace of John Frost. In the 1960s, redevelopment of Newport led to the creation of a central square which was named John Frost Square. The Chartist mural (see below) was situated in an underpass leading to the square. Newport Museum has a display relating to the uprising which includes homemade weapons. In 1991 three statues, 'Union, Prudence, Energy' by Christopher Kelly, commemorating the uprising were installed on Commercial Street at the front of the Westgate Hotel. In 2015 it was announced that Duffryn High School was to be renamed John Frost School. An annual 'Chartist Convention' is held in the city. Commemorative sites in other communities includes a 26 ft tall statue of a Chartist marcher designed by Sebastian Boyson, erected by Caerphilly County Borough Council near the Chartist Bridge at Blackwood. The Shire Hall in Monmouth, scene of the Chartist trial in 1840, has a preserved courtroom and displays relating to the trial. A plaque commemorating the departure of Frost, Williams and Jones from Chepstow by ship to Portsmouth on the first stage of their transportation voyage is situated on the Chepstow river front. === John Frost Square mural === In the 1960s, as part of a redevelopment scheme, a new square was named John Frost Square to commemorate the leader of the Rising,Documenting Chartism: The Newport Chartist Mural Documentation Project.

In 2007, an introductory panel was removed, and it was proposed that, as part of a further redevelopment scheme, the mural would be removed. Proposals to demolish the mural were restated in 2012.Nick Dermody, \\"Newport Chartist mural artwork faces demolition\\", BBC News, 13 March 2012.

The title of this polka was inspired from the waltz duet in the Singspiel (musical comedy) Aline by Adolf Bäuerle with music by Wenzel Müller first performed at the Theater in der Leopoldstadt on 9 October 1822. The song titled 'Was macht denn der Prater' was a hit during its day whereas its refrain 'Ja nur ein' Kaiserstadt, ja nur a Wien' (Yes, only one Imperial City, yes only one Vienna!) became a popular household phrase. While Stauss adapts no music from the stage work, he did incorporate Haydn's Austrian Hymn 'Gott erhalte' into the Finale of the polka. Strauss first performed the work during a lucrative Russian tour at Pavlovsk where he frequently performed at the Vauxhall Pavilion. At his penultimate concert there on 8 October 1864 (Russian calendar 26 September), he performed the work under its original title 'Vergiß mein nicht' (Forget me Not). For his audiences back home in Vienna, he retitled the work and performed it on 4 December 1864 at a festive concert at the Vienna Volksgarten to celebrate his 20th anniversary of his public début at Dommayer's Casino. == References == * Category:Compositions by Johann Strauss II Category:Polkas Category:Compositions set in Vienna ","title":"'S gibt nur a Kaiserstadt, 's gibt nur a Wien!"},{"id":"1277655","text":"Banner for the Bureau of Colored troops The Bureau of Colored Troops was created by the United States War Department on May 22, 1863, under General Order No. 143, during the Civil War, to handle \\"all matters relating to the organization of colored troops.\\" Major Charles W. Foster was chief of the Bureau, which reported to Adjutant General Lorenzo Thomas. The designation United States Colored Troops replaced the varied state titles that had been given to the African-American soldiers.Dudley Taylor Cornish, The Sable Arm: Negro Troops in the Union Army, 1861-1865 (1955; New York: W.W. Norton, 1965), pp. 129-131.James M. McPherson, The Negro's Civil War (New York: Pantheon Books, 1965), p. 170. == Origins and recruitment == The first official authorization to employ African Americans in federal service was the Second Confiscation and Militia Act of July 17, 1862. This act allowed President Abraham Lincoln to receive into the military service persons of African descent and gave permission to use them for any purpose \\"he may judge best for the public welfare.\\" However, the President did not authorize use of African Americans in combat until issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863: \\"And I further declare and make known, that such persons of suitable condition, will be received into the armed service of the United States to garrison forts, positions, stations, and other places, and to man vessels of all sorts in said service.\\" With these words the Union army changed. During the American Civil War, in mid-1863, the administrative load became so burdensome that the War Department decided to create a single entity under the umbrella of the Adjutant General's Office, called the Bureau of Colored Troops, to manage its affairs. Headed by Major Charles W. Foster, the bureau was to systematize the process of raising black units and securing officers for them. It also served as a clearinghouse of information on these units. Over the course of the next year, the War Department began to change the names of black commands. Instead of state designations, they became United States Colored Troops, and the various units became United States Colored Infantry, Artillery, or Cavalry. == Racial segregation and treatment == The Bureau of Colored Troops brought efficiency to the USCT regiments, but not always equitable treatment. Despite objections from black leaders, the Bureau insisted on assigning only white men to commissioned officer positions. Although a small number of black soldiers received commissions by the end of the war—including the Virginia-born Martin R. Delany—and many served as non commissioned officers, the USCT remained primarily an organization led by whites. Officials in the army and in the government also initially assumed that black regiments would rarely, if ever, be used in combat. As a result, black soldiers endured a disproportionate share of labor duty. Also the assumption that black soldiers were workers, not fighters, led to inequities in pay. It was initially indicated that black soldiers would be paid $13 per month, which was the wage that white soldiers received. But in the Militia Act of 1862, Congress set the pay for black soldiers at $10 per month, $3 of which could be in clothing, which was the rate for military laborers. Black soldiers were also often denied recruitment bounties routinely offered to white soldiers, and were rarely eligible to collect aid for dependents, a benefit that state legislation often made available to white men serving in the ranks. == Major supporters == After the Emancipation Proclamation was announced, black recruitment was pursued in earnest. Volunteers from South Carolina, Tennessee, and Massachusetts filled the first authorized black regiments. However recruitment was slow until the support of prominent figures of African American cultures such as Frederick Douglass and Martin Delany. Martin Delany was commissioned as a major, the first African-American field officer in the United States Army during the American Civil War and was active in recruiting blacks for the United States Colored Troops. Frederick Douglass, on the other hand, encouraged black men to become soldiers to ensure eventual full citizenship. Volunteers began to respond, and in May 1863 the Government established the Bureau of Colored Troops to manage the burgeoning numbers of black soldiers. == Notes == Category:Union Army Category:African Americans in the American Civil War Category:Washington, D.C., in the American Civil War Category:19th-century history of the United States Army Category:1863 establishments in Washington, D.C.

Sergels torg, the largest square in the centre of Stockholm and near where his workshop stood, is named after him. ==Life== Sergel's bust of queen Sophia Magdalena of Denmark, 1783 Johan Tobias Sergel was born in Stockholm in 1740. He was the son of the decorator, Christoffer Sergel and Elisabet (née Swyrner), and was the brother of the decorator, Anna Brita Sergel. His first teacher was Pierre Hubert Larchevêsque.New International Encyclopedia, 1905 After studying in Paris, he went to Rome.Chisholm, 1911 He stayed in Rome for twelve years and sculpted a number of groups in marble. Besides subjects from classical mythology such as the Diomedes Stealing the Palladium, which he sold to the British collector, Thomas Mansel Talbot, in 1772, he also sculpted a colossal representation of The Muse of History Recording the Deeds of Gustavus Adolphus, in which are depicted the achievements of King Gustav II Adolf before the Chancellor, Axel Oxenstierna. It was in Rome also that he modelled the statue of King Gustav III, subsequently cast in bronze and purchased by the city of Stockholm in 1796. While primarily a sculptor, Sergel (inspired by English artists like Thomas Rowlandson) also drew sequential picture stories, an early form of comic strip. Portrait of the songwriter and performer Carl Michael Bellman, 1792 Summoned by Gustav III, Sergel returned to Stockholm in 1779 and continued to work there. Among the monuments he created at this time are a tomb for Gustav Vasa, a monument to Descartes, and a large relief in the church of St. Clarens, representing the Resurrection. He was an important part of the artistic elite in Stockholm, drawing a portrait of Sweden's bard Carl Michael Bellman among others. He had a relationship with the celebrated actress Fredrique Löwen and was possibly the father of one of her children. He died in his native city on 26 February 1814. ==Works== Among his works in the Nationalmuseum in Blasieholmen, central Stockholm are his monumental sculptures \\"Diomedes Stealing the Palladium\\", \\"The Muse of History Recording the Deeds of Gustavus Adolphus\\", and a \\"Bust of Gustavus III\\".

Barron (July 2, 1855, in Boston, Massachusetts – October 2, 1928) is one of the most influential figures in the history of Dow Jones & Company. As a career newsman described as a \\"short, rotund powerhouse\\",Robert McG. Thomas, Jr., \\"Mary Bancroft Dead at 93; U.S. Spy in World War II\\", The New York Times, January 19, 1997. (The subject of this Times obituary was Barron's step-granddaughter.) he died holding the posts of president of Dow Jones and de facto manager of The Wall Street Journal. He is considered the founder of modern financial journalism. == Early life == Barron graduated from Boston English high school in 1873. ==Career== Barron worked at a number of newspapers throughout his life, including the Boston Daily News and the Boston Evening Transcript, the latter from 1875 to 1887. He founded the Boston News Bureau in 1887 and the Philadelphia News Bureau in 1897, supplying financial news to brokers. In March 1903, Barron purchased Dow Jones & Company for $130,000, following the death of co-founder Charles Dow. In 1912, he appointed himself president, a title he held until his death and one which allowed him control of The Wall Street Journal, while the Woodworths published the paper. He expanded the reach of his publishing empire by merging his two news bureaus into Dow Jones. By 1920, he had expanded the daily circulation of The Wall Street Journal from 7,000 to 18,750, and over 50,000 by 1930. He also worked hard to modernize operations by introducing modern printing presses and expanding the reporting corps. Barron also established the financial advertising agency Doremus & Co. in 1903.Sold to BBDO in 1974, Doremus became a unit of Omnicom in 1986. \\"Doremus & Co.\\", Advertising Age Encyclopedia, September 15, 2003. In 1921, he founded the Dow Jones financial journal, Barron's National Financial Weekly, later renamed Barron's Magazine, and served as its first editor. He priced the magazine at 10 cents an issue and saw circulation explode to 30,000 by 1926, with high popularity among investors and financiers. ==Personal life== Barron married Jessie M. Waldron in 1900 and adopted her daughters, Jane and Martha. Mrs. Barron died in 1918. After Jane married Hugh Bancroft in 1907, Barron became a prominent member of the Boston Brahmin Bancroft family. Martha Barron married H. Wendell Endicott, heir apparent to the Endicott Shoe Company. Mr. & Mrs. Barron and the Endicotts are buried in a joint family plot at the historic Forest Hills Cemetery in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston. == Legacy == After his death, Barron's responsibilities were split between his son-in-law Hugh Bancroft, who became president of Dow Jones, and his friend Kenneth C. Hogate, who became the managing editor of the Journal. They Told Barron (1930) and More They Told Barron (1931), two books edited by Arthur Pound and S. T. Moore were published that showed his close connections and his role as a confidant to top financiers from New York City society, such as Charles M. Schwab. As a result, he has been called \\"the diarist of the American Dream.\\" (Reutter 148) This has led to allegations that he was too close to those he covered. However, Barron was renowned for pushing for deep scrutiny of corporate financial records, and is thus considered the founder of modern financial journalism. Barron's personal credo, which he supposedly urged the Journal to print and follow, was \\"The Wall Street Journal must stand for what is best in Wall Street.\\" For example, in 1913, he gave testimony to the Massachusetts Public Service Commission regarding a slush fund held by the New Haven Railroad. In 1920 he investigated Charles Ponzi, inventor of the Ponzi scheme, for The Boston Post. His aggressive questioning and common-sense reasoning helped lead to Ponzi's arrest and conviction.The Confidence Artists at www.vectorsite.net The Bancroft family remained the majority shareholder of Dow Jones until July 31, 2007 when Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. won the support of 32 percent of the Dow Jones voting shares controlled by the Bancroft family, enough to ensure a comfortable margin of victory. == Trivia == *He helped endow the Clarke School for the Deaf with two million dollars, and proposed naming it the Coolidge Trust after President Calvin Coolidge and his wife Grace.

It is generally recommended for use with other antiretrovirals. It may be used for prevention of HIV/AIDS among those at high risk before exposure, and after a needlestick injury or other potential exposure. It is sold both by itself and together as emtricitabine/tenofovir and efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir. It does not cure HIV/AIDS or hepatitis B. It is available by mouth as a tablet or powder. Common side effects include nausea, rash, diarrhea, headache, pain, depression, and weakness. Severe side effects include high blood lactate and an enlarged liver. There are no absolute contraindications. It is often recommended during pregnancy and appears to be safe. It is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor and works by decreasing the ability of the viruses to replicate. Tenofovir was patented in 1996 and approved for use in the United States in 2001. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication as of 2017. ==Medical uses== Tenofovir disoproxil is used for HIV-1 infection and chronic hepatitis B treatment. For HIV-1 infection, tenofovir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for people 2 years of age and older. For chronic hepatitis B patients, tenofovir is indicated for patients 12 years of age and older.Gilead Sciences, Inc. Prescribing Information. Revised: November 2012. ===HIV risk reduction=== Tenofovir can be used for HIV prevention in people who are at high risk for infection through sexual transmission or injecting drug use. A Cochrane review examined the use of tenofovir for prevention of HIV before exposure and found that both tenofovir alone and the tenofovir/emtricitabine combination decreased the risk of contracting HIV for high risk patients. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also conducted a study in partnership with the Thailand Ministry of Public Health to ascertain the effectiveness of providing people who inject drugs illicitly with daily doses of tenofovir as a prevention measure. The results revealed a 48.9% reduced incidence of the virus among the group of subjects who received the drug in comparison to the control group who received a placebo. ==Adverse effects== Tenofovir disoproxil is generally well tolerated with low discontinuation rates among the HIV and chronic hepatitis B population. There are no contraindications for use of this drug. The most commonly reported side effects due to use of tenofovir disoproxil were dizziness, nausea, and diarrhea. Other adverse effects include depression, sleep disturbances, headache, itching, rash, and fever. The US box warning cautions potential onset of lactic acidosis or liver damage due to use of tenofovir disoproxil. Long term use of tenofovir disoproxil is associated with nephrotoxicity and bone loss. Presentation of nephrotoxicity can appear as Fanconi syndrome, acute kidney injury, or decline of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Discontinuation of tenofovir disoproxil can potentially lead to reversal of renal impairment. Nephrotoxicity may be due to proximal tubules accumulation of Tenofovir disoproxil leading to elevated serum concentrations. == Interactions == Tenofovir interacts with didanosine and HIV-1 protease inhibitors. Tenofovir increases didanosine concentrations and can result in adverse effects such as pancreatitis and neuropathy. Tenofovir also interacts with HIV-1 protease inhibitors such as atazanavir, by decreasing atazanavir concentrations while increasing tenofovir concentrations. In addition, since tenofovir is excreted by the kidney, medications that impair renal function can also cause problems. ==Pharmacology== ===Mechanism of action=== Tenofovir disoproxil is a nucleotide analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI). It selectively inhibits viral reverse transcriptase, a crucial enzyme in retroviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), while showing limited inhibition of human enzymes, such as DNA polymerases α, β, and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ.Drugbank: Tenofovir In vivo tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is converted to tenofovir, an acyclic analog of deoxyadenosine 5'-monophosphate (d-AMP). Tenofovir lacks a hydroxyl group in the position corresponding to the 3' carbon of the d-AMP, preventing the formation of the 5′ to 3′ phosphodiester linkage essential for DNA chain elongation. Once incorporated into a growing DNA strand, tenofovir causes premature termination of DNA transcription, preventing viral replication. ===Pharmacokinetics=== Tenofovir disoproxil is a prodrug that is quickly absorbed from the gut and cleaved to release tenofovir. Inside cells, tenofovir is phosphorylated to tenofovir diphosphate (which is analogous to a triphosphate, as tenofovir itself already has one phosphonate residue), the active compound that inhibits reverse transcriptase via chain termination. In fasting persons, bioavailability is 25%, and highest blood plasma concentrations are reached after one hour. When taken with fatty food, highest plasma concentrations are reached after two hours, and the area under the curve is increased by 40%. It is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 1A2. Tenofovir is mainly excreted via the kidneys, both by glomerular filtration and by tubular secretion using the transport proteins OAT1, OAT3 and ABCC4. ==History== Tenofovir was initially synthesized by Antonín Holý at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic in Prague. The patent filed by Holý in 1984 makes no mention of the potential use of the compound for the treatment of HIV infection, which had only been discovered one year earlier. In 1985, De Clercq and Holý described the activity of PMPA against HIV in cell culture. Shortly thereafter, a collaboration with the biotechnology company Gilead Sciences led to the investigation of PMPA's potential as a treatment for HIV infected patients. In 1997 researchers from Gilead and the University of California, San Francisco demonstrated that tenofovir exhibits anti-HIV effects in humans when dosed by subcutaneous injection. The initial form of tenofovir used in these studies had limited potential for widespread use because it poorly penetrated cells and was not absorbed when given by mouth. Gilead developed a pro-drug version of tenofovir, tenofovir disoproxil. This version of tenofovir is often referred to simply as \\"tenofovir\\". In this version of the drug, the two negative charges of the tenofovir phosphonic acid group are masked, thus enhancing oral absorption. Tenofovir disoproxil was approved in the U.S. in 2001, for the treatment of HIV, and in 2008, for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B.FDA letter of approval (regarding treatment of hepatitis B) FDA Clears Viread for Hepatitis B ==Drug forms== Tenofovir disoproxil can be taken by mouth and is sold under the brand name Viread, among others. Tenofovir disoproxil is a pro-drug form of tenofovir phosphonate, which is liberated intracellularly and converted to tenofovir disphophate. It is marketed by Gilead Sciences (as the fumarate, abbreviated TDF). Tenofovir disoproxil is also available in pills which combine a number of antiviral drugs into a single dose. Well-known combinations include Atripla (tenofovir disoproxil/emtricitabine/efavirenz), Complera (tenofovir disoproxil/emtricitabine/rilpivirine), Stribild (tenofovir disoproxil/emtricitabine/elvitegravir/cobicistat), and Truvada (tenofovir disoproxil/emtricitabine). Gilead has created a second pro-drug form of the active drug, tenofovir diphosphate, called tenofovir alafenamide. It differs from tenofovir disoproxil due to its activation in the lymphoid cells. This allows the active metabolites to accumulate in those cells, leading to lower systemic exposure and potential toxicities. ==Chemistry== Tenofovir has a melting point of . Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is a white to off-white crystalline powder that is soluble in methanol, slightly soluble in water (13.4 mg/ml), and very slightly soluble in dichloromethane. ===Detection in body fluids=== Tenofovir may be measured in plasma by liquid chromatography. Such testing is useful for monitoring therapy and to prevent drug accumulation and toxicity in people with kidney or liver problems.R.

Richd. Grenville Temple, Earl Temple, Viscount and Baron Cobham, Lord Privy-Seal A younger son of George Nugent-Temple, 1st Marquess of Buckingham, by Lady Mary Elizabeth Nugent, only daughter and heiress of Robert Nugent, 1st Earl Nugent, he was born on 31 December 1788. His mother was created a baroness of the kingdom of Ireland in 1800, with remainder to her second son; and on her death (16 March 1813) he consequently succeeded to the peerage. Nugent was educated at Brasenose College, Oxford, and in 1810 received the honorary degree of D.C.L. from the university. He was Whig Member of Parliament for Buckingham, 1810-1812\\\\. This was a rotten borough controlled by the Grenvilles. At the general election of 1812 Nugent was returned to Parliament for the borough of Aylesbury; but in 1818 he was in some danger of losing his seat in consequence of his brother Richard, then by courtesy the Marquess of Buckingham, having joined the ministry. Nugent stood in his own interest, however, and was returned. He fought another successful contest in 1831, and remained one of the members for Aylesbury until the dissolution in 1832. In November 1830 Nugent was made one of the Lords of the Treasury, but he resigned this position in August 1832, to become Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands. This office he retained for three years, returning to England with the Grand Cross of St. Michael and St. George. He again offered himself for Aylesbury in 1837 and 1839, but was defeated on both occasions; and in 1843, when he stood, with the reformer George Thompson, for Southampton, he sustained a third defeat. On reappearing at Aylesbury in 1847 he was returned. Nugent was an extreme Whig, or a whig-radical, in politics. He was a strong supporter of Queen Caroline of Brunswick, and he visited Spain as a partisan of the Spanish Liberals against the Carlists. In the session of 1848 Nugent moved for leave to bring in a bill abolishing the separate imprisonment in gaols of persons committed for trial, but the motion was lost. During the same session he advocated the abolition of capital punishment. In 1849 he voted for limiting the powers of the Habeas Corpus (Ireland) Suspension Bill, and also supported a measure for the further repeal of Penal Laws. He was a member of the Reform Club and the Athenaeum Club. Nugent died on 26 November 1850, at his residence in Buckinghamshire. ==Works== In 1812 Nugent published Portugal, a Poem then in 1829 Oxford and Locke, which defended the expulsion of Locke from the University of Oxford against the censures of Dugald Stewart. Nugent's sympathetic Memorials of John Hampden appeared in 1832. The work was favourably reviewed by Thomas Babington Macaulay in the Edinburgh Review, and adversely by Robert Southey in the Quarterly Review, resulting in a flurry of correspondence. Legends of the Library at Lillies (his family seat) appeared in 1832: \\"from the fireside of the... little oak library the following legends proceed.\\"XIX Century Fiction, Part I, A–K (Jarndyce, Bloomsbury, 2019). It was followed by the two-volume travelogue Lands Classical and Sacred in 18456. Nugent also wrote pamphlets on political, social, and ecclesiastical subjects. ==Family== Nugent married, 6 September 1813, Anne Lucy, second daughter of Major-general the Hon. Vere Poulett. She died without issue in 1848, and the barony became extinct on the death of Nugent. ==References== ;Attribution == External links == * Category:1788 births Category:1850 deaths Category:19th-century Irish people Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies Nugent, George Nugent-Grenville, 2nd Baron Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George Nugent, George Nugent- Grenville, 2nd Baron Category:UK MPs 1807–1812 Category:UK MPs 1812–1818 Category:UK MPs 1818–1820 Category:UK MPs 1820–1826 Category:UK MPs 1826–1830 Category:UK MPs 1830–1831 Category:UK MPs 1831–1832 Category:UK MPs 1847–1852 Category:UK MPs who inherited peerages George Category:Alumni of Brasenose College, Oxford ","title":"George Nugent-Grenville, 2nd Baron Nugent"},{"id":"1277707","text":"Thomas Burnett Swann (October 12, 1928 - May 5, 1976) was an American poet, critic and fantasy author. His criticism includes works on the poetry of H.D. and Christina Rossetti. ==Poetry== Swann's poetry consists largely of short, whimsical pieces evoking a naive innocence. Many of them were later incorporated into his novels and placed in the mouths of his characters - sometimes the same poem is spoken by two or three different characters in novels set centuries and continents apart. Poets also frequently appear as characters in his novels, always on the side of good: Sappho in Wolfwinter (1972); Robert Herrick in Will-o-the-Wisp (1977, serialized 1974); a fictionalized Charles Sorley in The Goat Without Horns (1971); and Thomas Chatterton in The Not-World (1975). ==Fiction== Swann began writing fiction in 1958 with \\"Winged Victory\\", a science fiction story based on the famous headless statue known as the Winged Victory of Samothrace. In Swann's story the statue's head is discovered and found to have been modeled upon an alien visitor whom the sculptor took for a goddess. Extraterrestrials also feature in \\"The Painter\\", in which the painter Hieronymous Bosch is abducted by hideous aliens and forced to paint them, thereby providing the inspiration for the grotesque images in his painting The Garden of Earthly Delights. This and many other early stories appeared in the British magazine Science Fantasy. Some stories also appeared in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction (F&SF;). Most of Swann's fiction was outright fantasy. The early story \\"The Dryad-tree\\" is set in contemporary Florida and features a woman's reaction to the knowledge that her new husband's garden contains a tree possessed by a jealous dryad. The story was adapted as a short film in 2017. The bulk of Swann's fantasy fits into a rough chronology that begins in ancient Egypt around 2500 BC and chronicles the steady decline of magic and mythological races such as dryads, centaurs, satyrs, selkies and minotaurs. The coming of more \\"advanced\\" civilisations constantly threatens to destroy their pre- industrial world, and they must continually seek refuge wherever they can. They see the advent of Christianity as a major tragedy; the Christians regard magic and mythological beings as evil and seek to destroy the surviving creatures, although some manage to survive and preserve some of their old ways through medieval times down to the late 19th Century and perhaps even the 20th. An undercurrent of sexuality runs through all of these stories. Many of Swann's characters are sexually adventurous and regard sexual repression as spiritually damaging. Casual and sometimes permanent nudity is common. Homosexual relationships between both male and female characters are often hinted at, although seldom made explicit. The most openly homosexual relationship in Swann's stories is also the most controversial. His novel How Are the Mighty Fallen (1974) depicts the Biblical Jonathan and David as lovers, and furthermore suggests that Jonathan was himself a member of an ancient winged half-human race. The book appeared from Swann's regular publisher DAW Books, but only after DAW's founder and chief executive Donald A. Wollheim fought to prevent distributor New American Library from banning it. However, Swann was reportedly unhappy with George Barr's cover artwork, which showed two of the characters being chased by a cyclops, because he felt it misrepresented the style of the novel. Swann died of cancer in 1976. Several of his novels were published posthumously. ==Works (excluding non- fiction and poetry)== ===The Minotaur Trilogy=== (Written in reverse order. Swann claimed that he would correct the inconsistencies between the two earlier books if there was a second edition, but in the event there was not.) *Cry Silver Bells (1977) *The Forest of Forever (1971) *The Day of the Minotaur (1966; previously serialized in 1964-1965 as The Blue Monkeys in Science Fantasy) The three novels were collected as The Minotaur Trilogy (1997) ===The Latium Trilogy=== (Not Swann's title; also written largely in reverse) *Queens Walk in the Dusk (1977) **Formerly Swann's rarest novel, only published in a limited edition of 2000 copies.

Many hydrous pyrolysis processes use superheated water in the liquid phase, whereas steam cracking uses water in the gas phase. Steam cracking is used in the petroleum industry to produce the lighter alkenes and in many cases also substantial atmospheric carbon dioxide. Hydrous pyrolysis may be a significant process in the creation of fossil fuels.Pennisi, Elizabeth, Surreptitiously converting dead matter into oil and coal - Water, Water Everywhere, Science News, February 20, 1993. Simple heating without water, anhydrous pyrolysis has long been considered to take place naturally during the catagenesis of kerogens to fossil fuels. In recent decades it has been found that water under pressure causes more efficient breakdown of kerogens at lower temperatures than without it. The carbon isotope ratio of natural gas also suggests that hydrogen from water has been added during creation of the gas.

She stated, \\"I had to see that civilian workers did not mix with the prisoners, and later on, I was detailed to working parties outside camp.\\" In October 1942, she was moved as an Aufseherin to the Majdanek camp near Lublin. She claimed that she was moved as a punishment for being too nice to the prisoners by not giving them harsh enough punishments and helping to feed them. However, according to the Belsen Trial, she had received a bonus as well as better working conditions at this camp. By mid-1944, she was transferred to Krakau. SS officers there noticed she was too lenient, polite and helpful to the prisoners, so the SS returned her to Ravensbrück to undergo another training course, this time by Dorothea Binz. During this time, Ehlert divorced her husband.

Once, Ehlert even ordered the women who were at work to undress completely. After they had stripped, Ehlert searched each one extremely thoroughly, looking, no doubt, for rings, money, wrist watches, and other valuables.

The waltz was first performed at a parish festival ball at Unger's Casino in the suburb of Hernals, Vienna on 28 August of the same year. The work, which first suggests the whirring of the wings of a moth in the Introduction and then its circling flight, failed to gain the recognition many now feel it deserves when first performed in 1854. The Danube monarchy has formed an alliance with France and Great Britain during the Crimean War and the action has incurred the wrath of the Russian Tsar. Vienna at that time was also recovering from a devastating cholera outbreak that autumn and many entertainment establishments were finding it difficult to attract patronage to their dance halls and Strauss' works during that time do not reach a wider public attention. Strauss' work eventually enticed Liszt, who was made aware of the work's charms. The latter was observed at a festive occasion to earnestly entreating his daughter Cosima Wagner to play 'Nachtfalter' with his as a piano duet. Further, performances abroad such as in Pavlovsk and the later in Paris, confirmed the work as one of Strauss' earlier inspired creations. ==References== Category:Waltzes by Johann Strauss II Category:1854 compositions ","title":"Nachtfalter"},{"id":"1277734","text":"The Record is the only daily (Monday–Friday) English language newspaper based in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada. It serves the Eastern Townships region of that province. Launched on February 9, 1897, by businessman Leonard Channell and originally known as the Sherbrooke Daily Record, it is one of the two last surviving English-language daily newspapers in the French-speaking province, the other being the much larger Montreal Gazette. For the past several years, The Record has been a daily community newspaper for the anglophone minority in the Eastern Townships, without comprehensive coverage of national and world news. \\"Talk\\", or \\"Talk of the Townships\\", a weekly television, arts and cultural insert, appears every Friday. Periodic sections focus on individual communities and events within the Record's service area. Future Canadian media barons John Bassett and Conrad Black both got their starts in newspaper ownership as owner and co-owner, respectively, of the Sherbrooke Daily Record. For years The Record was owned by Black's Hollinger International. In January 2006 it was purchased by Alta Newspaper Group, a partnership of Glacier Ventures International and former Hollinger executive David Radler. ==Fire== In January 1999, a fire broke out in The Records offices, which were located on rue Delorme in Sherbrooke. The building and its contents, including the newspapers computers and presses, suffered heavy losses. The newspaper was temporarily moved to a location in nearby Lennoxville without its own press.

Sydney Smith, Canon of St Paul's. His mother was Carolina Maria Vernon, daughter of Richard Vernon. Vernon was educated at Christ Church, Oxford (2nd class classics 1822). ==Political career== He was elected Member of Parliament for Tralee in 1829, a seat he held until 1831, and then sat for Northampton from 1831 to 1859. When the Whigs came to power in 1830 under Lord Grey, Vernon was appointed a Lord of the Treasury (government whip), which he remained also when Lord Melbourne became Prime Minister in July 1834. The Whigs fell from office in November of that year, but returned already in April 1835, when Vernon was appointed Secretary of the Board of Control by Melbourne, which he remained until 1839. He then served as Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1839 to 1841. The latter year he was also admitted to the Privy Council. He did not hold office again until February 1852, when he was made Secretary at War in the first administration of Lord John Russell. However, the government fell already the same month. When the Liberals (as the Whigs were now known) returned to office in 1855 under Lord Palmerston, Vernon was appointed President of the Board of Control, with a seat in the cabinet, a post he retained until the government fell in March 1858. The Indian Mutiny took place during his tenure. The following year he was raised to the peerage as Baron Lyveden, of Lyveden in the County of Northampton., and in 1879 he was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB). In 1845 he was appointed one of the Lay Commissioners in Lunacy. ==Family== Greville Richard Vernon, son of Lord Lyveden. Lord Lyveden married Lady Emma Mary Fitzpatrick, daughter and co-heir of the Earl of Upper Ossory, in 1823. In 1846 he assumed for his children by Royal licence the surname of Vernon in lieu of Smith and in 1859 he assumed for himself by Royal licence the same surname in lieu of Smith. Lord Lyveden died in November 1873, aged 73, and was succeeded in the barony by his son Fitzpatrick. Lord Lyveden was a member of the Reform Club, the Travellers Club, and Brooks's.

His first movie, Hello Smile! (originally Bonjour Sourire) was released in 1956. He earned international attention with The Things of Life (Les choses de la vie, 1970), which he wrote and directed, like the rest of his later films. Featuring Michel Piccoli in the male lead, it was shown in competition at the 1970 Cannes Festival. The film also revived the career of Romy Schneider; she acted in several of Sautet's later films. In his next film Max and the Junkmen (Max et les Ferrailleurs, 1971) Schneider played a prostitute, while in César and Rosalie (César et Rosalie, 1972) she portrayed a married woman who copes with the reappearance of an old flame. Vincent, François, Paul and the Others (Vincent, Paul, François, et les Autres, 1974) is one of Sautet's most acclaimed films. Four middle-class men meet in the country every weekend mainly to discuss their lives. As well as Piccoli, it featured Yves Montand, Gérard Depardieu, and Stéphane Audran. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian in a 2020 tribute article to Michel Piccoli thought it was \\"arguably the best\\" of the \\"five very well-regarded movies\\" on which the actor and director collaborated. Sautet achieved even further critical success with Mado (1976). His film A Simple Story (Une Histoire simple, 1978) was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The film featured Schneider again, this time as a dissatisfied working woman in her 40s. She won the César Award for Best Actress for her performance. In the 1980s, he made only two films Waiter! (Garçon!, 1983), a drama starring Yves Montand as a middle-aged waiter, and the comedy A Few Days with Me (Quelques Jours Avec Moi, 1988). Claude Sautet won the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival and the César Award for Best Director for A Heart in Winter (Un cœur en hiver, 1992) and received the César once more for Nelly and Mr. Arnaud (Nelly et Monsieur Arnaud, 1995).

Ron Hubbard in 1950 R2-45 is the name given by L. Ron Hubbard to what he described as \\"an enormously effective process for exteriorization but its use is frowned upon by this society at this time\\". In Scientology doctrine, exteriorization refers to the separation of the thetan (soul) from the body, a phenomenon which Hubbard asserts can be achieved through Scientology auditing. R2-45 is said to be a process by which exteriorization could be produced by shooting a person in the head with a .45 pistol. This literal meaning is acknowledged by the Church of Scientology, although they deny that it is meant seriously. ==Origins of R2-45== In the book The Creation of Human Ability, Hubbard describes two training \\"Routes\\", with the exercises in Route 1 numbered R1-4 to R1-15, and the exercises in Route 2 numbered R2-16 to R2-75. R2-45 is simply described as \\"an enormously effective process for exteriorization but its use is frowned upon by this society at this time\\". Several conflicting accounts exist of where and when R2-45 originated and how it was presented by Hubbard. According to Stewart Lamont, in one of a series of lectures called the Philadelphia Doctorate Course, held from December 1 to 19, 1952, Hubbard demonstrated R2-45 by firing a Colt 45 into the floor of the podium. George Malko gives a slightly different account in his 1970 book Scientology: The Now Religion, writing that \\"Hubbard is said to have marched out onto center stage at one of the Scientology congresses in Washington, D.C., in the late fifties, pulled out a .45 loaded with blanks, fired it into the audience, and announced to the stunned assemblage, 'I just thought you'd like to see what R2-.45 looks like!'\\" A 2007 promotional film produced by the Church of Scientology features a claimed eyewitness account of Hubbard's introduction of R2-45. According to an unnamed veteran Scientologist who appeared in the film, R2-45 first appeared in a 1954 lecture given by Hubbard in Phoenix, Arizona, in which he described a series of auditing processes in numerical order: Decades later, Hubbard's estranged son Ronald DeWolf said that he had been present at a meeting where his father fired a pistol into the floor to illustrate R2-45. DeWolf commented, \\"I thought he was kidding and that it was a blank, but it wasn't; there was a hole in the floor. It was for real; he meant it.\\" ==R2-45 in Hubbard's lectures== Hubbard mentioned R2-45 in several more lectures given to Scientologists in the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1956 lecture \\"Exteriorization\\", Hubbard referred in passing to R2-45; a footnote in the transcript refers to the process as being \\"used humorously\\". In a lecture of 1958, Hubbard commented that \\"Death is not the same as clearing but there is, remember, R2-45. It's a very valid technique. A lot of people have used it before now.\\" He said in a 1959 lecture that \\"even cops or gangsters\\" could make a \\"Clear\\" out of a person \\"by taking a Webley 38 or Smith & Wesson, or Colt or something like that and doing R2-45.\\" An extract from this lecture was published on the Internet in 2009 by WikiLeaks. In a 1961 lecture, he said: \\"If that fails you, well, you've always got suicide. You could propose that to the pc [preclear]. That would solve his problems. 'R2-45' by its various – various other techniques.\\" He called it a \\"big process\\" that would \\"take a pc's head off\\" in another lecture a few months later, to which the transcript records that the audience responded with laughter. ==R2-45 in practice== Some critics of Scientology and ex-Scientologists have alleged that R2-45 was invoked by Hubbard to authorize the killing of individuals regarded as antagonistic to the Church of Scientology. There is no evidence that it has ever been put into practice and Hubbard did not explicitly define the meaning of R2-45 in writing. See official online archive. Representatives of the Church of Scientology have said that Hubbard's description of R2-45 \\"was coined as a joke — [it] is not authorized, and I am afraid [it] occasionally 'misfires' as a joke when taken literally\\". On two separate occasions orders to use R2-45 on specific individuals were published in a prominent Scientology magazine. On March 6, 1968, Hubbard issued an internal memo titled \\"Racket Exposed\\", in which he denounced twelve people as \\"Enemies of mankind, the planet and all life\\", and ordered that \\"Any Sea Org member contacting any of them is to use Auditing Process R2-45.\\" The memo was subsequently reproduced, with another name added, in the Church of Scientology's internal journal, The Auditor.The Auditor, issue #35. (Undated but copyrighted 1968) Another four people were named in a second R2-45 order published in The Auditor later in 1968.The Auditor, issue #37. (Undated but copyrighted 1968) Stephen A. Kent of the University of Alberta characterises such orders as demonstrations of \\"the manifestation of Hubbard's malignant narcissism and, more specifically, his narcissistic rage.\\" The Santa Rosa News-Herald reported in 1982 that \\"attorneys have uncovered evidence to suggest that between 1975 and 1977, during the FBI's investigation of the cult, meetings of Scientology executives were held in which there were discussions relative to 'auditing' high-level FBI members with auditing process R2-45.\\" ==See also== *Fair Game (Scientology) *Suppressive Person *Scientology controversies ==References== Category:Scientology beliefs and practices Category:Scientology-related controversies ","title":"R2-45"},{"id":"1277769","text":"Pacific University is a private university in Forest Grove, Oregon. Founded in 1849 as the Tualatin Academy, the university's original Forest Grove campus is west of Portland. The university maintains three other campuses in the cities of Eugene, Hillsboro, and Woodburn, and has an enrollment of more than 4,000 students. ==History== Marsh Hall Tabitha Moffatt Brown, a pioneer emigrant from Massachusetts, immigrated to the Oregon Country over the new Applegate Trail in 1846. After arriving in Oregon she helped to start an orphanage and school along with Rev. Harvey L. Clark in Forest Grove in 1847 to care for the orphans of Applegate Trail party.Horner, John B. Oregon: Her History, Her Great Men, Her Literature. Corvallis, OR: Gazette-Times, 1919; pp. 159-160.Carey, Charles Henry. (1922). History of Oregon. Pioneer Historical Publishing Co. p. 340, 350, 507, 724. In March 1848, Tualatin Academy was established from the orphanage with Clark donating to the school. George H. Atkinson had advocated the founding of the school and with support of the Presbyterians and Congregationalists helped to start the academy. Eliza Hart Spalding, part of the Whitman Mission, was its first teacher. Although the university has long been independent of their founding affiliation with the United Church of Christ (UCC), it still maintains a close working relationship with the church as a member of the United Church of Christ Council for Higher Education. The academy was officially chartered by the territorial legislature on September 29, 1849. The reverend Clark served as the first president of the board of trustees and later donated an additional to the institution. In 1851, what is now Old College Hall was built and in 1853 Sidney H. Marsh became the school's first president. The current campus was deeded in 1851.Deed, April 3, 1851, Washington Country, Oregon In 1854, the institution became Pacific University. The first commencement occurred in 1863 with Harvey W. Scott as the only graduate. In 1872, three Japanese students started at the university as part of that country's modernization movement, with all three graduating in 1876. These students were Hatstara Tamura, Kin Saito, and Yei Nosea. President Marsh died in 1879 and was replaced by John R. Herrick. Marsh Hall was built in 1895 and named for Pacific's first president, serving as the central building on Pacific's campus. Carnegie Library (now Carnegie Hall) opened in 1912 after Andrew Carnegie's foundation helped finance the brick structure. The library was designed by Portland architecture firm Whidden and Lewis. In 1915, the preparatory department, Tualatin Academy, closed due to the proliferation of public high schools in the state. By 1920, the school had grown to a total of five buildings on and had an endowment of approximately $250,000. Marsh Hall was gutted by fire in 1975, but its shell was preserved, and the structure reopened in 1977. Dr. Phillip D. Creighton became Pacific's sixteenth president in August 2003 and retired in June 2009.Christensen, Nick. “Search on for new Pacific University president : Creighton led university's growth, within Forest Grove and east to Hillsboro”, The Hillsboro Argus, September 22, 2008.

Walker, who was a missionary to China, and by his mother. Qilin (pronounced chee-lin or ki-rin) is a mythical Chinese creature with a lion-like stance, a unicorn-like horn, and deer or ox hooves from the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). During this period, qilin were often represented with a dragon head, fish scales, ox hooves and a lion's tail. Said to be a good omen of wisdom and prosperity, the Pacific qilin was nicknamed Boxer by its Chinese and Japanese students as an embodiment of the community's cultural diversity. In the first half of the twentieth century, the original mascot was the center of informal \\"Boxer Toss\\" events, where different clubs and groups would scrimmage for the statue as a tradition of passing its care from one group to another. In 1968, Boxer became the official mascot of the university to replace Benny Badger. The following year, the statue disappeared entirely, and only small pieces of have returned over the years. In the 1980s, the statue was recast as Boxer II; after supposedly enjoying an epic road trip across America, it too disappeared in the mid-2000s. In 2006, the university commissioned a 12-foot tall sculpture to replace the missing Boxers, which now stands in a central park welcoming students to the residence halls. Shortly thereafter, parts of the original Boxer statue were returned to the university by an alumnus in 2012. In 2018, alumni funded the design and casting of Boxer III by artist Pat Costello, unveiled during Homecoming weekend. Kept in trust as part of the university's art collection, the statue and exhibits on its cultural and community history are on display in the Tran Library. ==Academics== Performing Arts Center Pacific is home to 5 colleges offering undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs. ===College of Arts & Sciences=== Organized into 3 schools—Arts & Humanities, Natural Sciences, Social Sciences—the college offers over sixty undergraduate degree options, including unique options in Asia-Pacific Studies, Communication Sciences & Disorders, Creative Writing, Editing and Publishing, Music Therapy, Outdoor Leadership, Nonprofit Leadership, Social Work, and a suite of sustainability-centered art and science programs.

This seascape waltz composition resulted from Strauss' visit to the North Frisian island of Föhr, when he and his second wife Angelika stayed in the town of Wyk during one of the holidays. The contrasting moods offered from living so close to the North Sea immediately galvanised Strauss' creative spirit which produced this mature work, capturing the sea storms as well as the strong gale all in 3/4 time. Strauss' audiences in Vienna first heard the work when his brother Eduard Strauss conducted it at one of his concerts in the Musikverein on 16 November 1879. The waltz's slow introduction suggests a calm sea scene, while swirling waves are captured in later themes. The coda incorporates the 'sea storm' scene, with furious chords and fierce brass instruments suggesting the North Sea at the time of a severe gale.

It is an important mode of climate variability for the Northern Hemisphere. The southern hemisphere analogue is called the Antarctic oscillation or Southern Annular Mode (SAM). The index varies over time with no particular periodicity, and is characterized by non-seasonal sea-level pressure anomalies of one sign in the Arctic, balanced by anomalies of opposite sign centered at about 37–45° N.Arctic Oscillation (AO) time series, 1899 – June 2002 The North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) is a close relative of the Arctic oscillation. There is debate over whether one or the other is more fundamentally representative of the atmosphere's dynamics. The NAO may be identified in a more physically meaningful way, which may carry more impact on measurable effects of changes in the atmosphere.Ambaum et al. \\"Arctic Oscillation or North Atlantic Oscillation?\\" == Description == The loading pattern of the Arctic Oscillation The Arctic oscillation appears as a ringlike (or \\"annular\\") pattern of sea- level pressure anomalies centered at the poles. The presence of continents and large landmasses disrupts the ringlike structure at the Arctic pole, while anomalies surrounding the Antarctic pole are nearly circular. The Arctic oscillation is believed by climatologists to be causally related to (and thus partially predictive of) global weather patterns. NASA climatologist James E. Hansen explained the mechanism by which the Arctic oscillation affects weather at points so distant from the Arctic, as follows: The Arctic oscillation index is defined using the daily or monthly 1000 hPa geopotential height anomalies from latitudes 20° N to 90° N. The anomalies are projected onto the Arctic oscillation loading pattern, which is defined as the first empirical orthogonal function (EOF) of monthly mean 1000 hPa geopotential height during the 1979-2000 period. The time series is then normalized with the monthly mean index's standard deviation. Arctic Oscillation time series for the extended, December to March (DJFM), winter season 1899–2011. == Periodicity == Over most of the past century, the Arctic oscillation alternated between positive and negative phases. Data using a 60-day running mean has implied the oscillation has been trending to more of a positive phase since the 1970s, though it has trended to a more neutral state in the last decade. The oscillation still fluctuates stochastically between negative and positive values on daily, monthly, seasonal and annual time scales, although meteorologists have attained high levels of predictive accuracy for shorter term forecasts. The correlation between actual observations and the 7-day mean Global Forecast System ensemble AO forecasts is approximately 0.9. This zonally symmetric seesaw between sea level pressures in polar and temperate latitudes was first identified by Edward Lorenz and named in 1998 by David W.J. Thompson and John Michael Wallace. == Impacts == The National Snow and Ice Data Center describes the effects of the Arctic oscillation in some detail. In the positive phase, higher pressure at midlatitudes drives ocean storms farther north, and changes in the circulation pattern bring wetter weather to Alaska, Scotland and Scandinavia, as well as drier conditions to the western United States and the Mediterranean. In the positive phase, frigid winter air does not extend as far into the middle of North America as it would during the negative phase of the oscillation. This keeps much of the United States east of the Rocky Mountains warmer than normal, but leaves Greenland and Newfoundland colder than usual. Weather patterns in the negative phase are in general \\"opposite\\" to those of the positive phase. Climatologists are now routinely invoking the Arctic oscillation in their official public explanations for extremes of weather. The following statement from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Climatic Data Center: State of the Climate December 2010 which uses the phrase \\"negative Arctic Oscillation\\" four times, is very representative of this increasing tendency: :\\"Cold arctic air gripped western Europe in the first three weeks of December. Two major snowstorms, icy conditions, and frigid temperatures wreaked havoc across much of the region...The harsh winter weather was attributed to a negative Arctic Oscillation, which is a climate pattern that influences weather in the Northern Hemisphere. A very persistent, strong ridge of high pressure, or 'blocking system', near Greenland allowed cold Arctic air to slide south into Europe. Europe was not the only region in the Northern Hemisphere affected by the Arctic Oscillation. A large snow storm and frigid temperatures affected much of the Midwest United States on December 10–13....\\" == Events of 2010 == A further, quite graphic illustration of the effects of the negative phase of the oscillation occurred in February 2010. In that month, the Arctic oscillation reached its most negative monthly mean value at about −4.266, in the entire post-1950 era (the period of accurate record- keeping). That month was characterized by three separate historic snowstorms in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. The first storm precipitated on Baltimore, Maryland on February 5–6, and a second storm precipitated on February 9–10. In New York City, a separate storm deposited on February 25–26. Another snowstorm swept Catalonia as well as neighbouring French departments (Languedoc-Rousillon, Midi-Pyrenées) on March 8, depositing 60 cm of snow in Girona. This kind of snowstorm activity is considered to be highly anomalous, and as extreme as the negative Arctic oscillation value itself. These negative values of the AO during 2010 and following into the next winter allowed colder air to penetrate much further south than usual into sub-tropical South Florida which brought record breaking low temperatures and months registered in many locations and the coolest average monthly minimum temperatures for February, March and December that year in the tropical beach getaway of Cancún, up to over 4C below the climate period averages. The greatest negative value for the Arctic oscillation since 1950 in January was −3.767 in 1977, which coincided with the coldest mean January temperature in New York City, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and many other mid-Atlantic locations in that span of time, although the January Arctic oscillation has been negative only 60.6% of the time between 1950 and 2010, nine of the ten coldest Januarys in New York City since 1950 have coincided with negative Arctic oscillations.National Weather Service Climate Prediction Center and NWS Forecast Office, as of 2010 == See also == * Antarctic oscillation * Climate variability * John Michael Wallace * North Atlantic Current * Polar amplification * Polar vortex * Siberian high == References == == External links == * Overview of Arctic Climate Indices * Monthly Northern Hemisphere Annular Mode (NAM) Index or Arctic Oscillation (AO) Index 1850–2013 * Daily Northern Hemisphere Annular Mode (NAM) Index or Arctic Oscillation (AO) Index 1948–2013 * NOAA 3-month running mean AO Index 1950–2009 * Arctic roots of 'upside-down' weather BBC news, Tuesday, 5 January 2010 Category:Regional climate effects Category:Environment of the Arctic ","title":"Arctic oscillation"},{"id":"1277806","text":"Cidofovir, brand name Vistide, is an injectable antiviral medication primarily used as a treatment for cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis (an infection of the retina of the eye) in people with AIDS. Cidofovir was approved for medical use in 1996. ==Medical use== ===DNA virus=== Its only indication that has received regulatory approval worldwide is cytomegalovirus retinitis. Cidofovir has also shown efficacy in the treatment of aciclovir-resistant HSV infections. Cidofovir has also been investigated as a treatment for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy with successful case reports of its use. Despite this, the drug failed to demonstrate any efficacy in controlled studies. Cidofovir might have anti-smallpox efficacy and might be used on a limited basis in the event of a bioterror incident involving smallpox cases. Brincidofovir, a cidofovir derivative with much higher activity against smallpox that can be taken orally has been developed. It has inhibitory effects on varicella-zoster virus replication in vitro although no clinical trials have been done to date, likely due to the abundance of safer alternatives such as aciclovir. Cidofovir shows anti-BK virus activity in a subgroup of transplant recipients. Cidofovir is being investigated as a complementary intralesional therapy against papillomatosis caused by HPV. It first received FDA approval on 26 June 1996, TGA approval on 30 April 1998 and EMA approval on 23 April 1997. It has been used topically to treat warts. ===Other=== It has been suggested as an antitumour agent, due to its suppression of FGF2. ==Administration== Cidofovir is only available as an intravenous formulation. Cidofovir is to be administered with probenecid which decreases side effects to the kidney. Probenecid mitigate nephrotoxicity by inhibiting organic anion transport of the proximal tubule epithelial cells of the kidney.Lacy, S. \\"Effect of Oral Probenecid Coadministration on the Chronic Toxicity and Pharmacokinetics of Intravenous Cidofovir in Cynomolgus Monkeys. In addition, hydration must be administered to patients receiving cidofovir. 1 liter of normal saline is recommended in conjunction with each dose of cidofovir. ==Side effects== The major dose-limiting side effect of cidofovir is nephrotoxicity (that is, kidney damage). Other common side effects (occurring in >1% of people treated with the drug) include: * Nausea * Vomiting * Neutropenia * Hair loss * Weakness * Headache * Chills * Decreased intraocular pressure * Uveitis * Iritis Whereas uncommon side effects include: anaemia and elevated liver enzymes and rare side effects include: tachycardia and Fanconi syndrome. Probenecid (a uricosuric drug) and intravenous saline should always be administered with each cidofovir infusion to prevent this nephrotoxicity. ===Contraindications=== Hypersensitivity to cidofovir or probenecid (as probenecid needs to be given concurrently to avoid nephrotoxicity). ===Interactions=== It is known to interact with nephrotoxic agents (e.g. amphotericin B, foscarnet, IV aminoglycosides, IV pentamide, vancomycin, tacrolimus, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, etc.) to increase their nephrotoxic potential. As it must be given concurrently with probenecid it is advised that drugs that are known to interact with probenecid (e.g. drugs that probenecid interferes with the renal tubular secretion of, such as paracetamol, aciclovir, aminosalicylic acid, etc.) are also withheld. ==Mechanism of action== Its active metabolite, cidofovir diphosphate, inhibits viral replication by selectively inhibiting viral DNA polymerases. It also inhibits human polymerases but this action is 8-600 times weaker than its actions on viral DNA polymerases. It also incorporates itself into viral DNA hence inhibiting viral DNA synthesis during reproduction. It possesses in vitro activity against the following viruses: * Human herpesviruses * Adenoviruses * Human poxviruses (including the smallpox virus) * Human papillomavirus ==History== Cidofovir was discovered at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Prague, by Antonín Holý, and developed by Gilead Sciences and is marketed with the brand name Vistide by Gilead in the USA, and by Pfizer elsewhere. ==Synthesis== Cidofovir can be synthesized from a pyrimidone derivative and a protected derivative of glycidol. :600px == See also == * Brincidofovir, a novel prodrug of cidofovir that can be taken orally ==References== Category:Gilead Sciences Category:Anti-herpes virus drugs Category:Pyrimidones Category:Amines Category:Ethers Category:Phosphonic acids Category:Primary alcohols ","title":"Cidofovir"},{"id":"1277817","text":"Denis O'Conor, O'Conor Don (; 1794 – 1847) of Clonalis, County Roscommon, was an Irish nobleman, and Member of Parliament (MP) in the British House of Commons. ==Life== O'Conor was MP for Roscommon from 1831 to 1847.

His best year in the majors was 1999, when he won 21 games for the Astros and pitched in his only All-Star Game. A flamboyant free spirit, he was best known for coining all his pitching appearances as Lima Time. His remarkably animated displays of emotion on the mound made him a fan favorite, but also drew the ire of opposing teams. He was known for his flamboyant celebrations after his victories in the face of opponents.Stephens, Bailey \\"Former big leaguer Lima dead at 37.\\" www.mlb.com, May 23, 2010.

After three years in Detroit, he was traded to the Houston Astros on December 10, 1996, in an eight-player trade. In he compiled a record of 21–10 and was named to the National League All Star Team that season. However, after the 1999 season, Lima struggled to recapture his success and surrendered a league-leading 48 home runs, which was only two short of the single season record held by Bert Blyleven, and lost 16 games. On June 23, 2001, Lima was traded back to Detroit in exchange for Dave Mlicki. He was released by Detroit during the season, proclaiming at the time, \\"If I can't pitch on this team—the worst or second- worst team in baseball—where am I going to pitch? If I can't start on this ballclub, I must be the worst pitcher on Earth.\\" He pitched for the Newark Bears in the Independent Atlantic League early in 2003, but returned to MLB in June 2003, when he was acquired by the Kansas City Royals. Lima started off fast in Kansas City, he was 7–0 with a 2.17 ERA after eight starts. But a groin injury during his ninth start caused his performance to decline significantly and he went 1–3 with a 10.65 ERA in his last six starts. He joined the Los Angeles Dodgers in . With the Dodgers, Lima was 13–5 with a 4.07 ERA, his best performance since the 1999 season. Possibly the best moment of his career came on October 9, 2004, in Game Three of the 2004 National League Division Series, when he pitched a 5-hit shutout against the St. Louis Cardinals. It was the Dodgers' first post-season victory since Game Five of the 1988 World Series. In , he returned to Kansas City as a free agent but managed only to compile a record of 5–16, while posting a 6.99 ERA and was not re-signed by the club. On February 14, 2006, Lima was inked to a minor league deal by the Mets and pitched for the Mets' AAA affiliate, the Norfolk Tides. He was called up to the Mets on May 7, 2006, and went 0–3 with an 8.79 ERA in three starts before being designated for assignment on May 20, 2006. On July 4, 2006, he was again called up again to the Mets, when Heath Bell was optioned back to the Norfolk Tides. Lima had another poor outing on July 7, 2006, against the Florida Marlins which included surrendering up a grand slam to opposing pitcher Dontrelle Willis and was removed from the game. After the game Lima was designated for assignment back to the Norfolk Tides for the second time during the 2006 season. Lima finished the 2006 season with a 0–4 record with a 9.87 ERA in four total starts for the Mets. In the Dominican Winter Baseball League, he played for the Águilas Cibaeñas. In , Lima also played for Saraperos de Saltillo in the Mexican League. == Korea Professional Baseball == For the 2008 season, Lima signed with the Kia Tigers, a nine-time champion in the Korea Professional Baseball. Despite high expectations as a former Major League Baseball pitcher, Lima struggled in several starts. After that, he was sent down to the Korea Baseball Futures League, and media reported that Lima would be released from the Tigers. However, after returning to the Tigers, Lima got two consecutive wins against the Woori Heroes by pitching seven innings while not allowing a single run, and the Hanwha Eagles, pitching five innings and allowing just three runs, but was still released by the Tigers. == Golden Baseball League == Lima signed with the Long Beach Armada of the independent Golden Baseball League (GBL) on March 27, 2009. He was to play under veteran minor league manager and former major league all- star Garry Templeton. Lima was traded by the Armada to the Edmonton Capitals for former Chicago White Sox first-round draft pick Kris Honel on July 31, 2009. During a May visit to Edmonton with the Long Beach Armada, Lima was heartily embraced by the Capitals' fans and even had a local fan club develop at the ballpark—a first ever for a visiting player there. He pitched a total of four games for the Capitals, going 1-2 in the regular season and losing his only GBL playoff appearance.O'Leary, Chris & Sumamo, Yonathan. \\"One-time Edmonton Capitals pitcher José Lima dead at 37,\\" Edmonton Journal, Sunday, May 23, 2010. == Personal life == Lima made statements in his native Dominican Republic that he would possibly pursue a career as a singer after his baseball career was over; specifically in the genre of bachata. He also had two sons. === Death === Lima died on the morning of May 23, 2010, at age 37. He was rushed to Huntington Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. An autopsy did not determine the cause of death, but stated that due to the condition of his heart, he likely died of a cardiac arrhythmia.http://www.autopsyfiles.org/reports/Celebs/lima,%20jose_report.pdf He had suffered from cardiac problems.

For instance, the orbit and spin of a single particle can interact through spin–orbit interaction, in which case the complete physical picture must include spin–orbit coupling. Or two charged particles, each with a well-defined angular momentum, may interact by Coulomb forces, in which case coupling of the two one-particle angular momenta to a total angular momentum is a useful step in the solution of the two-particle Schrödinger equation. In both cases the separate angular momenta are no longer constants of motion, but the sum of the two angular momenta usually still is. Angular momentum coupling in atoms is of importance in atomic spectroscopy. Angular momentum coupling of electron spins is of importance in quantum chemistry. Also in the nuclear shell model angular momentum coupling is ubiquitous. In astronomy, spin–orbit coupling reflects the general law of conservation of angular momentum, which holds for celestial systems as well. In simple cases, the direction of the angular momentum vector is neglected, and the spin–orbit coupling is the ratio between the frequency with which a planet or other celestial body spins about its own axis to that with which it orbits another body. This is more commonly known as orbital resonance. Often, the underlying physical effects are tidal forces. ==General theory and detailed origin== Orbital angular momentum (denoted l or L). ===Angular momentum conservation=== Conservation of angular momentum is the principle that the total angular momentum of a system has a constant magnitude and direction if the system is subjected to no external torque. Angular momentum is a property of a physical system that is a constant of motion (also referred to as a conserved property, time-independent and well-defined) in two situations: #The system experiences a spherically symmetric potential field. #The system moves (in quantum mechanical sense) in isotropic space. In both cases the angular momentum operator commutes with the Hamiltonian of the system. By Heisenberg's uncertainty relation this means that the angular momentum and the energy (eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian) can be measured at the same time. An example of the first situation is an atom whose electrons only experiences the Coulomb force of its atomic nucleus. If we ignore the electron–electron interaction (and other small interactions such as spin–orbit coupling), the orbital angular momentum l of each electron commutes with the total Hamiltonian. In this model the atomic Hamiltonian is a sum of kinetic energies of the electrons and the spherically symmetric electron–nucleus interactions. The individual electron angular momenta li commute with this Hamiltonian. That is, they are conserved properties of this approximate model of the atom. An example of the second situation is a rigid rotor moving in field-free space. A rigid rotor has a well-defined, time-independent, angular momentum. These two situations originate in classical mechanics. The third kind of conserved angular momentum, associated with spin, does not have a classical counterpart. However, all rules of angular momentum coupling apply to spin as well. In general the conservation of angular momentum implies full rotational symmetry (described by the groups SO(3) and SU(2)) and, conversely, spherical symmetry implies conservation of angular momentum. If two or more physical systems have conserved angular momenta, it can be useful to combine these momenta to a total angular momentum of the combined system--a conserved property of the total system. The building of eigenstates of the total conserved angular momentum from the angular momentum eigenstates of the individual subsystems is referred to as angular momentum coupling. Application of angular momentum coupling is useful when there is an interaction between subsystems that, without interaction, would have conserved angular momentum. By the very interaction the spherical symmetry of the subsystems is broken, but the angular momentum of the total system remains a constant of motion. Use of the latter fact is helpful in the solution of the Schrödinger equation. ===Examples=== As an example we consider two electrons, 1 and 2, in an atom (say the helium atom). If there is no electron–electron interaction, but only electron–nucleus interaction, the two electrons can be rotated around the nucleus independently of each other; nothing happens to their energy. Both operators, l1 and l2, are conserved. However, if we switch on the electron–electron interaction that depends on the distance d(1,2) between the electrons, then only a simultaneous and equal rotation of the two electrons will leave d(1,2) invariant. In such a case neither l1 nor l2 is a constant of motion in general, but the total orbital angular momentum L = l1 \\\\+ l2 is. Given the eigenstates of l1 and l2, the construction of eigenstates of L (which still is conserved) is the coupling of the angular momenta of electrons 1 and 2. The total orbital angular momentum quantum number L is restricted to integer values and must satisfy the triangular condition that l_1 - l_2 \\\\leq L \\\\leq l_1 + l_2, such that the three nonnegative integer values could correspond to the three sides of a triangle.Merzbacher, Eugen (1998). Quantum Mechanics (3rd ed.). John Wiley. pp. 428–9. . In quantum mechanics, coupling also exists between angular momenta belonging to different Hilbert spaces of a single object, e.g. its spin and its orbital angular momentum. If the spin has half-integer values, such as 1/2 for an electron, then the total (orbital plus spin) angular momentum will also be restricted to half-integer values. Reiterating slightly differently the above: one expands the quantum states of composed systems (i.e. made of subunits like two hydrogen atoms or two electrons) in basis sets which are made of tensor products of quantum states which in turn describe the subsystems individually. We assume that the states of the subsystems can be chosen as eigenstates of their angular momentum operators (and of their component along any arbitrary z axis). The subsystems are therefore correctly described by a set of ', m quantum numbers (see angular momentum for details). When there is interaction among the subsystems, the total Hamiltonian contains terms that do not commute with the angular operators acting on the subsystems only. However, these terms do commute with the total angular momentum operator. Sometimes one refers to the non-commuting interaction terms in the Hamiltonian as angular momentum coupling terms, because they necessitate the angular momentum coupling. ==Spin–orbit coupling== The behavior of atoms and smaller particles is well described by the theory of quantum mechanics, in which each particle has an intrinsic angular momentum called spin and specific configurations (of e.g. electrons in an atom) are described by a set of quantum numbers. Collections of particles also have angular momenta and corresponding quantum numbers, and under different circumstances the angular momenta of the parts couple in different ways to form the angular momentum of the whole. Angular momentum coupling is a category including some of the ways that subatomic particles can interact with each other. In atomic physics, spin–orbit coupling, also known as spin- pairing, describes a weak magnetic interaction, or coupling, of the particle spin and the orbital motion of this particle, e.g. the electron spin and its motion around an atomic nucleus. One of its effects is to separate the energy of internal states of the atom, e.g. spin-aligned and spin-antialigned that would otherwise be identical in energy. This interaction is responsible for many of the details of atomic structure. In solid-state physics, the spin coupling with the orbital motion can lead to splitting of energy bands due to Dresselhaus or Rashba effects. In the macroscopic world of orbital mechanics, the term spin–orbit coupling is sometimes used in the same sense as spin–orbit resonance. ===LS coupling=== Illustration of L–S coupling. Total angular momentum J is purple, orbital L is blue, and spin S is green. In light atoms (generally Z ≤ 30The Russell Saunders Coupling Scheme R. J. Lancashire, UCDavis ChemWiki (accessed 26 Dec.2015)), electron spins si interact among themselves so they combine to form a total spin angular momentum S. The same happens with orbital angular momenta ℓi, forming a total orbital angular momentum L. The interaction between the quantum numbers L and S is called Russell-Saunders coupling (after Henry Norris Russell and Frederick Saunders) or LS coupling. Then S and L couple together and form a total angular momentum J: :\\\\mathbf J = \\\\mathbf L + \\\\mathbf S, \\\\, where L and S are the totals: : \\\\mathbf L = \\\\sum_i \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\ell}_i, \\\\ \\\\mathbf S = \\\\sum_i \\\\mathbf{s}_i. \\\\, This is an approximation which is good as long as any external magnetic fields are weak. In larger magnetic fields, these two momenta decouple, giving rise to a different splitting pattern in the energy levels (the Paschen-Back effect.), and the size of LS coupling term becomes small. For an extensive example on how LS-coupling is practically applied, see the article on term symbols. ===jj coupling=== In heavier atoms the situation is different. In atoms with bigger nuclear charges, spin–orbit interactions are frequently as large as or larger than spin–spin interactions or orbit–orbit interactions. In this situation, each orbital angular momentum ℓi tends to combine with the corresponding individual spin angular momentum si, originating an individual total angular momentum ji. These then couple up to form the total angular momentum J :\\\\mathbf J = \\\\sum_i \\\\mathbf j_i = \\\\sum_i (\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\ell}_i + \\\\mathbf{s}_i). This description, facilitating calculation of this kind of interaction, is known as jj coupling. ==Spin–spin coupling== Spin–spin coupling is the coupling of the intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of different particles. Such coupling between pairs of nuclear spins is an important feature of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy as it can provide detailed information about the structure and conformation of molecules. Spin–spin coupling between nuclear spin and electronic spin is responsible for hyperfine structure in atomic spectra. == Term symbols == Term symbols are used to represent the states and spectral transitions of atoms, they are found from coupling of angular momenta mentioned above. When the state of an atom has been specified with a term symbol, the allowed transitions can be found through selection rules by considering which transitions would conserve angular momentum. A photon has spin 1, and when there is a transition with emission or absorption of a photon the atom will need to change state to conserve angular momentum. The term symbol selection rules are. ΔS = 0, ΔL = 0, ±1, Δl = ± 1, ΔJ = 0, ±1 The expression \\"term symbol\\" is derived from the \\"term series\\" associated with the Rydberg states of an atom and their energy levels. In the Rydberg formula the frequency or wave number of the light emitted by a hydrogen-like atom is proportional to the difference between the two terms of a transition. The series known to early spectroscopy were designated sharp, principal, diffuse and fundamental and consequently the letters S, P, D, and F were used to represent the orbital angular momentum states of an atom. == Relativistic effects == In very heavy atoms, relativistic shifting of the energies of the electron energy levels accentuates spin–orbit coupling effect. Thus, for example, uranium molecular orbital diagrams must directly incorporate relativistic symbols when considering interactions with other atoms. == Nuclear coupling == In atomic nuclei, the spin–orbit interaction is much stronger than for atomic electrons, and is incorporated directly into the nuclear shell model. In addition, unlike atomic–electron term symbols, the lowest energy state is not L − S, but rather, ℓ + s. All nuclear levels whose ℓ value (orbital angular momentum) is greater than zero are thus split in the shell model to create states designated by ℓ + s and ℓ − s. Due to the nature of the shell model, which assumes an average potential rather than a central Coulombic potential, the nucleons that go into the ℓ + s and ℓ − s nuclear states are considered degenerate within each orbital (e.g. The 2p3/2 contains four nucleons, all of the same energy. Higher in energy is the 2p1/2 which contains two equal-energy nucleons). == See also == * Clebsch-Gordan coefficients * Angular momentum diagrams (quantum mechanics) * Spherical basis ==Notes== == External links == * LS and jj coupling * Term symbol * Web calculator of spin couplings: shell model, atomic term symbol Category:Atomic physics Category:Rotational symmetry ar:ترابط مغزلي مداري it:Interazione spin-orbita ","title":"Angular momentum coupling"},{"id":"1277830","text":"Portrait of O'Conor Charles Owen O'Conor, O'Conor Don PC (; 7 May 1838 – 30 June 1906),John P.

Any party initiating aggression might trigger their own demise. At the same time, the parties are unable to extricate themselves from the situation without suffering a loss - effectively, a situation of mutual zugzwang. As a result, all participants need to maintain the strategic tension, which remains unresolved until some outside event makes it possible to resolve it. The term Mexican standoff was originally used in the context of using firearms and it still commonly implies a situation in which the parties face some form of threat from the other parties. The Mexican standoff is a recurring trope in cinema, in which several armed characters hold each other at gunpoint. There is no definitive requirement that the confrontation involve at least three parties. == Etymology == The expression came into use during or before the last decade of the 19th century; the Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary makes an unattributed claim that the term is of Australian origin. Other sources claim the reference is to the Mexican–American War or post-war Mexican bandits in the 19th century. The earliest print cite to the phrase was 19 March 1876 in a short story about Mexico, an American being held up by a Mexican bandit, and the outcome:\\"Mexican, n. and adj.\\". OED Online. March 2018. Oxford University Press. == Popular use == In popular use, the term Mexican standoff is sometimes used in reference to confrontations in which neither opponent appears to have a measurable advantage. Historically, commentators have used the term to reference the Soviet Union – United States nuclear confrontation during the Cold War, specifically the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. The key element that makes such situations Mexican standoffs is the equality of power exercised among the involved parties. The inability of any particular party to advance its position safely is a condition common among all standoffs; in a \\"Mexican standoff,\\" however, there is an additional disadvantage: no party has a safe way to withdraw from its position, thus making the standoff effectively permanent. In financial circles, the Mexican standoff is typically used to denote a situation where one side wants something, a concession of some sort, and is offering nothing of value. When the other side sees no value in agreeing to any changes, they refuse to negotiate. Although both sides may benefit from the change, neither side can agree to adequate compensation for agreeing to the change, and nothing is accomplished. A Mexican standoff where each party is pointing a gun at another is now considered a movie cliché, stemming from its frequent use as a plot device in cinema. The classic exemplar of the trope is in Sergio Leone's 1966 Western The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, where the eponymous characters, played by Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach, face each other at gunpoint.Buckmaster, Luke. \\"The lasting legacy of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,\\" BBC.com, Wednesday 10 February 2016. Retrieved October 26, 2018 The videogame Red Dead Redemption features a notable example among gamblers in Mexico. One of the participants makes a humorous nod to the trope, realizing the situation and claiming “There must be a name for this” to which the Lee Van Cleef-inspired character Landon Ricketts replies “An impasse, sir. An impasse.” In Red Dead Redemption 2, such is illustrated when at the final mission of the epilogue: Dutch Van Der Linde, Micah Bell and John Marston are each holding each other at gunpoint. Director John Woo, considered a major influence on the action genre, is known for his highly chaotic action sequences, Mexican standoffs, and frequent use of slow motion. Director Quentin Tarantino (who has cited Woo as an influence) has featured Mexican standoff scenes in his films like Inglourious Basterds (the tavern scene features multiple Mexican standoffs including meta-discussion); and the climactic scene of Reservoir Dogs, which depicts a standoff among four characters. A Mexican standoff also features prominently in the mission The Wrap Up in Grand Theft Auto V, in which a meeting between protagonist Michael De Santa and the FIB quickly devolves into an all out four-way battle among the FIB, IAA and Merryweather agents. == See also == == References == == External links == * Category:English-language idioms Category:Cinematic techniques Category:Dilemmas Category:Slang Category:Violence Category:English phrases Category:Phrases ","title":"Mexican standoff"},{"id":"1277846","text":"Marlies Askamp.

A prodrug form of adefovir was previously called bis-POM PMEA, with trade names Preveon and Hepsera. It is an orally administered nucleotide analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (ntRTI). It can be formulated as the pivoxil prodrug adefovir dipivoxil. ==Uses== It is used for treatment of hepatitis B. Trials of adefovir in patients with HIV have not shown any clear benefits. ==History== Adefovir was invented in the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic by Antonín Holý, and the drug was developed by Gilead Sciences for HIV with the brand name Preveon. However, in November 1999, an expert panel advised the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) not to approve the drug due to concerns about the severity and frequency of kidney toxicity when dosed at 60 or 120 mg. The FDA followed that advice, refusing to approve adefovir as a treatment for HIV. Gilead Sciences discontinued its development for HIV treatment in December 1999, but continued to develop the drug for hepatitis B (HBV), where it is effective with a much lower dose of 10 mg. FDA approval for use in the treatment of hepatitis B was granted on September 20, 2002, and adefovir is sold for this indication under the brand name Hepsera. Adefovir became an approved treatment for HBV in the European Union in March 2003. ==Mechanism of action== Adefovir dipivoxil Adefovir works by blocking reverse transcriptase, an enzyme crucial for the HBV to reproduce in the body. It is approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults with evidence of active viral replication and either evidence of persistent elevations in serum aminotransferases (primarily ALT) or histologically active disease. The main benefit of adefovir over lamivudine (the first NRTI approved for the treatment of HBV) is that it takes a much longer period of time for the virus to develop resistance to it. Adefovir dipivoxil contains two pivaloyloxymethyl units, making it a prodrug form of adefovir. == References == == External links == * - Adefovir dipivoxil Category:Gilead Sciences Category:Reverse transcriptase inhibitors Category:Purines Category:Phosphonic acids ","title":"Adefovir"},{"id":"1277850","text":"Looking West From Bear Mountain Bear Mountain is a peak in the Tehachapi Mountains, near Tehachapi, California.

Its function is to pile bulk material such as limestone, ores and cereals on to a stockpile. A reclaimer can be used to recover the material. Gold dredges in Alaska had a stacker that was a fixed part of the dredge. It carried over-size material to the tailings pile. Stackers are nominally rated for capacity in tonnes per hour (tph). They normally travel on a rail between stockpiles in the stockyard. A stacker can usually move in at least two directions: horizontally along the rail and vertically by luffing (raising and lowering) its boom. Luffing of the boom minimises dust by reducing the distance that material such as coal needs to fall to the top of the stockpile. The boom is luffed upwards as the height of the stockpile increases. Some stackers can rotate the boom. This allows a single stacker to form two stockpiles, one on either side of the conveyor. Stackers are used to stack in different patterns, such as cone stacking and chevron stacking. Stacking in a single cone tends to cause size segregation, with coarser material moving out towards the base. In raw cone ply stacking, additional cones are added next to the first cone. In chevron stacking, the stacker travels along the length of the stockpile adding layer upon layer of material. Stackers and reclaimers were originally manually controlled, with no means of remote control. Modern machines are typically semi-automatic or fully automated, with parameters remotely set. The control system used is typically a programmable logic controller, with a human-machine interface for display, connected to a central control system. Other than stacking, a stacker has three basic movements: * Luffing: This is vertical movement. Stackers use either a winch mechanism with metal wire, or hydraulic cylinders, generally two. Winch mechanisms are highly reliable compared to hydraulic actuators and remain widely used, particularly in large stackers. * Travelling: The stacker moves on a rail track, which may be broad or narrow gauge, enabling it to move around the stockyard as required. For this purpose, traction motors powered by direct current (DC) are connected by bevel gears to between 12 and 22 wheels. For manual control, all the controls are in a controller's cabin above the boom conveyor or boom. Modern stackers can be controlled remotely. * Slewing: This is rotation of the stacker around its central axis to align or place the stockpile where required. This works mostly by a slew pinion that rotates around a slew base. This type of gear assembly is called a sun and planet gear. The axles may be multiple and are driven by DC-powered axle motors which transmit the torque via bevel or helical gears. The conveyor belts used in stackers may be made of fabric or metal wire, depending upon the material to be handled. They are driven by pulleys, which in turn are driven by DC motors. The motors and gear are coupled by fluid coupling. Most stackers are electrically powered by way of a trailing cable. There are basically two types of cable trailing: power cord rotating drum (PCRD) and control cable rotating drum (CCRD). Pendulum adjustments are made to ensure the proper alignment of these cables while the stacker is travelling. ==See also== * Coal homogenization * Reclaimer ==External links == ==References== Category:Bulk material handling Category:Mining equipment Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Stacker"},{"id":"1277858","text":"\\"Sandwiches\\" is a song by American electronic band Detroit Grand Pubahs.

The Ystwyth flows westwards before its confluence with the Afon Rheidol and the estuary at Aberystwyth to drain into Cardigan Bay. The Ystwyth valley is sparsely populated with villages, namely Ysbyty Ystwyth, Cwm Ystwyth, Pont- rhyd-y-groes, Llanilar and Llanfarian. In previous centuries, the valley was relatively densely populated due to its mineral wealth. Silver, lead and zinc have been mined in the valley since Roman times, an activity that reached its peak in the 18th century. The largest of the very many mines was Cwm Ystwyth Mine. It is reputed that the average age at death of the miners in Cwm Ystwyth was 32, largely because of acute lead poisoning. There is no active metal mining in the Ystwyth valley today. The River still carries elevated levels of lead, zinc and silver in its water, mostly due to seepage from abandoned mine tailings and discharges from mine adits. At the Frongoch mine near Pont-rhyd- y-groes, Natural Resources Wales has introduced a new technique for reducing the pollution. Water is drawn away from the mine in a leat to a wetland area, where biological processes involving the vegetation immobilise much of the pollutants. A similar approach is being used at Cwm Rheidol mine, near Aberystwyth. These remedies are considered important because the area supports a rich variety of wildlife, as well as bringing anglers and tourists to the area. ==References== * Green, John (2006), Afon Ystwyth: The Story of a River, Artery Publications 2006. == External links == Category:Aberystwyth Ystwyth Ystwyth ","title":"River Ystwyth"},{"id":"1277883","text":"Lithograph by Dutchman Philip Baldeus depicting Ahmedabad and Sabarmati river circa 1752 Sabarmati river in 1890 Watercarts in Sabarmati near Ahmedabad in 1890s alt= The Sabarmati river is one of the major west-flowing rivers in India.

Y., Petersen, M. R. & Lin, W. The Southern Annular Mode and Southern Ocean Surface Westerly Winds in E3SM. Earth Sp. Sci. 6, 2624–2643 (2019). The Antarctic oscillation (AAO, to distinguish it from the Arctic oscillation or AO), also known as the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), is a low-frequency mode of atmospheric variability of the southern hemisphere that is defined as a belt of strong westerly winds or low pressure surrounding Antarctica which moves north or south as its mode of variability.Australian Bureau of Meteorology - The Southern Annular Mode. Accessed 25/10/2013. http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/enso/history/ln-2010-12/SAM-what.shtml It is a climate driver for Australia, influencing the country's weather conditions – It is associated with storms and cold fronts that move from west to east that bring precipitation to southern Australia.Southern Annular Mode and the Australian climate Bureau of Meteorology ==Phases and impacts== In its positive phase, the westerly wind belt that drives the Antarctic Circumpolar Current intensifies and contracts towards Antarctica. This would increase rainfall (including East coast lows) and reduce heat in south-eastern Australia in the summer due to higher onshore flows from the Pacific Ocean and, in winter, decrease snow in the alpine areas and rainfall in the far south and southwest. This phase would occur more frequently with a La Niña event.Southern Annular Mode Bureau of Meteorology, 12 June 2019 Its negative phase involves this belt moving towards the equator, decreasing rainfall in the southeast of Australia in the summer and as well as raising the possibility of spring heatwaves. Moreover, winters will usually be wetter than normal in the south and southwest with more snowfall in the alpine areas, but drier in the east coast due to less moist onshore flows from the east. This phase will usually be more frequent with an El Niño event. Winds associated with the Southern Annular Mode cause oceanic upwelling of warm circumpolar deep water along the Antarctic continental shelf, which has been linked to ice shelf basal melt, representing a possible wind-driven mechanism that could destabilize large portions of the Antarctic ice sheet. ==Research== In 2014, Nerilie Abram used a network of temperature-sensitive ice core and tree growth records to reconstruct a 1000-year history of the Southern Annular Mode. This work suggests that the Southern Annular Mode is currently in its most extreme positive phase over at least the last 1000 years, and that recent positive trends in the SAM are attributed to increasing greenhouse gas levels and later stratospheric ozone depletion. ==See also== * Anticyclone * Arctic oscillation * John Michael Wallace * North Atlantic oscillation * Pacific decadal oscillation ==References== == External links == * http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/gjma/sam.html Observation-based SAM index from 1957–present * http://hurricane.ncdc.noaa.gov/pls/paleox/f?p=519:1:0::::P1_STUDY_ID:16197 1000-year Southern Annular Mode reconstruction * Monthly Southern Hemisphere Annular Mode (SAM) Index or Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) Index 1850 - 2013 * Daily Southern Hemisphere Annular Mode (SAM) Index or Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) Index 1948 - 2013 * http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/daily_ao_index/aao/aao.loading.shtml * https://web.archive.org/web/20081216220433/http://stratus.astr.ucl.ac.be/textbook//pdf/Chapter_5.pdf (chapter 5.2.3) *SOUTHERN ANNULAR MODE IN AUSTRALIA – What is it? * The Southern Annular Mode Introduction to climate dynamics and climate modelling, Université catholique de Louvain Category:Climate of Antarctica Category:Regional climate effects Category:Environment of Antarctica Category:Climate of Australia ","title":"Antarctic oscillation"},{"id":"1277895","text":"Helen Delich Bentley (November 28, 1923 – August 6, 2016) was an American politician who was a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from Maryland from 1985 to 1995. Before entering politics, she had been a leading maritime reporter and journalist. == Early life == Bentley was born in the copper-mining town of Ruth, Nevada. Her parents were immigrant Serbians, and her father was a miner. When Bentley was eight years old, her father died of silicosis, a common miner's disease, and Bentley took a part- time job in a dress shop while her mother took in boarders to support the family. While at high school, she had her first experiences of journalism and politics while working on the weekly newspaper of Ely, Nevada, which was published by Republican state legislator Charles Russell. She won scholarships to study journalism at the University of Missouri, graduating in 1944 after earning a BA degree with honors. While at college, she worked on the Senate campaign for Democrat James D. Scrugham, and was appointed his Senate secretary. == Career == === Journalism === Following her graduation, Bentley worked for small-town newspapers in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Lewiston, Idaho, but she wanted to report hard news for a larger publication; at the time, most women journalists were limited to writing society news. She wrote to all the main East Coast newspapers and eventually, in 1945, The Baltimore Sun offered her a reporting position. She initially reported on labor and union matters, but was subsequently allocated maritime and waterfront news. She became a widely respected maritime reporter, dealing with people from dock workers to state politicians, and also writing for port agencies and shipping companies. Beginning in 1950 Bentley hosted a local Baltimore TV program on WMAR, The Port That Built a City, presenting maritime and transportation-related news. Later retitled The Port That Built a City and State, the series was produced by Bentley until 1965 and included then-novel live remotes from the decks of ships in Baltimore harbor during the early years of television. During the Vietnam War, Bentley became aware of the congestion in the port of Saigon, and traveled there to report on the problems of supplying American troops. President Johnson became aware of her report, and subsequently improvements were made to port facilities in Cam Ranh Bay to relieve pressure on Saigon. === Politics === In 1969, Bentley was offered a seat on the Federal Maritime Commission. However, she declined and asked for the position of chair instead. She was appointed and chaired the commission from 1969 to 1975. The position made her the highest-ranking woman in President Nixon's administration. During her tenure, Bentley advocated for federal support for American shipbuilding yards. Bentley challenged Democratic incumbent Clarence Long in in 1980 and 1982. She defeated Long on her third attempt in 1984, and was elected to the 99th Congress and to the four succeeding Congresses, serving from January 3, 1985, to January 3, 1995. During her time in office, Bentley was a strong advocate for protectionist trade policies in support of U.S. manufacturing and the U.S. Merchant Marine fleet. She also introduced legislation which enabled Chesapeake Bay to be dredged, allowing larger cargo ships to access the port of Baltimore. In the 1990s, she was sympathetic towards Serbians during the civil war in Yugoslavia, and opposed U.S. military involvement in that conflict. Helen Delich Bentley with Serbian poet and journalist Dejan Stojanovic in 1993 Bentley was not a candidate for reelection to the 104th Congress in 1994, but was an unsuccessful candidate for nomination for Governor of Maryland. Despite an endorsement from the incumbent Democratic governor William Donald Schaefer, she was defeated in the Republican primary by the more conservative Ellen Sauerbrey. When her successor in Congress, Bob Ehrlich, gave up his seat, Bentley sought to take the seat back in 2002. However, the district had been made significantly more Democratic in redistricting and included a large slice of Baltimore City, an area Bentley had never represented. She lost to Baltimore County Executive Dutch Ruppersberger. In 1995, Bentley founded Helen Bentley & Associates, Inc., and provided consultancy services on international trade, business and government. She was also a consultant for the Maryland Port Administration and the Port of Baltimore, and served on the Board of Trustees for both the Baltimore Museum of Industry and the Maritime Industries Academy High School. === Electoral record === {class=\\" collapsible\\" - ccc;\\" ! colspan=\\"24\\" ccf;\\"Election results - !Year !Office !Election ! !Candidate !Party !Votes !% ! !Opponent !Party !Votes !% ! !Opponent !Party !Votes !% - 1980 Representative for Maryland's 2nd District General   Helen Delich Bentley  Republican  89,961  42.6%   Clarence Long  Democratic  121,017  57.4%  - 1982 Representative for Maryland's 2nd District General   Helen Delich Bentley  Republican  75,062  47.4%   Clarence Long  Democratic  83,318  52.6%  - 1984 Representative for Maryland's 2nd District General   Helen Delich Bentley  Republican  111,517  51.4%   Clarence Long  Democratic  105,571  48.6%   N/A  Other  1  0.0% - 1986 Representative for Maryland's 2nd District General   Helen Delich Bentley  Republican  96,745  58.7%   Kathleen Kennedy Townsend  Democratic  68,200  41.3%   N/A  Write-in  1  0.0% - 1988 Representative for Maryland's 2nd District General   Helen Delich Bentley  Republican  157,956  71.5%   Joseph Bartenfelder  Democratic  63,114  28.5%  - 1990 Representative for Maryland's 2nd District General   Helen Delich Bentley  Republican  115,398  74.4%   Ronald P.

The work's genesis was attributed to the composition of another waltz by Jacques Offenbach later titled 'Abendblätter' when the French opera composer dedicated his work to the influential Vienna Authors' and Journalists' Association ('Concordia'). The Association had earlier intended the 'Abendblätter' waltz (untitled by Offenbach when first dedicated) to be played at their 'Concordia Ball' on 12 January 1864. Strauss and his orchestra were engaged to provide music for the festivity and he was also obliged to dedicate a new composition of his own. Since he was clearly aware of Offenbach's dedication, he similarly left it to the Association to decide the title of his own work. The committee, in a mood for a musical joust, titled Offenbach's work as 'Abendblätter' (Evening Papers) and Strauss' work as 'Morgenblätter' (Morning Papers). Friendly rivalry was top of their intentions though, as Strauss dutifully premiered Offenbach's work as well as his own because the latter was not present on the day in question. Despite many later fabrications that Strauss' work was initially ignored, first night press reviews do not proclaim in favor of either work although posterity seemed to pronounce in favor of Strauss' uplifting work with the 'Abendblätter' waltz being equally impressive.

The quiet introduction in the key of D major begins the work, with repeated chords in the bass-line. A sharp series of loud chords interrupts the playful mood and a long clarinet passage ushers in the first waltz theme in G major. Waltz 1B (in D major) carries on the exuberant mood before a repeat of waltz 1A quickly proceeds to the tranquility of Waltz 2A in C major. Waltz 3A and 3B (F major) is more robust and quicker than the previous sections whereas Waltz 4A in B flat major is quiet and brooding. Waltz 4B erupts in joy for a brief section and proceeding to repeat waltz 4A. Waltz 5A is the climax of the work, in E-flat major and is punctuated with the brass instruments, particularly the trombones. A more peaceful-sounding waltz 5B is played but the brash 5A makes another appearance. A tense coda would be quickly replaced with a reprise of waltz 2A. A furious passage of chords brought in waltz 1A again before sweeping into a joyous conclusion complete with a snare drumroll and orchestral flourish.

The new series, which has had annual releases through 2020, is available on multiple platforms. The series is meant to contrast the Sony-published, PlayStation-exclusive MLB The Show, which is considered more simulationist in its focus. ==Gameplay and features== Screenshot from the first R.B.I. Baseball RBI Baseball was the first console game of its kind to be licensed by the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) and used actual MLB player names, unlike other baseball video games of the late 1980s. As it was not licensed by Major League Baseball (MLB) itself, it did not use team nicknames or logos. Instead, the game contained 8 teams listed by only their location: Boston, California, Detroit, Houston, Minnesota, New York, St. Louis, and San Francisco; their real-life, MLB counterparts were the first place teams in each division in (Boston, California, Houston, New York) and (Detroit, Minnesota, St. Louis, San Francisco) MLB seasons. The game also boasted two All-Star teams, American League and National League; the two featured established veterans such as George Brett, Mike Schmidt, Dale Murphy and Andre Dawson—none of whom appeared on the other eight teams—and up-and-coming players like Mark McGwire, Andrés Galarraga, Kevin Seitzer and José Canseco. Each player has different capabilities in the game; hitters vary in ability to make solid contact, to hit the ball with power, and their base running speed. Vince Coleman is the fastest player in the game; it is very difficult to catch him stealing second base. Pitchers vary in pitching speed, and the amount by which the player can steer the ball left and right during its flight. Pitchers also have varying stamina; as a pitcher gets tired, the ball slows down and is harder to steer. Nolan Ryan and Roger Clemens are two pitchers in the game with the fastest pitches. Fernando Valenzuela, without a hard fastball, has tremendous movement in both directions with his pitches. Mike Scott has a sharp and deceptive breaking ball. The best pitcher is debatable, depending on how they are used by the players. There is no evidence that fielding abilities correspond to individual players. The abilities of each player do not necessarily correspond with the statistics shown on the screen when the player comes to bat or takes the mound. These statistics are generally accurate, with many exceptions (see below). They do not change during the course of the game or sequence of games. A rudimentary box score is displayed during and after the game showing composite statistics for each team. A hit batter is credited with a walk, and anyone reaching on an error gets credited for a hit even as the other team is charged with an error. Conversely, a batter thrown out while trying for extra bases is not credited with a hit. The infield fly rule is not implemented. The rosters for the eight teams are fairly accurate if simplified representations of the playoff rosters from their respective years. Each team has 8 starting batters, four bench players, two starting pitchers and two relievers. The player can start any pitcher they like, though the relievers have very low stamina. But if they play consecutive games without resetting the system, any starting pitcher used in the previous game will be unavailable. The player has to wait until the game starts before substituting players with pinch hitters, who can play any position. Pinch runners are not implemented. Unlike Major League Baseball, R.B.I. Baseball implements the mercy rule—if one team is ahead by ten or more runs after any number of completed innings, the game ends immediately. Additionally, while the statistics shown on the screen for each player in the original game were reasonably accurate, their playing attributes were not always accurate. For example, George Brett was depicted in-game as a right-handed batter, while the real-life Brett batted left-handed. Also, all real-life switch hitters, such as Tim Raines, were depicted exclusively as left-handed batters. In Vs. RBI Baseball, the teams are made up of legends from 10 different franchises. These players were statistically represented with their best seasons. A notable exception was that of McGwire, who was included on the Oakland team, and was statistically represented by his potential numbers. In a remarkable display of foresight, he was projected to hit 62 home runs in his best season. In 1998, he set the then-major league record for home runs in a season with 70. From the second game onward in the original R.B.I. Baseball series, all of the (then) 26 (later 28) Major League Baseball teams were featured; however, these later games also did not have a full MLB license, so the teams were only identified by their cities (however, they still had real player names as they had the MLBPA license). Beginning with the third game in the series, some playoff teams of the recent past were featured, which also include the rosters of those teams in the years that they qualified. ==Games== ==Reception== Most every edition of R.B.I. Baseball has typically received \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\" from critics since its 2014 reboot, according to review aggregator Metacritic. IGN called R.B.I. Baseball 14 and 15 \\"bad\\". Forbes gave bad reviews to 16, 17, and 18. 18 was criticized for its animation and collision detection. Polygon called R.B.I. Baseball 18 \\"primitive\\". R.B.I.

In 2000, PAN president Vicente Fox appointed him director general of Banobras. This non-PRI position conflicted with the leadership of his party, and he resigned in 2003 to be nominated by the PRI as candidate for federal deputy of the LIX Legislature of the Mexican Congress. He was a proportional representation deputy elected from the third electoral region and served on a trio of business-related commissions: Finances and Public Credit, Budget and Public Accounts, and Oversight of the Superior Auditor of the Federation. He worked alongside PRI parliamentary coordinator Elba Esther Gordillo in the Chamber of Deputies when a conflict arose between Gordillo and the president of the PRI, Roberto Madrazo Pintado. He supported a failed fiscal reform measure that would have extended the application of value-added tax to food and medicine products and wound up dividing the PRI parliamentary faction in the Chamber of Deputies. After the dismissal of Gordillo from the PRI, González resigned from the Chamber of Deputies and was replaced by José Luis García Mercado.SIL: Profile for Tomás José Ruiz González (in Spanish) In 2004, he took the position as head of the National Lottery; in October 2005, he broke ties with the PRI, of which he had been a member for 20 years.

In 2010, Ruiz González's political career was resuscitated when new Governor of Veracruz Javier Duarte appointed him as the state's Secretary of Finance, a position in which he remained until March 2013, when he resigned for \\"personal reasons\\" and left the department in a severe cash crisis. He rejoined the PRI in July 2012. Two years after leaving the state government, Duarte put Ruiz back in his cabinet, this time as state secretary of infrastructure and public works.

Pinal began her career in the theater, venturing into cinema in 1949. Pinal reached popularity during the Golden Age of Mexican cinema. Her film work and popularity in her native country led her to work in Europe (Spain and Italy). Pinal achieved international recognition by starring in a famous film trilogy by director Luis Buñuel: Viridiana (1961), El ángel exterminador (1962) and Simón del desierto (1965). In addition to her outstanding career in film, Pinal has also excelled in other areas. She was a pioneer of the Musical theatre in MexicoReforma.com: Silvia Pinal, pionneer of the Musical Theatre in Mexico in addition to venturing into television, as an actress and producer.

Her career spans over sixty years and she is still active as of 2020. ==Early life== Silvia Pinal Hidalgo was born in Guaymas, Sonora, Mexico on September 12, 1931. Her parents were María Luisa Hidalgo Aguilar and Moisés Pasquel. Pasquel was an orchestra conductor at the Mexican radio station XEW. Silvia's mother became pregnant with Pasquel when she was only 15 years old. Her father did not recognize her and Silvia did not knew him until she was 11 years old.TVyNovelas México: Silvia Pinal presents her autobiographic book On the part of her biological father, Silvia had three more brothers: Eugenio, Moisés and Virginia. however, Pinal never spent time with the Pasquel family. Pinal spent her first years behind the counter of a seafood restaurant located near the XEW where her mother worked. When Pinal was five years old, her mother married Luis G. Pinal, whom they called \\"El Caballero Pinal\\", a journalist, military man and politician twenty years older than her. Pinal recognized Silvia as his daughter. Mr. Pinal had three more daughters from a previous marriage: Mercedes, Beatriz and Eugenia. Her adoptive father held several public positions in Mexico. He was municipal president of Tequisquiapan, Querétaro. The family lived in several cities of Mexico as Querétaro, Acapulco, Monterrey, Chilpancingo, Cuernavaca and Puebla, finally settled in Mexico City. Pinal was fascinated by show business since she was a child. In addition to film and music, she liked to write and recite poems.Pinal (1996), p. 15 She studied first at Pestalozzi College in Cuernavaca, and then at the Washington Institute in Mexico City. Despite her artistic aspirations, her father conditioned her to study \\"something useful\\" and therefore she learned typing. At age 14 she started working at Kodak as a secretary. Silvia wanted to study opera. She began to prepare taking classes with a private teacher and then with Professor Reyes Retana. Her first step towards fame occurred when she was invited to participate in a beauty pageant. In this contest Silvia obtained the title of Student Princess of Mexico. In her coronation she met the actors Rubén Rojo and Manolo Fábregas, with whom she became close friends.Pinal (1996), p. 28 While studying bel canto, Silvia went to work as a secretary in the pharmaceutical laboratories Carlos Stein. At the music academy, Silvia auditioned for a role in the opera La Traviata. However, this hearing was a failure. Then her teacher encouraged her to take acting courses in the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes. In that academy, she was a classmate of figures such as Carlos Pellicer, Salvador Novo and Xavier Villaurrutia.Pinal (1996), p. 31 She debuted as an extra in a performance of A Midsummer Night's Dream, by William Shakespeare.García Riera (1996), p. 21 ==Career== ===Beginning=== Silvia continued working in the pharmaceutical products firm, in her advertising department. Her boss, knowing that she was studying acting, gave her the opportunity to participate in the recording of some radio comedies in the XEQ. She debuted in the comedy Dos pesos la dejada.García Riera (1996), p. 21 At the radio station, she met some publicists, who invited her to be part of an experimental company. She made her debut in that company with a role in the play Los Caprichos de Goya. The director of this work was the Mexican actor and director, of Cuban origin Rafael Banquells, with whom Silvia began an employment relationship and a close friendship that led to romance. Rafael Banquells got the master Carlos Laverne to allow them to use the Ideal Theater of Mexico City for their productions. Laverne chose Silvia to participate in a montage with the company of the Ideal Theater, directed by the Spanish actress Isabelita Blanch. The work was called Nuestra Natacha. Silvia acted in numerous works for this company. Her first star work was Un sueño de cristal.García Riera (1996), p. 22 ===Film=== Just fifteen days after she debuted in the theater, Pinal made her debut in the cinema with a brief role in the film Bamba (1949), starring Carmen Montejo and directed by Miguel Contreras Torres. Contreras Torres had seen her work at the Ideal Theatre and invited her to take part in the project. Contreras Torres was a tough and strict director who made Pinal suffer for her inexperience. Eventually, in that same year, she performed in the film El pecado de Laura, directed by Julián Soler and starring Meche Barba. In that film she worked for the first time in cinema with Rafael Banquells, who at that time was already her husband. Immediately she made another small role in the film Escuela para casadas, by Miguel Zacarías. Silvia met and worked for the first time with the popular actor and singer Pedro Infante in the film La mujer que yo perdí. The actor and comedian Cantinflas (her wedding godfather), chose Pinal as his co-star in the film The Doorman (1949), which was a very big step for the young and new actress. But her first solid step towards popularity was her participation in the comedy El rey del barrio (1949), where she formed a great comedic pair with Germán Valdés \\"Tin-Tán\\", directed by Gilberto Martínez Solares. Pinal and Tin Tán acted together in two more films: La marca del zorrillo (1950) and Me traes de un ala (1952). Pinal participated in small roles in several more films. Pinal received her first major recognition, her first Silver Ariel Award as a co- starring actress, for her performance in the film Un rincón cerca del cielo (1952), where she worked again with Pedro Infante. In 1952, she performed with Joaquín Pardavé in the comedies Doña Mariquita de mi corazón] and El casto Susano. In 1953, Pinal signed a contract with the FILMEX studios of Gregorio Walerstein, who gave her first stellar works in the films Reventa de esclavas (1953) and Yo soy muy macho ( 1953). In that same year, she made her first musical work with the film Mis tres viudas alegres, where she shared credits with Lilia del Valle and the Cuban rumbera Amalia Aguilar. The success of the film led the three actresses to star, that same year, in the comedy Las cariñosas. In that same year ,she acted with Libertad Lamarque in Si volvieras a mí Pinal achieved success and recognition in 1954, after participating in the film Un extraño en la escalera, directed by Tulio Demicheli, and starring opposite Arturo de Córdova. De Córdova wanted as his co-stars the Italian actress Gina Lollobrigida or the Cuban rumbera Rosa Carmina, because he distrusted Pinal due to her youth. With the support of the producer Gregorio Walerstein, Silvia made a change of image, highlighting her sex appeal, which helped her to be approved by De Cordova for the film. The film was filmed in Havana, Cuba and it was a remarkable blockbuster, which consecrates Pinal as the first figure in the cinema.García Riera (1996), p. 65–66 Another director who knew how to make the most of Silvia's histrionic abilities was Alberto Gout. Under the baton of Gout, Silvia made the film La sospechosa (1954). Another outstanding movie in which Pinal participates is Historia de un abrigo de mink (1954),an episodic film that Pinal co-stars with the actresses María Elena Marqués, Columba Domínguez and Irasema Dilián. With Tito Davison as director, Pinal also filmed the Mexican-Spanish-Chilean co-production Cabo de Hornos (1955), along with the actor Jorge Mistral. Pinal worked again with Pedro Infante, this time as his co-star in the famous comedy El inocente (1955). Pinal starred in several films by Tulio Demicheli. Among the most outstanding is Locura pasional (1955), which would bring her first Silver Ariel award as best actress. The second was thanks to her role in the film La dulce enemiga (1957), directed by Tito Davison. In 1956, Pinal starred in the film Una cita de amor (1956), where she worked for the first and only time under the direction of the director Emilio Fernández. The popularity and success of Pinal in Mexico opened the doors for her to work in Europe following the advice of Tulio Demicheli. Her first work in the Old Continent is in the Spanish-Mexican co-production Las locuras de Bárbara (1958), directed by Demicheli. From the hand of Demicheli Silvia starred in Spain the musical film Charleston. Given the success of her films in Europe, Silvia was invited to work in Italy, where she also served as producer of the film Men and Noblemen (1959), which she starred next to Vittorio de Sica and Elke Sommer. Pinal and Elke Sommer in the Italian film Men and Noblemen (1959). Under the direction of José María Forqué, Silvia starred in Spain in the film Maribel y la extraña familia (1960). In 1961 she filmed the Spanish musical film Adiós, Mimí Pompom, next to Fernando Fernán Gómez. Pinal achieved international acclaim through a trilogy of films that marked the end of the Mexican era of the Spanish filmmaker Luis Buñuel. Pinal had her first contact with Buñuel through Mexican actor Ernesto Alonso, with the firm intention of starring in the film version of the novel Tristana. However, the little commercial success of Buñuel's films prevented the producers from financing the project, which ended up collapsing (Buñuel filmed the film years later in Spain with Catherine Deneuve).Interview with Silvia Pinal: Viridiana Years later, Pinal, with the help of her second husband, producer Gustavo Alatriste, looked for Buñuel in Spain and convinced him to film Viridiana (1961). This, without a doubt, is her most famous film. She was co-starred by Francisco Rabal and Fernando Rey, and was the winner of the Palme d'Or at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival. Despite the success and prestige enjoyed by the film, it was at the time, rejected by the Spanish censorship and the Vatican, accusing it of blasphemy. The Spanish government ordered its destruction. Through the intervention of Pinal, who fled with a copy to Mexico, the film was saved. Pinal (2015), p. 170 In Mexico, Vatican censorship had also resonated. However, with the help of Salvador Novo, the film premiered in some rooms. Her second film with Buñuel was El ángel exterminador (1962), which Pinal starred in with a choral cast. The film also received critical acclaim worldwide. In 2004, the New York Times recognized it among the best films of all time. Her third and last project with Buñuel was Simón del desierto (1964). The film, misrepresented as a medium-length film, was originally conceived to be an episodic film. Pinal and Gustavo Alatriste looked for Federico Fellini to direct a second episode, but Fellini accepted with the condition that his wife, Giulietta Masina, starred in it. Jules Dassin was then sought, who likewise accepted on the condition that it was starred by his wife Melina Mercouri. Pinal also rejected this request. The idea was that Pinal starred in all the episodes of the film, so the project ended up filming only with Buñuel.Interview with Silvia Pinal: Simón del desierto In the film Pinal also made the first nude appearance of her career, something still rare in Mexican cinema and also the first naked scenes of Buñuel's cinema.García Riera (1996), p. 108 Pinal was also on the verge of starring with Buñuel in the film Diary of a Chambermaid, in France. Pinal learned French and was willing to charge nothing for her participation. However, the French producer Serge Silberman ended up choosing Jeanne Moreau.Taller de Actores Profesionales (TAP): Silvia Pinal Even so, Silvia Pinal (along with Lilia Prado), who is the actress with whom Buñuel worked with the most, made a total of three classic films. Pinal was also going to shoot with Buñuel in Spain on Divinas palabras, but there were problems with copyrights. Years later, Pinal was finally able to do it in Mexico with another director. After her work with Buñuel, Pinal returned to the cinema with the comedy Buenas noches, Año Nuevo (1965), where she alternated with Ricardo Montalbán. In 1966 she made the mythical film La soldadera, directed by José Bolaños and inspired by the events of the Mexican Revolution. In that same year she participated in the Mexican-Brazilian co-production Juego peligroso, directed by Luis Alcoriza and based on a script by Gabriel García Márquez. She also appeared in the Franco-Italian-Mexican co-production La bataille de san sebastian, along with Anthony Quinn and Charles Bronson. In 1967 Pinal films Shark!, together Burt Reynolds and directed by Samuel Fuller. This is the only Hollywood production in which Pinal has appeared. Pinal achieved a huge blockbuster with the film María Isabel (1968), based on a popular cartoon by Yolanda Vargas Dulché. Between the late 1960s and early 1970s, Pinal mainly made comic films directed by the filmmaker René Cardona Jr.. In 1976, Pinal starred in Las mariposas disecadas, a thriller of psychological suspense. In 1977 she finally starred in the controversial film Divinas palabras (1977), directed by Juan Ibáñez, a film where she made an integral nude scene. At the end of the seventies and the beginning of the eighties, Silvia filmed some films in Spain, Italy and Argentina as part of a project by Televisa to unify the Spanish and Latin American markets. After ten years of absence in the cinema, Silvia returned in 1992 with the tape Modelo antiguo, directed by Raul Araiza. The decline of Mexican cinema and the activity of Silvia on television and other media (such as politics), made her practically withdraw from the big screen. In recent years, her film appearances are limited to films Ya no los hacen como antes (2002), and a brief special appearance on the movie Tercera llamada ( 2013). ===Stage=== Pinal made her debut at the theater in the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes. Eventually she did experimental plays, to then work at the Ideal Theater in Mexico City, in the company of the Spanish actress Isabelita Blanch, where she was directed in numerous productions by Rafael Banquells. Outside of this company, in 1950 participates in the playCelos del aire, with Manolo Fábregas and Carmen Montejo. In that same year she represented Doña Inés in Don Juan Tenorio, next to Jorge Mistral. Of her most outstanding plays from the beginning of her career stand out The Madwoman of Chaillot, next to Prudencia Griffel and El cuadrante de la soledad, by José Revueltas, with sets by the artist Diego Rivera. In 1954, Pinal participates in the play La Sed, with Ernesto Alonso and the Argentinean actor Pedro López Lagar. In 1955 she obtained the recognition in the theater scene in the assembly Anna Christie, along with Wolf Ruvinskis. In 1957 Silvia staged the play Desnúdate, Lucrecia, in Chile, next to Jorge Mistral, who eventually starred in the cinema in Mexico. In 1958, Pinal was responsible for producing in Mexico the first Musical comedy Bells Are Ringing, directed by Luis de Llano Palmer. For this work, Pinal had an offer to work on Broadway with the manager of Judy Holliday, but Pinal refused to cut her career in Mexico.Pinal (1996), p. 133 In 1964 she made the Mexican version of the musical Irma La Douce, alongside Julio Alemán and directed by Enrique Rambal. José Luis Ibáñez will end up becoming her head theater director. Under the baton of Ibañez, Pinal starred in the work Vidas privadas. One of her most memorable works in musical comedy, was the Mexican version of Mame, successful Broadway musical, which thanks to her success, Pinal rode three times (1972, 1985 and 1989).

Reportedly, several encores of the piece was called for and Strauss felt moved to retitled the piece to suit his audience back in native Vienna. The new title 'Im Krapfenwald'l' alludes to the popular Krapfenwald area of the Wienerwald located in the scenic village of Grinzing and the heights of Cobenzl and Kahlenberg. The piece may also refer to the owner of the local tavern 'Krapfenwaldel', Franz Josef Krapf who opened his establishment at the same area. Eduard Strauss, who was responsible for performing many of his elder brother's works dating from his Russian tour first performed the work in Vienna at the Vienna Volksgarten on 24 June 1870 where it enjoyed greater admiration. The work which hints strongly at the Viennese Woods backdrop calls for bird whistles which adorn the polka. Strauss has the last laugh when he calls for one of these birdsong in the closing moments of this cheerful work before a rushed ending with percussions and a flourish. == References == Category:Polkas Category:Compositions by Johann Strauss II Category:Döbling Category:Vienna Woods ","title":"Im Krapfenwald'l"},{"id":"1277964","text":"Bellefonte may refer to: ;Places in the United States * Bellefonte, Alabama * Bellefonte, Arkansas * Bellefonte, Delaware * Bellefonte, Kentucky * Bellefonte, Pennsylvania ;Other * The Bellefonte Nuclear Generating Station in Hollywood, Alabama, United States * USCGC Bellefonte (WYP-373), a United States Coast Guard patrol vessel in commission from April to August 1944 which also was in commission in the United States Fish and Wildlife Service as the fisheries research ship RV Albatross III from 1948 to 1959 ==See also== *Bellefont, Kansas ","title":"Bellefonte"},{"id":"1277972","text":"Walter Hines Page (August 15, 1855 – December 21, 1918) was an American journalist, publisher, and diplomat. He was the United States ambassador to the United Kingdom during World War I. He founded the State Chronicle, a newspaper in Raleigh, North Carolina, and worked with other leaders to gain legislative approval for what is now known as North Carolina State University, which established as a land-grant college in 1885. He worked on several newspapers, including the New York World and Evening Post. He was the editor of The Atlantic Monthly for several years and also a literary adviser to Houghton Mifflin. For more than a decade starting in 1900, he was a partner of Doubleday, Page & Company, a major book publisher in New York City. ==Biography== Born in Cary, North Carolina to father Allison Francis \\"Frank\\" Page and his wife, Catherine Frances Raboteau. His father built the Page- Walker Hotel about 1868. Walter was educated at Trinity College (Duke University), then at Randolph-Macon College and Johns Hopkins University. His studies complete, he taught for a time in Louisville, Kentucky. On November 15, 1880, Page married Willa Alice Wilson. They had a daughter and three sons including Arthur W. Page. Page began his journalism career as a writer and then editor at the St. Joseph Gazette in Missouri. (The St. Joseph Gazette published in that town from 1845 until June 30, 1888, when its morning position was taken over by its sister paper, the St. Joseph News-Press.) After a short time at the Gazette, in 1881 Page resigned to travel through the South, having arranged to contribute letters on southern sociological conditions to the New York World, the Springfield Republican of Massachusetts, and the Boston Post. He intended these letters to educate both the North and the South in a fuller understanding of their mutual dependence. In 1882, he joined the editorial staff of the New York World; among his major work was a series of articles on Mormonism, the result of personal investigation in Utah. Later in 1882, Page went to Raleigh, North Carolina, where he founded the State Chronicle. Two years later, he was a founding member of the Watauga Club, along with Arthur Winslow and William Joseph Peele. Together, they petitioned the North Carolina General Assembly early in 1885 to create an institution for industrial education for \\"wood-work, mining, metallurgy, practical agriculture\\" and similar fields; establishing what is now North Carolina State University, a land-grant college, which could receive federal funds. Page returned to New York in 1883 and for four years was on the staff of the Evening Post. From 1887 to 1895, he was manager and, after 1890, editor of The Forum, a monthly magazine. From 1895 to 1900, he was literary adviser to Houghton, Mifflin and Company, and for most of the same period editor of The Atlantic Monthly (1896–99). From 1900 to 1913, Page was partner and vice president of Doubleday, Page & Co.; when he joined Frank Nelson Doubleday as a partner, the company's name was changed to include his. He also was editor of World's Work magazine. Doubleday, Page & Co. became one of the great book publishing companies of the 20th century. The company sometimes publishes under the name \\"Country Life Press\\" in Garden City, New York, where Page resided in the years prior to World War I. Among the great writers it published in its early years was Rudyard Kipling. In 1986, it was acquired by Bertelsmann AG. Page believed that a free and open education was fundamental to democracy. In 1902, he published The Rebuilding of Old Commonwealths, which emphasized that. He felt that nothing (class, economic means, race, or religion) should be a barrier to education. == Ambassador == Page's UK Ambassador nomination In March 1913, Page was appointed U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom by President Woodrow Wilson, whom Page had befriended in 1882 when Wilson was a young lawyer starting out in Atlanta. Page was one of the key figures involved in bringing the United States into World War I on the Allied side. A proud Southerner, he admired his British roots and believed that the United Kingdom was fighting a war for democracy. As ambassador to Britain, he defended British policies to Wilson and helped to shape a pro- Allied slant in the President and in the United States as a whole. One month after Page sent a message to Wilson, the U.S. Congress declared war on Germany. Page was criticized for his unabashedly pro-British stance by those who thought his priority should be defending American interests in the face of British criticism. He and his staff had to deal with the British claim of the right to stop and search American ships, including the examination of mail pouches; the commercial blockade (1915); and the \\"blacklist,\\" the names of American firms with whom the British forbade all financial and commercial dealings by their citizens (1916). In 1918, Page became ill and resigned his post as Ambassador to the Court of St. James's. He returned to his home in Pinehurst, North Carolina, where he died. He is buried in Old Bethesda Cemetery in Aberdeen, North Carolina. ==Legacy and honors== *A memorial plaque in his honor was installed in Westminster Abbey in Westminster, London, UK. *The Life and Letters of Walter H.

Strauss has amalgamated his late father's orchestra with his own in 1849 and with the new responsibility, was expected to rehearse, organise, compose, orchestrate, and lastly, conduct at two or three venues on the same day. During the hectic years of 1851 and 1852, Strauss exerted himself and after a tiring tour of Germany late 1852, he was taken seriously ill. Many of his engagements were forced to be cancelled although Strauss felt sufficiently well to appear at his benefit concert at the Sofienbad-Saal ballroom on January 16, 1853 along with his new waltz 'Phönix-Schwingen'. The title suggested a possible reference to himself, having like the mythical bird, 'risen from the ashes'. However, Strauss' interesting title may well refer to the unpopular Vienna transport enterprise 'Phoenix' which had promised faster and cheaper travel intending to rival the traditional Viennese 'fiaker'. The enterprise proved to be no more than a flash in the pan and foundered after a mere few days. Whether meaning the mythical creature or the enterprise, Strauss' work is very brisk and stylish, with rising arpeggios and effective motif usage.

He is also a former Chairman of the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. He has been active in UK politics, formerly as a member of the Conservative Party and since 2016 in the Liberal Democrats.Ad Lib, issue 29, September 2016, p. 19 He is Master of the Southdown and Eridge Hunt. ==Early life== Massow was born Ivan Field in Brighton, East Sussex. His relationships with his father and subsequently his stepfather were poor; as a boy he ended up being cared for by social services, before being adopted as a pre-teenager by John Massow. Commenting on his life prior to his adoption, Massow has stated that \\"My life up to then is a bit of a blur. I had four different families, my name changed from Field to Mitchell to Massow, I was moved around for various reasons.\\" Massow is dyslexic and left school at 16 with one O-level in metalwork, with possibly others in photography and history; however, information regarding his early qualifications is ambiguous, and Massow himself has commented that \\"I lied about them so much, I can't remember what's actually true.\\" He studied at Eastbourne for a BTEC in art and design, then moved to Bristol and was employed by an insurance firm. In 1990 Massow moved to London and started his own financial services business. ==Business career== ===Massow Financial Services=== In 1990 and with less than £5,000 Massow started Bowater Massow, later to become Massow Financial Services Ltd, running it initially from a squat in Kentish Town, London, using just a mobile phone. Massow specialised in offering financial services to gay people, in particular sourcing competitively priced insurance and mortgages for customers whose sexuality previously resulted in their being charged much higher premiums. Massow's company soon attracted customers and expanded; the success and high profile of the business resulted in Massow being voted Man of the Year by the Pink Paper in 1996, and by 1997 Massow had become a multi-millionaire. At the end of the decade his company had several offices, including branches in Edinburgh, Manchester and Liverpool, and was at the forefront of the 'gay finance' sector. At the end of 2000 Massow merged his company with another gay- orientated finance company, Rainbow Finance of Oxford, thereby creating Rainbow Massow, one of the largest independent financial advice firms in the UK. Massow took the role of chairman while Louis Letourneau, who had run Rainbow Finance, became managing director. The market value of the new company was £20m, and Massow predicted that turnover would rise from £2m per annum to over £3.5m. However, within one year the firm ran out of money and was placed in receivership. Both Massow and Letourneau blamed each other for the firm's demise. Massow bought the company back from the receiver for about £1.5m and subsequently re-established it. ===Jake=== In 2001 Massow set up Jake, an online social networking site for gay professionals. ===Allied Dunbar and Zurich=== Between 2003 and 2004 Massow was director of another financial adviser firm, this time a tied agent of the Zurich Advice Network (previously Allied Dunbar). Massow had previously campaigned against what he saw as Allied Dunbar's anti-gay underwriting practices, but he claimed that \\"they've moved on and, for the sake of my customers, so must I [...] if other gay financial advisers think they're doing the best for their customers by blackballing all the companies that were once out of line (there were about eight of them) when it came to gay issues – then their priorities are very strange. Financial advice is about getting the best product – not petty grudge bearing.\\" Massow accepted a transitional loan of £330,000 to enable office relocation and staff training. However the arrangement was short-lived and ironically ended after a dispute between Massow and Zurich over Zurich's approach to insuring the gay clients in which the firm specialised. A long £13m legal case followed which was settled out of court. ===Pay Me My=== In September 2011 Massow set up Pay Me My, a trading name of Massows Limited, which offered customers a rebate of 80% of the 'trail' commission paid to their existing advisers if the customer switched their insurance, pension and investment policies to the agency of Pay Me My, who would take 20% as their fee.Sam McDonald Massow's trail commission firm was 'doomed from the start' Money Marketing, 22 August 2013; Retrieved 28 August 2013 Massow defended the business model of the firm from suggestions that it would not be viable following changes to financial regulation in the UK due to start on 1 January 2013;Scott Sinclair, A Q&A; with Ivan Massow IFA Online, 9 September 2011; Retrieved 20 August 2013 Archived at WebCitation however, it ceased trading in August 2013 when the government banned commission rendering its services obsolete.Laura Miller, Ivan Massow's trail rebate firm goes out of business IFA Online, 20 August 2013; Archived at WebCitation The firm informed its clients that, should they choose to remain with the company, all future trail commissions would be retained and not rebated.Sam Macdonald, Ivan Massow firm to keep 100% of trail if clients don't move FundWeb, 21 August 2013; Retrieved 21 August 2013 Archived at WebCitation This action was unpopular with customers, therefore Massow agreed to sell the remaining assets under management to Clubfinance, who would continue rebating the majority of their commission. ===Others=== Other Massow businesses include Halos and Horns and Massows Angels. ==Contemporary art== In 1999, Massow became Chairman of the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. He was brought in by Director Philip Dodd to increase sponsorship and patronage for the organisation. Dodd claimed that Massow was a \\"mass of contradictions, just like the ICA. He's a risky choice for us, but the ICA should always live dangerously.\\" However the working relationship between Massow and Dodd subsequently proved to be not wholly successful, as Dodd increasingly disliked Massow's knack for self-promotion and perceived him to be taking over the role of being the organisation's public face. The situation deteriorated irreparably when in January 2002 Massow wrote an article in New Statesman magazine, attacking the predominance of conceptual art in the art world. He described modern concept art as \\"pretentious, self-indulgent, craftless tat\\" and \\"the product of over-indulged, middle-class [...], bloated egos who patronise real people with fake understanding\\". He called the ICA a \\"pillar of the shock establishment\\". He attacked Tracey Emin saying she \\"couldn't think her way out of a paper bag\\", though he admitted this comment was \\"a little below the belt\\". In February 2002, Massow resigned as Chairman of the ICA, after the board unanimously requested him to. Board member Ekow Eshun was quoted in The Guardian as saying \\"I have no problem with Ivan bringing up this debate. But Ivan has been ramping up the story all week. I think he's been a little bit of a pillock.\\" There was speculation that Massow had deliberately been as provocative as possible to engineer his own sacking. Massow claims he spoke out to redress the imbalance between the promotion of conceptual and more traditional art in the British art scene. His views have engendered strong feelings about him amongst the art world; a year after his resignation one artist commented that \\"they treat him like the Black Death round here\\", although Massow has received less vocal support from many artists who fear they will never achieve recognition unless they follow the conceptual route. Massow collects figurative contemporary art and claims that he visits art colleges and artists' studios regularly. In a 2003 interview he stated that \\"I visit at least one a week, quietly, on my own. It helps to see how people work. How they define themselves. I rarely buy from galleries.\\" Massow has had his portrait painted nearly 30 times, including a double nude diptych by Jonathan Yeo, son of Conservative MP Tim Yeo, and a portrait by Darren Coffield of Massow in full foxhunting attire, which was exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery. Massow has personally provided regular financial support for some artists, to assist them in their lives and work. ==Politics== Massow was first attracted to the politics of the Conservative Party when he was a boy. He joined his local Young Conservatives and at age 14 became its chairman, the youngest in the country at the time. In the 1990s Massow's flatmates were for a time former Conservative Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove, and MP and former head of Conservative policy Nicholas Boles, a situation Massow described as \\"Tory Friends\\". However Massow, along with many espousing \\"compassionate conservatism\\", was frustrated by the Party's apparent reluctance to alter its stance on gay rights issues and discrimination in general. In 2000, following John Bercow MP's resignation from the front bench and the defection of Shaun Woodward MP to Labour, Massow too left the Conservative Party to join the Labour Party, where he was welcomed by Mo Mowlam. However Massow later returned to the Conservatives, subsequently claiming that the brief defection to Labour had a particular motivation: \\"I knew if I switched it would be front page news. I thought it would help the party focus on repealing Section 28. I had one meeting with Labour, that's all. I never wanted to be a candidate.\\" Massow is pro-hunting and in 2003 was depicted in full hunting gear in a portrait by Darren Coffield, exhibited at the National Portrait gallery. Massow became head of the Conservative Technology Initiative for London in 2012. In November 2014, he became the first Conservative to declare their plan to seek the Conservative Party's candidacy to become Mayor of London at the 2016 elections. He was unsuccessful in his candidacy. He joined the Liberal Democrats in September 2016, in protest at the Conservative Party's post-Brexit vote stance. ==Media== In November 2005, Massow was the winning mentor on Channel 4's Make Me a Million. Massow produced the film Banksy's Coming For Dinner, starring Joan Collins. In 2013 Massow was a significant part of Derren Brown's The Great Art Robbery for Channel 4, in which Brown taught a group of old age pensioners how to get away with a robbery using various techniques such as how to stay unnoticed as well as controlling fear and nerves. The OAPs then embarked on a large-scale robbery, which involved stealing an expensive painting from Massow. The show first aired on 13 December 2013. In 2016 Massow featured in the Channel 4 documentary \\"Rich Brother, Poor Brother\\" along with his estranged younger brother David. The documentary contrasted Ivan's millionaire London lifestyle with that of David, a bohemian labourer who lives in a converted truck near Glastonbury. ==Charity work== Massow Financial Services was the first mainstream business to sponsor London's Gay Pride in 1990 which it continued to do in subsequent years. Massow has raised funds for charity and founded the April Bombing Appeal for victims of the April 1999 nail-bombings in Soho, Brixton and Brick Lane in London. Massow Financial Services collected donations for the appeal. In March 2010, in partnership with Oxfam and Beat That Quote, Massow developed Compare for Good, a charity fundraising price comparison website which promised to pay more than two-thirds of the money raised by the site to Oxfam.Compare For Good 7 February 2011; Retrieved from Internet Archive 28 August 2013 In March 2011 Beat That Quote was sold to Google.Beat That Quote 26 October 2011; Retrieved from Internet Archive 28 August 2013 ==Personal life== Massow is openly gay. He lives in Hoxton, in London's East End and enjoys horse riding and foxhunting. In the aftermath of the Zurich case, Massow moved to Spain. He began to drink heavily and became an alcoholic. However he has not drunk since 2008 and chaired an Alcoholics Anonymous group in Soho. In 2010 Massow developed an aneurysm and became seriously ill. He required urgent hospital treatment, including at one point having to be operated on without anaesthetic, which saved his life. Massow subsequently described the experience as uplifting, stating that \\"The prospect of dying wasn't frightening, as I'd thought, but calm and full of relief. And instead of thinking about a tomorrow that wouldn't come, I looked over my past 'life' and was actually quite proud and happy I'd acquitted myself OK. There was nothing to be ashamed of.\\" ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:LGBT businesspeople from the United Kingdom Category:People from Brighton Category:People from Hoxton Category:Gay politicians Category:LGBT politicians from England Category:Conservative Party (UK) people ","title":"Ivan Massow"},{"id":"1278003","text":"Rains Brook is a tributary of the River Leam.

Mozambique elects representatives at several levels: * at national level a head of state – the president - and a legislature. The president is elected for a five-year term by the people. The Assembly of the Republic (Assembleia da República) has 250 members, elected for a five-year term by proportional representation. * at provincial level, since 2009 Provincial Assemblies, elected at the same time that the national elections. * at local level, since 1998 Municipal Elections to elect the leaders of the growing number of municipalities: the President of the Municipal Council and Municipal Assemblies. ==Electoral commission law== Mozambican elections are run by a National Election Commission (CNE), and the election law has changed often. In December 2012, a new law in regards to the composition of the election commission consists of eight political party representatives: five appointed by the incumbent FRELIMO, two appointed by the principal opposition RENAMO and one by the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM). There are further three members nominated by civil society representatives, a judge appointed by the Higher Council of the Judicial Magistrature and an attorney appointed by the Higher Council of the Public Prosecutor's Office.http://allafrica.com/stories/201402210793.html ==1994 – Presidential and Parliamentary election== In the first multi-party elections held in Mozambique, in 1994, FRELIMO candidate and president of Mozambique since 1986 Joaquim Chissano was elected and the opposition party and former guerrilla group RENAMO acknowledged the result. The United Nations Security Council, which had a peacekeeping operation based there due to the civil war, endorsed the results as free and fair in Resolution 960. ==1999 – Presidential and Parliamentary election== In the elections in late 1999 President Joaquim Chissano from FRELIMO was re-elected with 52.3% of the vote, and FRELIMO secured 133 of 250 parliamentary seats. The main opposition parties candidate, RENAMO's Afonso Dhlakama, got 47.7% and the party won the remaining 117 parliamentary seats. ==2004 – Presidential and Parliamentary election== In the 1–2 December 2004 election Armando Guebuza, the new FRELIMO candidate, won with 63.7% of the votes, more than twice as many as RENAMO's candidate Afonso Dhlakama (31.7%). In the parliamentary election FRELIMO won 62% (1.8 million) of the votes, RENAMO 29.7% (905,000 votes), and 18 minor parties shared the remaining 8%. FRELIMO will hold 160 of the parliamentary seats, RENAMO 90. The elections have been criticized for not having been conducted in a fair and transparent manner by the National Electoral Commission. Several cases of electoral fraud have occurred and remained unsanctioned. This has been criticized among others by the European Union Election Observation Mission to Mozambique and the Carter Center. However, the elections shortcomings have probably not (also according to EU observers) affected the final result in the presidential election. The distribution of parliamentary seats among the parties will have been somewhat altered, though (RENAMO probably losing a number of seats to FRELIMO). On 2 February 2005 Guebuza was sworn in as president of the republic, but without Dhlakama and RENAMO's recognition and presence at the inauguration. RENAMO have, however, agreed to participate in the Parliament and the Council of State. ==2009 – Presidential and Parliamentary election== The Presidential and Parliamentary elections were held on 28 October 2009 for the fourth time since the introduction of the multiparty system. In the elections for the Assembly of the Republic, FRELIMO and RENAMO contested all 13 parliamentary constituencies, but the newly formed MDM was able to contest only 4 parliamentary constituencies. ==2014 – Presidential and Parliamentary election== The Presidential and Parliamentary elections were held on 15 October 2014 for the fifth time since the introduction of the multiparty system.

A member of the Centre Party, he served as Minister of Economic Affairs in Juha Sipilä's cabinet from 2015 until 2016, the European Commissioner for Enlargement from 2004 to 2010 and European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Euro from 2010 to 2014. ==Early life and education== Born in Mikkeli in Eastern Finland, Rehn studied economics, international relations, and journalism at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minnesota, in the United States. He gained a master's degree in political science from the University of Helsinki in 1989, and a D.Phil. from St. Antony's College, Oxford in 1996 on the subject of \\"Corporatism and Industrial Competitiveness in Small European States\\". In addition to his native Finnish and German he speaks English, French, Swedish, and some Russian, Polish and Hungarian. Rehn also played football for his hometown club Mikkelin Palloilijat in Finland's top division Mestaruussarja (now Veikkausliiga) in his youth. ==Finnish politics== He began his political career already in youth politics as a regular member of the Finnish Centre Youth and soon became the Secretary General of the Nordic Centre Youth. In 1987, he was elected as the president of the Finnish Centre Youth. That position can be seen as predicting high political responsibilities in Finnish politics.Vanhanen, Tatu. Vihreä Nuoriso, Nuoren Keskustan Liitto r.y., 1995, p. 104. In 1988 Rehn was elected as a city councillor in Helsinki. He was vice president of the Centre Party from 1988 to 1994, having been president of its youth wing from 1987. Elected to the Finnish Parliament in 1991, Rehn led the Finnish delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, and was a special adviser to the Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho from 1992 to 1993. He left the Finnish Parliament in 1995 to become an MEP, aligned to the liberal group. He was, however, not re-elected in the 1996 election. He was briefly the chairman of Veikkausliiga from 1996 to 1997. From 1998 to 2002 Rehn ran the office of Erkki Liikanen, Finland's representative on the Prodi Commission. Rehn would later succeed Liikanen in the role of Commissioner for Enterprise and Information Society. In 2002, he left European politics for the University of Helsinki, where he led the Centre for European Studies. In 2003, he became an adviser to the Prime Minister on economic policy, a position he held until his appointment to the European Commission the following year. ==European Commission== Rehn served briefly on the Prodi Commission. He was appointed European Commissioner for Enterprise and Information Society on 12 July 2004, taking over the role from the previous Finnish Commissioner Erkki Liikanen, who left his post the same day to become Governor of the Bank of Finland. The Finnish government nominated Rehn for the incoming Barroso Commission, which took office on 22 November 2004. He was the youngest member of the first Barroso Commission. Rehn's appointment to the enlargement post was seen as a slight disappointment for Finland, who had hoped for their nominee to be given a portfolio relating to economic issues. Enlargement was a central issue for the EU in the run-up to the landmark accession of ten countries on 1 May 2004, but has since declined in importance, if only slightly. Rehn presided over the accession of Bulgaria and Romania in 2007, as well as continuing negotiations with Croatia and opening them with Turkey, the latter being perhaps the most significant and the most hotly debated future accession. Rehn favours Turkish membership but has controversially suggested permanent restrictions on the free movement of workers from Turkey, \\"in case serious disturbances occur in the labour market within the EU as a result of Turkey’s accession\\", an attitude seen by some as running counter to the whole purpose and spirit of the EU.Speech in Istanbul on Turkish accession (full text ), 20 October 2004 He has stressed the importance of greater respect for human rights and civil liberties as preconditions for Turkey's entry, while acknowledging the advances it had already made in this respect. Siim Kallas was twice Acting Commissioner in his stead, from 19 April 2014 – 25 May 2014 while he was on electoral campaign leave for the 2014 elections to the European Parliament and from 1 July 2014 – 16 July 2014 after he took up his seat.KUNA – Barroso announces caretaker replacements following resignation of 4 EU Commissioners ===Selection hearing=== Questioned by the European Parliament, Rehn offered his thoughts on the prospects for accession of each of the countries highest on the enlargement agenda. He praised Turkey for the human rights advances it had made but said he would advocate stronger monitoring if the decision was taken to open accession talks by the European Council when it considered the question in December. Asked about free movement of Turkish labour after the country's accession, Rehn expressed the view that there should be \\"considerable transitional periods as well as a permanent safeguard clause\\". He was cautious on the question of the inevitability of Turkish membership, stating that he did not \\"believe in historic determinism\\", but that if negotiations were begun, \\"underpinned by the commitment that [Turkey] will be able to join [the EU] once it fulfils all conditions, it will join as soon as it does meet the conditions\\". He insisted that Bulgaria and Romania would be judged on their merits and that he would not hesitate to delay accession by a year if the EU's requirements were not met on time. He considered the establishment of a pre-accession strategy for the Western Balkans one of his prime tasks. ===European sovereign debt crisis=== In late June 2011, Rehn spoke out on austerity measures being considered by the Greek parliament, saying, \\"The only way to avoid immediate default is for parliament to endorse the revised economic program...The program includes both the medium-term fiscal strategy and the privatization program. They must be approved if the next tranche of financial assistance [a 12 billion euro aid payment] is to be released...To those who speculate about other options, let me say this clearly: there is no Plan B to avoid default\\". In May 2012, coincident with warnings from Mario Draghi of the ECB, Rehn said that even if Eurobonds \\"were ever approved, it would still not be sufficient to save the euro. The single currency’s members needed 'a genuine stability culture and a much upgraded common capacity to contain common contagion', if they wanted to avoid a disintegration of the eurozone and if they wanted it to survive\\". Rehn has continued to maintain that the only way out of the crisis is a continued programme of fiscal austerity. Economist Paul Krugman has been critical of this stance, saying in early 2013 that Olli Rehn, and the economic management of the European Commission, had been proven disastrously wrong in their predictions and management since the beginning of the crisis. He noted, \\"European leaders seem determined to learn nothing, which makes this more than a tragedy; it’s an outrage.\\" Krugman maintains that Rehn's focus on fiscal discipline is in fact an excuse to dismantle the social safety net and reduce the size of government, as he has criticized countries, such as France which have tried to achieve fiscal discipline through tax increases. In mid-2013, Rehn claimed that the European Commission was following a pragmatic policy balancing austerity policies with pro-growth policies and that much of the criticism was unfair. ==Member of the European Parliament, 2014–2015== Rehn was a candidate in the 2014 European election and was elected MEP. In the European Parliament he was elected to be one of the parliament's 14 vice presidents.Olli Rehn valittiin EU-parlamentin varapuhemieheksi, HS.fi, 1 July 2014, accessed 1 July 2014 ==Return to Finnish politics== ===Minister of Economic Affairs, 2015–2016=== In 2015, Rehn was elected in the Finnish parliamentary election with 6,837 votes. His term in the European Parliament ended on 27 April, when Rehn officially accepted the seat in the Finnish Parliament. On 29 May 2015, Rehn was appointed the Minister of Economic Affairs in Sipilä Cabinet. During his time in office, he oversaw the country's emergence from a three-year recession thanks to a combination of tax and spending cuts. He also played a key role in persuading labor unions to agree to pay cuts to restore competitiveness.Raine Tiessalo (14 October 2016), Austerity Fan Olli Rehn Appointed to Bank of Finland Board Bloomberg News. ===Bank of Finland, 2016–present=== On 14 October 2016, Rehn was selected to the Board of the Bank of Finland.

Most gray horses have black skin and dark eyes; unlike some equine dilution genes and some other genes that lead to depigmentation, gray does not affect skin or eye color. Gray horses may be born any base color, depending on other color genes present. White hairs begin to appear at or shortly after birth and become progressively more prevalent as the horse ages as white hairs become intermingled with hairs of other colors. Graying can occur at different rates—very quickly on one horse and very slowly on another. As adults, most gray horses eventually become completely white, though some retain intermixed light and dark hairs. The stages of graying vary widely. Some horses develop a dappled pattern for a period of time, others resemble a roan with more uniform intermixing of light and dark hairs. As they age, some gray horses, particularly those heterozygous for the gray gene, may develop pigmented speckles in addition to a white coat, a pattern colloquially called a “fleabitten gray.” Gray horses appear in many breeds, though the color is most commonly seen in breeds descended from Arabian ancestors. Some breeds that have large numbers of gray-colored horses include the Thoroughbred, the Arabian, the American Quarter Horse and the Welsh pony. Breeds with a very high prevalence of gray include the Percheron, the Andalusian, and the Lipizzaner. People who are unfamiliar with horses may refer to gray horses as \\"white\\". However, a gray horse whose hair coat is completely \\"white\\" will still have black skin (except under markings that were white at birth) and dark eyes. This is how to discern a gray horse from a white horse. White horses usually have pink skin and sometimes even have blue eyes. Young horses with hair coats consisting of a mixture of colored and gray or white hairs are sometimes confused with roan. Some horses that carry dilution genes may also be confused with white or gray. While gray is classified as a coat color by breed registries, genetically it may be more correct to call it a depigmentation pattern. It is a dominant allele, and thus a horse needs only one copy of the gray allele, that is, heterozygous, to be gray in color. A homozygous gray horse, one carrying two gray alleles, will always produce gray foals. ==Prevalence== Gray is common in many breeds. Today, about one horse in 10 carries the mutation for graying with age. The vast majority of Lipizzaners are gray, as are the majority of Andalusian horses. Many breeds of French draft horse such as the Percheron and Boulonnais are often gray as well. Gray is also found among Welsh Ponies, Thoroughbreds, and American Quarter Horses. All of these breeds have common ancestry in the Arabian horse. In particular, all gray Thoroughbreds descend from a horse named Alcock's Arabian, a gray born in 1700. The gray coat color makes up about 3% of Thoroughbreds. Gray also affects spotting patterns of pintos and leopard complex horses such as Appaloosas. Its effects wash out the contrast of the markings of these patterns, sometimes colloquially described as “ghosting.” ==Changes in the color of gray horses== mare with suckling foal. The mare has a white hair coat, but the underlying black skin still confirms that she is a gray and not white. The light hairs around the foal's muzzle and eyes indicate that it will gray like its mother. Not all foals show signs of graying this young. A gray foal may be born any color. However, bay, chestnut, or black base colors are most often seen. As the horse matures, it “grays out” as white hairs begin to replace the base or birth color. Usually white hairs are first seen by the muzzle, eyes and flanks, occasionally at birth, and usually by the age of one year. Over time, white hairs replace the birth color. The changing patterns of white and dark hairs have many informal names, such as “rose gray,” “salt and pepper,” “iron gray”, or “dapple gray.” As the horse ages, the coat continues to lighten, often to a pure white. Some horses develop pigmented reddish-brown speckles on an otherwise white hair coat. Such horses are often called “fleabitten gray”. Different breeds, and individuals within each breed, take differing amounts of time to gray out. Thus, graying cannot be used to approximate the age of a horse except in the broadest of terms: a very young horse will never have a white coat (unless it is a true white horse), while a horse in its teens usually is completely grayed out. One must also be careful not to confuse the small amount of gray hairs that may appear on some older horses in their late teens or twenties, which do not reflect the gray gene and never cause a complete graying of the horse. This change in hair color means that the same gray horse will appear to be a different color over time, sometimes resulting in a need to change the color noted on breed registry papers. Other times, people traveling with gray horses who have a pure white hair coat have encountered problems with non- horse-oriented officials such as police officers or border guards who are unclear about a horse who has papers saying it is \\"gray\\" when the horse in front of them appears white. To further complicate matters, the skin and eyes may be other colors if influenced by other factors such as white markings, certain white spotting patterns or dilution genes. { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width: 100%; clear: right;\\" + Gray color changes - ! scope=\\"col\\" width=15% Name ! scope=\\"col\\" width=10% Image ! scope=\\"col\\" width=75% Description - ! scope=\\"row\\" Foals  120px Horses in their first year begin to show a few white hairs as their foal coat sheds. Some foals show gray hairs around their eye, muzzle and other “soft” areas at birth, others do not show white hairs until they are almost yearlings. - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Young gray horses  200 px  An intermediate stage typically seen in young horses in the early stages of turning gray is when white hairs are mixed with the dark birth color. In horses born black or dark bay, the horse shows mostly black and white hairs intermingled on the body. This is sometimes called \\"salt and pepper,\\" \\"iron gray,\\" or \\"steel gray.\\" This is the most common intermediate form of gray, which can give a silvery look to the coat. A reddish tinge, called a “rose gray\\", describes this intermediate stage for a horse born a chestnut or bright bay. Young horses just starting to gray out are sometimes confused with roans, but a gray continues to lighten with age, while a roan does not. Roaning also causes fewer white hairs on the legs and head, giving the horse the appearance of dark points, which is usually not true of gray. - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Dapple gray  200px  Light and dark areas form a dappled pattern of dark rings with lighter hairs on the inside of the ring, scattered over the entire body of the animal. Not all grays dapple, and it is an intermediate stage, usually seen in young adult horses, often considered highly attractive. The horse will continue to become lighter. Dappled grays should not be confused with the slight dappling \\"bloom\\" seen on horses of other colors that are in excellent condition, as \\"bloom\\" dapples disappear should the horse lose condition. - ! scope=\\"row\\" Late stage graying 200px  As grays become lighter with age, a few areas, especially around the flanks and legs, retain some color - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Complete depigmentation  200px  Nearly all hairs are white. A horse at this stage may be done changing color, or may begin to develop fleabitten pigment. Gray horses with a completely white coat can be distinguished from a white horse by their underlying black skin, particularly around the eyes, muzzle, and genital area. - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Fleabitten gray  200px  Flea-bitten gray is a color consisting of a white hair coat with small pigmented speckles or \\"freckles\\". The flea-bitten pattern is seen primarily in heterozygous Grays. Most horses who become flea-bitten grays still go through a brief period when they are pure white. The amount of speckling varies between individuals and density of speckling may increase as the horse ages. Some horses may appear almost pure white, with only a few speckles observed on close examination. Others may have so many speckles that they are occasionally mistaken for a roan or even a type of sabino. - ! scope= \\"row\\"  Blood marks  200px One unique form of gray, genetically related to flea-bitten gray, are “blood marks” or a \\"bloody shouldered\\" horse. This is an animal that is so heavily pigmented on certain parts of the body, usually the shoulder area, that it appears as an irregular, almost solid pattern—as if blood had been spilled on the horse, hence the name. Blood marks can change size and shape as the horse ages. Arabian horse breeders claim the Bedouin people considered the \\"bloody shoulder\\" to be a prized trait in a war mare and much desired. } ==The genetics of gray== The gray gene (G) is an autosomal dominant gene. In simple terms, a horse which has even one copy of the gray allele, regardless of other coat color genes present, will always become gray. This also means that all gray horses must have at least one gray parent. If a gray horse is homozygous (GG), meaning that it has a gray allele from both parents, it will always produce gray offspring no matter the color genetics of the other parent. However, if a gray horse is heterozygous (Gg), meaning it inherits one copy of the recessive gene (g), that animal may produce offspring who are not gray, depending on the genetics of the other parent and Mendelian inheritance principles. Genetic testing is now possible to determine whether a horse is homozygous or heterozygous for gray.\\"Gray - Horse Coat Color DNA Testing.\\" Animal Genetics, Incorporated.' . web page accessed August 29, 2008 The gray gene does not affect skin or eye color, so grays typically have dark skin and eyes, as opposed to the unpigmented pink skin of white horses. In 2008, researchers at Uppsala University in Sweden identified the genetic mutation that governs the graying process. The study revealed that all gray horses carry an identical mutation that can be traced back to a common ancestor that lived at least two thousand years ago. The discovery that gray can be linked to a single animal provides an example of how humans have \\"cherry-picked\\" attractive mutations in domestic animals. Gray is controlled by a single dominant allele of a gene that regulates specific kinds of stem cells. Homozygous grays turn white faster, are more likely to develop melanomas, and are less prone to develop the \\"fleabitten\\" speckling than heterozygous grays. Researchers suggest the pigmented speckles of the “fleabitten” gray, as well as more intense reddish- brown colored areas called “blood” markings, may be caused by a loss or inactivation of the gray allele in some of the somatic cells as that would explain why the speckles are more common on heterozygous grays than homozygotes. ===Melanoma in gray horses=== The identification of the gray mutation is of great interest in of medical research since this mutation also enhances the risk for melanoma in horses: some studies have suggested as many as 80% of grays over 15 years of age have some form of melanoma. Growth rate depends on the type, and many are slow-growing, but over time, many develop into a malignant melanoma. The study of gray genetics has pointed to a molecular pathway that may lead to tumour development. Both STX17 and the neighboring NR4A3 gene are overexpressed in melanomas from gray horses, and those carrying a loss-of-function mutation in ASIP (agouti signaling protein) had a higher incidence of melanoma, implying that increased melanocortin-1 receptor signaling promotes melanoma development in Gray horses. Some studies indicate as many as 66% of melanomas become malignant, though other studies have found much lower rates, and in one case, zero. ==Horse coat colors sometimes confused with gray== ===White horses=== Gray horses are sometimes confused with dominant white horses Many people who are unfamiliar with horses refer to a gray horse as \\"white\\". However, most white horses have pink skin and some have blue eyes. A horse with dark skin and dark eyes under a white hair coat is gray. However, a gray horse with an underlying homozygous cream base coat color may be born with rosy-pink skin, blue eyes and near-white hair. In such cases, DNA testing may clarify the genetics of the horse. ===Roan=== ”Blue roan” horses such as these, may be confused with young grays Some grays in intermediate stages of graying may be confused with a roan or a rabicano. Some heavily fleabitten grays may also be confused with roans. However, roans are easily distinguishable from grays: roan consists of individual white hairs on a dark base coat, usually with the head and legs of the horse darker than the rest of the body. Rabicanos also have intermixed white hairs primarily on the body with a dark head. With gray horses, the head is often the first area to lighten, especially around the eyes and muzzle. Also, roans do not lighten with age, while grays always do. The varnish roan is another unusual coloration, sometimes seen in Appaloosa horses, that, like gray, can change with age, but unlike gray, the horse does not become progressively lighter until it is pure white. Varnish roans are created by the action of leopard complex within breeds such as the Appaloosa and are seldom seen elsewhere. ===Diluted colors=== Horse with both Blue dun and silver dapple dilution The dilution genes that create dun, cream, pearl, silver dapple and champagne coloring may occasionally result in confusion with gray. Some horses with a particular type of dun hair coat known as a \\"blue dun\\", grullo, or \\"mouse\\" dun appear to be a solid gray. However, this color is caused by the dun gene acting on a black base coat, and horses who are dun have all hairs the same color; there is no intermingling of white and dark hairs. Also, dun horses do not get lighter as they age. Horses that are a light cream color are also not grays. These are usually cremello, perlino or smoky cream horses, all colors produced by the action of the cream gene. However, if a gray parent passes on the gene, the hairs will turn white like any other gray. Another cream-colored dilution, the pearl gene or \\"barlink factor\\", may also create very light-coated horses. Similarly, the champagne gene can lighten coat color, often producing dappling or light colors that can be confused with gray. In spite of its name, the silver dapple gene has nothing to do with graying. It is a dilution gene that acts only on a black coat, diluting the coat to a dark brown and the mane to a flaxen shade. Horses that express the silver dapple gene (and do not have the gray gene) are born that color and it will not lighten. However, again, if one parent passes on the gray gene, the gray gene will again be dominant. ==Mythology== Throughout history, both gray and white horses have been mythologized. As part of its legendary dimension, the gray horse in myth has been depicted with seven heads (Uchaishravas) or eight feet (Sleipnir), sometimes in groups or singly. There are also mythological tales of divinatory gray horses who prophesy or warn of danger. ==See also== *Albinism *Equine coat color *Equine coat color genetics ==Notes== ==References== *\\"Introduction to Coat Color Genetics\\" from Veterinary Genetics Laboratory, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis.

Watt's linkage (also known as the parallel linkage) is a type of mechanical linkage invented by James Watt in which the central moving point of the linkage is constrained to travel on a nearly straight line. It was described in Watt's patent specification of 1784 for the Watt steam engine. Today it is used in automobile suspensions, allowing the axle of a vehicle to travel vertically while preventing sideways motion. ==Description== Watt's linkage consists of three bars, bolted together, in a chain. The chain of bars, consists of two end bars, and a middle bar. The middle bar is bolted at each of its ends to one of the ends of each outer bar. The two outer bars are of equal length, and are longer than the middle bar. The three bars can pivot around the two bolts. The outer endpoints of the long bars are fixed in place relative to each other, but otherwise the three bars are free to pivot around the two joints where they meet. In linkage analysis there is an imaginary fixed-length bar connecting between the outer endpoints. Thus Watt's linkage is an example of a four-bar linkage. ==History== Figure 9 from James Watt's patent application (top left part) showing the straightline linkage The idea of its genesis using links is contained in a letter Watt wrote to Matthew Boulton in June 1784. This type of linkage is one of several types described in Watt's 28 April 1784 patent specification. However, in his letter to Boulton he was actually describing a development of the linkage which was not included in the patent. The slightly later design, called a parallel motion linkage, led to a more convenient space-saving design which was actually used in his reciprocating, and his rotary, beam engines.. Also available at https://www.gutenberg.org/files/27106/27106-h/27106-h.htm The context of Watt's innovation has been described by C. G. Gibson: :During the Industrial Revolution, mechanisms for converting rotary into linear motion were widely adopted in industrial and mining machinery, locomotives and metering devices. Such devices had to combine engineering simplicity with a high degree of accuracy, and the ability to operate at speed for lengthy periods. For many purposes approximate linear motion is an acceptable substitute for exact linear motion. Perhaps the best known example is the Watt four bar linkage, invented by the Scottish engineer James Watt in 1784.C. G. Gibson (1998) Elementary Geometry of Algebraic Curves, pp 12, 13, Cambridge University Press ==Shape traced by the linkage== This linkage does not generate a true straight line motion, and indeed Watt did not claim it did so. Rather, it traces out Watt's curve, a lemniscate or figure eight shaped curve; when the lengths of its bars and its base are chosen to form a crossed square, it traces the lemniscate of Bernoulli.. In a letter to Boulton on 11 September 1784 Watt describes the linkage as follows. Although the Peaucellier–Lipkin linkage, Hart's inversor, and other straight line mechanisms generate true straight- line motion, Watt's linkage has the advantage of much greater simplicity than these other linkages. It is similar in this respect to the Chebyshev linkage, a different linkage that produces approximate straight-line motion; however, in the case of Watt's linkage, the motion is perpendicular to the line between its two endpoints, whereas in the Chebyshev linkage the motion is parallel to this line. ==Applications== ===Double-acting piston=== The earlier single- action beam engines used a chain to connect the piston to the beam and this worked satisfactorily for pumping water from mines, etc. However, for rotary motion a linkage that works both in compression and tension provides a better design and allows a double-acting cylinder to be used. Such an engine incorporates a piston acted upon by steam alternately on the two sides, hence doubling its power. The linkage actually used by Watt (also invented by him) in his later rotary beam engines was called the parallel motion linkage, a development of \\"Watt's linkage\\", but using the same principle. The piston of the engine is attached to the central point of the linkage, allowing it to act on the two outer beams of the linkage both by pushing and by pulling. The nearly linear motion of the linkage allows this type of engine to use a rigid connection to the piston without causing the piston to bind in its containing cylinder. This configuration also results in a smoother motion of the beam than the single-action engine, making it easier to convert its back-and-forth motion into rotation. An example of Watt's linkage can be found on the high and intermediate pressure piston rod of the 1865 Crossness engines. In these engines, the low pressure piston rod uses the more conventional parallel motion linkage, but the high and intermediate pressure rod does not connect to the end of the beam so there is no requirement to save space. ===Vehicle suspension=== Watt's linkage automobile suspension Watt's linkage in a 1998 Ford Ranger EV suspension Watt's linkage train suspension Watt's linkage is used in the rear axle of some car suspensions as an improvement over the Panhard rod, which was designed in the early twentieth century. Both methods are intended to prevent relative sideways motion between the axle and body of the car. Watt’s linkage approximates a vertical straight-line motion much more closely, and it does so while consistently locating the centre of the axle at the vehicle's longitudinal centreline, rather than toward one side of the vehicle as would be the case if a simple Panhard rod were used.. It consists of two horizontal rods of equal length mounted at each side of the chassis. In between these two rods, a short vertical bar is connected. The center of this short vertical rod – the point which is constrained in a straight line motion - is mounted to the center of the axle. All pivoting points are free to rotate in a vertical plane. In a way, Watt’s linkage can be seen as two Panhard rods mounted opposite each other. In Watt’s arrangement, however, the opposing curved movements introduced by the pivoting Panhard rods largely balance each other in the short vertical rotating bar. The linkage can be inverted, in which case the centre P is attached to the body, and L1 and L3 mount to the axle. This reduces the unsprung mass and changes the kinematics slightly. This arrangement was used on Australian V8 Supercars until the end of the 2012 season. Watt's linkage can also be used to prevent axle movement in the longitudinal direction of the car. This application involves two Watt's linkages on each side of the axle, mounted parallel to the driving direction, but just a single 4-bar linkage is more common in racing suspension systems ==See also == * Parallel motion == References == == External links == * Watt Beam Engine * How to draw a straight line, by A.B.

One of the founders of Shas,Deri ‘uses the rabbis,’ has ‘complete influence over them’ says Shas MK Nissim Ze’ev The Jerusalem Post, 1 February 2015 he served as Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem between 1983 and 1998, and as a member of Knesset from 1999 until 2015. ==Biography== Ze'ev was born and resides in Jerusalem. He is married, and has a large family. He is a graduate of Porat Yosef Yeshiva, and was ordained to the Rabbinate. He has served as a Rabbi, Shochet, Mohel, and Chazzan in Israel and abroad. He began his Torah activities in his youth when, in 1968, he established Torah youth clubs named \\"Irgun Yeladim Lomdei Torah\\" (Association of Children Who Study Torah). They were established in memory of the IDF soldiers who died when the INS Eilat was lost in 1967. Hundreds of students participated in this club in the afternoon studying \\"Ta'amei Hamikra\\" (Torah incantations), Psalms, Jewish Law, and Jewish Legend. In 1971, Ze'ev served as a rabbi and shochet in the Ein HaEmek moshav. Three years later, he was sent abroad as a shochet and inspector on behalf of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel. He would ultimately spend five years away from Israel, going to Mexico City in 1977, to help establish the Aram Tzova Kollel, then to the \\"Sephardic Jewish Center\\" in Brooklyn, New York, where he served as rabbi and chazzan. In 1979, he returned to Israel to establish the \\"Nevat Israel\\" Institutes for Sephardic Jewish girls - ranging from kindergarten, to elementary schools, to high schools, and to a teaching seminary to train teachers and kindergarten teachers. ===Political career=== In the summer of 1983, he established a non-profit organization called the \\"Sephardic Association of Torah Observers\\", and served as its chairman. In addition to educational, cultural, and charitable activities, the association was involved in the selection of representatives to appear as a political list for the elections for local municipalities and the Knesset. The first meeting of the association convened shortly thereafter in the Yesodei Torah Yeshiva in Jerusalem. Participants included the president of the Torah Elders Council, Chief Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, as well as Rabbi Shalom Cohen, Rabbi Yehuda Tzadka (Head of the Porat Yoseph Yeshiva), and Rabbi Shabtai Aton. With their blessings, the Shas party ran for the first time for the local elections in Jerusalem, with Ze'ev at its head, and succeeded in winning three seats. Between 1983 and 1998, Ze'ev served as deputy mayor of Jerusalem in charge of the Welfare Department, as well as chairman of the Allotments of Land for Public Institutes and chairman of the Exemption Committee for Arnona. In 1999, Ze'ev was elected to the Knesset on the Shas list, and was re-elected in 2003, 2006, 2009, and 2013. During his time in the Knesset, he served as a member of the Knesset Committee, the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, the Constitution, Law, and Justice Committee, and the Committee on Interior Affairs. In the 17th Knesset (2006–2009), he served as chairman of the Knesset Committee on the War Against Drugs and Alcohol, coordinating with all the relevant agencies and holding many meetings which led to a body of legislation to fight drug and alcohol abuse. He was not included in the Shas list for the 2015 elections after being removed from the list by Shas leader Aryeh Deri.Shas founder MK Nissim Ze'ev: Rabbi Ovadia Yosef didn't want Deri, period The Jerusalem Post, 26 February 2015 ==Views== Ze'ev is known for his strong opposition to the evacuation of Jews from Israeli settlements. To advance this cause, he established the Knesset Caucus for Israel, Judaism, and Global Ethics, and presented legislative proposals to prevent the evacuation of settlers against their will. Among the other laws initiated by him are the Law to Increase Child Allotments, the Law to Punish Terrorists, the Abortion Law, the Incitement Law, and the Law to Recognize the Rights of Jewish Refugees from Arab Lands. In June 2007, he compared homosexuals to drug addicts, and suggested that rehabilitation centers be set up for them throughout Israel, saying: \\"The government should initiate this; these people are unfortunate, and we must keep an eye on them to assist them...

From archaeological excavations, it is known that the area was settled late in the Roman conquest of the Iberian Peninsula (due to its distance from coastal and North-South accesses). From local toponomy, the permanence of Germanic tribes is evident; names such as Sá, Saril, Alvarenga, Burgo, Escariz, Friães and Melareses, are examples of this influence. Following Moorish invasion more information began to be recorded in this region. Christian settlements that existed within the area were abandoned during this time, and moved to other northern access points. These settlements later returned following the Reconquista, when instability in the region disappeared. The history of Arouca, therefore, only became available with the founding and growth of the Monastery of Arouca, culminating in the religious life of D. Mafalda, daughter of the second King, D. Sancho I. It was this monastery, which for many centuries, that the populace of the region depended. The monastery was erected in the 10th century, in the invocation of Saint Peter, by two noblemen: Loderigo and Vandilo, from Moldes. The primitive building was nothing more than a simple dwelling, supporting a complement of monks and nuns. The centre of Arouca, with the Chapel of Misericórdia A symbol of the Christian influence in the region: the Alminhas do Calvário By the 12th century, D. Toda Viegas and his family became principal patrons of the monastery, resulting in a growth of wealth and prestige. D. Afonso Henriques, even before national independence, conceded the Viegas and the monastery's monks various privileges and donations. They received various charters between 1132 and 1143. In the first years of the 13th century, the monastery of Arouca passed into the hands of the Crown, and D. Sancho I left the complex in his testament to his daughter D. Mafalda. She entered monastic life between 1217 and 1220. Her presence resulted in a period of splendor and importance, not merely for her presence, but also her material wealth, which she brought into monastic service. By this time, the monastery was a sanctuary for nuns, and the principal economic center of the Arouca valley. Following the death of D. Mafalda, in 1256, the prestige of the monastery continued, carried on by here former support, memory, religious and cult. She was beatified in 1792 and her remains placed in an urn, executed in ebony, crystal, silver and bronze in one of the wings of the monastery's church (where her body was later moved in 1793). The municipality of Arouca evolved from a long process over the centuries, inheriting civil parishes and integrating municipalities from the 19th century. The municipality of Vila Meã do Burgo originated the parish of Burgo, which was annexed by Arouca in 1817. With the extinction of the municipalities of Alvarenga (1836) and Fermêdo (1855) many of the former parishes were integrated into Arouca: the parishes of Santa Cruz de Alvarenga, Canelas, Janarde and Espiunca were folded in from Alvarenga and the parishes of São Miguel do Mato, Fermêdo, Escariz and Mansores were annexed from Fermêdo. The parish of Covêlo de Paivó, which belong to the municipality of São Pedro do Sul, was annexed in 1917. The historical centre of Arouca, which included many the current parishes was constituted by the seats of São Bartolomeu (in 1846 the parishes of São Bartolomeu de Arouca and Santo Estêvão de Moldes), Cabreiros, Albergaria da Serra, part of São Salvador do Burgo, Santa Eulália, São Miguel de Urrô, Várzea, Rossas, Santa Marinha de Tropêço and Chave. ==Geography== ===Physical geography=== The rural village of Tebilhão in the terraced foothills of Arouca The Arouca is a fertile valley, almost entirely enclosed with a mountainous plateau, with only the western edge open to the rest of the country. To the north is the Serra do Gamarão, to the east the conic mountain of Mó and the Serra da Freita ao Sul.,Abel Botelho (1883) and to the south is the ridge of Montemuro (the highest point in the municipality). Here is situated the Pedra Posta, at approximately , relatively close to the Noninha. The existence of tungsten mines in this region, has historical attracted foreign mineral exploration companies. In the towns of Rio de Frades (parish of Cabreiros) and Regoufe (parish of Covêlo de Paivó), until the end of the Second World War, there functioned both English and German mining companies, that continued their mining operations (although at less intense levels) until the 1960s. The ruins of these mines and numerous pits are visible in the parishes of Alvarenga and Janarde, a testament the authentic \\"gold fever\\" associated with the mining industry here. ===Biome=== In addition to the geological richness of the region is the extraordinary biological diversity.

The waltz melodies are drawn from his operetta Eine Nacht in Venedig (A Night in Venice) which was a fiasco when premiered in Berlin on 3 October 1883. The waltz's primary melody was from the Act 3 song by the character Duke of Urbino. The Berlin production incorporated many outrageously silly lyrics during this waltz song where the singer has to sing the embarrassing 'Nacht sind die Katzen ja grau, nachts tönt es zärtlich Miau!' (At night, the cats are grey, at night \\"meow\\" they tenderly say!'). Without further ado, for the hurried Vienna premiere, the tempo was reduced and the words were replaced with the more agreeable 'Ach, wie so herrlich zu schaun, sind all' die lieblichen Frau'n!'

Though air traffic was not heavy at LAX, as Flight 1493 was on final approach the local controller was distracted by a series of abnormalities, including a misplaced flight progress strip and an aircraft that had inadvertently switched off the tower frequency. The SkyWest flight was told to taxi into takeoff position while the USAir flight was landing on the same runway. Upon landing, the 737 collided with the twin-engine turboprop, continued down the runway with the turboprop crushed beneath it, exited the runway, and caught fire. All 12 people aboard the smaller plane were killed, as well as an eventual total of 23 out of the 89 occupants of the Boeing. Rescue workers were on the scene of the fire within minutes and began the evacuation of the plane. Because of the intense fire, three of the 737's six exits could not be used. Neither of the front exits was usable, which caused the front passengers to try to use the overwing exits. However, only one of the overwing exits was usable, which caused a backlog to form. Most of those who died aboard the 737 succumbed to asphyxiation in the post-crash fire. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that the probable cause of the accident was the procedures in use at the LAX control tower, which provided inadequate redundancy, leading to a loss of situational awareness by the local controller, and inadequate oversight of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for failing to supervise the control tower managers. The crash led directly to the NTSB's recommendation of using different runways for takeoffs and landings at LAX. ==Accident details== ===Aircraft and crew=== USAir Flight 1493 was a scheduled service from Syracuse, New York making stops at Washington, D.C., Columbus, Ohio, and Los Angeles (LAX), before continuing to San Francisco. On February 1, 1991, Flight 1493 was operated using a Boeing 737-300 (registration '); after a crew change in Washington, it was under the command of Captain Colin Shaw, 48, a highly experienced pilot with approximately 16,300 total flight hours (including more than 4,300 hours on the Boeing 737), and First Officer David Kelly, 32, who had approximately 4,300 total flight hours, with 982 hours on the Boeing 737. Flying into LAX, the aircraft had a total of 89 people on board (83 passengers, 4 flight attendants, and the 2 pilots). On February 1, 1991, SkyWest Airlines Flight 5569 was operated using a twin- engine Fairchild Metroliner (registration '). The flight was scheduled to depart LAX on the final leg of a multi-city schedule, and was bound for Palmdale, California with 10 passengers and 2 pilots aboard. Both of Flight 5569's pilots had significant experience; Captain Andrew Lucas, 32, had approximately 8,800 flight hours (with 2,101 of them on the Metroliner), and First Officer Frank Prentice, 45, had approximately 8,000 flight hours, including 1,363 hours on the Metroliner. ===Airport=== LAX consists of four parallel runways, with the two runways and associated taxiways north of the terminal called the North Complex. Aircraft that landed on the outer runway – 24R – would cross the inner runway – 24L – in order to reach the terminal. ===Flight=== Diagram showing movement of the aircraft involved in the accident. Skywest 5569 was cleared by an Air Traffic Controller in the LAX tower (the 'local controller') to taxi to Runway 24L, moving from gate 32 to the runway via taxiways Kilo, 48, Tango, and 45. The plane was briefly not visible from the tower on taxiway 48 between Kilo and Tango in the area known as no man's land. Immediately prior to SkyWest 5569 reaching runway 24L, a Wings West aircraft had landed on 24R and was awaiting permission to cross 24L and taxi to the terminal. The local controller attempted to cross the Wings West aircraft but the crew had changed frequencies and did not answer, distracting the local controller as she attempted to reestablish communications. Shortly after 6 PM local time, as USAir 1493 was on final approach to LAX, the Metroliner was cleared by the local controller to taxi into its takeoff position on 24L at the intersection of taxiway 45, some up from the runway threshold.Kilroy, Chris. AirDisaster.Com: Special Report: USAir Flight 1493 . Retrieved on December 16, 2009. After four attempts by the local controller, the Wings West aircraft finally responded to the tower and apologized for switching frequencies. The local controller then cleared the USAir flight to land on 24L, even though the SkyWest Metroliner was still holding in takeoff position on the runway. With this activity ongoing, another Wings West aircraft, a Metroliner similar to SkyWest 5569, called the tower reporting they were ready for takeoff. The same local controller queried this aircraft about their position, and they told her they were holding on a taxiway short of 24L. The flight progress strip for this flight had not yet been given to the local controller by the clearance delivery controller (another distraction), and the local controller mistakenly thought this Metroliner was SkyWest 5569 and thus the runway was clear of aircraft. The first officer of the USAir flight recalled hearing this conversation but did not remember anyone being cleared to hold on the runway. The USAir plane touched down near the runway threshold. Just as the nose was being lowered, the first officer noticed SkyWest 5569 on the runway and applied maximum braking, but it was too late. The USAir plane slammed into the Metroliner, crushing it beneath its fuselage. The 737 proceeded to skid down the runway, then veered off the left side and came to rest on the far side of the taxiway against a closed fire station building where it eventually caught fire. Large debris from the Metroliner – including its tail, wings, and right engine – were found on the runway and between the runway and the abandoned fire station. The accident was witnessed from a plane carrying the Vancouver Canucks, who were arriving for an NHL hockey game against the Los Angeles Kings. The captain of that charter aircraft, having just landed, powered up the engines to get away from the fireball of the accident. The team was unsure if the USAir 737 was going to stop before it collided with their plane. The Canucks were shaken by the experience and lost to the Kings by a score of 9–1, their worst loss of the 1990–91 season. ==Fatalities and injuries== Seating chart of US Airways Flight 1493 from the NTSB, revealing locations of passengers, lack of injury, the severity of injuries, and deaths. The 35 dead included all 12 people (10 passengers and both crew members) on SkyWest 5569, and 23 of the 89 aboard the USAir 1493 (21 passengers, Captain Shaw, and one flight attendant). Two of the USAir fatalities were passengers who initially survived the crash, but died from burn injuries 3 and 31 days after the crash. Captain Shaw was killed when the nose of the aircraft struck the abandoned fire station, crushing the section of the cockpit where his seat was located. Of the remaining passengers and crew aboard USAir 1493, 2 crew members and 10 passengers sustained serious injuries, 2 crew members and 15 passengers sustained minor injuries, and 37 passengers received no injuries. Billionaire businessman David H. Koch was among the survivors. The majority of fatalities aboard USAir 1493 occurred to those seated in the front of the plane, where the post-crash fire originated in the forward cargo hold, fed by a combination of fuel from the wreckage of SkyWest 5569 and gaseous oxygen from the 737's damaged crew oxygen system. Everyone seated in row 6 or forward was either killed or sustained major injuries, while everyone aft of row 17 escaped, some with minor injuries. Only two passengers and one crew member managed to escape from the forward service (R1) door, while the main cabin (L1) door was inoperable due to damage. Only two passengers used the left over-wing exit before the fire became too intense outside the aircraft. The majority of the survivors exited via the right over-wing exit, with the rest of the surviving cabin occupants escaping through the rear service (R2) door. The rear passenger (L2) door was briefly opened during the course of the accident but was quickly closed due to the spreading fire on that side of the aircraft. Multiple issues slowed the evacuation from the right over-wing door, including a passenger seated in the exit row who could not open the door, a brief scuffle between two men at the exit, and the seatback of the exit window seat being folded forward, partially obstructing the exit. From the location of the bodies, only two victims on USAir 1493 were found in their seats, while authorities believe that 17 had unbuckled their seat belts and died from smoke inhalation while making their way to the exits. According to James Burnett, who headed the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation team, \\"I can't think of a recent accident where this many people have been up and out of their seats and didn't make it out.\\" The captain was one of the few people who died of blunt force trauma, a blow to the head when the bulkhead collapsed as the aircraft collided with the firehouse. The first officer was rescued through the cockpit windows by some of the first firefighters to arrive on the accident scene. ==Investigation== First Officer David Kelly, who was flying the USAir 1493 during the accident leg, reported that he did not see SkyWest 5569 until he lowered the nose of his aircraft onto the runway after landing. Kelly also said that he applied the brakes, but did not have enough time for evasive action. Statements made by passengers who survived the crash were consistent with this testimony.\\"LAX Runway Collision\\". Retrieved on December 16, 2009. The local controller who cleared both aircraft to use the same runway, Robin Lee Wascher, testified before the NTSB and accepted blame for causing the crash. She said she originally thought the landing USAir plane had been hit by a bomb, then \\"realized something went wrong... I went to the supervisor and I said, 'I think this (the SkyWest plane) is what USAir hit.'\\" She testified that rooftop lights in her line of sight caused glare in the tower, making it difficult to see small planes at the intersection where the SkyWest plane was positioned. Just before the accident, she confused the Skywest plane with another commuter airliner that was on a taxiway near the end of the runway. Making matters more difficult, the ground radar at LAX was not working on the day of the accident. The NTSB's investigation of the crash revealed that the cockpit crew of the landing USAir jet could not see the commuter plane, which blended in with other airport lights. The NTSB cited LAX's procedures which placed much of the responsibility for runways on the local controllers, which directly led to the loss of situational awareness by the local controller. The NTSB also noted that during the previous performance review a supervisor had noted four deficiencies in the local controller who ultimately worked the accident aircraft. These deficiencies were not addressed prior to the accident, and two of the deficiencies were apparent in the accident sequence—her loss of situational awareness and aircraft misidentification. The NTSB's investigation of the crash revealed a failing system in the air and ground traffic control facilities at LAX: the ground radar system worked intermittently, and was not functioning at the time of the incident; the blind spot, from the control tower, when looking at the spot where SkyWest 5569 was waiting on the runway; the system for ground controllers in the tower to pass flight progress strips to the local controller did not support the local controller's workload; aircraft on runways were not required to turn on all their external lights until rolling for takeoff. All these issues were rectified at LAX following this incident. At the time of the accident, air traffic controllers at LAX used all four runways (North Complex runways 24L and 24R, South Complex runways 25L and 25R) for mixed takeoffs and landings. One of the NTSB recommendations was that the runways be segregated with only landings or departures taking place on an individual runway. This recommendation was implemented, but not until after another incident, when on August 19, 2004, a Boeing 747 landing on 24L passed only above a 737 holding on the same runway. == Aftermath == LAX now prioritizes the use of the outboard runways (24R and 25L) for landings and the inboard runways (24L and 25R) for takeoffs, though mixed operations may occur in certain situations. Additionally, a new control tower was built at LAX, in a more central location, significantly taller and with a better vantage point, allowing visibility of all runways and critical taxiways at the airport. Before this accident, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a ruling that required airlines to upgrade the flammability standards of materials on board, but the USAir plane had been built before the effective date of those requirements and had not yet been modernized. It was scheduled to be upgraded within the next year. By 2009, all aircraft operating in the United States were compliant. == Dramatization == The story of the disaster was featured in a ninth-season episode of the Discovery Channel Canada / National Geographic series Mayday. The episode, titled Cleared for Disaster, explores the events surrounding the crash and its investigation, including interviews with NTSB investigators, first responders, survivors, and witnesses. == See also == * Tenerife airport disaster – in 1977, the deadliest runway incursion in history, involving two 747s in dense fog * Madrid runway disaster – a 1983 fatal runway incursion involving a DC-9 and a 727 * 1990 Wayne County Airport runway collision – a 1990 fatal runway incursion involving both a DC-9 and a 727 * Linate Airport disaster - a 2001 fatal runway incursion involving an MD-87 and a Cessna Citation CJ2 ==Footnotes== == References == == External links == * Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the United States in 1991 Category:Aviation accidents and incidents caused by air traffic controller error Category:Airliner accidents and incidents involving ground collisions 1493 Category:History of Los Angeles Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Boeing 737 Classic Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner Category:Airliner accidents and incidents in California Category:Los Angeles International Airport Category:1991 in California Category:February 1991 events in the United States ","title":"Los Angeles runway disaster"},{"id":"1278065","text":"Jacmel, () is a commune in southern Haiti founded by the Spanish in 1504 and repopulated by the French in 1698. It is the capital of the department of Sud- Est and has an estimated population of 40,000, while the commune of Jacmel had a population of 137,966 at the 2003 Census. The town's name is derived from its indigenous Taíno name of Yaquimel. In 1925, Jacmel was dubbed as the \\"City of Light,\\" becoming the first in the Caribbean to have electricity. The city is known for its well-preserved French colonial architecture that dates back from the early nineteenth century and has little changed. The town has been tentatively accepted as a World Heritage site. It sustained damage in the 2010 Haiti earthquake. ==History== The town was founded by the Compagnie de Saint- Domingue in 1698 as the capital of the southeastern part of the French colony Saint-Domingue. The area now called Jacmel was Taíno territory, part of the Xaragua chiefdom ruled by cacique Bohechio. With the arrival of the French, and the later establishment of the town, the French renamed Yaquimel as Jacmel. The city was developed to boost sugar production and trade, but soon it evolved into a coffee trading centre. In 1896 it suffered a major fire that destroyed most of the buildings in the city. The city was rebuilt, often using prefabricated cast-iron pillars and balconies shipped from France. Many ornate mansions of wealthy coffee merchants from this time have been preserved up to this day without much change and the whole central part of the city has changed little over the last 100 years. The mansions of Jacmel, with their cast-iron pillars and balconies, would later influence the homes in much of New Orleans. Today, many of these homes are now artisan shops that sell vibrant handicrafts, papier-mâché masks, and carved-wood animal figures. In recent years, efforts have been made to revitalize the once flourishing cigar and coffee industries. The town is a popular tourist destination in Haiti due to its relative tranquility and distance from the political turmoil that plagues Port-au-Prince. Over the years, this rather small town experienced a number of noted historical events. Some of these occurrences are: ===Haitian Revolution and War of Knives=== In 1791 and 1792, Romaine-la-Prophétesse led thirteen thousand rebels in besieging, occupying, and later burning Jacmel, and taking weapons and supplies from (and then burning) surrounding plantations from Marigot, about 25 kilometers east of Jacmel, to Bainet, about 45 kilometers west of it, freeing their slaves.Terry Rey, The Priest and the Prophetess: Abbé Ouvière, Romaine Rivière, and the Revolutionary Atlantic World (2017), pp. 14, 32-35, 48-49. Toussaint Louverture fought over Jacmel in the so-called War of Knives between him and his fellow countryman André Rigaud, who wished to maintain authority over the city. This war began in June 1799. By November the rebels were pushed back to this strategic southern port, the defence of which was commanded by Alexandre Pétion. Jacmel fell to Toussaint's troops in February 1800, during which the American warship USS General Greene bombarded the city, after which the rebellion was effectively over. Pétion and other mulatto leaders subsequently went into exile in France. ===Creation of the Gran Colombia flag=== A Venezuelan predecessor of Simón Bolívar in the liberation struggle against colonialism in Venezuelan and much of Spanish-ruled South America, Francisco de Miranda created the first flag of Gran Colombia near Jacmel, which served as the national flag of the First Republic of Venezuela. Anchored in the Bay of Jacmel (Baie de Jacmel), he first raised the flag on March 12, 1806, on the corvette Leander. This day is still celebrated as Venezuelan Flag Day. The general design of the Gran Colombian flag served as the model for the current flags of Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador, which emerged as independent nations at the breakup of Gran Colombia in 1830. This flag is often referred to as the \\"bandera madre\\" (mother flag) due to its role as inspiration and resemblance to the flags of Colombia and Ecuador. ===Ramón Emeterio Betances=== Puerto Rican pro- independence leader Ramón Emeterio Betances spent a short interval in Jacmel in 1870, from where he gathered support for an uprising in the Dominican Republic, seeking to install a liberal government there. Then-president of Haiti, Nissage Saget supported Betances's ideals of a pan-Antillean union, and gave the uprising his support. ===Modern Jacmel prior to the 12 January 2010 earthquake=== The port town is internationally known for its very vibrant art scene and elegant townhouses dating from the 19th century. Among the wealth of art and crafts available in Jacmel are the papier-mâché, done by nearly 200 artisans and the renowned Atelier created by Moro Baruk. In recent years Jacmel has been host to a large film festival, called the Jacmel Film Festival, that started in 2004, and in 2007 the international Jacmel Music Festival was successfully launched as well. Its carnival, the nearby Bassin Bleu (Haiti's most famous natural deep pools), and the scenic white sand (Timouillage, Cabic, Raymond-les-bains, located primarily in Cayes-Jacmel) beaches attract many visitors. The town is regarded as one of the safest in the country, and foreign visitors that come to Haiti seeking tranquility often go for Jacmel. Its urbanization has been increasing in large part due to the income generated by tourism. Royal Caribbean, the leading tourism company whose cruise ships regularly dock at Labadee, plans to add stopovers at Jacmel. In February 2007, Edwin Zenny became the town's newly elected mayor. In addition, the Jacmel Film Festival is held there annually. On January 11, 2010, Choice Hotels announced they would open a 120-room Comfort Inn in Jacmel, the first chain hotel to be opened there in a decade. ===2010 Haiti earthquake=== On 12 January 2010, Haiti experienced a magnitude 7.0 earthquake that caused heavy damage and casualties in Jacmel.\\"Magnitude 7.0 – HAITI REGION\\" , United States Geological Survey The first temblor rocked the city at 4:40 pm, but the later temblor at 5:37 pm stopped the cathedral's clock. A Jacmel radio station estimated that at least 5000 were dead from the quake itself, although mayor Zennie Edwin later reported that the figure was closer to 300–500 deaths and 4,000 injured. About 70 per cent of the homes were damaged, with most of the heavier damage being in the poorer neighbourhoods.AFP, \\"In Haiti, the Jacmel cathedral clock stopped at 5:37 pm\\", 20 January 2010 (accessed 20 January 2010) The town hall was so severely damaged that it had to be demolished.Leeder, Jessica (9 February 2010) \\"Welcome to Jacmel\\", Globe and Mail.

This initiative was created to help stimulate a self-sustaining tourism economy for Haiti. Michael Capponi, founder of the Capponi Group, formed the Jacmel Advisory Council to help revitalize Jacmel, while preserving its arts, culture and traditions. The board promotes best practices to provide a socio-economic system for thousands of Haitians living in the southeast region. Capponi Group Haiti is also restoring a 200-year-old coffee-sorting house at the port of Jacmel. The project hopes to again make Jacmel a commercial and tourist center. ==Notable residents == * René Depestre, a famous Haitian poet and essayist who fled from the Duvalier dictatorship.

Courtesy: Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary Staff The Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary is a U.S. National Marine Sanctuary in the Florida Keys. It includes the Florida Reef, the only barrier coral reef in North America and the third-largest coral barrier reef in the world. It also has extensive mangrove forest and seagrass fields. The Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, designated in 1990, is the ninth national marine sanctuary to be established in a system that comprises 13 sanctuaries and two marine national monuments. The Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary protects approximately of coastal and ocean waters from the estuarine waters of south Florida along the Florida Keys archipelago, encompassing more than 1,700 islands, out to the Dry Tortugas National Park, reaching into the Atlantic Ocean, Florida Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. The mission of the sanctuary is to protect the marine resources of the Florida Keys while facilitating human uses that are consistent with the primary objective of resource protection. Sanctuary waters and habitats support high species diversity due to the presence of both tropical and subtropical species, including the largest documented contiguous seagrass community in the northern hemisphere and extensive coral reef habitat. The sanctuary is also home to maritime heritage resources that encompass a broad historical period. ==Human impact== ===Population and urban development=== Population growth and urban development may impact the health of coral reefs. Development activities may cause erosion resulting in the runoff of sediments which eventually reach the coral reefs. Storm water runoff may carry fertilizers into the ocean causing damage to the coral reefs, and an increase of nutrient concentrations in the reef may cause an increase of algae which may smother the corals. Sizable foreign objects such as sunken boats and planes provide rich micro- sanctuaries for a plethora of sea life that otherwise would not exist. ===Fishing activities=== The harvest of resources from the sea is ever growing. Overfishing has changed the ecological dynamics of marine communities allowing some organisms to dominate reefs that were once controlled by large reef fish populations. ===Tourism=== Tourism dollars help to fund scientific research and environmental remediation activities. Tourism may contribute to reef damage. Divers and snorkelers may harm the corals by touching the polyps, and boats may damage it by running aground and dragging anchors. ===Coral bleaching=== Global warming coupled with an intense El Niño has led to higher sea water temperatures throughout the area, that can cause coral bleaching. “Minor paling” of some corals has been observed by local Coral Bleaching Early Warning NetworkCoral Bleaching Early Warning Network: Current Conditions Report. Data.gov, a program of Mote Marine Laboratory and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. ==Invasive animal species== ===The lionfish=== One of the Florida Keys' most ecologically damaging invasive species is the lionfish. First discovered as an introduced species in 2009, the lionfish population affects the original flora and fauna of the Florida Keys in three major ways. The lionfish has an appetite for native fish and crustaceans is able to spawn year-round. Originating in the Pacific Ocean, the lionfish has no known predator in the Atlantic Ocean. The lack of natural predators to control the lionfish population allows the lionfish population to grow to disruptive numbers. Lionfish are predators of juvenile fish, such as commercially important grouper and snapper, as well as juvenile parrotfish, which graze on algae in coral reefs, preventing the algae from overgrowing and killing corals. The lionfish’s dietary consumption of native species of the Florida Keys not only affects the species diversity of the Florida Keys, but also causes detriment to the environment due to a decrease in fish who help maintain the coral reefs. The regular spawning of the lionfish further impacts the environment of the Florida Keys; which therefore always maintains a stable reproductive population. A female lionfish can produce 30,000 to 40,000 eggs every few days; lionfish become sexually mature by the time they are a year old. The regular spawning of the lionfish creates a constant pressure on the Florida Keys ecosystem. ==Invasive exotic plants== There are various introduced plants within the Florida Keys. Many of these plants outcompete the original plants of the Keys, such as mangroves and seagrass. The animals who rely on native plants for food and habitat are also at risk by invasive plants. There are four main exotic plant species that have become so invasive in the Florida Keys that they threaten and endanger 42 native plant species and 27 animal species to the point of extinction. Australian Pine, Brazilian pepper or Florida holly, Asiatic colubrine, and Melaleuca all pose a risk to the flora and fauna of the Florida Keys. ===Australian pine=== The Australian pine is a nonnative species that poses risks to the original flora and fauna of the Florida Keys. The Australian pine \\"outcompetes native vegetation by producing a dense leaf litter beneath them;\\" therefore the Australian pine does not allow the native plants to obtain needed nutrients. The Australian pine also has a comparative advantage over native species: the Australian pine can quickly \\"invade newly accreted beaches, beaches where dredge spoil has been deposited, and beaches where a storm has destroyed existing vegetation.\\" The Australian pine displaces native flora of the Florida keys, and displaces native fauna by providing no native wildlife habitat. ===Brazilian pepper=== The Brazilian pepper tree is native to Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil, but was brought to Florida in the mid-1800s as an ornamental plant. The introduction of the Brazilian pepper has disturbed the biodiversity of the Florida ecosystem, as one of the most widespread of the invasive non- indigenous pest plants in Florida. The Brazilian pepper tree has invaded over 700,000 acres in Florida. The tree produces a dense canopy that shades out all other plants and provides a very poor habitat for growth to native species. \\"The Brazilian pepper invades aquatic as well as terrestrial habitats, reducing the quality of native biotic communities.\\" ==Reefs== Notable reefs in the sanctuary include the following: *Sand Key *Rock Key *Eastern Dry Rocks *Western Sambo *Eastern Sambo *9-foot Stake *Marker 32 *Looe Key *Newfound Harbor Key *Sombrero Key *Coffins Patch *Tennessee Reef *Alligator Reef *Cheeca Rocks *Hen and Chickens *Davis Reef *Conch Reef *Snapper Ledge *Pickles Reef *Molasses Reef *French Reef *Crocker Reef *Grecian Rocks *Dry Rocks *The Elbow *Carysfort Reef *Turtle Reef *Pacific Reef *Ajax Reef ==Notes== ==External links== *Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary Category:Florida Keys Category:Protected areas of Monroe County, Florida Category:National Marine Sanctuaries of the United States Category:Protected areas of Florida Category:1990 establishments in Florida Category:Protected areas established in 1990 ","title":"Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary"},{"id":"1278073","text":"Kreischa is a municipality in the Sächsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge district, Saxony, Germany.

Giovanny Arroba's TA60 exterior was chosen in late 2000, with a final production freeze in July 2001. The design language of the future truck was previewed by the 2001 Alpha T concept shown at the 2001 Detroit Auto Show, which had previously developed through November 2000. Production began on September 21, 2003 and sales on December 1, 2003. The Titan used Nissan's new full-size F-Alpha platform. This new platform was shared with the Nissan Armada and Infiniti QX56 SUVs, with all three manufactured in Canton, Mississippi, United States. The first generation Titan continued without a major redesign through 2015. ===Specifications=== ====Models and equipment==== All models came standard with a 32-valve, 5.6-liter engine, VK56DE, which generates ( on 2004–2006 models) and of torque.

It was powered by gas turbines, the only multiple unit so powered that was used by British Rail. The APT-E consisted of two driving power cars (PC1 and 2) and two trailer cars (TC1 and 2). Each power car was equipped with four Rover- built Leyland 2S/350 gas turbines (and a fifth for auxiliary power supplies), these initially produced 300 HP each but were progressively uprated to 330 HP.APT: A Promise Unfulfilled, p480 Two GEC 253AY nose suspended traction motors provided the traction on the leading bogies. The vehicles were manufactured from aluminium, approx with articulated bogies between them. The APT-E made its first run on 25 July 1972 from Derby to Duffield and was immediately 'blacked' by the drivers' union ASLEF, due to concerns that the single driver's seat preempted ongoing negotiations about the single-manning of trains. It was over twelve months before it ran again on the main line in August 1973. The prototype was eventually tried out on the Great Western Main Line, and achieved a new British railway speed record when on 10 August 1975 it hit whilst on test with the Western Region between Swindon and Reading. It was also tested extensively on the Midland Main Line out of London St. Pancras and on the Old Dalby Test Track, where in January 1976 it attained a speed of . The unit was only intended for testing and was never used in ordinary public service, although it did carry office staff and the occasional dignitaries on trial runs. When its period of testing was complete, in June 1976, it was sent to the National Railway Museum, York for preservation. It is now based at the NRM's Locomotion museum in Shildon. When further APT Class 370 units were built, they were powered by 25 kV AC electrification. ==Test bed set== The APT-POP (Power-0-Power) set was a rake of three skeletal unpowered carriages used as a test bed for the suspension, tilting and braking systems used by APT units. The 'Power pumps' were only mock-ups, though similar externally to PC1 and PC2 in the APT-E unit minus cabs, and the whole set had to be hauled by a locomotive. Following the abandonment of the APT project, all three carriages were scrapped in 1985.

It offers forty-five majors in the fields of fine arts, humanities, social and natural sciences, education, business, and religion, and nine pre-professional programs, including nursing, dentistry, medicine, pharmacy, veterinary, and law. McMurry has 1,145 students. Methodist students constitute 27 percent of the student population. Ninety five percent of students are Texan. Minority groups make up approximately one-fourth of the student body. In the freshman class, 98 percent of students receive some financial aid. Fifty-three percent of students live on campus, and 75 percent of students are involved in at least one extracurricular activity. McMurry boasts a student to faculty ratio of 13:1. 91 percent of the faculty have earned a doctorate or other terminal degree in their field. McMurry is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, the Texas Education Agency, the University Senate of the United Methodist Church, the National League for Nursing, and the Texas State Board of Nurse Examiners. ==Indians mascot controversy== McMurry's sports teams originally used Indians as their nickname. In late August 2005, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) handed down a decision calling for the eighteen universities with Native American mascots to change their names or obtain a waiver from their representative tribe for the use of the mascot name. The McMurry Indians were part of this list. The Indians nickname was chosen as a tribute to the University's first president, J.W. Hunt, who grew up on an Indian Reservation in the Indian Territory. On May 18, 2006, the NCAA rejected McMurry's appeal to keep their nickname. The school chose to appeal the ruling, and indicated their intention to do so by the June 18, 2006, deadline. According to a press release, \\"the University’s appeal will be based on the arbitrariness of the NCAA’s decision-making process and the inconsistent results and messages that have come from the process.\\" Other schools, such as Florida State University, made successful appeals by garnering the endorsement of Indian tribes. Although McMurry did not actively seek an endorsement, representatives from the Kaw, Kiowa, and Comanche tribes voiced their approval of McMurry's mascot. In October 2006, McMurry's Board of Trustees decided that the university would no longer use any names for its athletic teams. Citing the school's 83-year history of honoring Native Americans, the school announced that in spite of no longer using names to designate athletic teams, the school traditions created to honor Native Americans would continue. The school's stadium name was changed from Indian Stadium to Wilford Moore Stadium as of May 13, 2007. Wilford Moore was the most-winning coach in McMurry football history. On March 11, 2011, it was announced that McMurry University's athletic teams would be known as the War Hawks. The new mascot was chosen after a nearly year-long search to find a new mascot to replace the former Indian mascot. The war hawk is meant to represent pride, courage and fierce competition for McMurry's athletic teams. ==Athletics== The McMurry University football team in action against the Texas A&M;–Commerce Lions in 2014 McMurry's school colors are maroon and white. McMurry fields teams in 19 different intercollegiate sports. For the men, McMurry competes in baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swimming, tennis and indoor and outdoor track and field. For the women, McMurry competes in basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, swimming, tennis, indoor and outdoor track and field, volleyball, in which they won the NCCAA national championship in 2012, and softball. All teams played in the NCAA Division III American Southwest Conference until 2011. In July 2011, McMurry announced that it had been accepted as a candidate for NCAA Division II membership and joined the Heartland Conference in the fall of 2012. The Board of Regent voted in January 2014 to move back to Division III. As of July 2013, the McMurry football team has accepted an invitation to the Lone Star Conference and will play a full conference schedule as of fall 2014. McMurry University announced October 19, 2016 that the sport of softball would be added to its women's intercollegiate programs, beginning in 2018. The addition of softball will bring to 20 the number of sports sponsored by the War Hawks. \\"This is another example of McMurry momentum,\\" Director of Athletics Sam Ferguson said. \\"The University is growing in students, in programs, and now also in athletics opportunities. \\"Softball is one of the most popular sports in the state of Texas. In fact, nearly 34,000 girls are competing at the high school level. It's a great fit at McMurry, because we know that there is an abundance of talent right here in our backyard. We are also excited about the type of scholar-athlete softball will attract. According to NCAA data, softball players are some of the most academically successful. Finally, the addition of this important program will help us take another step in the right direction from a Title IX standpoint. This addition is long overdue.\\" The plan is to hire a head coach by this coming January 2017 to begin recruiting for the following school year and build a schedule. The War Hawks will – initially – play their home games on a local city of Abilene facility and, by the third year, build an on-campus field. Beyond that, upgrade projects will include press box facilities, permanent seating and team areas/offices. \\"The American Southwest Conference congratulates McMurry University on bringing softball to its intercollegiate athletics program,\\" said Amy Carlton, ASC commissioner. \\"The War Hawks' addition provides women an avenue to continue academic pursuits while participating in a sport they enjoy within one of the top NCAA Division III softball conferences.\\" Softball sponsorship in the ASC will grow to 13 teams and becomes the seventh conference championship sport to be supported at every member institution. Women's soccer, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's tennis, and baseball are ASC sports sponsored by all ASC members. By conference rule and with full member sponsorship of softball, the ASC Softball Championship Tournament format will shift to eight-team double-elimination with the 2018 tournament. ==Notable alumni== * V.

As Nissan's first crossover SUV for the United States and Canada, the Murano was designed at Nissan America in La Jolla, California, and was based on the Nissan FF-L platform shared with the third generation Altima. The single European version of the Murano began sales in 2004. The Murano was Nissan's only crossover SUV in the United States until September 2007, when the 2008 Rogue went on sale. In Canada the X-Trail had been on sale as Nissan's second car based SUV since 2004 as a model for 2005; it was replaced by the 2008 Rogue at the end of 2007. The Murano is sized between the Pathfinder and the now defunct Xterra (replaced by the Rogue as a compact SUV). The nameplate Murano derives from the Italian city of Murano and the namesake Murano art glass for which the city is widely known. == First generation (Z50; 2002)== The first generation Nissan Murano was unveiled in production form for the model year of 2003, at the 2002 New York International Auto Show. It was powered by a 3.5 liter (VQ35DE) V6 producing and , also used in several other Nissan models like the Altima, Maxima, and Nissan 350Z, but specifically tuned for use in the Murano. Available with standard front-wheel- drive (FWD) and optional all-wheel-drive (AWD), the Nissan Murano is one of the largest vehicles using a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Fuel economy was rated at 18 mpg in the city and 23 mpg on the highway (same mpg FWD and AWD on the new EPA specifications). Production started in middle of May 2002, and the first vehicles shipped in early June for the United States, and mid July for Canadian markets. An independent suspension on all wheels was used for class leading ride and handling. Nissan Murano 3.5 (UK) Interior A full set of airbags, steel reinforced cabin, and head restraints were safety features designed to protect the interior while VDC, ABS, electronic brakeforce distribution and brake assist were mechanical safety features. VDC incorporates a form of traction control. The Murano received a crash test rating of five stars in all categories but vehicle rollover (four stars) from the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). For the model year of 2006 in North America, the Murano received some updates in the form of LED tail lamps and turn signals, standard color information screen, available back-up camera (standard in Canada for all models), GPS and a restyled front end with some minor trim updates. September 2004, the Murano was introduced in Japan, replacing the Bassara MPV and exclusive to Nissan Red Stage locations, with a further introduction at Nissan Blue Stage locations in October, replacing the Terrano. Due to the Murano exceeding engine displacement and exterior dimensions as declared in Japanese Government regulations, it was regarded as a luxury vehicle and was equipped with many optional features found in North America as standard equipment on Japanese models, to include Nissan's GPS and internet-based navigation system called CarWings. Japanese models were available with two engine choices, the 3.5L V6 engine, or the 2.5L four cylinder engine. === Murano GT-C === There was also a high-performance version of the first generation of Murano, named as \\"GT-C\\", which used a high-output version of the VQ35DE engine with a peak power of around 305 bhp, as seen on the 350Z. This enabled the GT-C to set off from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in less than 8 seconds, with a top speed of slightly over 220 km/h. == Second generation (Z51; 2007)== Interior Nissan skipped the model year of 2008 with the introduction of the second generation Murano – as a model for 2009. The 2009 Murano made its debut at the 2007 Los Angeles Auto Show in November, and sales began in January 2008. The exterior and interior were redesigned. The second generation Murano was initially offered in three trim levels: the base S, the mid grade SL, and the top level LE. The performance oriented SE model was discontinued. The S and SL are offered with standard FWD, with optional iAWD (Intelligent All Wheel Drive) available. The LE trim is iAWD only. The second generation Murano included new features, some of which were optional or available only on the LE grade, including rain sensing wipers, double stitched leather seats, power rear lift gate, power fold up rear seats, iPod integration, and a hard-drive based, touchscreen navigation system. The S and SL feature aluminum interior accents, while the LE sports wood tone trim. Like the first generation model, there is no third row seat. The second generation is based on the Nissan D platform, shared with the fourth generation Nissan Altima, and the new 2009 Nissan Maxima. The second generation was equipped a revised version of the 3.5L VQ engine rated at , an increase of 20 over the previous model. Torque is rated at . The engine is mated to a revised Continuously Variable Transmission with Adaptive Shift Control. EPA fuel economy is rated at 18 city / 23 highway. Standard safety features on all trims include four wheel disc brakes with ABS, brake assist, and EBD; electronic stability control; and front, side, and side curtain airbags. The NHTSA awarded the second generation Murano four stars on the frontal crash test, and five stars for side impacts, worse than the first generation. On September 29, 2008, Nissan released the second generation Murano in Japan, targeted mainly at men in their 30s, 40s and 50s, and priced between 3,150,000 yen and 4,042,500 yen, about 200,000 to 300,000 yen more expensive than the first generation model. Nissan announced plans to sell the vehicle in 170 countries. The four-cylinder 2.5L QR engine continued to be offered as an option in Japan. In July 2010, Nissan launched a facelifted version in Europe only, with an updated 2.5L YD25DDTi four cylinder diesel engine producing 190 hp and . For the model year of 2011, the Murano was refreshed to include refreshed front and rear fascias, new headlights and LED taillights, and new 18 inch wheels on the outside. New interior changes included a new white meter color (as opposed to red/orange), new center stack plastic colors matching the leather trim, and added equipment to various trim levels. The refresh also added a new exterior color, \\"Graphite Blue\\" and for the 2013 model year the LE trim was renamed to Platinum. In September 2011, Nissan launched the second-generation Murano in Indonesia. Only one version was available, and sold for 750 million rupiahs (about US$78,900). In April 2011, the Murano was officially withdrawn from the United Kingdom, due to disappointing sales. ===Murano CrossCabriolet=== Nissan Murano CrossCabriolet (Japan) Nissan premiered the Murano CrossCabriolet at the 2010 Los Angeles International Auto Show, marketing it as \\"the world’s first all wheel drive crossover convertible.\\" Nissan began formally marketing the CrossCabriolet with the model year of 2011 -- without further refreshes or any other trim levels during its production run. The crossover was only offered in the LE trim and had the same engine as a standard Murano. The fully automatic, hydraulically operated cloth top has an automatic power latch/unlatch system, rear glass skylight, dual pop-up roll bars, 7.6 cf cargo capacity with the top down and 12.3 cf with the top up -- and a Cd of 0.39. Its front doors are 7.9 inches longer than four door Murano front doors, with structural reinforcement from the A-pillar rearward. The Murano CrossCabriolet was discontinued after the 2014 model year.\\"Nissan Murano CrossCabriolet being phased out, no replacement planned\\" from Autoblog (April 15, 2014) == Third generation (Z52; 2014)== 2015 Nissan Murano Platinum In April 2014, Nissan unveiled the third generation Murano at the New York Auto Show, with production in Canton, Mississippi and featuring the VQ-Series 3.5 liter V6. \\"2015 Nissan Murano gets edgier, lighter for NY \\" From Autoblog (April 14, 2014) The third generation Murano was not marketed in Japan, due to costs associated with exceeding Japanese Government dimension regulations and annual road tax obligations. The 3.5 liter V6 engine produces up to . Nissan discontinued the rain-sensing wipers. The Nissan Murano returned in Mexico after an absence for a decade after the second generation was discontinued in that market. For the 2019 model year, Murano received an updated front and rear fascias as well as a new wheel design and quilted semi-aniline leather appointed seating became standard on the Platinum trim level and also gets new interior trim finishers, Light wood-tone on SV and SL trim levels with cashmere interior, Metallic trim on S, SV, and SL trim levels with graphite interior, and Dark wood-tone on the Platinum trim level. New exterior colors include Deep Blue Pearl, Mocha Almond Pearl, and Sunset Drift ChromaFlair. For 2020, it kept the same design while receiving minimal changes, mostly safety features. The SV and SL models received the Nissan Safety Shield 360 as standard, which included automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, blind spot warning, rear cross- traffic alert, lane departure warning, rear automatic braking, and high-beam assist. ===Murano Hybrid=== Only for the model year of 2016, Nissan introduced a Hybrid version of the Nissan Murano. The Murano Hybrid is available in two trim levels, SL and Platinum. The Murano Hybrid features an electric motor, a 2.5 liter four cylinder engine, Intelligent Dual Clutch System, and Lithium- Ion Battery that is located under the center console. Hybrid components won't reduce passenger and cargo space. The hybrid version uses the so-called VSP (Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians) system that uses sound to help alert pedestrians of the presence of the vehicle, when it is being driven at a low speed in the electric drive mode. ==Awards and recognition== * 2003 Nominated for the North American Truck of the Year award. * 2007 Motorist Choice best premium mid-size SUV by AutoPacific. * 2010 Murano received the highest ratings in the front-, side-, and rear-impact evaluations performed by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. * 2010 Murano received NHTSA's Highest Government Side-Impact Safety Rating (five stars). * 2015 Ward's 10 Best Interiors Winner ==Sales== { class= style=\\"text-align: right;\\" - !

It is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. It was scientifically described in 2005. It is a relatively large brown primate with a comparatively short tail. Its species name comes from munzala (\\"monkey of the deep forest\\") as it was called by the Monpa people.Press release issued jointly by NCF, WCS, New York, International Snow Leopard Trust & NIAS, Bangalore PDF ==Discovery== A camera trap photograph of Arunachal macaques in Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary, India It was discovered as a new taxon in 1997 by the noted Indian primatologist Anwaruddin Choudhury, but he thought it to be a new subspecies of the Tibetan macaque (M. thibetana). It was described as a new species in 2005 by a group of scientists from the Nature Conservation Foundation, India. It is the first species of macaque to have been discovered since 1903, when the Indonesian Pagai Island macaque was discovered. This monkey was reported on the basis of a good quality photograph as the holotype. In 2011, some researchers suggested, on the basis of morphological variation within the Assamese macaque, that it might be better treated as a subspecies. Subsequently, it was also discovered in Bhutan, where it was observed and photographed in the Trashi Yangshi area in 2006. ==Description== The Arunachal macaque is compactly built and has a very dark face. It lives at high altitudes, between 2000 m and 3500 m above sea level, making it one of the highest-dwelling primates. It belongs to the M. sinica species-group of macaques, along with the Assamese macaque (M. assamensis), the Tibetan macaque, the bonnet macaque (M. radiata) and the toque macaque (M. sinica). The Arunachal macaque is apparently physically similar to the Assam and Tibetan macaques, while genetically closely related to the bonnet macaque of southern India. This is probably the result of convergent evolution, where organisms evolve similar physical features due to similar environmental selection pressure, while genetically they may have different origins. However, its full specific status is not beyond doubt and further research might show it to be a new subspecies of Assamese or Tibetan macaques. This monkey is severely persecuted in some parts of its known distribution by locals retaliating against crop raiding. Recent surveys suggest that this species may be highly endangered in some parts of Arunachal Pradesh. == References == ==External links== * Arunachal Macaque information with photograph Arunachal macaque Category:Primates of South Asia Category:Fauna of Arunachal Pradesh Arunachal macaque ","title":"Arunachal macaque"},{"id":"1278112","text":"Skipping may refer to: * The hippity-hoppity gait that comes naturally to children * A game or form of exercise using a skipping rope * Stone skipping, throwing a stone so that it bounces off the surface of water * String skipping, a guitar-playing technique * Snowmobile skipping, a sport where drivers hydroplane snowmobiles on lakes or rivers * British slang for dumpster diving * an episode of the television series Teletubbies * a song by the band Associates from their 1982 album Sulk * Truancy ==See also== * * Skip (disambiguation) * Oswald Skippings (born 1953), former Chief Minister of the Turks and Caicos Islands ","title":"Skipping"},{"id":"1278119","text":"Montalcino Brunello di Montalcino is a red DOCG Italian wine produced in the vineyards surrounding the town of Montalcino, in the province of Siena, located about 80 km south of Florence in the Tuscany wine region. Brunello, a diminutive of Bruno (\\"brown\\"), is the name that was given locally to what was believed to be an individual grape variety grown in Montalcino. In 1879 the Province of Siena's Amphelographic Commission determined, after a few years of controlled experiments, that Sangiovese and Brunello were the same grape variety, and that the former should be its designated name.Kerin O'Keefe Brunello di Montalcino. Understanding and Appreciating One of Italy's Greatest Wines University of California Press 2012 In Montalcino the name Brunello evolved into the designation of the wine produced with 100% Sangiovese. In 1980, Brunello di Montalcino was among the four wines awarded the first Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) designation. Today it is one of Italy's best-known and most expensive wines.M. Ewing-Mulligan & E. McCarthy Italian Wines for Dummies pp. 159-–61 Hungry Minds 2001 ==History== Sangiovese grapes in Montalcino. One of the first records of \\"Brunello\\" was a red wine that was made in the Montalcino area in the early 14th century. In 1831, marchese Cosimo Ridolfi (who was later appointed Prime Minister of Tuscany by the Grand Duke Leopold II) praised the merits of the red wines of Montalcino above all others in Tuscany. In 1865, an agricultural fair in Montalcino noted that the prize winning wine of the event was a \\"select red wine\\" known as a Brunello.J. Robinson (ed) The Oxford Companion to Wine Third Edition pp. 106–107 Oxford University Press 2006 In the mid-19th century, a local farmer named Clemente Santi isolated certain plantings of Sangiovese vines in order to produce a 100% varietal wine that could be aged for a considerable period of time. In 1888, his grandson Ferruccio Biondi-Santi—a veteran soldier who fought under Giuseppe Garibaldi during the Risorgimento—released the first \\"modern version\\" of Brunello di Montalcino that was aged for over a decade in large wood barrels.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pp. 382–384 Workman Publishing 2001 H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 423 Simon and Schuster 1989 H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 179 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 By the end of World War II, Brunello di Montalcino had developed a reputation as one of Italy's rarest wines. The only commercial producer recorded in government documents was the Biondi-Santi firm, which had declared only four vintages up to that point—1888, 1891, 1925, and 1945. The high price and prestige of these wines soon encouraged other producers to emulate Biondi-Santi's success. By the 1960s there were 11 producers making Brunello, and in 1968 the region was granted Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) status. By 1970 the number of producers had more than doubled to 25, and by 1980 there were 53 producers. In 1980, the Montalcino region was the first Italian wine region to be awarded Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) designation. By the turn of the 21st century, there were nearly 200 producers of Brunello di Montalcino, mostly small farmers and family estates, together producing nearly 330,000 cases a year. In 2008, Italian authorities confiscated four producers' 2003 Brunello on charges that the producers had committed fraud by including foreign varietals such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in the wine that they then fraudulently labeled as Brunello di Montalcino, which by law may only contain Sangiovese grapes. Laboratory tests later confirmed that the confiscated wines were in fact Brunello except for a small portion that remained inconclusive. ==Climate and geography== Brunello vines in Montalcino. Montalcino has one of the warmest and driest climates in Tuscany with the grapes in the area ripening up to a week earlier than in nearby Montepulciano. It is the most arid Tuscan DOCG, receiving an average annual rainfall of around 700 mm, in contrast to the Chianti region which receives an average of 900 mm. As with all of the Northern Hemisphere, the north-facing slopes receive fewer hours of sunlight and are generally cooler than the south-facing slopes. Thus, vineyards planted on the north-facing slopes ripen more slowly and tend to produce wines that are racier and more aromatic. Vineyards on the southern and western slopes receive more intense exposure to sunlight and more maritime winds which produces wines with more power and complexity. The top producers in the area have vineyards on both slopes, and make use of a blend of both styles.James Suckling. \\"Brunello di Montalcino: The Wines\\", Wine Spectator, p.42, 31 July 2007 The town of Montalcino is a small medieval village located about above sea level in the province of Siena. The wine district is centered to the northeast of the village in densely wooded and hilly terrain. Monte Amiata, the highest peak in Southern Tuscany, provides a sheltering influence from the southeast and tempers the region's climate and rainfall. Compared to the nearly of planted land in Chianti, Montalcino is a relatively small wine region with around planted. Vineyards in Montalcino are planted in varied soils—including limestone, clay, schist, volcanic soil and a crumbly marl known as galestro—at altitudes ranging from 149 m to 500 m. This diversity in terroir contributes to the vast range in quality and potential complexity of Brunello di Montalcino. According to Kerin O'Keefe: \\"although sangiovese excels in select parts of Montalcino, it does not perform as well throughout the whole denomination thanks to the dramatic differences within the large growing area\\". O'Keefe is in favor of putting subzones on the labels as this would greatly help consumers understand the stark differences among Brunellos from Montalcino's greatly varied territory, proposing 8 subzones: Montalcino North, Montalcino South, Castelnuovo dell'Abate, Camigliano, Tavernelle, Bosco, Torrenieri, Sant'Angelo. ==Winemaking and regulations== Brunello di Montalcino \\"Biondi-Santi, 1967 - Brunello di Montalcino \\"Fattoria dei Barbi, 1968 , bottle N° R7381 - Tegolato, 1966, produced bottles: 39.200, bottle n°20.910 Brunello di Montalcino is made 100% from Sangiovese. Traditionally, the wine goes through an extended maceration period where color and flavor are extracted from the skins. Following fermentation the wine is then aged in oak. Traditionally, the wines are aged 3 years or more \\"in botte\\"—large Slavonian oak casks that impart little oak flavor and generally produce more austere wines. Some winemakers will use small French barrique which impart a more pronounced vanilla oak flavor. There is a middle ground where the wine is aged in small barrique for a short time and then spends a longer sojourn in the traditional botte. Most producers will separate their production between a normale and riserva bottling. The normale bottles are released on the market 50 months after harvest and the riserva are released a year afterward. The current aging requirements were established in 1998 and dictate that Brunellos are to be aged in oak for 2 years and at least 4 months in a bottle before release. Winemakers who intentionally stray from these rules and regulations can possibly receive a conviction of commercial fraud accompanied by an imprisonment sentence of up to six years. ===Brunellopoli=== In 2008, reports surfaced that Italian authorities were investigating claims that several major Brunello producers were adulterating their wines by using foreign or domestic grape varieties in violation of the DOCG regulations, which stipulate that only Sangiovese may be used to make Brunello. The prosecutor handling the investigation said he would bring commercial fraud charges that could result in imprisonment for the violators. The producers in question were suspected of adding wine made from non-approved grapes in order to make it more appealing to the international market. In response the U.S. government blocked imports of Brunello that did not have proof that they were in fact 100% Sangiovese. The scandal was coined Brunellopoli by the Italian wine press. ==Grapes and wines== A Brunello di Montalcino produced by the Antinori family. The Sangiovese grape is the most widely planted grape in the Montalcino region and is the only permitted grape in the Brunello di Montalcino DOCG. The particular clones of Sangiovese are unique to the Montalcino region and have developed in adaption to that area's specific terroir. The altitude and climate of the Montalcino region has provided an area where Sangiovese ripens more fully and consistently than anywhere else in Tuscany. These factors contribute to the body, color, extract and tannins commonly associated with Brunello di Montalcino. In contrast to Chianti, the other famous Sangiovese based wine of Tuscany, Brunello di Montalcinos have a more fleshy texture with common aromas and flavors of blackberry, black cherry, black raspberry, chocolate, leather and violets. Brunello is often compared with the Pinot noir wines of Burgundy with its smooth tannins and ripe, fruit driven character. The high acidity of the wine allows it to pair well with food, especially grilled meat and game. A large portion of Brunello sold in the United States is purchased in restaurants. The wine has become particularly popular in America with nearly 1 out of every 3 bottles of Brunello di Montalcino being sold in the US. Brunello di Montalcino are known for their ability to age with well made examples from exceptional vintages often showcasing development for several decades. Master of Wine Mary Ewing- Mulligan notes that most Brunellos often need at least 10 years before they shed their youthfulness and start to harmonize their flavors. ==Other wines== In addition to Brunello di Montalcino, producers in the Montalcino region can produce wine under Rosso di Montalcino, Sant'Antimo and Moscadello di Montalcino DOCs as well as the generic Indicazione geografica tipica designation of Toscana IGT. Moscadello di Montalcino is a sweet white wine made from Muscat. The style was once widely produced in Montalcino but fell out of style following World War II. In the early 1980s, the wine estate of Castello Banfi attempted to revive the style by planting Muscat. The Sant'Antimo DOC was named for the 9th century abbey built by Charlemagne. In the 1970s, producers in Montalcino were influenced by the success of the \\"Super Tuscan\\" style of wine that was gaining international recognition for Chianti producers who deviated from DOC regulations with winemaking techniques such blending Cabernet Sauvignon with Sangiovese. In 1996, Italian authorities approved the Sant'Antimo DOC to allow Montalcino producers to produce DOC designated wines that were not 100% Sangiovese. These wines include blended Bianco and Rosso wines as well as varietally labeled Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Merlot, Pinot grigio, Pinot nero and Sauvignon blanc. ===Rosso di Montalcino=== A Rosso di Montalcino made from 100% Sangiovese in the Brunello di Montalcino region. The Rosso di Montalcino DOC was established in 1984 as a means of giving Brunello di Montalcino producers the flexibility to continue the tradition of long aging of the region's flagship wine. Rosso di Montalcino is made from 100% Sangiovese grown in the same delineated region as Brunello di Montalcino. However, the wine is required to spend only six months aging in oak and 1 year total aging before release. This allows Brunello producers to make an earlier releasing wine that can generate cash flow while their Brunello di Montalcino age for their complete duration. In less than ideal vintages some producers will relegate all their grapes to Rosso di Montalcino production and not make a Brunello. Wineries can also declassify their Brunello that has already been aging 2–3 years and release it as Rosso di Montalcino if the wine is not developing to their expectations. Rosso di Montalcino is typically lighter, fresher and more approachable upon release though some producers will make wines with more Brunello like characteristics. These \\"Baby Brunellos\\" are often 1/3 to 1/2 the price of Brunello di Montalcino. ==References== Category:Italian DOCG Category:Wines of Tuscany ","title":"Brunello di Montalcino"},{"id":"1278130","text":"Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111 (1942), is a United States Supreme Court decision that dramatically increased the regulatory power of the federal government. It remains as one of the most important and far-reaching cases concerning the New Deal, and it set a precedent for an expansive reading of the U.S. Constitution's Commerce Clause for decades to come. The goal of the legal challenge was to end the entire federal crop support program by declaring it unconstitutional. An Ohio farmer, Roscoe Filburn, was growing wheat to feed animals on his own farm. The US government had established limits on wheat production, based on the acreage owned by a farmer, to stabilize wheat prices and supplies. Filburn grew more than was permitted and so was ordered to pay a penalty. In response, he said that because his wheat was not sold, it could not be regulated as commerce, let alone \\"interstate\\" commerce (described in the Constitution as \\"Commerce... among the several states\\"). The Supreme Court disagreed: \\"Whether the subject of the regulation in question was 'production', 'consumption', or 'marketing' is, therefore, not material for purposes of deciding the question of federal power before us.... But even if appellee's activity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce and this irrespective of whether such effect is what might at some earlier time have been defined as 'direct' or 'indirect.'\\". The Supreme Court interpreted the Constitution's Commerce Clause, in Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution, which permits the US Congress \\"to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.\\" The Court decided that Filburn's wheat-growing activities reduced the amount of wheat he would buy for animal feed on the open market, which is traded nationally, is thus interstate, and is therefore within the scope of the Commerce Clause. Although Filburn's relatively small amount of production of more wheat than he was allotted would not affect interstate commerce itself, the cumulative actions of thousands of other farmers like Filburn would become substantial. Therefore the Court decided that the federal government could regulate Filburn's production. == Background == The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 limited the area that farmers could devote to wheat production. Its stated purpose was to stabilize the price of wheat in the national market by controlling the amount of wheat produced. It was motivated by a belief by Congress that great international fluctuations in the supply and the demand for wheat were leading to wide swings in the price of wheat, which were deemed to be harmful to the US agricultural economy. The Supreme Court's decision states that the parties had stipulated as to the economic conditions leading to passage of the legislation: Roscoe Filburn was a farmer in what is now suburban Dayton, Ohio. He admitted producing wheat in excess of the amount permitted. He maintained, however, that the excess wheat was produced for his private consumption on his own farm. Since it never entered commerce at all, much less interstate commerce, he argued that it was not a proper subject of federal regulation under the Commerce Clause. In July 1940, pursuant to the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) of 1938, Filburn's 1941 allotment was established at and a normal yield of 20.1 bushels of wheat per acre (). Filburn was given notice of the allotment in July 1940, before the fall planting of his 1941 crop of wheat, and again in July 1941, before it was harvested. Despite the notices, Filburn planted and harvested 239 more bushels () than was allowed from his of excess area.. The Federal District Court ruled in favor of Filburn. The Act required an affirmative vote of farmers by plebiscite to implement the quota. Much of the District Court decision related to the way in which the Secretary of Agriculture had campaigned for passage: the District Court had held that the Secretary's comments were improper. The government then appealed to the Supreme Court, which called the District Court's holding (against the campaign methods that led to passage of the quota by farmers) a \\"manifest error.\\" The Court then went on to uphold the Act under the Interstate Commerce Clause. By the time that the case reached the high court, eight out of the nine justices had been appointed by President Franklin Roosevelt, the architect of the New Deal legislation. In addition, the case was heard during wartime, shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor galvanized the United States to enter the Second World War.\\"In times of war, this Court has deferred to a considerable extent—and properly so—to the military and to the Executive Branch.\\"; Nos. 03-334, 03-343, SHAFIQ RASUL v. GEORGE W. BUSH, FAWZI KHALID ABDULLAH FAHAD AL ODAH v. UNITED STATES, On Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit BRIEF AMICUS CURIAE OF RETIRED MILITARY OFFICERS IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS, MIRNA ADJAMI JAMES C. SCHROEDER, Midwest Immigrant and Counsel of Record Human Rights Center. (January 2004) The decision supported the President by holding that the Constitution allowed the federal government to regulate economic activity that was only indirectly related to interstate commerce. == Decision == The Act's intended rationale was to stabilize the price of wheat on the national market. The federal government has the power to regulate interstate commerce by the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. In this decision, the Court unanimously reasoned that the power to regulate the price at which commerce occurs was inherent in the power to regulate commerce. Filburn argued that since the excess wheat that he produced was intended solely for home consumption, his wheat production could not be regulated through the Interstate Commerce Clause. The Supreme Court rejected the argument and reasoned that if Filburn had not produced his own wheat, he would have bought wheat on the open market. That effect on interstate commerce, the Court reasoned, may not be substantial from the actions of Filburn alone, but the cumulative actions of thousands of other farmers just like Filburn would certainly make the effect become substantial. Therefore, Congress could regulate wholly intrastate, non-commercial activity if such activity, viewed in the aggregate, would have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, even if the individual effects are trivial. Some of the parties' argument had focused on prior decisions, especially those relating to the Dormant Commerce Clause, in which the Court had tried to focus on whether a commercial activity was local or not. Justice Robert H. Jackson's decision rejected that approach as too formulaic: The issue was not how one characterized the activity as local. Rather, it was whether the activity \\"exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce:\\" The regulation of local production of wheat was rationally related to Congress's goal: to stabilize prices by limiting the total supply of wheat produced and consumed. It was clear, the Court held, ==Aftermath== Wickard marked the beginning of the Supreme Court's total deference to the claims of the US Congress to Commerce Clause powers until the 1990s. The Court's own decision, however, emphasizes the role of the democratic electoral process in confining the abuse of the power of Congress: \\"At the beginning Chief Justice Marshall described the Federal commerce power with a breadth never yet exceeded. He made emphatic the embracing and penetrating nature of this power by warning that effective restraints on its exercise must proceed from political rather than from judicial processes.\\" According to Earl M. Maltz, Wickard and other New Deal decisions gave Congress \\"the authority to regulate private economic activity in a manner near limitless in its purview.\\"Earl M. Maltz, as quoted in Chen, supra, at footnote 223. That remained the case until United States v. Lopez (1995), which was the first decision in six decades to invalidate a federal statute on the grounds that it exceeded the power of the Congress under the Commerce Clause. The opinion described Wickard as \\"perhaps the most far reaching example of Commerce Clause authority over intrastate commerce\\" and judged that it \\"greatly expanded the authority of Congress beyond what is defined in the Constitution under that Clause.\\" In Lopez, the Court held that while Congress had broad lawmaking authority under the Commerce Clause, the power was limited and did not extend so far from \\"commerce\\" as to authorize the regulation of the carrying of handguns, especially when there was no evidence that carrying them affected the economy on a massive scale. (In a later case, United States v. Morrison, the Court ruled in 2000 that Congress could not make such laws even when there was evidence of aggregate effect.) The Supreme Court has since relied heavily on Wickard in upholding the power of the federal government to prosecute individuals who grow their own medicinal marijuana pursuant to state law. The Supreme Court would hold in Gonzalez v. Raich (2005) that like with the home-grown wheat at issue in Wickard, home-grown marijuana is a legitimate subject of federal regulation because it competes with marijuana that moves in interstate commerce: In 2012, Wickard was central to arguments in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius and Florida v. United States Department of Health and Human Services on the constitutionality of the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act, with both supporters and opponents of the mandate claiming that Wickard supported their positions.. ==See also== * Gonzales v.

While the two Xterra generations differed significantly, both prioritized ruggedness and affordability over luxury and used body-on-frame construction along with underbody skid plates. Both generations also used a two-box design with c-pillar-mounted rear door handles, asymmetrical rear window, tailgate bump-out for a first aid kit accessible from inside - and a prominent two-tiered roof enabling stadium seating in the second row. The stepped roof accommodated a lower, front roof rack with a removable gear basket and a more conventional roof rack at the rear, upper roof. Nissan licensed the Xterra name from the XTERRA off-road triathlon race series and manufactured the SUV at Nissan's Smyrna Assembly, as well as in Canton, Mississippi. Variants were also manufactured in Brazil and China. Developed at Nissan Design America in La Jolla, California, the Xterra was the first Nissan vehicle completely conceived, developed and manufactured in the United States. According to Jerry Hirshberg, president of Nissan Design International, \\"the impetus for Xterra designers was to create an affordable, rugged, quality piece of equipment\\". Road & Track described the Xterra as \\"an honest SUV that doesn't try to be a luxury car alternative, nor tries to hide its truck underpinnings\\". Jalopnik called it a \\"knockoff of the Land Rover Discovery\\". The Washington Post described it as \\"rugged without bravado\\". ==First generation WD22 series (1999-2004)== ===1999–2001=== The Xterra was introduced in North America in the 2000 model year, using Everything you need, nothing you don't as its marketing tagline. During the Xterra's first two years, two trim levels were offered, marketed as XE and SE. The XE featured a KA24DE I4, 5-speed manual transmission, and steel wheels as well as several option packages combining the 170 horsepower 3.3 L VG33E V6 engine with either a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission, as well as roof rack, side step-rails, sunroof, and carpeted floor mats. The SE featured standard equipment that was optional on an XE. All models featured removable, tab- secured rear seat cushions to accommodate a fold-flat rear seat back. Canadian models from 1999 to 2004 were limited to the VG33E V6 engine with part-time 4WD. ===2002–2004=== 2002–2004 Nissan Xterra With the 1999 Xterra having been developed at Nissan Design America in California, all updates for the 2002 Xterra were executed at Nissan Technical Center-North America in Farmington Hills, Michigan. The facelifted model debuted at the 2001 Chicago Auto Show prominently revised front-end styling with rounded headlights, revised instrument panel, center console, larger glove compartment, pullout rear cup holders and four interior power points, foot-operated pedal parking brake (vs. previous a dash-mounted pull-and-twist parking brake) -- and an increase of 10 horsepower for the V6 engine. The 3.3L VG33E V6 was upgraded to at 4,800 rpm and 202 lb⋅ft (274 N⋅m) at 2,800 rpm, with the supercharged VG33ER option carried over from the 2001 Nissan Frontier, producing of torque for the automatic, and of torque with 5-speed manual. For 2003, options included side- curtain airbags and a tire pressure monitoring system. The 6-disc, 4-speaker AM/FM/CD audio system was replaced by a 6-speaker 300W Rockford Fosgate AM/FM/CD audio system with an 8-inch subwoofer that took up a small portion of the rear storage area. The last of the model year 2004 Xterras were manufactured in January 2005. ==Second generation N50 series (2005-2015)== ===2005-2015=== The second generation Xterra debuted at the New York International Auto Show in 2004 using Nissan's F-Alpha platform. Larger in all dimensions than its predecessor, it entered showrooms in early 2005 for the 2005 model year. The standard engine was upgraded to Nissan's 4.0 L VQ40DE variable valve timing V6, producing .http://www.rockcrawler.com/features/newsshorts/05january/xterra_production.asphttp://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/autos/reviews/healey/2005-01-13-drive- xterra_x.htm A rear differential locker was offered for off-roading. ===2009 update=== 2009–2012 Nissan Xterra The Xterra received a facelift for 2009 (July 2008 production) with more options and colors, leather seats on SE models, and roof mounted lights on off-road models. The last year of the Nissan Xterra in Mexico was 2008. In 2012, production was moved from Smyrna, Tennessee, to Nissan's facility in Canton, Mississippi. ===2011 update=== Early US models include X, S and PRO-4X, with a choice of 6-speed manual or 5-speed automatic transmissions, a choice of part-time 4-wheel drive or 2-wheel drive.2014 Nissan Xterra Press Kit Changes include: *Standard Bluetooth Hands-free Phone System, steering wheel audio controls and sunglass holder (overhead console) on all grade levels; *An updated NissanConnect with smartphone integration for iPhone and Android, allowing the user to connect with Pandora, iHeartRadio, Facebook and more. Capabilities include SiriusXM (subscription required, sold separately), streaming audio via Bluetooth, Hands-free Text Messaging Assistant and audio voice recognition. *New 16-inch aluminum-alloy wheel designs for the S and PRO-4X. *New HVAC controls and upgraded audio system added to X grade. *Heated front seats available on PRO-4X. *Silver paint on the grille and underguard. ===Discontinuation=== The Xterra was discontinued in the U.S. after the 2015 model year. Poor fuel economy, declining sales, and mandated upgrades to safety and emissions were cited as reasons. ==Awards and recognition== 2012 Nissan Xterra Pro-4X dashboard * 2000 Motor Trends Sport Utility of the Year * 2000 North American Truck of the Year * 2000 New England Motor Press Association's Winter Vehicle Award of New England for Best in Class – Mini Sport Utility * 2001 Named Top Car by AAA New Car and Truck Buying Guide * 2005 Named on the Automobile Magazines 50 Great New Cars list * 2006 Nominated as North American Truck of the Year * 2006 Motor Trends Sport Utility of the Year * 2006 Motor Trends Truck Trend's Best Little-Guy SUV Award * 2006 Car and Driver Rock-Hopper SUV Winner.Rock-Hopper 2006 Competition Car and Driver.com, April, 2006.

(Nissan ceased Brazilian production entirely in 2007.) It is built under license by Pars Khodro in Iran as the Nissan Roniz, and in China by Zhengzhou Nissan Automobile as the () from 2003 to 2013. The Paladin uses the same chassis and running gear as the first generation Nissan Xterra, and the 2.4L KA24DE engine mated to a 5-speed manual transmission. The front end is from the local Pickup. (The second generation Xterra model is only available in North America.) Other difference between the American Xterra and its Chinese counterparts is the parking brake actuator, a pedal with a pull-handle release in America, and a lever in China. ===Dongfeng Oting=== Dongfeng Motors produces a Chinese version of the Xterra called the Oting from 2007 to 2015. It is based on the first generation of the Xterra. It was available with the 2.4 litre 4G64 and 4G69 or a 2.5 litre turbo diesel engine paired to a 5 speed manual gearbox. In comparison to pricing, the Chinese market Nissan Paladin was priced at 159,800 to 244,800 RMB (25,264 to US$38,702) while the Oting was priced at 119,800 to 154,800 RMB (18,940 to US$24,473). Trim levels for the Paladin were called the 2WD S, 2WD C, 2WD L, 2WD E, 4WD S, 4WD C, 4WD L and 4WD E.http://chinaautoweb.com/car-models/nissan-paladin/ Trim levels for the Oting were called the China III MT L, China III MT E, China III AT L, China IV MT L, China IV MT E, Diesel 2WD and the Diesel 4WD.http://chinaautoweb.com/car-models/dongfeng-oting/ File:Nissan Paladin facelift China 2012-06-02.JPGDongfeng Oting with Nissan badge File:Dongfeng Oting facelift 01 China 2016-04-08.jpgDongfeng Oting File:Dongfeng Oting facelift 02 China 2016-04-08.jpgDongfeng Oting rear. ==Future== Following the Xterra's discontinuation from the U.S. market in 2015, Nissan began testing a Navara-based SUV.http://www.carbuzz.com/news/2016/9/14/Is-This- Proof-The-Nissan-Xterra-May-Be-Back-After- All-7735467/http://www.carbuzz.com/news/2016/5/25/Nissan-Is-Prepping-One-Of- The-Best-SUVs-The-US-Will-Probably-Never-Get-7733718/ The Nissan Terra made its debut in Asia in early 2018. ==Sales== { class= style=\\"text- align: right;\\" - !

Rosy pink skin and pale blue eyes are characteristics of cremellos, or \\"double- dilute\\" chestnuts. The cream gene is responsible for a number of horse coat colors. Horses that have the cream gene in addition to a base coat color that is chestnut will become palomino if they are heterozygous, having one copy of the cream gene, or cremello, if they are homozygous. Similarly, horses with a bay base coat and the cream gene will be buckskin or perlino. A black base coat with the cream gene becomes the not-always-recognized smoky black or a smoky cream. Cream horses, even those with blue eyes, are not white horses. Dilution coloring is also not related to any of the white spotting patterns. The cream gene (CCr) is an incomplete dominant allele with a distinct dosage effect. The DNA sequence responsible for the cream colors is the cream allele, which is at a specific locus on the MATP gene. Its general effect is to lighten the coat, skin and eye colors. When one copy of the allele is present, it dilutes \\"red\\" pigment to yellow or gold, with a stronger effect on the mane and tail, but does not dilute black color to any significant degree. When two copies of the allele are present, both red and black pigments are affected; red hairs still become cream, and black hairs become reddish. A single copy of the allele has minimal impact on eye color, but when two copies are present, a horse will be blue-eyed in addition to a light coat color. The cream gene is one of several hypomelanism or dilution genes identified in horses. Therefore, it is not always possible to tell by color alone whether the CCr allele is present without a DNA test. Other dilution genes that may mimic some of the effects of the cream gene in either single or double copies include the pearl gene, silver dapple gene, and the champagne gene. Horses with the dun gene also may mimic a single copy of the cream gene. To complicate matters further, it is possible for a horse to carry more than one type of dilution gene, sometimes giving rise to coloring that researchers call a pseudo double dilute. The discovery of the cream gene had a significant effect on breeding, allowing homozygous blue-eyed creams to be recognized by many breed registries that had previously registered palominos but banned cremellos, under the mistaken notion that homozygous cream was a form of Albinism. ==Colors produced== Cream coat colors are described by their relationship to the three \\"base\\" coat colors: chestnut, bay, and black. All horses obtain two copies of the MATP gene; one from the sire, and one from the dam. A horse may have the cream allele or the non-cream allele on each gene. Those with two non-cream alleles will not exhibit true cream traits. Horses with one cream allele and one non-cream allele, popularly called \\"single dilutes,\\" exhibit specific traits: all red pigment in the coat is gold, while the black pigment is either unaffected or only subtly affected. These horses are usually palomino, buckskin, or smoky black. These horses often have light brown eyes. Horses with 2 copies of the cream allele also exhibit specific traits: cream-colored coats, pale blue eyes, and rosy-pink skin. These horses are usually called cremello, perlino, or smoky cream. ===Heterozygous creams (\\"single dilutes\\")=== Horses that are heterozygous creams, that is, have only one copy of the cream gene, have a lightened hair coat. The precise cream dilute coat color produced depends on the underlying base coat color. Unless also affected by other, unrelated genes, they maintain dark skin and brown eyes, though some heterozygous dilutes may be born with pink skin that darkens with age. Some have slightly lighter, amber eyes. However, the heterozygous cream dilute (CR) must not be confused with a horse carrying champagne dilution. Champagne (CH) dilutes are born with pumpkin-pink skin and blue eyes, which darken within days to amber, green or light brown, and their skin acquires a darker mottled complexion around the eyes, muzzle, and genitalia as the animal matures. It is also possible for a heterozygous cream horse to carry more than one of the other dilution alleles. (see \\"Cream mimics,\\" below) In such cases, they may exhibit some characteristics more typical of a homozygous dilute. Cream dilutions may have seasonal color variation between winter and summer coats, as seen in this palomino Palomino is the best known cream-based coat color, and is produced by the action of one cream allele on a chestnut coat. It is characterized by a cream or white mane and tail and yellow or gold coat. The classic golden shade akin to that of a newly minted gold coin is common, but there are other variations: the darkest shades are called sooty palominos, unusual but most often seen in Morgans, can include a mane and tail with darker hairs and heavy dappling in the coat. The palest varieties can be nearly white, retaining darker skin and eyes, are sometimes mistakenly confused with cremello, and are called isabellas in some places. Buckskin is also a well-known color, produced by the action of one cream gene on a bay coat. All red hairs in the base coat are diluted to gold. The black areas, such as the mane, tail and legs, are generally unaffected. The cream gene acting on a \\"blood bay\\" coat, the reddest shade, are pale gold with black points. They are sometimes called buttermilk buckskins. The cream gene acting on the darkest bays, (sometimes mistaken for seal browns) may dilute to a sooty buckskin. True seal brown buckskins can be very difficult to identify owing to their almost all-black coats. It is only the reddish markings around the eyes, muzzle, elbow and groin, which are turned gold, that may give them away. Smoky black foal. Smoky black, a horse with a black base coat and one copy of the cream allele, is less well-known than the two golden shades. Since a single copy of the cream gene primarily affects red pigment, with only a subtle effect on black, smoky blacks can be quite difficult to identify. Smoky blacks may have reddish guard hairs inside their ears, and experienced horse persons may detect something \\"off\\" about the coat of a smoky black, though the slightly burnished look is often chalked up to sun bleaching, which can also be seen in true blacks. The palest can be mistaken for bays or liver chestnuts, especially if exposed to the elements. Smoky black coats tend to react strongly to sun and sweat, and many smoky blacks turn a chocolate color with particularly reddish manes and tails. Bleaching due to the elements means that the legs retain their color better, and can take on an appearance of having dark points like a bay horse. Smoky blacks, however, will lack rich red tones in the coat, instead favoring chocolate and orange tones. Because smoky blacks are often not recognized as such, breeders sometimes think that the cream gene \\"skipped\\" generations. While there are \\"color breed\\" registries for palomino and buckskin horses, which generally record horses based on apparent phenotype and do not require a DNA color test, it is impossible for these colors to breed \\"true\\" due to the action of a single copy of the cream allele. Crossing two heterozygous dilutes will statistically result in offspring which are 25% the base color, 25% homozygous dilute, and 50% heterozygous dilute. This smoky cream tobiano illustrates the difference between unpigmented (white) skin and hair, and skin and hair color due to the cream dilution. When a horse is homozygous, meaning it has two copies of the cream allele, the strongest color dilution occurs. *Cremellos are homozygous cream chestnuts, and have a cream colored body with a cream or white mane and tail. *Perlinos are homozygous cream bays, which also have a cream-colored body but a mane and tail that may be somewhat more reddish in color than a cremello. *Smoky Creams are homozygous cream blacks, and very difficult to visually distinguish from cremellos or perlinos. All three shades can be difficult to distinguish from one another, and are often only firmly identified after a DNA test. While both red and black pigments are turned cream, the black pigment retains a little more color and tends to have a reddish or rusty tint.Bowling A.T. (1996) Horse Genetics. pp. 25±8. CAB International, Wallingford, UK. Thus all-red coats are turned all-ivory, all-black coats are turned all-rusty cream, and bay coats have ivory bodies with slightly darker points. Perlinos may have a reddish- tinted mane Horses with two copies of the cream allele can be collectively called double-dilutes, homozygous creams, or blue-eyed creams, and they share a number of characteristics. The eyes are pale blue, paler than the unpigmented blue eyes associated with white color or white markings, and the skin is rosy-pink. The true, unpigmented pink skin associated with white markings is clearly visible against the rosy-pink skin of a double-dilute, especially when their coat is wetted down. The palest shades of double-dilute coats are just off-white, while the darkest are distinctly rust-tinged. Their coats may be described as nearly white or ivory in addition to cream. The off- white coat, pale blue eyes, and rosy pink skin distinguish the coats of double-dilutes from those of true white horses. True white horses have unpigmented skin and hair due to the incomplete migration of melanocytes from the neural crest during development. No health defects are associated with the cream gene. This is also true of the normal variations in skin, hair and eye color encoded on the human MATP gene. True white coat coloring can be produced by at least half a dozen known genes, and some are associated with health defects. Some genes which encode a white or near-white coat when heterozygous, popularly called \\"dominant white,\\" may be lethal in homozygote embryos. Another specific mutation on the endothelin receptor type B (EDNRB) gene is associated with the frame overo pattern produces Lethal white syndrome if homozygous, but carriers can be identified with a DNA test. ==Prevalence== Sooty buckskin Connemara. The cream gene is found in many breeds. It is common in American breeds including the American Quarter Horse, Morgan, American Saddlebred, Tennessee Walking Horse, and Missouri Fox Trotter. It is also seen in the Miniature horse, Akhal-Teke, Icelandic horse, Connemara pony, and Welsh pony. It is even found in certain lines of Thoroughbreds, Warmbloods, and the Lusitano. The Andalusian horse has conflicting standards, with the cream gene being recognized by some registries, but not explicitly mentioned by others. The cream gene is completely absent from the Arabian horse genepool, and is also not found in breeds with stringent color requirements, such as the Friesian horse. ==Cream mimics== A light palomino foal. Its light cream coat color gives it a superficial resemblance to a cremello, but it has dark skin and eyes, so it can only have one copy of the cream dilution gene, and cannot be a double-dilute cremello or a pseudo-double dilute. Comparison between the lightly pigmented blue eye of a perlino (top) versus a pure blue \\"unpigmented\\" eye, created by an unpigmented layer of cells at the front of the eye. Other coat colors may mimic the appearance of a cream coat color. The presence or absence of the cream gene can always be verified by the use of a DNA test. Also, as explained in \\"Mixed dilutes,\\" below, horses may simultaneously carry more than one dilution gene. Dilution genes which, by themselves, may be confused with cream dilutions include the following: * Bay dun vs. Buckskin: the action of the dun gene on bay produces a buckskin-like coat. Additional confusion occurs because in some countries, it is still customary to refer to buckskins as \\"dun\\", particularly in the British pony breeds. Bay duns tend to have a flatter coat color, more tan or peanut butter-colored than bronze, and also exhibit primitive markings. * Amber champagne vs. Buckskin: the action of the Champagne gene on bay can also produce a buckskin-like coat. Champagnes can be identified by their freckled skin, hazel eyes, and chocolate (rather than black) points. * Flaxen chestnut vs. Palomino: Horses having light chestnut coats with flaxen manes and tails, such as those found in the Haflinger breed, can be confused with palominos. However, unlike chestnuts, palomino is inherently a heterozygous condition and thus cannot be true- breeding. Furthermore, even the lightest chestnut will retain \\"red\\" character in the hair, rather than gold. * Gold champagne vs. Palomino: the action of the Champagne gene on chestnut was for many years called pumpkin-skinned palomino. However, lighter, freckled skin and hazel eyes identify a gold champagne, which can otherwise look much like a palomino. *Pearl vs. Palomino: the action of the pearl gene only occurs when the pearl allele is homozygous. In such cases, the red hairs are lightened to an apricot color.\\" Introduction to Coat Color Genetics\\" from Veterinary Genetics Laboratory, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis. Web Site accessed March 27, 2008 *Pseudo double-dilute vs. Cremello: A horse that has one cream allele and one pearl allele may resemble a homozygous cream, including pinkish skin and blue eyes. A combination of one cream and one Champagne allele may also produce a similar phenotype, though may be distinguishable by lighter yellowish or blue eyes and pale, faintly freckled skin. *White vs. Double dilute: White horses with blue or dark eyes and pink skin are born white and remain so throughout life. Cremello and isabelline horses that bleach out in the sun may approach a near-white shade, but have some skin pigment, exhibited by a slightly more peach skin tone and blue-eyed creams have a less vivid shade of blue when compared to that of an unpigmented blue-eye. * Gray vs. Double dilute: Gray horses are born a normal color and grow progressively lighter in their coat, while double-dilute creams do not. Grays that are not affected by a dilution gene do not have blue eyes or pink skin unless they are due to white markings. There are, however, records of palominos, buckskins, smoky blacks, and double-dilute creams that also carry the gray gene. ==Mixed dilutes== If a horse carries more than one type of dilution gene, additional cream mimics and other unique colors may occur. The combined effects of champagne and a single cream gene can be hard to distinguish from a double- dilute cream. Freckled skin and greenish eyes, or pedigree knowledge can yield clues, though the mystery can also be solved with a DNA test. The pearl gene or \\"barlink factor\\" is a recessive gene that affects only red pigment. When a single copy each of pearl and cream are present, the effect is quite similar to cremello. Dilutes combining the pearl gene with one copy of the cream gene are known as \\"pseudo-double dilutes\\" and produce a cream dilute phenotype that includes pale skin and blue/green eyes. DNA tests and patience are effective in determining which is the case. Some of the terms used to describe these combinations include: * Dunalino, yellow dun or palomino dun: a chestnut-based coat with one cream allele and at least one dun allele. The points are reddish, but the body coat is a paler, flatter shade of gold and primitive markings are visible. * Dunskin, buckskin dun, or buttermilk dun: a bay-based coat with one cream allele and at least one dun allele. These are quite difficult to tell apart from ordinary duns. They are a slightly paler shade, and retain their dark points and primitive markings. The pale body coat and darker head and legs of this horse are consistent with the appearance of either a \\"dunalino\\" or a \\"palomino roan.\\" * Cream dun, Cremello dun or linebacked cremello: a blue-eyed cream horse also carrying the dun gene. The primitive markings associated with the dun color are usually quite visible, especially on horses with a bay or black base coat. * Smoky grulla, silver grulla or smoky black dun: a black-based coat with one cream allele and at least one dun allele. The effect is of an extra-pale grulla. * Double-cream champagne: any blue-eyed cream horse that also carries the champagne gene. The champagne traits are, in the few known individuals, not visible. The skin is quite pink. * Amber cream or Buckskin champagne: a bay-based coat with one cream allele and at least one champagne allele. The skin and eyes have champagne traits such as skin mottling, while the coat is a pale buff color. The points are a soft, pale grayish-chocolate. * Classic cream or Smoky black champagne: a black-based coat with one cream allele and at least one champagne allele. is also an acceptable term. Like an amber cream, they retain champagne traits in the skin and eyes, and range from pale buff to pale chocolatey-gray. Even though the coat is black-based, the mane and tail tend to be darker. * Gold cream: chestnut-based coat with one cream allele and at least one champagne allele. Formerly referred to as \\"ivory champagne.\\" The champagne traits remain in the skin and eyes, and the coat is an all-over ivory color. * Sable cream or Brown buckskin champagne: brown-based coat with one cream allele and at least one champagne allele. The coat color falls between amber and classic cream. * Silver buckskin: bay-based coat with one cream allele and at least one silver dapple allele. The effect varies, as silver dapple does not act on red coats, but the buckskin's golden tone is somewhat lost. * Silver smoky black: black-based coat with one cream allele and at least one silver allele. The effect varies from chestnut-like to silver black-like. Lighter eyes can help with identification. ==Inheritance and expression== Buckskin New Forest Pony The cream locus is on exon 2 of the MATP gene; a single nucleotide polymorphism results in an aspartic acid-to-asparagine substitution (N153D). The DNA test offered by various laboratories detects this mutation. The MATP gene encodes a protein illustrated to have roles in melanogenesis in humans, mice, and medaka. Mice affected by a condition homologous to cream exhibit irregularly shaped melanosomes, which are the organelles within melanocytes that directly produce pigment. Genes in horses such as Frame and Sabino1 produce white spotting by interrupting or limiting the migration of melanocytes from the neural crest, while the cream mutation affects the nature of the pigments produced by melanocytes. Therefore the skin, eyes, and hair of horses with the cream mutation do not lack melanocytes, melanosomes, or melanins, but rather exhibit hypomelanism. Prior to the mapping of the cream gene, this locus was titled C for \\"color\\". There are two alleles in the series: the recessive, wildtype allele C and the incomplete dominant CCr. The CCr allele represents the N153D MATP mutation. * C/C recessive homozygotes are not affected by cream and have no true cream traits. * C/CCr heterozygotes have one cream allele, and one wildtype non- cream allele. Only red pigment in the hair is diluted, as seen in buckskins and palominos. * CCr/CCr homozygotes (homozygous creams) have no wildtype non- cream alleles. The red and black pigment in the hair are diluted to cream, the eyes are light blue and the skin is rosy pink. Cream was first formally studied by Adalsteinsson in 1974, who reported that the inheritance of palomino and buckskin coat colors in Icelandic horses followed a \\"semi- dominant\\" or incomplete dominant model. Adalsteinsson also noted that in heterozygotes, only the red pigment (pheomelanin) was diluted. The discovery that the palomino coat color was inextricably linked to the cream coat color was very significant. At one time, double dilutes, particularly cremellos, were barred from registration by many breed organizations. Cremello was thought by some to be a lethal white or albino coloring and a potential genetic defect. There also were known health implications of albinism in humans, and cultural prejudices; while a heroic figure such as Roy Rogers rode a golden palomino, the \\"Albino\\" in Mary O'Hara's Thunderhead portrayed a horse with a freakish defect. These coat colors carried vastly different cultural significance. Because the experience of breeders of palomino and buckskin horses indicated that blue-eyed cream offspring of these animals were not genetically defective, some of the research that took place nearly thirty years after Adalsteinsson's studies that identified the nature of cream dilution was directly supported by breed registries that had historically barred blue eyed creams. Smoky black Icelandic horse. ===Cryptic creams=== The cream gene's preferential effect on red pigment has not yet been explained. The champagne dilution affects both black and red pigments equally, the silver dapple gene affects only black pigment, and pearl exhibits a recessive mode of inheritance and only affects red pigment. Unlike the cream gene, pearl does not seem to affect the mane and tail to a greater extent than the body coat, a feature of cream that is most vividly illustrated in the palomino coat color. This characteristic of the cream gene is also unexplained. The disparity in effects on red and black pigments is easy to identify in buckskins, with their black points, but it is also visible in CCr/CCr homozygotes: perlinos (homozygous cream on a bay coat) often retain points that are a darker shade of cream. This unusual feature enables what are called cryptic creams. A certain percentage of dark bay, seal brown, and black horses exhibit such subtle dilution of their coats as to be misregistered. In the study that mapped the cream gene, three horses registered as seal brown, dark bay or bay were actually smoky black and buckskin. This is one way by which the cream gene is transmitted through generations without being identified. Horses born palomino, buckskin, and smoky black, but also carry the gray gene, have a hair coat that turns white as they age and are usually registered as \\"gray\\" rather than as their birth color. This is particularly a common occurrence in the Connemara breed. Horses sold after turning fully gray may surprise breeders by producing golden or cream offspring. This effect - stronger expression on red pigment - is also seen in coat pattern genes in horses. In general, white markings are more pervasive in chestnuts than in non-chestnuts, to the extent that homozygous non-chestnuts (which carry the \\"Extension\\" (E) gene and may also carry the Agouti gene) were more modestly marked than non-chestnuts heterozygous for the E gene. This effect has also been identified and studied in the Leopard complex patterns. Sooty palomino, note the streaks in the mane. ===Analogous conditions in other animals=== The MATP gene is best known in humans as being the location of a mutation that results in human type IV oculocutaneous albinism (OCA4). Type IV oculocutaneous albinism, like other types of human albinism, results in hypopigmentation of the skin and eyes, with increased rates of skin cancer and reduced visual acuity. None of these effects are associated with the equine cream gene. Other human MATP polymorphisms result in normal pigment variations, specifically fair skin, light eyes, and light hair in Caucasian populations. A polymorphism on the mouse MATP gene is known to be the cause of the underwhite coat color phenotype. The phenotype was first identified in the 1960s, and since then has been mapped successfully. Affected individuals have a reduction in eye and coat pigmentation, and irregularly shaped melanosomes. ==See also== *Equine coat color genetics *Equine coat color *White (horse) *Melanism *Gray (horse) *Palomino *Buckskin (horse) *Dun gene *Champagne gene *Silver dapple gene *Albinism *Leucism *Lethal white syndrome ==References== Category:Horse coat colors ","title":"Cream gene"},{"id":"1278162","text":"Pouched rats are a group of African rodents in the subfamily Cricetomyinae.

Graduating from Yale College, he was ordained as a minister by the Congregational Council of Southold, Long Island in October 1738. ==Preaching career and controversies== It was around this time that he met Presbyterian revivalist Gilbert Tennent and English evangelical George Whitefield. The success of Whitefield's style of revival preaching convinced Davenport that God was calling him, and in 1741 - having by chance opened his Bible to 1 Samuel 14, where Jonathan and his armor-bearer attack the Philistine camp, and taken this as a sign - he left his congregation to become an itinerant. His actions during this time often caused him to run afoul of both ecclesiastical and civil authorities. Davenport often denounced fellow clergymen for their conduct, such as when he labeled Joseph Noyes, the pastor of New Haven, a \\"wolf in sheep's clothing.\\" Davenport is also noted for his \\"Bonfires of the Vanities\\", the public burnings he organized in New London. As with those of Girolamo Savonarola, Davenport urged his followers to destroy immoral books and luxury items with fire. He often said that he could distinguish people who were saved versus people who were damned just by looking at them. In June 1742, Davenport and fellow preacher Benjamin Pomeroy were arraigned before the Colonial Assembly at Hartford, Connecticut, charged with disorderly conduct. Pomeroy's case was dismissed, but Davenport was declared to be under \\"enthusiastical impressions and impulses, and thereby disturbed in the rational faculties of his mind.\\" No punishment was meted out, but Davenport was sent back to his former parish of Southold. On March 7, 1743, Davenport exhibited perhaps his most bizarre behavior yet, in an incident which garnished him lasting fame—or infamy. The day before, he had led a crowd to burn a large pile of books; this day he called them to throw their expensive and fancy clothing onto the fire, so as to prove their full commitment to God. Davenport—leading by example—removed his pants and cast them into the bonfire. One woman in the crowd quickly grabbed his pants out of the blaze, and handed them back to Davenport, entreating him to get a hold of himself. \\"This act broke Davenport's spell,\\" wrote historian Thomas Kidd. Davenport had gone too far, charisma or no, and the crowd quickly dispersed.Thomas S. Kidd, The Great Awakening: A Brief History with Documents (New York: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2008), 1. In July 1744 Davenport published a retraction claiming that he had been possessed by \\"demonic spirits.\\" According to the Boston Weekly Post Boy of 28 March 1743, Davenport had exhibited signs of physical distress along with his unorthodox behavior, symptoms that at the time would have been interpreted as evidence of demonic possession. ==Later life== On 27 October 1754, Davenport became pastor of Maidenhead and Hopewell, New Jersey, an office he held until his death in 1757. He was buried in the Old Cemetery lot of the Pennington (N.J.)

Renowned for his military skill and embodiment of chivalry, he was made a marshal of France. ==Biography== He was the son of Jean I Le Maingre, also called Boucicaut and likewise a marshal of France. He became a page at the court of Charles V of France, and at the age of 12 he accompanied Louis II, Duke of Bourbon, in a campaign against Normandy. At age 16 he was knighted by Louis on the eve of the Battle of Roosebeke (27 November 1382). In 1383, he began the first of his journeys that would take up more than twenty years of his life. In 1384, he undertook his first journey to Prussia, in order to assist the Teutonic Order in their war against the pagan Lithuanians, who would convert to Roman Catholicism in 1386. After some campaigns against the Moors in Spain, and against Toulouse in France he again accompanied the duke of Bourbon, this time to Spain, which had become a secondary battlefield of the Hundred Years' War. From there he travelled for two years through the Balkans, the Near East, and the Holy Land, in the company of his friend Renaud of Roye and later with Philip of Artois, Count of Eu. There, he and his companions composed the Livre des Cent Ballades, a poetical defense of the chaste knight the central figure of chivalry, which Johan Huizinga found a startling contrast with the facts of his military career. Arms of Jean II Le Meingre,d'argent à l'aigle éployée de gueules becquée et membrée d'azur, Argent, an eagle displayed Gules armed and beaked Azure In 1390, while the Truce of Leulinghem had temporarily interrupted the war with England, Boucicaut and two other French knights set up the tournament of Saint-Inglevert, where he jousted, along with his two comrades, against redoubtable English knights, unhorsing three of his 18 opponents. The next year he travelled to Prussia for a third time. Because of his great service in the war against the heathens in Livonia and Prussia, he was named Marshal of France on 25 December 1391 by Charles VI at the cathedral of St. Martin in Tours. In 1396, he took part in the joint French-Hungarian crusade against the Ottoman Empire, which suffered a heavy defeat on September 28 at the Battle of Nicopolis. He was taken hostage by the Ottoman sultan Bayezid I, but, unlike many of his companions, escaped execution and was eventually ransomed. In 1399, he founded the Emprise de l'Escu vert à la Dame Blanche, a chivalric order inspired by the ideal of courtly love: \\"one might have supposed him cured of all chivalrous delusions after the catastrophe of Nicopolis\\", remarked Huizinga. In the same year, he was sent with six ships carrying 1,200 men to assist Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaeologus against the Ottomans, who were besieging Constantinople. In 1401, because of his military accomplishments and his knowledge of the east, he was appointed French governor of Genoa, which had fallen to Charles VI in 1396. He successfully repelled an attack from King Janus of Cyprus, who tried to take back the city of Famagusta on Cyprus, which had been captured by Genoa. Later on, Boucicaut wanted to attack Alexandria but he was prevented by adverse winds to land there, he later went to Tripoli, then after a costly attempt to capture it, he went south to Botron which was burned and pillaged, then to Beirut on 10 August 1403, which was also sacked and 500 bundles of spices worth 30,000 ducats were taken from the Venetian warehouses there, he later went to attack Sidon then Latakia, which both showed resistance due to strong garrison, he returned to Famagusta in late August, to eventually settle in Rhodes in September, where he dispatched 500 men with two large ships who tried in vain to take Alexandria. On his return, he was defeated by the Venetians at the Battle of Modon on 7 October 1403. After some struggles in the Mediterranean the Genoese freed themselves from French rule by 1409. Boucicaut returned to France and became involved in the rivalry between Burgundy and Orléans. In the Battle of Agincourt in 1415 he commanded the French vanguard, but was captured by the English and died six years later in Yorkshire. He was buried in the cathedral of Tours, in his family's chapel, with the epitaph \\"Grand Constable of the Emperor and of the Empire of Constantinople.\\" ==Notes== ==References== * Anonymous, Le Livre des faits du bon messire Jehan le Maingre, dit Boucicaut. maréschal de France et gouverneur de Jennes * Châtelet, Albert, L' âge d'or du manuscrit à peintures en France au temps de Charles VI et les heures du Maréchal Boucicaut, Dijon 2000. * Lalande, Denis, Jean II le Meingre, dit Boucicaut: (1366–1421) - étude d'une biographie héroïque, Genève 1988. * * ==External links== * Category:Marshals of France Category:People of the Hundred Years' War Category:Christians of the Battle of Nicopolis Category:People of the Reconquista Category:People of the Northern Crusades Category:Christians of the Crusades Category:French prisoners of war in the Hundred Years' War Category:1366 births Category:1421 deaths Category:French prisoners of war in the 14th century Category:14th- century French people Category:15th-century French people Category:Medieval French knights ","title":"Jean II Le Maingre"},{"id":"1278177","text":"A mohur is a gold coin that was formerly minted by several governments, including British India and some of the princely states which existed alongside it, the Mughal Empire, Kingdom of Nepal, and Afghanistan.

Founded in 1983, The Wall Street Journal Europe was printed in nine locations throughout the region – Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, the U.K. and Israel. The paper was distributed in more than 60 countries with almost 80% of its subscribers European citizens. The Wall Street Journal Europe drew on the Dow Jones network of more than 1,900 editors and reporters worldwide, including more than 400 in Europe alone, operating from 30 news bureaus across the EMEA region. Its website, offered news and analysis, opinion, market data and multimedia features tailored for a European audience by a London-based editorial team. Blogs include New Europe covering Eastern and Central Europe; Iain Martin's blog on U.K. Politics The Source; and Real Time Brussels, offering analysis on events through the European business day. Content was also available via mobile devices, including a Europe edition of the WSJ.com Blackberry Reader; and a mobile-optimized website which provided continually updated news, information and analysis from Europe.WSJ.com, via any web- enabled mobile device or smartphone. Growth figures for circulation of The Wall Street Journal Europe may not be directly comparable to that of other newspapers beginning January 2008 due to the Journal's contract with Executive Learning Partnership (ELP) of the Netherlands. This agreement involved ELP's purchasing copies of the newspaper at between 1¢ and 5¢ cents a copy, well below normal market price. These copies, given at no cost to students, represented 41% of The Wall Street Journal Europe circulation by 2010. Since ELP received payments from the Journal through intermediary companies, some journalists and a whistleblower then employed by the Journal alleged that the newspaper was secretly boosting circulation figures by buying its own papers. This could have had a positive impact on the newspaper's advertising revenues. The contract also committed the Journal to publishing articles that reportedly promoted ELP's activities. While maintaining that the arrangement was legitimate and appropriate, the European managing director of the Journal's parent Dow Jones & Company, Andrew Langhoff, resigned in October 2011. Les Hinton, who was chief executive officer of Dow Jones & Company and who was reportedly advised of the arrangement with ELP, resigned July 2011 in conjunction with the unrelated News International phone hacking scandal. ==References== ==External links== * Europe Category:Business newspapers Category:International newspapers Category:Newspapers published in Europe Category:Publications established in 1983 Category:1983 establishments in Europe Category:Business in Europe ","title":"The Wall Street Journal Europe"},{"id":"1278184","text":"alt= North American Cuisine includes foods native to or popular in countries of North America, such as Canadian cuisine, American cuisine, African American cuisine, Mexican cuisine and Central American cuisine.

Quoting Martin Gardner: \\"Ninel has been caught cheating more than once by Soviet Establishment scientists.\\" In 1987, Kulagina sued and won a partial victory in a defamation case brought against a Soviet government magazine that had accused her of fraud. ==Biography== Kulagina, who was born in 1926, joined the Red Army at age fourteen, entering its tank regiment during World War II, but she was a housewife at the time that her alleged psychic abilities were studied and she entered international discourse in the 1960s. During the Cold War, silent black-and-white films were produced, in which she appeared to move objects on a table in front of her without touching them. These films were allegedly made under controlled conditions for Soviet authorities and caused excitement for many psychic researchers around the world, some of whom believed that they represented clear evidence for the existence of psychic phenomena. According to reports from the Soviet Union, 40 scientists, two of whom were Nobel laureates, studied Kulagina. In Investigating Psychics, Larry Kettlekamp claims that Kulagina was filmed separating broken eggs that had been submerged in water, moving apart the whites and yolks, during which event such physical changes were recorded as accelerated and altered: heartbeat, brain waves and electromagnetic field.Kettlekamp, Larry. (1977) Investigating Psychics: Five Life Histories William Morrow & Company, New York. 16-17. Reproduced, Understanding a Midsummer Night's Dream: A Student Casebook to Issues, Sources, and Historical Documents by Faith Nostbakken. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003. pp. 179-180. To ensure that external electromagnetic impulses did not interfere, she was placed inside of a metal cage while she supposedly demonstrated an ability to remove a marked matchstick from a pile of matchsticks under a glass dome. Kulagina claimed that she first recognized her ability, which she believed she had inherited from her mother, when she realized that items spontaneously moved around her when she was angry. Kulagina said that in order to manifest the effect, she required a period of meditation to clear her mind of all thoughts. When she had obtained the focus required, she reported a sharp pain in her spine and the blurring of her eyesight. Reportedly, storms interfered with her ability to perform psychokinetic acts. One of Kulagina's most celebrated experiments took place in a Leningrad laboratory on 10 March 1970. Having initially studied the ability to move inanimate objects, scientists were curious to see if Kulagina's abilities extended to cells, tissues, and organs. Sergeyev was one of many scientists present when Kulagina attempted to use her energy to stop the beating of a frog's heart floating in solution. He said that she focused intently on the heart and apparently made it beat faster, then slower, and using extreme intent of thought, stopped it.Moss, Thelma (1979). The Body Electric. J. P. Tarcher. p. 79. ==Dispute== Many individuals and organizations, such as the James Randi Educational Foundation and the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims on the Paranormal (CICAP) express skepticism regarding claims of psychokinesis. Massimo Polidoro has written that the long preparation times and uncontrolled environments (such as hotel rooms) in which the experiments with Kulagina took place left much potential for trickery. Magicians and skeptics have argued that Kulagina's feats could easily be performed by one experienced in sleight of hand, through means such as cleverly concealed or disguised threads, small pieces of magnetic metal, or mirrors and the Cold War-era Soviet Union had an obvious motive for falsifying or exaggerating results in the potential propaganda value in appearing to win a \\"Psi Race\\" analogous to the concurrent Space Race or arms race.Kulagina, Nina in An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural. James Randi Educational Foundation.Couttie, Bob (1988). Forbidden Knowledge: The Paranormal Paradox. Lutterworth Press. p. 141. \\"A piece of thread can be stretched between the hands and used to move objects across smooth tables. If, like the famous Russian psychic, Nina Kulagina, one works on a lighted table even a heavy thread will be lost in the glare, especially on film and photographs.\\"Stein, Gordon (1996). The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal. Prometheus Books. p. 384. \\"Nina Kulagina, Geller's Russian counterpart, used invisible thread to move matches across a table and to float Ping-Pong balls. The thread was manipulated by her husband in a side room. Any magician present would have recognized the method at once and simply passed a hand through the space where the thread went before Nina's husband could draw it out of the room.\\" Vladimir Lvov published an article in Pravda which accused Kulagina of fraud. Lvov wrote that she performed one of her tricks by concealing a magnet on her body. The article also reported that Kulagina had been arrested for cheating the public out of five thousand rubles. Science writer Martin Gardner described Kulagina as a \\"pretty, plump, dark eyed little charlatan\\" who had been caught using tricks to move objects.Gardner, Martin (1983). Science: Good, Bad and Bogus. Oxford University Press. p. 244. According to Gardner, she was \\"caught cheating more than once by Soviet Establishment scientists.\\" However, Kulagina countersued and won a partial victory on the suit. ==References== ==Further reading== *Martin Gardner.

He was also president of the National Liberal Party (PNL) and the vice-president of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (ELDR), two positions he assumed in 2004. He was the President of the Senate, second position in the Romanian state, from 10 March 2014 until he resigned on 2 September 2019, having previously resigned from the PNL party, becoming an independent senator. In July 2014, he established the Liberal Reformist Party. ==Personal life== Calin Popescu-Tăriceanu was born in Bucharest. His mother, Alexandrina Louiza, was of Greek ancestryPress Releases-\\"The perception about Romania has improved in the last months\\", have said to the Prime Minister Calin Popescu-Tariceanu the representatives of the Hellenic Association from Romania and those of the Romanian Orthodox Community \\"Stefan cel Mare si Sfant\\", that he met to Athena, in the evening –her mother was fully Greek while her father was half-Romanian, half-Greek.\\"Premierul Tariceanu preocupat de romanii emigrati in Grecia \\", Ziua, 7 July 2005. He has been married five times and has two children. Popescu-Tăriceanu is a graduate of the Technical University of Civil Engineering of Bucharest and has a master's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. ==Early political career== Between 1996 and 1997, he served as Minister of Industries and Commerce in Victor Ciorbea's government. Between 1996 and 2004 he was a member of the Chamber of Deputies of Romania, representing Bucharest. Between 2000 and 2004, he was vice president of the PNL group in Parliament, as well as vice president of the Budget, Finances and Insurance Committee in the Chamber of Deputies.Calin Popescu-Tariceanu, Vicepresedinte al Partidului National Liberal, Membru al Camerei Deputatilor ==Prime Minister== Traian Băsescu (left) and Tăriceanu in 2005 Following the victory of Traian Băsescu in the 2004 presidential election, Băsescu appointed Popescu-Tăriceanu as Prime Minister, in line with a pre-electoral agreement between the two parties of the Justice and Truth Alliance. The new government took office on 29 December; it was approved by Parliament by a vote of 265 for and 200 against. He became the first National Liberal prime minister since 1937. The Tăriceanu government oversaw a number of major reforms, such as the introduction of a flat tax, the revaluation of the leu, the abolition of conscription and professionalization of the Romanian Armed Forces, and the accession of Romania to the European Union in 2007. It also coincided with a considerable economic boom in Romania. However, economists criticized several of Tăriceanu's policies, such as the introduction of a \\"first registration tax\\" for motor vehicles, faulty management of over 2 billion euros acquired following the privatization of BCR, and, most prominently, an increase in the number of public servants and their salaries, which resulted in a major increase in public spending on the eve of the financial crisis. On 7 July 2005, Popescu-Tăriceanu announced that he and his cabinet would resign in order to trigger early elections. The announcement of the resignation was prompted by the Constitutional Court's decision to block a set of laws designed to reform the judicial system. President Traian Băsescu had been pushing for early elections since his victory in the 2004 elections. On 19 July, Popescu-Tăriceanu reversed the decision and announced he would not resign, citing the severe floods that hit the country (for example the Comăneşti floods). Floods killed 66 people in Romania that year, leaving thousands homeless.EurMonitor Guvernare: Inundatii dezastruoase Transparenta Guvernare europeana: Integrare uniunea europeana stiri UE eveniment finantari aderare joburi – EurActiv.ro At that point, relations began to publicly sour between Popescu-Tăriceanu and President Băsescu, who refused to meet with the Prime Minister in the days following the announced reversal. In the view of former President Emil Constantinescu, however, relations between Popescu-Tăriceanu and President Băsescu started to become strained following allegations of Băsescu's past membership in the Securitate (during Communist Romania). In September 2005, a newspaper alleged that on 9 April 2004, Tăriceanu bought 10 million shares of the Rompetrol company based on insider information, shares that were sold later that year after he became Prime Minister. Several other publicly known persons were cited to testify about their involvement in questionable transactions with Rompetrol shares, including the company's CEO, Dinu Patriciu. On 5 April 2006 Basescu stated that he regrets naming Tariceanu Prime-Minister, and accused him of partnership with other groups.Cotidianul:Basescu: Regret ca l-am numit pe Tariceanu premier On 29 June 2006, Tăriceanu officially announced that the National Liberal Party supports the withdrawal of Romanian troops from international battle zones where they are deployed without a mandate from the United Nations, NATO, or the European Union. This mainly concerns the Romanian troops in Iraq (present there following the Iraq War). This position is strongly opposed by President Băsescu. On 14 March 2007, Popescu-Tăriceanu postponed the elections for the European Parliament claiming that the political environment was too unstable due to discussions regarding President's impeachment, the subsequent referendum, and the fact that President Basescu asked for a referendum regarding uninominal elections. The media also pointed out that Popescu-Tăriceanu's National Liberal Party stood to perform poorly in the elections if they were held at the time. Tăriceanu at a cabinet meeting in 2007 On 21 March 2007, he assumed ad interim the office of Minister of Foreign Affairs, 43 days after Ungureanu's resignation, because President Băsescu refused to accept the nomination of Adrian Cioroianu. On 5 April 2007, the Constitutional Court decided \\"The Romanian President's refusal to name a member of Government at the proposal of Prime Minister started a jurisdictional conflict of a constitutional nature.[...] The Romanian President has no right to veto, but he can ask the Prime Minister to renounce his proposal, if he observes that the proposed person does not meet the legal conditions required to be a member of Government\\".Antena 3: Comunicat de presa al Curtii constitutionale The same day, Cioroianu assumed the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs. On 1 April 2007, Tariceanu dismissed the ministers of the pro-Băsescu Democratic Party and formed a minority government with the Democratic Union of Hungarians;\\"Romania's prime minister names new Cabinet of minority government\\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), 2 April 2007. the government was approved by Parliament on 3 April, with the support of the Social Democratic Party.Adam Brown, \\"Romanian Lawmakers Approve New Cabinet in First Test of Support\\", Bloomberg.com, 3 April 2007. Popescu-Tăriceanu's government survived a no-confidence vote on 3 October 2007, following a motion brought by the Social Democratic Party. Although 220 members of parliament voted in favor of the motion and only 152 voted against it, the motion fell short of the necessary 232 votes.\\"Romania's government survives no-confidence motion\\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), 3 October 2007. == Late political career == On 26 February 2014, Tăriceanu left PNL due to their intention to leave the Social-Liberal Union and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) to join the European People's Party. One day later, he announced that he would launch a new political party, the Liberal Reformist Party (PLR). The party's first congress was held on 1–2 August 2014. Popescu-Tăriceanu was elected president of the new party. On 4 March, PNL leader Crin Antonescu stepped down his position as President of the Senate. On 10 March, Popescu-Tăriceanu was elected as the new President of the Senate, with the votes of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and serving as independent senator.Senatorul independent Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu a fost ales președinte al Senatului , Agerpres.ro, 10 March 2014. In late July 2014, Popescu-Tăriceanu launched his candidacy for the 2014 presidential elections.Tariceanu candideaza la alegerile prezidentiale, Ziare.com, 27 June 2014 Due to problems with registering his new political party, he ran as independent.Specimenul buletinului de vot , bec2014.ro Tăriceanu placed third in the election's first round, with 5,36%, behind Klaus Iohannis and Victor Ponta. Later, he announced that he would support Ponta in the second round of the elections. However, in the run-off, Ponta was defeated by Iohannis by a 54.5%-45.5% margin. In July 2015, PLR announced its merger with the Conservative Party (PC), to form a new party, Alliance of Liberals and Democrats (ALDE), Tăriceanu becoming its co- president. In 2017, Tăriceanu, claimed that he was a staunch Monarchist and \\"Constitutional monarchy has the advantage of placing the monarch over political games, which is not our case: the president, instead of being an arbitrator, prefers to be a player. \\"http://adevarul.ro/news/politica/monarhia-salveaza-psd-presedintele-executiv- psd-vorbeste-posibil-referendum-tema-monarhiei-loc- acesta-1_5a37a9f95ab6550cb8531ab9/index.html ==Controversies== Tăriceanu has been accused by President Băsescu of interfering with justice in Dinu Patriciu's benefit. On 24 January 2006, Monica Macovei, then Minister of Justice, made public a meeting with Tăriceanu which took place 7 months before (in June 2005), and to which Tăriceanu invited Dinu Patriciu. Patriciu complained to Macovei about alleged procedural problems regarding his case. Macovei accused Tăriceanu of interfering with justice. On 20 February 2006 Tăriceanu declared on TVR1:\\" I recognise my fault. I didn't act correctly. But I didn't influence justice.\\" \\"Îmi recunosc vina. Nu am procedat corect. Dar nu am influenţat justiţia\\"Tariceanu despre intalnirea din 2005 cu Macovei si Patriciu: Nu am procedat corect – Realitatea TV – Politică Elena Udrea recalled that, while she was Presidential Counsellor, she saw a note written by Tăriceanu. In a few days President Băsescu found the note and made it public, saying that \\"The Prime Minister suggested to me a partnership, but, unfortunately, with our oligarchies\\" \\"Domnul prim-ministru imi propunea un parteneriat, dar, din pacate, cu oligarhiile noastre\\". The note was about a complaint from Petromidia about the 27 May procedure problems: > Dear Traian, > 1\\\\.

In May 2007, Patriciu won a lawsuit against the Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI), which illegally tapped his phones for two years.

It is the manganese endmember of the manganese-iron wolframite solid solution series. It forms reddish brown to black monoclinic prismatic submetallic crystals. The crystals are typically flattened and occur with fine striations. It has a high specific gravity of 7.15 and a Mohs hardness of 4.5. It is transparent to translucent with perfect cleavage. Refractive index values are nα = 2.170 - 2.200, nβ = 2.220, and nγ = 2.300 - 2.320. Typical occurrence is in association with high-temperature hydrothermal vein deposits and altered granites with greisen, granite pegmatites and in alluvial deposits. It occurs associated with cassiterite, arsenopyrite, molybdenite, tourmaline, topaz, rhodochrosite and fluorite. It was first described in 1865 for an occurrence in the Erie and Enterprise veins, Mammoth district, Nye County, Nevada, and named after the German mining engineer and metallurgist, Adolf Hübner from Freiberg, Saxony. ==Introduction== Hübnerite is a rare mineral from the rare family wolframite. It is considered to be one of the principle ores of tungsten. It is usually identified by the dark color, one direction of perfect cleavage and high specific gravity all serving to distinguish it from other minerals. The first recorded identification of the wolframite family was back in 1948 but it was not added as a mineral until 1951. ==Composition== Since hübnerite comes from a family with only two end members it would be easier to explain the composition of the wolframite family since there is not enough data on hübnerite itself. The primary formula of the wolframite series is (Fe,Mn)WO4. The predominance of either iron or manganese results in formation of one of two minerals, the compositional end-members FeWO4 (ferberite) and MnWO4 (hübnerite), respectively.. Hübnerite is rarer than ferberite because of the difficulty of substituting manganese for iron. There are also other analogues, such as MgWO4. These compounds are usually referred to as \\"wolframites\\" because they share the wolframite structure, but are not naturally occurring minerals, typically being produced for industrial applications, e.g., crystal scintillators. ==Structure== Sample from the Pasto Bueno District, Pallasca Province, Ancash Department, Peru, showing deep red internal reflections when backlit (Size: 6.6 x 4.2 x 1.6 cm) Hübnerite is a rare end-member of the wolframite group, and has the same crystal structure as other members of the family. The crystal structure contains distorted tetrahedral (WO4) and octahedral ((Fe. Mn)O6) units. The wolframite family represents complete solid solution between Fe2+ and Mn2+. In ferberite, the percentage of WO3 is around 76.3% whereas in hübnerite it is around 76.6%. In naturally occurring minerals the percent range falls within 20-80 percent. In the past it was thought that the wolframite structure possesses orthorhombic symmetry but in fact it possesses monoclinic symmetry. Short prismatic, flattened or wedge-shaped crystals are the common morphologies of wolframite crystals. In some rare cases the crystals occur doubly terminated. It is common for the faces to be striated parallel to the c axis. In most cases, wolframite is found embedded in quartz as subparallel crystalline masses. ==Physical properties== Color differences between members of the wolframite family are clear and marked. The color of hübnerite varies from yellowish brown to reddish brown. Crystal and crystalline masses of hübnerite show a variety of lusters from adamantine, submetallic to resinous luster. In thin splints, hübnerite can be either transparent or translucent. The streak is related to the color being a shade lighter. All the wolframite minerals exhibit perfect cleavage on {010}. On {100} and {102}, parting is less well- developed. Hübnerite exhibits brittle and uneven fracture. It is common for all members of the wolframite family to show simple contact twins on {100} or rarely interpenetrant twins on {001}. The hardness of hübnerite is between 4 and 4.5 and its specific gravity is between 7.12 and 7.18. ==Geological occurrence== Hübnerite is a rare member of the wolframite group. Hübnerite is usually found within pegmatites and high-temperature quartz veins. Hübnerite does not occur on its own, but is typically associated with other minerals such as cassiterite, scheelite, quartz, galena, arsenopyrite, native bismuth, pyrite, and sphalerite. ==History and uses== Hübnerite was not the original name giving to the mineral. Hübnerite is a synonym of the original name, megabasite. The name megabasite was given to the mineral by A. Breithaupt in 1852. The name hübnerite was given to the mineral by E.N. Riotte in 1865 to honor the metallurgist Adolph Hübner. Hübnerite is primarily used as a source of tungsten. Tungsten is used to harden metal in the manufacture of high-speed tools. ==See also== *List of minerals *List of minerals named after people ==References== * Category:Manganese(II) minerals Category:Tungstate minerals Category:Monoclinic minerals ","title":"Hübnerite"},{"id":"1278226","text":"Amani Askari Toomer (born September 8, 1974) is a former American football wide receiver and punt returner who played his entire career for the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL). He registered over 1,000 receiving yards each season from 1999 to 2003, was a member of the 2007 Giants team that won Super Bowl XLII, and holds Giants' club records with 9,497 receiving yards, 668 receptions and 54 receiving touchdowns. He also returned 109 punts for 1,060 yards and three touchdowns. As a rookie in 1996, he led the NFL with an average of 16.6 yards on 18 punt returns. Toomer played college football at the University of Michigan from 1992 to 1995. In 1994, he broke the school's single-season record with 1,096 receiving yards and was a finalist for the Biletnikoff Award and a first-team All-Big Ten honoree. Toomer finished his college career ranked second (now fourth) in Michigan history with 2,657 receiving yards. ==Early years== Toomer was born in Berkeley, California, in 1974. His first name, \\"Amani\\", is Swahili for peace, and his middle name, \\"Askari\\", is Swahili for policeman. Toomer's father, Donald Toomer, played college football for Woody Hayes at Ohio State. His uncle is comedian George Wallace. Toomer began playing Pee-Wee Football as a lineman for the Berkeley Cougars and as a receiver, kicker, punter, linebacker and running back for the Richmond Steelers. Toomer attended De La Salle High School in Concord, California. As a football player at De La Salle, Toomer was selected as a Parade All-American and a USA Today All-USA player. ==University of Michigan== Toomer enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1992 and played college football for the Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1992 to 1995. As a freshman and sophomore in 1992 and 1993, he started only three games (two in 1992 and one in 1993) and was principally used as a backup to the team's #1 receiver, Derrick Alexander. Toomer caught 16 passes for 238 yards in 1992 and 29 passes for 565 yards in 1993.(to retrieve Toomer's college statistics, enter \\"toomer\\" in the box for the player's last name) ===1994 season=== As a junior in 1994, Toomer did not start any games for Michigan, as Mercury Hayes was the starting flanker in all 12 games. Despite technically being a \\"backup\\" to Hayes, Toomer in 1994 broke Jack Clancy's single-season Michigan record with 1,096 receiving yards.(To retrieve a list of Michigan's leading single- season receiving leaders, go to the section for \\"Individual Statistical Leaders\\" and select the dropdowns for Season Receiving Yards. As of the end of the 2014 season, six players led by Jeremy Gallon have now surpassed Toomer's 1994 receiving yardage.) With Todd Collins at quarterback, Toomer was the 1994 Wolverines' leading receiver with 54 receptions for 1,096 yards, an average of 20.3 yards per reception. Toomer also finished the season as the Big Ten Conference's leading receiver with an average of 93.9 receiving yards per game. He had a career-high 179 receiving yards, including touchdown receptions of 46 and 38 yards, in the Wolverines' 1994 season-opening victory over Boston College. He also returned a punt 72 yards for a touchdown against Illinois. Toomer was a finalist for the Biletnikoff Award in 1994 and was selected by both the conference coaches and media as a first-team wide receiver on the 1994 All-Big Ten team. ===1995 season=== As a senior, Toomer finally became a starter, starting 12 games at split end for the 1995 Michigan team. However, Toomer was routinely double-teamed in 1995, opening the way for Mercury Hayes to lead the team in both receptions and receiving yardage. Toomer finished the 1995 season with 44 receptions for 758 yards and seven touchdowns. He had his best game of the season in a 52-17 victory over Minnesota, catching five passes for 174 yards and two touchdowns, including a career-long 75-yard touchdown reception from Brian Griese. ===Career overview=== In four seasons at Michigan, Toomer had 124 receptions for 2,144 yards (17.3 per catch) and 12 receiving touchdowns. He finished his college career ranked second (now fourth) in Michigan history with 2,657 receiving yards.(To retrieve a list of Michigan's leading career receiving leaders, go to the section for \\"Individual Statistical Leaders\\" and select the dropdowns for Career Receiving Yards.) Toomer was also used as a punt and kick returner at Michigan. He returned 46 punts for 384 yards (8.3 yards per return) and two touchdowns. He also returned 14 kickoffs for 306 yards (21.9 yards per return). ==Professional football== ===Return specialist: 1996–1998=== Toomer was selected by the New York Giants in the second round (34th overall pick) of the 1996 NFL Draft. In July 1996, he signed a three-year contract with the Giants providing a $670,000 signing bonus and salaries of $269,000 in 1996, $336,000 in 1997, and $403,000 in 1998. In his first three seasons with the Giants, Toomer was principally used as a punt and kickoff returner. In his first NFL game, the opening game of the 1996 season, Toomer set a Giants' record with an 87-yard punt return for a touchdown against the Buffalo Bills. He returned a second punt for a touchdown that season against the Philadelphia Eagles, before injuring his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and spending the rest of the season on injured reserve. Toomer led the NFL in 1996 with an average of 16.1 yards on 19 punt returns. During the 1997 season, Toomer appeared in all 16 games for the Giants and returned 47 punts for 455 yards, an average of 9.7 yards per return. He registered his third punt return touchdown. He also caught his first touchdown pass on October 19, 1997, a 56-yard reception from Danny Kanell against the Detroit Lions. In 1998, Toomer again appeared in all 16 games for the Giants. He returned 35 punts for 252 yards, an average of 7.1 yards per return. He also began to see increased playing time as a receiver, registering 27 catches for 360 yards and five touchdowns. In Week 14, in a come-from-behind victory over the previously-undefeated Denver Broncos, Toomer caught a 37-yard touchdown pass from Kent Graham with 48 seconds left in the game as the Giants ruined the Broncos' dream of a perfect season by winning 20–16. Toomer later publicly acknowledged that his slow start as an NFL receiver was the result of exercise-induced asthma which he had hidden for years. After seeking treatment for the condition, his receiving career blossomed in 1999 and 2000. ===Prime years: 1999–2003=== During the 1999 New York Giants season, Toomer became a starting wide receiver in all 16 games. That year, he broke the team record for receptions in a season (79), and his 1,183 receiving yards were the second-highest in team history behind Homer Jones. In 2000, Toomer appeared in all 16 regular season games (14 as a starter) for the Giants and posted solid totals with 78 receptions for 1,094 yards and seven touchdowns. With Kerry Collins at quarterback, the 2000 Giants team advanced to Super Bowl XXXV (a loss to the Baltimore Ravens), and Toomer started all three postseason games for the team. He totaled 10 catches for 135 yards and a touchdown in the 2000–01 NFL playoffs. During the 2001 New York Giants season, Toomer appeared in all 16 regular season games, caught more than 70 passes, and gained over 1,000 receiving yards for the third consecutive year. Toomer had the best year of his NFL career in 2002. He set Giants' single-season records with 82 receptions and 1,343 receiving yards. His eight receiving touchdowns in 2002 was also a career-high. His total of 204 receiving yards against the Indianapolis Colts was also the highest total for a Giants wide receiver in a 60-minute game (two players had higher receiving totals, but both of those games went to overtime). In 2003, Toomer started all 16 games and had his fifth consecutive season with at least 1,000 receiving yards. He totaled 63 catches for 1,057 yards and five touchdowns. In the second game of the season, a Monday night game against the Dallas Cowboys, Toomer broke Frank Gifford's club record for receiving yardage. ===2004 to 2006 seasons=== The 2004 season marked the first time since Toomer's rookie year in which he did not score a touchdown. Toomer appeared in 15 games and had 51 catches for 747 yards, the sixth consecutive season in which he topped 50 catches and 700 yards. During the 2005 season, the Giants had a new starting quarterback, Eli Manning, who threw for almost 3,800 yards. Plaxico Burress took over as the Giants' #1 receiver, but Toomer still started all 16 games and had 60 receptions for 684 yards and seven touchdowns. Toomer's 2005 highlights included a last-second touchdown reception against the Denver Broncos, a late game-tying touchdown at Seattle, and a fourth-and-goal touchdown catch against the Rams. Toomer started strongly in the 2006 season. In a Week 2 game against the Philadelphia Eagles, he tallied a career-high 12 receptions and scored two touchdowns to help spark a 17-point comeback. Physically exhausted by game's end, he had to be carried off the field by trainers. Toomer's season came to an end after eight games when he suffered a partially torn ACL in his left knee. In eight games during the 2006 season, Toomer had 32 receptions for 360 yards and three touchdowns. The Giants compiled a 6-2 record in the first half of the season with Toomer in the lineup, but fell to 2-6 in the second half without Toomer. Giants head coach Tom Coughlin noted, \\"There's no question Amani has a very positive effect on Eli.\\" Quarterack Eli Manning also praised Toomer: \\"He has a way of being in the right place at the right time.\\" ===Super Bowl champion: 2007=== Amani presenting George W. Bush with a personalized Giants jersey on April 30, 2008. During the 2007 season, Toomer returned from his injury to appear in all 16 regular season games for the Giants. He totaled 59 receptions for 760 yards and three touchdowns. On October 21, 2007, in a home game against the San Francisco 49ers, he broke Kyle Rote's club record with his 49th career touchdown catch. In the same game, he also broke Tiki Barber's team record for career receptions. The 2007 Giants advanced through the playoffs and won Super Bowl XLII over the previously undefeated New England Patriots. Toomer started all four postseason games for the team and totaled 21 catches for 280 yards and three touchdowns. On January 13, 2008, during the 2007 divisional playoff round, Toomer caught a 52-yard touchdown pass, his longest since a 77-yard touchdown on November 30, 2003. This catch broke the club record for most postseason receptions. Toomer had two touchdown catches in the Giants' 21-17 upset over the Dallas Cowboys. His first touchdown gave the Giants a 7-0 lead after he caught an 11-yard pass, eluded three tacklers and ran 50 yards for the score. Toomer also led the Giants with six receptions for 84 yards in the Super Bowl. In May 2008, Toomer and the Giants were invited by President Bush to the White House to honor their victory in Super Bowl XLII. ===2008 season and career overview=== The 2008 season was Toomer's last in the NFL. He appeared in all 16 regular season games, 12 as a starter, and caught 48 passes for 580 yards and four touchdowns. He concluded his NFL career having appeared in 190 games, 142 as a starter, with 668 receptions for 9,497 yards (14.2 yards per catch), and 54 touchdown receptions. He holds Giants' record for most career receiving yards, receptions, receiving touchdowns, and most consecutive games with at least one reception (94). In 2010, Toomer was included in the initial group selected for induction into the New York Giants Ring of Honor. ====Giants Franchise Records==== 's NFL off-season, Amani Toomer held at least 16 Giants franchise records, including: * Most Receptions (career): 668 * Most Receptions (game): 12 (2006-09-17 @PHI; tied with Mark Bavaro, Hakeem Nicks and Odell Beckham Jr. x2) * Most Receptions (playoff career): 44 * Most Receiving Yds (career): 9,497 * Most Receiving Yds (playoff career): 608 * Most Receiving TDs (career): 54 * Most Receiving TDs (playoff career): 7 * Most Receiving TDs (playoff game): 3 (2003-01-05 @SFO) * Most Total TDs (playoff career): 7 * Most Total TDs (playoff game): 3 (2003-01-05 @SFO) * Most Punt Returns (season): 47 (1997; tied with Chad Morton) * Most 100+ yard receiving games (career): 23 * Most Games with 1+ TD scored (playoffs): 4 (tied with Brandon Jacobs) * Most Games with 2+ TD scored (playoffs): 2 (tied with Hakeem Nicks) * Most Games with 3+ TD scored (playoffs): 1 * Most 1000+ receiving yards (career): 5 ===Kansas City Chiefs=== Toomer was signed to a one-year contract by Kansas City Chiefs on August 4, 2009.

It retains engineering authority for all calibrations performed in the PMEL labs throughout the Air Force, and oversees the contractor managed and operated Air Force Primary Standards Lab (AFPSL). It currently operates as a direct reporting unit of the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center for Wright-Patterson AFB, Wright-Patterson, OH. ==Mission== To develop and sustain precision measurement capabilities ensuring accurate, reliable, and safe air and space systems performance through effective management of the Air Force Metrology Program.Fact Sheets : AFMETCAL ==History== The United States Air Force calibration program was initiated in January 1952 to comply with AF Regulation 74-2, which outlined policies and assigned responsibilities for managing the Air Force Metrology and Calibration (AFMETCAL) Program.Fact Sheets : AFMETCAL – History – Why Metrology? The Dayton Air Force Depot, located at Gentile Air Force Station, Dayton, Ohio, developed and implemented a plan to ensure traceability to national standards that would apply to all measurements made on any weapon system in the Air Force. The Dayton Air Force Depot was given the authority to establish a centralized calibration program. Under their plan, the Air Materiel Area Depots were given a set of measurement standards, which were periodically calibrated by the Dayton Air Force Depot using standards traceable to the National Bureau of Standards. The operational success of a \\"Test Shop\\" program set up at March AFB, California, on 15 September 1957, led to the establishment of the base-level Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratories providing the Air Force with a complete calibration system that could handle the increasingly stringent measurement needs of the new missile and aircraft systems. The Dayton Air Force Depot facilities were becoming inadequate to support the increasing accuracy requirements of the Air Force so the search for a suitable replacement facility was begun in 1958. Air Force Industrial Plant No. 48 at Heath, Ohio, contained most of the features desired, such as the underground facilities and a stable seismic environment. On 1 February 1959, it was redesignated the Heath Maintenance Annex of the Dayton Air Force Depot. Authorization to begin construction was given by public law on 9 June 1960. The Dayton Air Force Depot personnel associated with the Air Force calibration program began their moves to the Heath Maintenance Annex in April 1962, and by June, most had been relocated to Heath, Ohio. In June, the name was also changed to the 2802nd Inertial Guidance and Calibration Group under HQ Air Force Logisitics Command. By July 1962, the Metrology function was fully staffed. By the end of 1962, the primary calibration labs and the Air Force Measurement Standards Laboratories were completed, consisting of four levels underground containing 20,000 square feet (1900 m²) of laboratory area. In November 1962, the facility was named Newark Air Force Station. In 1965, the Air Force assigned management of the worldwide Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratories certification program to the Calibration and Metrology Division. In 1968, the 2802nd Inertial Guidance and Calibration Group was inactivated and replaced by the Aerospace Guidance and Metrology Center (AGMC). The Calibration and Metrology Division was changed to the Directorate of Metrology on 8 November 1968. Newark Air Force Station was renamed Newark Air Force Base in June 1987. During the 1990s privatization took place at Newark AFB. This has resulted in the functions of the Air Force Primary Standards Laboratories, and Technical Order preparation, being performed by a private contractor. The Air Force created the Air Force Metrology and Calibration Program Office (AFMETCAL) at Heath, Ohio, to manage metrology services for the Air Force, retain engineering authority for all calibrations performed in the PMEL labs throughout the Air Force, and manage the contractor operated Air Force Primary Standards Lab. This is the present configuration of the Air Force Metrology program.Fact Sheets : AFMETCAL – Privatization ==Notes== * Newark Air Force Base was the first base to be targeted by BRAC for privatization.

The number traditionally assigned to it is based on the order of its publication; it is actually the thirteenth quartet in order of composition. ==Music== The five movements of the quartet are: The performance of the work takes around 45 minutes. === I. Assai sostenuto – Allegro === The slow introduction to the first movement, like that of the thirteenth quartet, is based on a motif that recurs throughout the late quartets and in the Große Fuge as well: the second tetrachord of the harmonic minor scale. The movement is in a modified sonata form which involves three full rotations of the expositional primary and secondary thematic material, each with a different tonal plan, in contrast to the usual sonata form which only cycles fully through this material twice (for the exposition and recapitulation). The first expositional rotation begins in the tonic and moves down a third to VI (F major) for the second key area (m. 48), while the second – following a developmental episode – is almost a direct transposition that begins in E minor (m. 103) and moves similarly down a third to C major. The final abbreviated rotation (m. 193) remains in the tonic throughout, followed by a coda (m. 232) featuring a dominant pedal point. The movement's unusual structure has invited a variety of analytical interpretations. Composer Roger Sessions describes the form as more of a triple exposition than a normal sonata form, and the second rotation could be interpreted as a simulation of the expositional repeat seen in many classical sonata form expositions, with the added interest of transposition. Conversely, other analysts have interpreted the second rotation as the onset of the recapitulation or as a \\"double recapitulation effect\\" rather than as an expositional repeat, with Hepokoski and Darcy describing it as a \\"tonally 'wrong' recapitulatory rotation followed by a notably varied, 'right' one in the tonic\\".Hepokoski, James and Warren Darcy. (2006) Elements of Sonata Theory: Norms, Types and Deformations in the Late Eighteenth-Century Sonata. New York: Oxford University Press, p. 280. and Joseph Kerman referring, albeit with reservations, to an \\"E-minor recapitulation\\" and an \\"A-minor recapitulation\\".Kerman, Joseph. (1967) The Beethoven Quartets. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, p. 247. Charles Rosen, on the other hand, considered this structure to be governed, as all of Beethoven's works, by the principle of sonata resolution, pointing to Haydn's 75th and 89th symphonies as precedents. For Rosen, the exposition comprises the A minor and F major sections; the brief developmental episode is a true development; and the middle section that directly transposes the exposition is a harmonic development (in the dominant and mediant keys, on the sharp side of the tonic) while acting thematically as a recapitulation. This allows the final section to act as a harmonic recapitulation (as it remains in the tonic throughout), while incorporating thematic development. ===II. Allegro ma non tanto=== The second movement is a minuet with trio, rather than the scherzo with repeated trio that Beethoven used most often in his works starting with his second symphony. The trio evokes a musette with its melodies over sustained tonic (here, A) tones. It partly reuses Beethoven's Allemande WoO 81. To begin this movement (11pxListen), Beethoven exposes the fourth in a three-note gesture (G–A–C) four times, with the violins and viola in unison and the cello an octave below. In m. 5, this motive is combined with an inverted variation (outlining a descending fifth) in mixed rhythm. Opening of the second movement of Beethoven's String Quartet in A-Minor Op. 132 Philip Radcliffe (1965, p. 114) says that the three-note gesture shares with the opening of the first movement “the unusual feature of beginning on the leading note of the scale.”Radcliffe, P. (1965) Beethoven's String Quartets. London, Hutchinson University Library. Daniel Chua (1995, p. 113) points out that this creates “rhythmic ambivalence”, especially when the two motives combine in bar 5: “In this way, as the two patterns interlock a gentle tension is induced by the differing rhythmic currents and admits the possibility of two contradictory metrical interpretations.”Chua, D. (1995), The \\"Galitzin\\" Quartets of Beethoven. Princeton university Press.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYnVnrZoB6o === III. Molto adagio – Andante === At about 15 to 20 minutes in duration, the third movement is the longest of the quartet. Formally described, it alternates slow sections in a modal F with faster sections, \\"Neue Kraft fühlend\\" (\\"feeling new strength\\"), in D. The slow sections each have two elements, (1) a passage reminiscent of the opening of the first movement in which the instruments overlap each other with a brief motive; (2) a chorale, the actual song. In the three instances of the slow section, the overlapping motives become increasingly complex rhythmically, while the chorale is pared down, and the two elements become increasingly integrated. There is a characteristic intensification of the head-motif toward the end of the movement. Beethoven wrote this piece after recovering from a serious illness which he had feared was fatal because he had been afflicted with intestinal disorder during the entire winter of 1824–5. He thus headed the movement with the words, \\"Heiliger Dankgesang eines Genesenen an die Gottheit, in der lydischen Tonart\\" (\\"Holy song of thanksgiving of a convalescent to the Deity, in the Lydian mode\\"). ===IV. Alla marcia, assai vivace=== This brief (2-minute) march in A major leads directly into the rondo-finale through a recitative-like passage. ===V. Allegro appassionato=== The movement is in sonata rondo form (A B A C A B A). Beethoven's sketches show that this theme was originally meant for an instrumental conclusion to the Ninth Symphony, but was abandoned for the now famous choral ending. The movement ends with a coda in A major. == Influence == Some credit this quartet as T. S. Eliot's impetus to write the Four Quartets; certainly he was recorded in a letter to Stephen Spender as having a copy of the A-minor quartet on the gramophone: 'I find it quite inexhaustible to study. There is a sort of heavenly or at least more than human gaiety about some of his later things which one imagines might come to oneself as the fruit of reconciliation and relief after immense suffering; I should like to get something of that into verse before I die.' Aldous Huxley in his novel Point Counter Point makes extended reference and description of this quartet in the late chapter concerning the death/suicide of the character Maurice Spandrell. == See also == * Late String Quartets (Beethoven) ==References== == Further reading == *Sessions, Roger.

Six years later, he published a book of his experiences on a journey through Libya, that later became famous. The book exposed the maltreatment of the population the author had witnessed on his journey and the atrocities committed by the Italian colonial power. This account is especially valuable for its description of the concentration camps into which Italian colonial powers forced bedouin Arabs and where \\"torture, humiliation, and famine\\" were rife. Holmboe was murdered on his way to Makkah in Aqaba in October 1931. Some suspect that Italian intelligence officials, connected to the regime of Benito Mussolini, conspired in his death. Knud Holmboe was the elder brother of Danish composer Vagn Holmboe. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Knud Holmboe was born as the eldest son of a well-known Danish merchant family in Horsens, Jutland. In his late teenage years he became more and more interested in religion and philosophy, and at the age of twenty, he moved into a monastery in Clervaux/Clerf, in northern Luxembourg, converting to Catholicism in 1921.Knud Holmboe, forlagetvandkunsten.dk (in Danish) ===Career and travels=== After finishing an education as a journalist, he started to work for various Danish local papers. However, in search of deeper religious knowledge, he traveled to Morocco in 1924, and became acquainted with Islam. During a meeting with a sheikh, he realized that he belonged to Islam and converted the following year.Knud Valdemar Gylding Holmboe, knud-holmboe.com His first book Between the Devil and the Deep Sea. A Dash by Plane to Seething Morocco was translated from the Danish and published in 1924 by Klinte Publishers. After returning to Denmark, he wrote two books recounting his experiences in Morocco. In 1925, he began a journey across the countries of the Middle East (Turkey, Syria, Palestine, Iraq and Persia). In 1927, he travelled through the Balkan and witnessed in Albania the mistreatment of the population by Italian troops. He took a photograph of the hanging of a dissident Catholic priest by Mussolini's soldiers in Albania. This picture was published in newspapers around the globe and, along with articles that went public all over Europe, infuriated the Italian authorities. Back in Denmark, he experienced economic difficulties and in 1928 he ultimately took the decision to leave the country along with his wife Nora and his daughter Aisha who was born earlier that year. He went to Morocco for the second time, settled down with his family and changed his name to Ali Ahmed el Gheseiri. Two years later, in 1930, his wife took the decision to return with her child to Denmark. Knud Holmboe, however, developed a plan to travel from Morocco across the Sahara to reach Egypt. It was this journey that made him famous. Driving through the desert in a 1929 Chevrolet, he left the beaten track to discover the communities and landscape of the desert. Holmboe was shocked to observe European violence against the indigenous populations of the North African colonies. In Libya, he witnessed the shocking treatment of the Libyan Muslim population by Italian colonial troops. Holmboe wrote everything down and took loads of photographs documenting the observations he had made. His activities did not remain unnoticed by the Italians and in the eastern city of Derna he was arrested and kicked out of Libya. In Egypt, he tried to organize resistance against the Italian colonial powers in Libya. However, after the Italian ambassador had informed the British authorities in Egypt, Holmboe was arrested again and thrown into prison in Cairo. After a month, he was sent home to Denmark. Back in Denmark, he produced a book in 1931 based on these travel experiences, entitled Desert Encounter () condemning the colonial overseers.Ørkenen brænder, forlagetvandkunsten.dk (in Danish) The book was published both in Denmark, in many other European countries and in the USA, but immediately banned in Italy. The Italian colonial powers were outraged at the suggestion that the Muslim population of Libya was being subjected to genocide. ===Last years and death=== After completing his book, Knud Holmboe started on his hajj, to Makkah in May 1931. Holmboe bought a camel in Amman and travelled to Aqaba (in modern Jordan) where he waited for an entry permit into Ibn Saud ́s territory. On 11 October 1931 he left on his camel towards the Saudi Arabian border spending the night in the vicinity of the Haql oasis. The next day he was attacked by a local Bedouin tribe on the road between al- Haql and Humayda. He managed to escape overnight, but was found the next day and shot on 13 October 1931. The circumstances of the death of Knud Holmboe were never fully explained. While it has been speculated that Italian intelligence ordered the murder, this claim has never been verified. == External links == *Knud Holmboe-Bridges Foundation *Zahara Books - Danish *Salaam Knowledge *Knud Holmboe ==Notes== Category:1902 births Category:1931 deaths Category:Converts to Islam Category:Danish journalists Category:Danish Muslims Category:Danish people murdered abroad Category:Danish travel writers Category:Murdered explorers Category:Murdered journalists Category:Murdered male writers Category:People from Horsens Category:20th-century journalists ","title":"Knud Holmboe"},{"id":"1278254","text":"Hanuka is a surname.

In both chambers, the measure to override the governor's veto passed by a single vote to secure the two thirds majority required. New Hampshire had been the last state in New England to allow capital punishment by law, and is the 21st state to abolish capital punishment. The abolishment of capital punishment does not affect Michael \\"Stix\\" Addison, who was sentenced to death in 2008 for the murder of Manchester police officer Michael L. Briggs.\\"Victim's parents praise NH death penalty verdict\\", WHDH-TV, December 18, 2008 He is the only person on death row in New Hampshire; the new law does not apply retroactively to his case. The primary means of carrying out the punishment is lethal injection, with hanging as a secondary means if lethal injection is deemed \\"impractical\\" by the State Commissioner of Corrections. The state has no execution facility nor drugs to carry out lethal injection.https://www.concordmonitor.com/A-brief- history-of-New-Hampshire-s-death-penalty-25890583 The state has carried out 24 executions for capital punishment, most recently in July 1939, with the execution of Howard Long. == Status prior to 2019 == === Legal process === When the prosecution chose to seek the death penalty, the sentence was decided by the jury and had to be unanimous. In the case of a hung jury during the penalty phase of the trial, a life sentence was issued, even if a single juror opposed death (there was no retrial). The governor has the power of clemency with respect to death sentences, with advice of the executive council. ===Capital murder=== Capital murderNew Hampshire RSA 630:1 was the only crime for which people, who were convicted prior to May 30, 2019, could be executed in the state. With the abolishment of the death penalty on May 30, only the sentence of death was replaced by mandatory life in prison. A person is guilty of capital murder if they knowingly caused the death of: #A sheriff or deputy sheriff, state trooper, constable or police officer of a city or town, correctional officer, probation-parole officer, conservation officer, judge or similar person, state or local prosecutor acting in the line of duty or in retaliation for their job. #Another before, after, while engaged or attempting to commit a kidnapping. #Another after conspiring with a third to commit a contract killing. #Another after being sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. #Another before, after, while engaged or attempting to commit aggravated felonious sexual assault. #Another before, after, while engaged in the commission of, or while attempting to commit robbery. #Another before, after, while engaged or attempting to commit a drug offense. Since the state's execution of Howard Long on July 14, 1939, eight people have been charged with capital murder. Three were convicted but received a mandatory life imprisonment without parole sentence. In three other cases, capital murder charges were resolved before trial, twice because the New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled the law authorizing the death penalty to be unconstitutional. ===Methods=== After a person was convicted of capital murder, a separate penalty phase was carried out using the same jury. The jury weighed a variety of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. If a person had been convicted of capital murder and was not sentenced to death, the mandatory sentence was life imprisonment without possibility of parole (LWOP), the same sentence as for first-degree murder. Executions must be carried out no sooner than one year after the sentencing. Death row for men and the execution are at the New Hampshire State Prison for Men at Concord. According to state law: > The punishment of death shall be inflicted by continuous, intravenous > administration of a lethal quantity of an ultrashort-acting barbiturate in > combination with a chemical paralytic agent… It was also possible for executions to be carried out by hanging if it was found: > …to be impractical to carry out the punishment of death by administration of > the required lethal substance or substances, the sentence of death may be > carried out by hanging… ===Public opinion=== In a 2008 poll conducted for the Concord Monitor, 57 percent of likely voters supported the death penalty in police killing cases, 39 percent favored life in prison without parole, and 4 percent weren't sure.http://www.wcsh6.com/news/regional/story.aspx?storyid=93471&catid;=46, WCSH6 ==Earlier history== Since 1734, twenty-four people have been executed in the state for capital murder, the last in 1939. ===1739–1942=== *In 1739, two women were the first convicts to be executed in the state, both convicted of \\"feloniously concealing the death of a ... infant bastard child\\". Provincial laws at the time required capital punishment for murder, rape, homosexual acts, abortion, bestiality, burglary, counterfeiting and treason. *On May 8, 1755, Eliphas Dow became the first man to be executed in New Hampshire. He was executed in Portsmouth for murder. *In 1796, Thomas Powers, an African American, was hanged for rape. He was the only black person to be executed in the state. *On January 3, 1822, Daniel Davis Farmer was hanged in Amherst for the murder of Ann Ayer in Goffstown in April 1821. *In 1868, hangings were moved to the State Prison in Concord, after a riot followed the execution of Samuel Mills on the main street of Woodsville. Prior to the 1868 execution, hangings were carried out in public. *In 1903, the punishment for murder in the first degree was changed from death, to death or imprisonment for life as the jury may determine... If the jury shall find the respondent guilty of murder in the first degree, the punishment shall be life imprisonment unless the jury shall add to their verdict the words, with capital punishment. *In 1939, Howard Long was the last person to be executed by the State of New Hampshire. A storekeeper from Alton, Long was hanged at the New Hampshire State Prison in Concord on July 14, 1939, for molesting and fatally beating 10-year-old Mark Neville Jensen, from Laconia. *In 1949, Ralph Jennings, a black man, was sentenced to be hanged for the murder of New Jersey nanny Ruth Eisenberg. Her body was found by hunters on a dirt road with panties shoved down her mouth along with a watch. Jennings was not executed but committed suicide in his cell by hanging himself.https://web.archive.org/web/20200918031744/https://img.newspapers.com/img/img?institutionId=0&user;=0&id;=219529314&width;=557&height;=596&crop;=4020_355_775_845&rotation;=0&brightness;=0&contrast;=0&invert;=0&ts;=1600395204&h;=12e6068595aeb4f45c6a382ef9eebc7bJennings was convicted after a jury trial in Carroll County. https://archive.org/download/juryRalphiemurderer/juryRalphiemurderer.PNG The evidence was provided insinuated it was a sex crime/homicide. https://ia601506.us.archive.org/0/items/clipping_59501428/clipping_59501428.pdf The case became a national sensation and newspapers called Jennings a sex- murderer.

Georgia (1972)=== In 1959, Frederick Martineau and Russell Nelson were convicted of murdering a businessman in a Nashua parking lot, who was scheduled to testify in a Rhode Island burglary case. Martineau and Nelson received 13 stays of execution. They were spared the death penalty in 1972 when the United States Supreme Court ruled in Furman v. Georgia, that \\"unitary trial\\" procedure, in which the jury was asked to return a verdict of guilt or innocence and, simultaneously, determine whether the defendant would be punished by death or life imprisonment, was in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. ===1970–present=== *In 1971, the state legislature enacted RSA 630:1 Capital Murder. In 1977, RSA 630:1 III was amended by the legislature so that a person convicted of a capital murder \\"may\\" be punished by death, instead of \\"shall be\\" punished by death. In 1988, killing another after being sentenced to life imprisonment without parole pursuant was added to RSA 630:1. Also, probation-parole officer was added to the list of law enforcement officers contained in Paragraph II of the statute. *In 1990, causing the death of another before, after, while engaged or attempting to commit aggravated felonious sexual assault, or an offense punishable under RSA 318-B:26, I(a) or (b) of the Controlled Drug Act was added as an aggravating element that might cause a crime to be classified as capital murder. In 1994, killing a \\"judicial officer\\" was added to the criteria for capital murder, and retaliation for a person's actions in the line of duty was added. *In 1992, the New Hampshire State Prison dismantled its gallows. *In 2000, Governor Jeanne Shaheen vetoed legislation to abolish the death penalty. The act had passed the House of Representatives 191-163 and the Senate 14-10. A two-thirds majority to overturn the veto was not achieved. *In 2004, Governor Craig Benson vetoed legislation that would have raised the minimum age to execute someone from 17 to 18. Benson said: > When somebody, regardless of their age, is bold enough to take the life of a > police officer, there should be no exceptions — we should make sure that > they should pay the ultimate price. So I'm going to make a pledge as > governor that if anyone takes the life of a police officer, I will seek the > death penalty. *In 2006, the statutory minimum age for a person punishable by death was raised from 17 to 18 years. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Roper v. Simmons (2005), that it is unconstitutional to impose the death penalty on people who were under age of 18 when they committed a capital crime. It noted that science has demonstrated the brains of minors are still unformed, and that it constituted \\"cruel and unusual punishment\\" to sentence them as adults. *In 2009, Representative Stephen Linsey introduced House Bill 556, to repeal the death penalty.

Originally, the domain was download.com, which became download.com.com for a while, and is now download.cnet.com. The domain download.com attracted at least 113 million visitors annually by 2008 according to a Compete.com study. ==Overview== The offered content is available in four major categories: software (including Windows, Mac and mobile), music, games, and videos, offered for download via FTP from Download.com's servers or third-party servers. Videos are streams (at present) and music was all free MP3 downloads, or occasionally rights-managed WMAs or streams until it was replaced with last.fm. The Software section includes over 100,000 freeware, shareware, and try-first downloads. Downloads are often rated and reviewed by editors and contain a summary of the file from the software publisher. Registered users may also write reviews and rate the product. Software publishers are permitted to distribute their titles via CNET's Upload.com site for free, or for a fee structure that offers enhancements. CNet uses Spigot Inc to monetize the traffic to download.com. According to Sean Murphy, a General Manager at CNet, \\"Spigot continues to be a great partner to Download.com, sharing our desire to balance customer experience with revenue.\\" ==Malware distribution== In August 2011, Download.com introduced an installation manager called CNET TechTracker for delivering many of the software titles from its catalog. This installer included trojans and bloatware, such as toolbars. CNET admitted in their download FAQ that \\"a small number of security publishers have flagged the Installer as adware or a potentially unwanted application\\".CNET Download Installer In December 2011, Gordon Lyon, writing under his pseudonym Fyodor wrote of his strong dislike of the installation manager and the bundled software. His post was very popular on social networks, and was reported by a few dozen media. The main problem is the confusion between the content offered on Download.com and the software offered by the original authors; the accusations included deception as well as copyright and trademark violation. In 2014, The Register and US-CERT warned that via download.com's \\"foistware\\", an \\"attacker may be able to download and execute arbitrary code\\". In 2015, research by :Emsisoft suggested that all free download providers bundled their downloads with potentially unwanted software, and that Download.com was the worst offender. A study done by How-To Geek in 2015 revealed that Download.com was packaging malware inside their installers. The test was done in a virtual machine where the testers downloaded the Top 10 apps. These all contained crapware/malware; one example was the KMPlayer installer, which installed a rogue antivirus named 'Pro PC Cleaner' and attempted to execute \`WajamPage.exe\`. Some downloads, specifically YTD, were completely blocked by Avast. Another study done by How-To Geek in 2015 revealed that Download.com was installing fake SSL certificates inside their installers, similar to the Lenovo Superfish certificate. These fake certificates can completely compromise SSL encryption and allow man-in-the-middle attacks. However, in July 2016, How-To Geek discovered that Download.com no longer included adware/malware in its downloads and that its Installer program had been discontinued. ==See also== * Spigot Inc ==References== Category:CBS Interactive websites Category:Download websites Category:File hosting Category:Free music download websites Category:Internet properties established in 1996 Category:Adware Category:Malware Category:American music websites ","title":"Download.com"},{"id":"1278289","text":"Saint Martins church of Moerzeke Moerzeke is a village located at the river Scheldt in the municipality Hamme, Belgium. ==History== The name comes from the Gallo-Roman Mauriciacum, which means good or villa belonging to Mauricius. In the passing ages the name Moerzeke has been written in various ways. In Latin manuscripts from 1125 and 1156 you can read Murzeke and Murceke, in 1171 Morzeka, in 1225 Morsca, in 1259 and 1261 Morseke, in 1330 Mourseka. At the end of the sixteenth century Mercator indicates Moerzeke as Moeshe on his maps. This name is still used by the people of Moerzeke. The village has a history of disasters. In 1488 the castle of the lord of Moerzeke was ruined by troublemakers from Ghent. The church was plundered too, but the inhabitants of Moerzeke had moved the most valuable pieces of their church to Dendermonde. Reformation brought a lot of mayhem: half the parish got burned down and ravaged and even the church didn't escape this. From 1578 on the Catholic religion was prohibited, violation resulted in the death penalty. In 1580 the Black Death broke out, which nearly killed the total population of Moerzeke. In 1584 after a siege that lasted for 20 days Moerzeke and Dendermonde were liberated from the Protestants by the Spanish troops. In 1590 a priest from Hulst (the Netherlands) came to Moerzeke together with some seventy families from Verrebroek and Kieldrecht to bring the population to a normal level again. This was not yet the end of misery in Moerzeke however. In 1846-1848 the harvest largely failed, which caused poverty and the death of many. Moerzeke also has had several dam-breaks causing floods. ==Sites== Moerzeke holds the burial chapel and associated museum of Father Edward Poppe, who was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1999. These have grown into places of pilgrimage. ==External links== Category:Populated places in East Flanders ","title":"Moerzeke"},{"id":"1278298","text":"Publius Pomponius Secundus was a distinguished statesman and poet in the reigns of Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius. He was suffect consul for the nundinium of January to June 44, succeeding the ordinary consul Gaius Sallustius Crispus Passienus and as the colleague of the other ordinary consul, Titus Statilius Taurus.Gallivan, \\"The Fasti for the Reign of Claudius\\", pp. 408, 424. Publius was on intimate terms with the elder Pliny, who wrote a biography of him, now lost. ==Name== His full name was Publius Calvisius Sabinus Pomponius Secundus, as indicated by two fragmentary inscriptions from Germania Superior., . For some time, Pomponius' praenomen was uncertain; Publius was not a regular name of the Pompilii, and Olli Salomies discusses the possibility that it might have been Gaius, but notes that a Publius Calvisius Sabinus was attested as existing in Spoletium, and concludes that it is \\"possible to assume with some confidence\\" that he had been adopted by a Publius Calvisius Sabinus.Salomies, Adoptive and polyonymous nomenclature, p. 114 That his praenomen was Publius, at least after his adoption, seems to be confirmed by an inscription from Veii, dating from his consulship, another from Cyrenae, when he was proconsul, and one from Mogontiacum, when he was Legatus Augusti pro praetore., , . ==Family== Pomponius' mother was Vistilia, who by other marriages was the mother of Publius Suillius Rufus and the general Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo. The name of his father is not known, but Ronald Syme has suggested he could be either Gaius Pomponius Graecinus, consul suffectus in AD 16, or his brother, Lucius Pomponius Flaccus, consul ordinarius in 17.Syme, \\"Domitius Corbulo\\", p. 31 Pomponius' brother, Quintus Pomponius Secundus, was involved in various intrigues during the reigns of Tiberius and Claudius. Quintus tried to protect his brother from Tiberius' displeasure.Tacitus, Annales, vi. 18, xiii. 43. ==Political career== Pomponius was one of the friends of Sejanus, who was consul in 31, and on the latter's fall in October of that year, Pomponius was placed under house arrest, where he remained until Caligula released him.Cassius Dio, Roman History, lix. 6, 29.Tacitus, Annales, v.8, vi.18. During either the reign of Caligula or Claudius he was governor of the public province of Creta et Cyrenaica.Eck, \\"Über die prätorischen Prokonsulate in der Kaiserzeit\\". It was during the reign of Claudius that Pomponius acceded to the consulship. He was afterwards governor of Germania Superior from the year 50 to 54; during his office Pomponius conducted a successful campaign, described by Tacitus, against the German Chatti, where, after forty years, survivors of the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest were freed from slavery. For this he received ornamenta triumphalia.Tacitus, Annales, xii.27, 28 ==Writings== It was by his tragedies that Secundus obtained the most celebrity. They are spoken of in the highest terms by Tacitus, Quintilian, and the younger Pliny, and were read even in a much later age, as one of them is quoted by the grammarian Charisius. These tragedies were first put on the stage in the time of Claudius. Quintilian asserts that he was far superior to any writer of tragedies he had known, and Tacitus expresses a high opinion of his literary abilities.Tacitus, Annales, xi. 13; Dialogus de Oratoribus, 13.Quintilian, Institutio Oratoria, x. 1. § 98.Pliny the Younger, Epistulae, iii. 5, vii. 17.Charisius, apud Bothe, Poëtae Scenici Latinorum Fragmenta, vol. ii. p. 279. Secundus devoted much attention to the niceties of grammar and style, on which he was recognized as an authority. His subject matter was Greek, with one known exception, a praetexta called Aeneas. Tragedians in the Julio-Claudian and Flavian periods typically were men of relatively high social status, and their works often expressed their political views under an insufficient veil of fiction. Only a few lines of his work remain, some of which belong to Aeneas.Conte, Latin Literature, pp. 417, 418.Rudich, Political Dissidence under Nero, p. 304. ==See also== * Pomponia (gens) * Calvisia gens ==References== ==Bibliography== * Gaius Plinius Secundus (Pliny the Elder), Historia Naturalis (Natural History). * Marcus Fabius Quintilianus (Quintilian), Institutio Oratoria (Institutes of Oratory). * Gaius Plinius Caecilius Secundus (Pliny the Younger), Epistulae (Letters). * Publius Cornelius Tacitus, Annales, Dialogus de Oratoribus (Dialogue on Oratory). * Lucius Cassius Dio Cocceianus (Cassius Dio), Roman History. * Flavius Sosipater Charisius, Ars Grammatica (The Art of Grammar). * Friedrich Heinrich Bothe, Poëtae Scenici Latinorum Fragmenta (Fragments of the Latin Theatrical Poets), Heinrich Vogler, Halberstadt (1822). * Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, William Smith, ed., Little, Brown and Company, Boston (1849). * Theodor Mommsen et alii, Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum (The Body of Latin Inscriptions, abbreviated CIL), Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften (1853–present). * René Cagnat et alii, L'Année épigraphique (The Year in Epigraphy, abbreviated AE), Presses Universitaires de France (1888–present). * Otto Ribbeck, Geschichte der römischen Dichtung, vol. iii.

He also inherited the seigneurie of Mez (later Mez-le-Maréchal) in Gâtinais after his father's death in 1182. Albéric was born sometime in the mid-1160s to Robert III Clément and Hersende de Mez, and thus came from a knightly family- the Cléments of Mez. He accompanied Philip on the Third Crusade as Marshal, and distinguished himself at the Siege of Acre in particular, frequently leading the advanced guard into battle. Albéric is said to have died on 3 July 1191, during an attempted breach of the city's walls, with accounts by those such as contemporary poet Ambroise suggesting the Marshal led the charge himself and died on- or close to the Accursed Tower, after swearing that he would either die that day or enter Acre. Some accounts describe Albéric charging the walls with Philip's standard in hand and a number of men with him, attempting to scale the walls with a ladder, being pulled up with a grappling hook by the Saracen defenders and isolated from his men by rocks thrown onto the climbing assault party. Other accounts describe the ladder breaking under the weight of the Marshal's followers, leaving him alone on the wall. Accounts also go on to describe a defending soldier parading the walls wearing Albéric's armour after his death, stopping only when Richard I of England shot the man down. Albéric had two siblings, one of whom- Henry I Clément- would go on to become Marshal of France himself. ==Duties as Marshal of France== The title of Marshal of France as awarded to Albéric Clément and his successors did not involve command responsibilities of large armies- Albéric held no official command even at Acre. While military in nature, the position was more concerned with management of the king's horses and stables. It was not until the 15th century that the position would move away from managing stables to one with battlefield authority second only to the French sovereign. ==Gallery== Image:Blason fam fr Clément.svgCoat of arms of the Cléments of Mez.

The combined firm was itself acquired in 1984 by American Express, forming Shearson Lehman/American Express and with that, the Kuhn, Loeb name was retired. ==History== Kuhn, Loeb & Co. was an investment bank located in New York City. It was founded in 1867, by Abraham Kuhn and Solomon Loeb. Kuhn and Loeb had created a successful merchandising business in Cincinnati, Ohio, when they decided to move east, to New York, to take advantage of the country's burgeoning economic expansion. Company records indicate that by the time Kuhn and Loeb established their partnership, they were able to capitalize it at $500,000 (equivalent of about $ million in ). On January 1, 1875, Jacob Schiff (1847–1920), Solomon Loeb's son-in-law, joined the firm. He eventually became its leader and grew the firm into the second most prestigious investment bank in the United States behind J. Pierpont Morgan's J.P. Morgan & Co. Jacob Schiff The firm grew to prominence during the railroad era in the United States. Americans saw great hope and promise in railroads and investors saw great opportunities to profit. Kuhn, Loeb, like all investment banks, brought capital together with commercial opportunity. Its first meaningful entry into railroad financing was in 1877 when it raised funds for the Chicago and North Western Railroad, and several years later, in 1881, for the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad. Schiff was instrumental in the reorganization of the Union Pacific in 1897, helping to place the firm on sound financial footing. In 1901, with Kuhn, Loeb's financial support, E. H. Harriman famously battled James Jerome Hill and J.P. Morgan to acquire control of the Northern Pacific Railroad. The firm was long associated with many of America's emerging industrial giants, providing financial backing for Westinghouse and Western Union, as well as innovative consumer giants like the Polaroid Corporation. The firm also enjoyed respect as a trusted adviser overseas, providing services to numerous foreign governments, including the governments of Austria, Finland, Mexico and Venezuela. It also acted as the leading investment house for John D. Rockefeller, through the guidance of his investment adviser, Frederick T. Gates. Rockefeller invested in many syndicates with the bank, including major stakes in the prominent railroad companies, as well as contributing to its consolidation of the Chicago meatpackers, which resulted in the formation of a leading trust. Overseas ventures that Rockefeller also got involved with included the bank's loans to the Chinese and Imperial Japanese governments. The firm also joined a partnership with Rockefeller in 1911 to gain control of the Equitable Trust Company, which was later to merge and become the Chase Bank.The leading investment bank for the Rockefeller interests - see Ron Chernow, Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr. London: Warner Books, 1998. (p.373, 377) Famous partners of the firm included Otto Kahn, Paul Warburg, Felix Warburg, Mortimer Schiff, Benjamin Buttenwieser, Abraham Wolff, Lewis Strauss, and Sigmund Warburg, founder of S.G. Warburg. Otto Kahn In its early years, intermarriage among the German-Jewish elite was common. Consequently, the partners of Kuhn, Loeb were closely related by blood and marriage to the partners of J & W Seligman, Speyer & Co., Goldman, Sachs & Co., Lehman Brothers and other prominent German-Jewish firms. Prior to the Second World War, a particularly close relationship existed between the partners of Kuhn, Loeb and M. M. Warburg & Co. of Hamburg, Germany, through Paul and Felix, who were Kuhn, Loeb partners. Later on, following World War II, their cousin Sigmund Warburg would briefly continue this relationship as a partner and Executive Director of the firm. The firm's fortunes began to fade in the years following World War II. Wall Street was changing and shifting away from relationship banking. Kuhn, Loeb's world of gentlemen bankers was gradually being replaced by a more aggressive, transaction-oriented Wall Street, with underwriters entering the trenches and selling securities directly to the public—territory Kuhn, Loeb stubbornly refused to enter. When asked how many people worked at Kuhn, Loeb, one partner famously quipped, \\"about half\\". Such was life at Kuhn, Loeb, resting on its laurels, while Wall Street passed it by. In 1977, facing a capital crisis, the firm succumbed and merged with Lehman Brothers, to form Lehman Brothers, Kuhn, Loeb Inc. Internationally, the merged firms were known as Kuhn Loeb Lehman Brothers Inc., in recognition Kuhn Loeb's superior international reputation. The merger did not, however, prove to be the panacea to what ailed Kuhn, Loeb. Indeed, as detailed more closely in the Lehman Brothers history, a period of bitter internal strife ended in 1984 when the firm sold itself to Shearson/American Express, itself the product of a recent merger between American Express and Sandy Weill's, Shearson Loeb Rhoades. The combined firms then dropped the Kuhn, Loeb name and became known as Shearson Lehman/American Express, ending Kuhn, Loeb's almost 120 years on Wall Street. Later, the combined firm purchased disgraced E.F. Hutton, becoming Shearson Lehman Hutton. Ultimately, however, American Express could not make the pieces of its financial services supermarket work. In 1993, under then newly appointed CEO, Harvey Golub, the firm sold its retail brokerage operations to Primerica. In 1994, it spun off a beleaguered Lehman Brothers as Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., in an initial public offering. Although the Kuhn, Loeb name is probably gone forever, the firm's legacy is not. Former Kuhn, Loeb employees remain in senior positions throughout Wall Street, and until recently, at Lehman Brothers. Vestiges of the firm survived in the form of Lehman Brothers' extensive fixed income capabilities, including many of their bond indices, such as the Government/Credit index. This index, originally created in 1973 by Kuhn, Loeb, as the Government/Corporate index, was among the first generation of bond index data to measure the fixed income market. It is still the preeminent benchmark in its class. ==Successors== The following is an illustration of the company's mergers and its role in later successor firms, notably Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb, Shearson Lehman Brothers and later Lehman Brothers (this is not a comprehensive list):\\"Salomon Smith Barney\\" from Gambee, Robert.

Sedulius is the Latin form of the Irish name Siadhal, referring to the a family, sept or \\"siadhal\\" meaning \\"seed.\\" The only trustworthy information is given by his two letters to Macedonius, from which we learn that he devoted his early life, perhaps as a teacher of rhetoric, to secular literature. Late in life he converted to Christianity, or, if a Christian before, began to take his faith more seriously. One medieval commentary states that he resided in Italy. He is termed a presbyter by Isidore of Seville and in the Gelasian decree. ==Works== His fame rests mainly upon a long poem, Carmen paschale, based on the four gospels. In style a bombastic imitator of Virgil, he shows, nevertheless, a certain freedom in the handling of the Biblical story, and the poem soon became a quarry for the minor poets.

Kantowicz (eds.), Historical Dictionary of the Progressive Era, 1890-1920. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1988; pp. 425-426. Seligman continued his studies in Europe, attending courses for three years at the universities of Berlin, Heidelberg, Geneva, and Paris. He earned his M.A. and LL.B. degrees in 1885 and successfully defended a Ph.D. in 1885. He later was awarded a LL.D. in 1904. ==Career== Seligman spent his entire academic career at Columbia University, first joining as a lecturer in 1885. He was made an adjunct professor of political economy in 1888. He became the first McVickar Professor of Political Economy at the same university in 1904, a position which he occupied until 1931. Seligman's academic work dealt largely with matters of taxation and public finance, and he was regarded as a leading proponent of the progressive income tax. He also taught courses at Columbia in the field of economic history. From 1886 Seligman was one of the editors of the Political Science Quarterly. He also edited Columbia's series in history, economics, and public law from 1890. Seligman was a founder of the American Economic Association and served as president of that organization from 1902 to 1904. He was also a key figure behind the formation of the American Association of University Professors, serving as that group's president from 1919 to 1920. Seligman dedicated a great deal of effort to the question of public finance during World War I and was a prominent advocate of the establishment of a progressive income tax as a basis for the funding of government operations. Although a proponent of the economic interpretation of history, commonly associated with Marxism, Seligman was an opponent of socialism and appeared in public debates opposing prominent radical figures during the early 1920s, including such figures as Scott Nearing and Harry Waton.See the published stenograms of debates with Nearing (1921) and Waton (1922). Seligman's later academic work revolved around questions of tax policy and consumer finance. Among his students was B.R. Ambedkar, the principal architect of the Constitution of India. ==Death and legacy== Edwin Seligman died July 18, 1939. His beliefs were highly influential with Charles A. Beard, who was an academic colleague at Columbia.The Reader's Companion to American History, by Eric Foner In particular, Seligman's economic viewpoints to history helped inform Beard's work An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States.Historians in Public: The Practice of American History, 1890-1970 ==Works== ===Books and pamphlets=== * Railway Tariffs and the Interstate Commerce Act.

Duncan Kenworthy (CTW) was in charge of the USA production and Enrique Nicanor was assigned by (TVE) as Director of the Spanish new show and designer of the two Spanish new original muppets \\"Caponata\\" and \\"Perezgil\\" *Caponata was a red, orange and yellow feathered (female) hen with curly pink hair similar in height (2 meters) to Big Bird. Actress Emma Cohen was in charge of working inside the muppet' body and provide the voice and psychology of a 6 years old girl, naïve and curious about everything. *Perezgil was a green big snail with round glasses and curly green hair. He presumed to be an intellectual character, big reader, writer, poet and advisor of everybody in the neighborhood. Actor Jesús Alcaide was in charge of working the muppet as well as providing its voice. Other real actors performed the different characters living together with a lot of children in the neighborhood. * Nisi: Juan Margallo, the bar owner * Angela: Petra Martínez, Nisi's wife * Braulio: Manolo Aleixandre and/or José Riesgo, the newsstand owner * Manolo: Manolo Vallejo, the Garage owner * Carmen: Concha Goyanes * Cuqui: Gabriel Fariza, the radio reporter * Jose: Marcelo Rubal American characters adopted Spanish names: *Bert: Blas *Ernie: Epi *Kermit the Frog: Gustavo, la rana *Grover: Coco *Cookie Monster:Triqui *Count von Count :El Conde Draco == Media confusion about the show title and characters == The popularity of the series among children and adults, years after the series was aired and new times came with internet and globalization created confusion with the original American series so most of the media in Spain named the US series as \\"Barrio Sésamo\\" as well as named \\"Big Bird\\" as \\"Caponata\\" (Big Bird never appeared in the Spanish series). == End of the first season: controversy== The First Bario Sésamo season was cancelled by the station (RTVE) in 1981 when the station denied the authors to keep their rights on the characters. An agreement was reached where the authors granted full commercial rights to the station except the right to be mentioned as authors and the right to deny the use of the muppets for commercial advertising of carbonized drinks and unhealthy products for children. (Same rights that Jim Henson always kept with all his own characters). As a result, the station canceled the series anyway firing the first creators and banned all the characters to appear in the new season despite the popularity of the show with young audiences. The person responsible for the Children's department at the station made the decision to ban the series with their characters of Caponata and Perezgil, commissioning the American co-production company, CTW USA, to create and provide new \\"Spanish\\" muppets with new names for the subsequent seasons. With that action, Barrio Sésamo was not longer a co-production with Spanish-created characters. In 1983, one year after the re-invented new season started, a new government won the elections in Spain and new responsible officials were appointed as DG of RTVE (José Maria Calviño) the new staff fired the responsible people involved in the banning of the original series. The creator of the banned first season was called by the station and was appointed as new Head of the Children' Programmes Unit and later Director of the TVE-2 channel. He avoided to take any action against the new format of the programme itself and kept the new production format on air for the following years for the sake of the continuity of the excellence of the Sesame Street educational formula, actors and team created. ==La Cometa Blanca (3rd Run)== From 1981 to 1983, a different Televisión Española children's program, La Cometa Blanca, included some sketches from Sesame Street. This program was directed by Muppet fan Lolo Rico and featured some actors who would later appear in Barrio Sésamo, mainly Mari Luz Olier, Alfonso Vallejo and the child-actress Ruth Gabriel (then known as Ruth Abellán). ==Barrio Sésamo - 2nd, 3rd and 4th seasons (4th Run)== The Sesame Street sketches in La Cometa Blanca were so successful with their young audience that the Spanish-version was given another chance in 1983. Only José Riesgo as Julián returned from the first season. Caponata and Perezgil were replaced by two new Muppets totally designed, this time, and constructed by CTW. The main character was Espinete, a large pink hedgehog that replaced Caponata. Like Caponata, Espinete was a full-body Muppet and was the main character on the show, played by Chelo Vivares. He became famous for sleeping in pajamas in spite of being \\"naked\\" the rest of the day. Some of the friends of Espinete were: *Don Pimpón (Alfonso Vallejo): Another full-body Muppet. This farmer was an undetermined brown being, similar to a Sesame Street monster. *Chema (Juan Sánchez): The baker of Barrio Sésamo. *Ana (Isabel Castro): The young friend of everybody. *Don Julián (José Riesgo): The old owner of a mobile news stand. *Matilde (Mari Luz Olier) and Antonio (José Enrique Camacho): married owners of an horchata shop *Roberto (Roberto Mayor) and Ruth (Ruth Gabriel, as Ruth Abellán): Matilde and Antonio's children The show finished around April 1988 and was replaced by Los Mundos de Yupi, a similar program fully produced by Televisión Española, featuring three extraterrestrial characters.

The rate of change is usually with respect to time. Because science and engineering often relate quantities to each other, the methods of related rates have broad applications in these fields. Differentiation with respect to time or one of the other variables requires application of the chain rule, since most problems involve several variables. Fundamentally, if a function F is defined such that F=f(x), then the derivative of the function F can be taken with respect to another variable. We assume x is a function of t, i.e. x=g(t). Then F=f(g(t)), so : F'=f'(g(t)) \\\\cdot g'(t) Written in Leibniz notation, this is: : \\\\frac{dF}{dt} = \\\\frac{df}{dx} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{dx}{dt}. Thus, if it is known how x changes with respect to t, then we can determine how F changes with respect to t and vice versa. We can extend this application of the chain rule with the sum, difference, product and quotient rules of calculus, etc. For example, if F(x)= G(y)+ H(z) then : \\\\frac{dF}{dx}\\\\cdot \\\\frac{dx}{dt}=\\\\frac{dG}{dy} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{dy}{dt}+\\\\frac{dH}{dz} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{dz}{dt}. == Procedure == The most common way to approach related rates problems is the following: #Identify the known variables, including rates of change and the rate of change that is to be found. (Drawing a picture or representation of the problem can help to keep everything in order) #Construct an equation relating the quantities whose rates of change are known to the quantity whose rate of change is to be found. #Differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time (or other rate of change). Often, the chain rule is employed at this step. #Substitute the known rates of change and the known quantities into the equation. #Solve for the wanted rate of change. Errors in this procedure are often caused by plugging in the known values for the variables before (rather than after) finding the derivative with respect to time. Doing so will yield an incorrect result, since if those values are substituted for the variables before differentiation, those variables will become constants; and when the equation is differentiated, zeroes appear in places of all variables for which the values were plugged in. The \\"four corner\\" approach to solving related rates problems. Knowing the relationship between position A and position B, differentiate to find the relationship between rate A and rate B. ==Examples== ===Leaning ladder example=== A 10-meter ladder is leaning against the wall of a building, and the base of the ladder is sliding away from the building at a rate of 3 meters per second. How fast is the top of the ladder sliding down the wall when the base of the ladder is 6 meters from the wall? The distance between the base of the ladder and the wall, x, and the height of the ladder on the wall, y, represent the sides of a right triangle with the ladder as the hypotenuse, h. The objective is to find dy/dt, the rate of change of y with respect to time, t, when h, x and dx/dt, the rate of change of x, are known. Step 1: :x=6 :h=10 :\\\\frac{dx}{dt}=3 :\\\\frac{dh}{dt}=0 :\\\\frac{dy}{dt}=\\\\text{?} Step 2: From the Pythagorean theorem, the equation :x^2+y^2=h^2,\\\\, describes the relationship between x, y and h, for a right triangle. Differentiating both sides of this equation with respect to time, t, yields :\\\\frac{d}{dt}(x^2+y^2)=\\\\frac{d}{dt}(h^2) Step 3: When solved for the wanted rate of change, dy/dt, gives us :\\\\frac{d}{dt}(x^2)+\\\\frac{d}{dt}(y^2)=\\\\frac{d}{dt}(h^2) :(2x)\\\\frac{dx}{dt}+(2y)\\\\frac{dy}{dt}=(2h)\\\\frac{dh}{dt} :x\\\\frac{dx}{dt}+y\\\\frac{dy}{dt}=h\\\\frac{dh}{dt} :\\\\frac{dy}{dt}=\\\\frac{h\\\\frac{dh}{dt}-x\\\\frac{dx}{dt}}{y}. Step 4 & 5: Using the variables from step 1 gives us: :\\\\frac{dy}{dt}=\\\\frac{h\\\\frac{dh}{dt}-x\\\\frac{dx}{dt}}{y}. :\\\\frac{dy}{dt}=\\\\frac{10\\\\times0-6\\\\times3}{y}=-\\\\frac{18}{y}. Solving for y using the Pythagorean Theorem gives: :x^2+y^2=h^2 :6^2+y^2=10^2 :y=8 Plugging in 8 for the equation: :-\\\\frac{18}{y}=-\\\\frac{18}{8}=-\\\\frac{9}{4} It is generally assumed that negative values represent the downward direction. In doing such, the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of meters per second. ==Physics examples== Because one physical quantity often depends on another, which, in turn depends on others, such as time, related-rates methods have broad applications in Physics. This section presents an example of related rates kinematics and electromagnetic induction. ===Physics example I: relative kinematics of two vehicles=== One vehicle is headed North and currently located at (0,3); the other vehicle is headed West and currently located at (4,0). The chain rule can be used to find whether they are getting closer or further apart. For example, one can consider the kinematics problem where one vehicle is heading West toward an intersection at 80 miles per hour while another is heading North away from the intersection at 60 miles per hour. One can ask whether the vehicles are getting closer or further apart and at what rate at the moment when the North bound vehicle is 3 miles North of the intersection and the West bound vehicle is 4 miles East of the intersection. Big idea: use chain rule to compute rate of change of distance between two vehicles. Plan: #Choose coordinate system #Identify variables #Draw picture #Big idea: use chain rule to compute rate of change of distance between two vehicles #Express c in terms of x and y via Pythagorean theorem #Express dc/dt using chain rule in terms of dx/dt and dy/dt #Substitute in x, y, dx/dt, dy/dt #Simplify. Choose coordinate system: Let the y-axis point North and the x-axis point East. Identify variables: Define y(t) to be the distance of the vehicle heading North from the origin and x(t) to be the distance of the vehicle heading West from the origin. Express c in terms of x and y via the Pythagorean theorem: : c = (x^2 + y^2)^{1/2} Express dc/dt using chain rule in terms of dx/dt and dy/dt: { cellpadding=5 -  \\\\frac{dc}{dt} = \\\\frac{d}{dt}(x^2 + y^2)^{1/2}  width=\\"250pt\\"  Apply derivative operator to entire function -  = \\\\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2)^{-1/2}\\\\frac{d}{dt}(x^2 + y^2)  Square root is outside function; Sum of squares is inside function -  =\\\\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2)^{-1/2}\\\\left[\\\\frac{d}{dt}(x^2) + \\\\frac{d}{dt}(y^2) \\\\right]  Distribute differentiation operator -  = \\\\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2)^{-1/2}\\\\left[ 2x\\\\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y\\\\frac{dy}{dt}\\\\right]  Apply chain rule to x(t) and y(t)} -  = \\\\frac{x\\\\frac{dx}{dt} + y\\\\frac{dy}{dt}}{\\\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}  Simplify. - } Substitute in x = 4 mi, y = 3 mi, dx/dt = −80 mi/hr, dy/dt = 60 mi/hr and simplify : \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{dc}{dt} & = \\\\frac{4 \\\\text{ mi} \\\\cdot (-80 \\\\text{ mi}/\\\\text{hr}) + 3 \\\\text{ mi} \\\\cdot (60) \\\\text{mi}/\\\\text{hr}}{\\\\sqrt{(4 \\\\text{ mi})^2 + (3 \\\\text{ mi})^2}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\frac{-320 \\\\text{ mi}^2/\\\\text{hr} + 180 \\\\text{ mi}^2/\\\\text{hr}}{5\\\\text{ mi}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{-140 \\\\text{ mi}^2/\\\\text{hr}}{5\\\\text{ mi}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ & = -28 \\\\text{ mi}/\\\\text{hr} \\\\end{align} Consequently, the two vehicles are getting closer together at a rate of 28 mi/hr. ===Physics Example II: Electromagnetic induction of conducting loop spinning in magnetic field=== The magnetic flux through a loop of area A whose normal is at an angle θ to a magnetic field of strength B is : \\\\Phi_B = B A \\\\cos(\\\\theta), Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction states that the induced electromotive force \\\\mathcal{E} is the negative rate of change of magnetic flux \\\\Phi_B through a conducting loop. : \\\\mathcal{E} = -{{d\\\\Phi_B} \\\\over dt}, If the loop area A and magnetic field B are held constant, but the loop is rotated so that the angle θ is a known function of time, the rate of change of θ can be related to the rate of change of \\\\Phi_B (and therefore the electromotive force) by taking the time derivative of the flux relation : \\\\mathcal{E} = -\\\\frac{d\\\\Phi_B}{dt} = B A \\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\frac{d\\\\theta}{dt} If for example, the loop is rotating at a constant angular velocity ω, so that θ = ωt, then : \\\\mathcal{E}= \\\\omega B A \\\\sin\\\\omega t ==References== Category:Differential calculus Category:Differential equations ","title":"Related rates"},{"id":"1278397","text":"Alagar kovil is a village in Madurai district in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The history and living of the village is centered around Kallazhagar Temple. Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th–9th centuries AD. It is one of the 108 Divyadesam dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshiped as Kallazhagar and his consort Lakshmi as Thirumamagal. ==Kallazhagar Temple]== One of the broken gateway towers of the temple Kallazhagar Temple covers an area of about and has a five-tiered gopuram (gateway tower). The temple in enclosed in a rectangular enclosure with huge granite walls. The central shrine houses the image of the presiding deity, Sundarabahu Perumal in standing posture. The images of Sridevi and Bhudevi are also housed in the sanctum. There two life size images of Narasimha, the avatar of Vishnu. One of them is shown holding the demon Hiranya and other slaying him.

This festival day is declared as Local Holiday. In Chithirai (April-May), Lord Kallalagar starts from Alagar kovil in the form of Kallar and reaches Madurai on Pournami (Full Moon day). Here he steps into river Vaigai in his Horse Vaganam. Lakhs of devotees flock to river Vaigai to see this event. \\"Ethir Sevai\\" festival is celebrated on the day before Alagar steps into river Vaigai. It is a tradition for the people of Madurai to welcome Alagar. As Alagar returns from Vandiyur Dhasavatharam festival is celebrated throughout the night at Ramarayar Mandapam in the Northern part of river Vaigai. After this event Alagar is taken to Mysore Veera Mandapam on decorated Anantharayar Palanquin. The next morning Alagar in the form of Kallar returns to Alagar kovil in ‘Poo Pallakku'(Palanquin decorated with flowers) In the month of April and may, each year the great Chitra festival is celebrated on Pournami (full moon day). The Festival dramatically re enacts the visitation of Lord Kallalagar to Madurai from Alagarkoil . Lakhs of devotees flock to river Vaigai to personally witness the event of lord Alagar stepping down into the river and to get his blessings. During the months of July and August the festival of Aadi Brahmmorchavam is being celebrated for 10 days. This festival occurs within the precincts of the shrine. Devotees from different parts of Tamilnadu throng to participate in this festival. The temple car ‘Amaiththa Narayanan’ is taken in procession during Pournami (Full-Moon day) of Aadi (Brahmotchavam). ==References== Category:Villages in Madurai district Category:Neighbourhoods and suburbs of Madurai ","title":"Alagar Koyil"},{"id":"1278405","text":"Kevin James Mawae (; born January 23, 1971) is a former American football center who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 16 seasons, primarily with the New York Jets.

He was Louisiana State's highest selected offensive lineman since Bo Strange in 1961. Mawae saw his first pro action at right guard against the Los Angeles Raiders on September 11,Kevin Mawae: Game Logs, Season 1994 and never left the lineup after taking over early in the game versus the Indianapolis Colts. He finished the season playing in 14 games, starting the final 11 at right guard. After the season Mawae earned first-team All-Rookie honors from Pro Football Weekly/Pro Football Writers Association, College and Pro Football Newsweekly and Football News. In 1995, he started all 16 games at right guard, seeing time at center in two games.Kevin Mawae: Game Logs. Season 1995 In his first two seasons he helped pave the way for Seahawks running back Chris Warren to have back-to-back seasons of over 1,300 yards rushing. He was moved to the center position at the start of his 1996 season and remained at that spot for the rest of his NFL career. ===New York Jets=== In 1998, Mawae was signed by the New York Jets. In his first season in New York, the Jets' offense averaged 357.2 yards per game (second-best in AFC and fourth-best in NFL), while controlling the ball for an average of 32:17 minutes per game (second-best in AFC and third-best in NFL), also helped running back Curtis Martin to rush for franchise-record eight 100-yard rushing games en route to 1,287-yard season. He started all 16 games. In 1999, he was named to his first Pro Bowl on December 22, he did not miss a play for the second straight season and paved the way for Martin's then franchise-record of 1,464 yards rushing, and snapped to three different quarterbacks; Vinny Testaverde, Rick Mirer and Ray Lucas. During the 2000 NFL season, he was member of the line that tied Indianapolis Colts for fewest sacks allowed during regular season with 20. Also helped Jets offense average 337.2 yards per game was the 12th best in NFL and the passing offense averaged 245.3 yards per game (sixth in NFL). Mawae earned his second consecutive starting spot as AFC team Pro Bowl center he was selected to the Pro Bowl on six consecutive occasions (1999–2004). In 2002, he underwent offseason shoulder surgery to repair damage to his left rotator cuff; he missed two preseason games but kept his consecutive games started streak by making 124th consecutive start in the season opener against the Buffalo Bills. His unbroken streak of 177 games came to an end in October 2005 with a serious triceps injury to his left arm, and he missed the rest of the season. On March 5, 2006, he was cut by the Jets. ===Tennessee Titans=== After being cut by the Jets, Mawae was signed by the Tennessee Titans nine days later on March 14, 2006. In his first season with Tennessee, he helped the offense rank third in the AFC and fifth in the NFL in rushing with 2,214 yards. The Titans set a franchise record by averaging 4.7 yards per carry, and the offensive line, led by Mawae, finished tied for 10th in the league with only 29 sacks allowed,NFL Stats: 2006 season Titans running back Travis Henry finished 2006 with 1,211 rushing yards and rookie quarterback Vince Young was named AP Offensive Rookie of the Year.

Mawae would be elected to his 7th and 8th Pro Bowl for the 2008 and 2009 seasons. His last game was the 2009 Pro Bowl in February 2010. On February 2, 2019, Mawae was announced to be a part of the 2019 Pro Football Hall of Fame class. ==NFL Players Association== Mawae joined the NFLPA's executive committee in 2002, was elected its president in March 2008, and was re-elected in 2010. In September 2010, Mawae announced his retirement from the NFL, however he continued to serve as president until the end of his term in March 2012. Mawae's term coincided with the death of longtime NFLPA executive director Gene Upshaw, and the 2011 NFL lockout, which Mawae has stated he believes hastened the end of his playing career. During the NFL kickoff game broadcast in 2010, players from the New Orleans Saints and Minnesota Vikings \\"raised an index finger\\" as they took the field, a gesture Mawae has called \\"one of the proudest moments I ever had\\". It was under his presidency that active players were present for negotiations of the collective bargaining agreement. He has also served as an assistant coach in the annual NFLPA Collegiate Bowl. ==Coaching career== In 2016, Mawae joined the Chicago Bears coaching staff as an assistant offensive line coach. He was not retained by the Bears for the 2017 season. In March 2018 Mawae joined the Arizona State University football staff as a quality control analyst where he was reunited with his former New York Jets head coach, Herm Edwards.ASU football adds former NFL offensive line standout Kevin Mawae as analyst ==Personal life== Mawae is of Hawaiian descent.

It was part of Province of Greater Poland, and its capital was in Łęczyca. The voivodeship had the area of 4,080 square kilometers, divided into three counties. Local sejmiks took place at Łęczyca. The city of Łódź, which until the 19th century was a small town, for centuries belonged to Łęczyca Voivodeship. The voivodeship was created by King Wladyslaw Lokietek, out of the territory of Duchy of Łęczyca, which had been established after the 1138 Testament of Bolesław III Krzywousty. It had five senators in the Senate of the Kingdom of Poland (since 1569 the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth). These were: Voivode of Łęczyca, Castellan of Łęczyca, Castellan of Brzeziny, Castellan of Inowlodz, and Castellan of Konary. At the sejmiks, local nobility elected four deputies to the Sejm of Poland, and two deputies to the Greater Poland Tribunal at Piotrków Trybunalski. Zygmunt Gloger in his monumental book Historical Geography of the Lands of Old Poland gives a detailed description of Łęczyca Voivodeship: \\"Following the testament of Boleslaw Krzywousty, the Land of Łęczyca was a separate duchy, ruled by princes of the Piast dynasty (...) King Wladyslaw Lokietek reunited the duchy with Poland, making it a separate voivodeship. Local residents were used to their own legal system, so King Władysław II Jagiełło decided to keep a separate official there. In 1418, the szlachta of Łęczyca established its own rules, the 27 Articles of Constitutiones Terrae Lanciciensis generales (...) The voivodeship had the area of 80 square miles, stretching from Klodawa in the north, to the Pilica river in the south, where it bordered Sandomierz Voivodeship. In the 16th century, it had 74 Roman-Catholic parishes, 25 towns and 875 villages. It was the second most densely populated voivodeship of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, behind Brześć Kujawski Voivodeship (...) Łęczyca Voivodeship had five senators: the Voivode of Łęczyca, the Castellan of Łęczyca, and the Castellans of Brzeziny, Inowlodz, and Konary (...) Of the three counties, the largest one was Łęczyca County, which covered more than half of the area of the voivodeship. Local sejmiks took place at Łęczyca, where four deputies were elected to the Sejm, and additional two to the Greater Poland Tribunal at Piotrków Trybunalski.

The deviation of this measured voltage from the base line is called the seismic response and is analyzed for structure of the earth. ==Etymology== The term geophone derives from the Greek word \\"γῆ (ge) \\" meaning \\"earth\\" and \\"phone\\" meaning \\"sound\\". ==Construction== Geosource Inc. MD-79—8Hz, 335Ω geophone Geophones have historically been passive analog devices and typically comprise a spring-mounted wire coil moving within the field of a case-mounted permanent magnet to generate an electrical signal. Recent designs have been based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology which generates an electrical response to ground motion through an active feedback circuit to maintain the position of a small piece of silicon. The response of a coil/magnet geophone is proportional to ground velocity, while MEMS devices usually respond proportional to acceleration. MEMS have a much higher noise level (50 dB velocity higher) than geophones and can only be used in strong motion or active seismic applications. Man using a geophone ==Frequency response== The frequency response of a geophone is that of a harmonic oscillator, fully determined by corner frequency (typically around 10 Hz) and damping (typically 0.707). Since the corner frequency is proportional to the inverse square root of the moving mass, geophones with low corner frequencies (< 1 Hz) become impractical. It is possible to lower the corner frequency electronically, at the price of higher noise and cost. Although waves passing through the earth have a three- dimensional nature, geophones are normally constrained to respond to single dimension - usually the vertical. However, some applications require the full wave to be used and three-component or 3-C geophones are used. In analog devices, three moving coil elements are mounted in an orthogonal arrangement within a single case. ==Uses== Single End Spread & Split Stread Royal Rumble Source Receivers single fold-3 Fold The majority of geophones are used in reflection seismology to record the energy waves reflected by the subsurface geology. In this case the primary interest is in the vertical motion of the Earth's surface. However, not all the waves are upwards travelling. A strong, horizontally transmitted wave known as ground-roll also generates vertical motion that can obliterate the weaker vertical signals. By using large areal arrays tuned to the wavelength of the ground-roll the dominant noise signals can be attenuated and the weaker data signals reinforced. Analog geophones are very sensitive devices which can respond to very distant tremors. These small signals can be drowned by larger signals from local sources. It is possible though to recover the small signals caused by large but distant events by correlating signals from several geophones deployed in an array. Signals which are registered only at one or few geophones can be attributed to unwanted, local events and thus discarded. It can be assumed that small signals that register uniformly at all geophones in an array can be attributed to a distant and therefore significant event. The sensitivity of passive geophones is typically 30 volts per (meter per second), so they are in general not a replacement for broadband seismometers. Conversely, some applications of geophones are interested only in very local events. A notable example is in the application of remote ground sensors (RGS) incorporated in unattended ground sensor (UGS) systems. In such an application there is an area of interest which when penetrated a system operator is to be informed, perhaps by an alert which could be accompanied by supporting photographic data. A network of geophones has been used on the moon surface too. == See also == * Accelerometer * Hydrophone * Michelson interferometer * Seismometer ==References== ==External links== * PSR-1 Seismic Intrusion Detector (Vietnam era military device) Category:Seismology instruments ","title":"Geophone"},{"id":"1278446","text":"Boyer () is a French surname.Albert Dauzat, Noms et prénoms de France, Librairie Larousse 1980, édition revue et commentée par Marie-Thérèse Morlet. p. 62a Bouvier.

He is co-owner of Thank You skateboards with Torey Pudwill, and also skates for the company alongside other sponsored team riders. Song was named the 2006 \\"Skater of the Year\\" by Thrasher magazine, an award that is widely considered to be one of the most significant honors in skateboarding. ==Early life== Song, a Korean American, was born in Seoul, South Korea, and grew up in Gardena, California, following a year spent with his grandmother in Hawaii, US. During the first half of his life, Song was raised by his older sister, who also raised Song's brother. Song revealed in a \\"Milestone\\" interview for The Skateboard Mag that both of his parents were perceived as \\"insane\\" by their neighbours due to their constant fighting—Song explained that, on occasion, he would need to telephone the police. Song's mother, who once shot her husband in the face, died in 1999, predeceasing Song's father. When he was fourteen years of age, Song started skateboarding during a two- month period when his parents were separated—he was given his first skateboard by his mother and was later sponsored by a skateboard shop in the South Bay area of Los Angeles, California called \\"Sporting Ideas\\". Prior to this, Song received attention for his artistic abilities, winning drawing contests and engaging in the commercial art field at a very young age. Song provided insight into his family life in a 2005 interview: > You know Asian parents, man; they’re gnarly. They want you to become some > lead pianist in an orchestra or, like every parent, they want you to become > a doctor. I was really into art when I was a young kid, and I won a lot of > awards, so my parents thought that’s what I’d pursue. Then I got picked up > in skateboarding and started getting free stuff. They were tripping, like, > “Where are you getting all this free stuff?” They thought I was stealing > money from them. Song attended the 135th Street school in Gardena, known for its aggressive reputation, and has explained the challenges that were present while he was growing up in the area, where gang activity was prolific: > Around my neighborhood, skating was actually big for a time, like in the > early ’90s. Then it started to die out. There was a lot of gang banging > going on in my old neighborhood in Gardena. I was seriously the only > skateboarder left at my school. I just hung in there ... A lot of guys quit > skating, one got killed, another guy was tagging on a freeway and got > killed. I watched all these friends of mine getting into the stupidest > things. And I was like, dude, I just need to stick with this skateboard > thing. But I didn’t stick with it as a career; I just thought it was > something to do after school, y’know? Skateboarding’s changed so much now. > It’s like kids skate just to get sponsored. Back then we skated the curb at > Rally’s burgers just for something to do. Song has relayed that he sighted Mullen skateboarding at his school and that Mullen, in turn, had observed Song skateboarding there. Song explained in a 2012 interview that his friend at the time spoke with Mullen and the professional skateboarder revealed that he was impressed by Song's skills and wanted to send Song skateboard decks to ride as an introduction to Mullen's fledgling business. Song agreed to the proposal and the relationship between the two skateboarders, now co-owners of the Almost skateboard company, commenced at that point in time. Mullen became a mentor figure to Song and the latter became a team rider for the Tensor company as the result of this relationship (as of July 2014, Song continues to be sponsored by Tensor). ==Career== ===World Industries=== Song became sponsored by World Industries at the age of sixteen years and appeared in numerous video productions for the company, including Love Child (1992). It is in Love Child that Song documented the first hardflip on film. Song has spoken about his time with World Industries in numerous interviews, particularly focusing on his time at the World Industries indoor skate park and being involved with a company that was overseen by Steve Rocco, the founder of World Industries and former business partner of Rodney Mullen—Mullen would later become a close friend and mentor to Song. Videographer, Socrates Leal, who filmed a large portion of the World Industries/Dwindle Distribution footage since the company's inception, released footage from the World Park as part of the \\"30 Shot\\" web-based project, including segments that feature Song. Leal has revealed during his narration for one of the segments that Song has always possessed a clear awareness of what aspects of his skateboarding he would like filmed and would often instruct the filmer while skateboarding. Love Child was then followed up by New World Order (1993) and Song has explained that the skateboarding world had significantly changed in the one-year period between the videos: > Then in ’93, with New World Order, things got more serious. More skaters > started coming up, and if you were filming something and someone already did > it, you’d have to come up with something better. From that point on, filming > got a lot harder. Song stated during his \\"Epicly Later'd\\" episode for Vice magazine's web channel that he misses his time at World Industries. ===Ankle injury=== In a July 2012 interview with the online magazine, Jenkem, Song revealed that he seriously contemplated ceasing skateboarding between the years 1996 and 1997, following an ankle injury that he sustained during the New World Order period. During this period, Song stated that he was predominantly located in the Long Beach area of Los Angeles while in a relationship with a girlfriend who was a member of the Bloods. Song considered a living modifying cars and eventually returned to skateboarding following a telephone call from his mentor, Rodney Mullen. Song had gone into further detail about this period of his life in a 2005 interview: > I lost touch with a lot of girls, and then I called Rodney and he wasn’t > doing too good. It was a wake-up call. At that moment I felt like I was a > pathetic piece of trash. They did all this for me and I was going to give it > up. It was almost as though Rodney brought me into this and had supported > me, and now it was my turn to support him. I just woke up and started > skating again and tried to make stuff happen again. Then Rodney and me > started doing our projects, and everything from that point on has been > working out great. ===Matix Clothing=== In 1998, Song founded the Matix Clothing apparel company with fellow professional skateboarder, Tim Gavin (retired), and distribution company, Podium Distribution (the Dunlap brothers, Kevin and Brian). In March 2013, Song explained the initial period of the brand's formation: > Gavin brought Rudy Johnson, Jeron Wilson and Sean Sheffey; and then for me, > I brought Marc Johnson, Rodney Mullen and, ahh, JB Gillett. And that was our > team—including me and Gavin; so there was eight. I remember when it first > started—me, Kevin and Brian and Gavin ... just funny how all these things we > talked about on the kitchen floor, having pizza, it actually went into > motion, and it was, like, \\"Wow, here are the first samples!\\" Song further explained that he was responsible for the origin of the Matix logo, after he drew a squiggle on a napkin that reminded him of someone pushing along on a skateboard. As of 2013, the brand had been existence for fifteen years and Song stated in March of that year, \\"we are still pushing strong\\". The Transworld Business website announced on July 2, 2012, that Matix Clothing had been acquired by \\"technical apparel brand\\", Westlife Distribution; the deal included intellectual property, inventory and accounts receivable. In a press release on September 4, 2012, Matix announced the re- signing of Daewon Song, Marc Johnson, and Mike Anderson to its team roster (notably absent was young and popular former rider, Torey Pudwill). The press release confirmed the relocation of the brand to Los Angeles, and company president, Brian Dunlap, stated, “I’m thrilled with the Westlife transition so far, and bringing these guys back onto the program was key. We have longstanding relationships and friendships that were important to keep intact, and the brand image will only grow stronger with such a good crew representing for us.” As of March 2013, the Matix skate team consisted of Song, Johnson, Mike Anderson, Zach Wallin, Auby Taylor, and Matt Berger—at this time, Song, Johnson, and Anderson all had signature clothing collections for sale. Together with 686, a snowboard company, the company relocated to a new premises in Compton, California, US in 2013. The Matix Fall 2014 catalog video, filmed in the Sierra Nevada region of California, US, was published on the brand's Vimeo channel. A press release from the Sequential Brands Group, which acquired the shoe brand in mid-2012, revealed that Song had renewed his contract with the company for a further three years. The CEO of the licensing and branding company, Colin Dyne, explained in the press release that “It is critically important to us that the authenticity and integrity of the DVS brand remain . By moving forward with Daewon, a legend in the skate arena, DVS is remaining true to its heritage”. Song stated in the same document that “DVS has been family since 1997 and has always had my back 100% and I will always have , 100%!!! Re-signing wasn’t even a question! Just needed to make sure the damn pen worked!”. On August 28, 2012, Song revealed in a Twitter post that he had commenced work on a new DVS project. Song received the cover of The Skateboard Mag, as part of a feature on the DVS Shoes tour to Detroit, US that occurred in late-2012—the photo is credited to Anthony Acosta, a close friend of Song. Song was previously featured on the cover of The Skateboard Mag, in a photo also taken by Acosta, skating a transitional structure that was tied to the back of a truck in Norwalk, California, US—Acosta has explained: > I found this sheet-metal halfpipe sitting on a truck bed about two miles > from where I used to live. I knew Daewon was the guy to call for this > natural miniramp. We shot a few things that day and ended up getting a cover > of The Skateboard Mag with one of the photos. The DVS Shoes Facebook profile published the advertisement for Song's thirteenth signature shoe model, part of the \\"Daewon Song Signature Series\\", named the \\"Daewon 13\\"—Song is photographed performing a trick on a rust- covered structure that is in a coastal location. One-time DVS filmer, Colin Kennedy, released a video compilation that he had produced with the use of footage filmed during the Skate More period, entitled \\"Daewon vs H20\\". The compilation shows various settings in which Song filmed skateboarding tricks in locations where water was a primary factor, including a metropolitan sculpture of a movie reel situated within a pool of water. Part of Kennedy's blurb for the video stated, \\"Daewon likes a challenge. Watch any of his video parts and you'll see what I mean ... You name it and he's skated it, or at least tried.\\" The footage that is used in the video was shot between 2002 and 2005. ===Deca=== After nine years with World Industries, Song left the company in 1999 to found Deca Skateboards, with a team that included Chris Haslam, JB Gillet, Shiloh Greathouse, and Marcus McBride (Cooper Wilt was featured in two \\"hidden parts\\" in the second Deca video 2nd to None). After three years of operation, during which time two videos—Sneak Preview and 2nd to None—were produced, Deca ceased operations in 2002. Following the brand's demise, McBride moved onto establishing the DGK company with Stevie Williams, Greathouse rode for Stacy Lowery and Michael Sieben's Bueno brand, JB Gillet joined the Cliche team, while Wilt and Haslam remained with Song for his next board company Artafact. ===Artafact=== Following the cessation of Deca, Song launched a short-lived company entitled Artafact in 2002, with Haslam and Wilt included as team riders—the brand was dismantled in 2003 after eight to twelve months of operation. In a 2012 interview for the \\"Weekend Buzz\\" segment of the internet-based RIDE channel, Haslam provided a perspective on Artafact in relation to Deca: \\"I think I liked Artafact better—the layout of the ads was always sick. It was nice and clean and there was, like, possibilities to go there, but, you know, I guess it didn't really go anywhere, so we changed it.\\" Song released a video part on The Berrics in January 2011 that could be purchased for US$0.99. The downloadable part, entitled \\"New Year's Dae\\", was made available for sale on January 11—and was thus promoted as a \\"1.11.11\\" video part—the part featured a combination of street, park, and transition skateboarding. The Almost video 5-Incher was released June 4, 2012, and Mullen is the only team member that is not featured. The film premiered at the Art Theater in Long Beach, California, on May 31, 2012. Song's section in 5-Incher is the penultimate part, with Haslam providing the video's \\"ender\\" (final section). On June 18, 2012, Song then released additional footage on the internet, entitled \\"Daewon 5 Incher B-Side Edit\\", free of charge. Song was featured on the cover of the November 2012 issue of Transworld Skateboarding Japan—he is shown performing a trick from his 5-Incher video part. The issue also features a full interview with Song, entitled \\"Daewon Song Best of 2012\\", and was sold with a DVD that consisted of the 5-Incher video and the Song B-Sides edit, among other sections. Video footage was published throughout 2013 of Song performing new tricks that had not been captured on film before. On June 25, 2013, Song filmed a transition trick that was later called a \\"bolt slapper\\", and on October 10, 2013, Song was filmed a performing a variation of the bolt slapper, the \\"360 shove it bolt slapper\\"—both tricks were filmed at the Crailtap skatepark in Torrance, California, US. The Almost company celebrated its 10th anniversary with an event at the Berrics indoor skate complex in early March 2014, at which team member Youness Amrani was presented with his inaugural professional skateboard deck. Socrates Leal, a longtime videographer for Dwindle Distribution, created a video retrospective of the brand's growth since inception, entitled \\"10 Years of Almost.\\" At the same time as the 10-year anniversary, the company released a collaborative series of skateboard decks with the DC Comics comic book brand—Song's deck features the Batman character. On October 26, 2018, Daewon Song left Almost. He and Torey Pudwill who left Plan B Skateboards made their own project called Thank You Skateboards. ====Death of Lewis Marnell==== An official announcement on January 20, 2013 revealed that Almost team member Lewis Marnell had died in the 48 hours prior to the announcement—details of the passing were not provided. Marnell had released a full video part in Almost's 5-Incher during the six-month period prior to his death. Marnell had been sponsored by Almost for six-and-a-half years and his inaugural video part for the Almost company was in the Daewon and Haslam miniramp video project Cheese and Crackers—Marnell was introduced as a new team member with the inclusion of his part in the \\"Bonus\\" section of the DVD release and Curtis Mayfield's \\"Move On Up\\" is the soundtrack to the part. Song stated on his Instagram profile: \\"@lewismarnell you are a true inspiration brotha and will be missed thank u for showing the world your amazing gifts, and thank u for being such a positive,kind and giving friend to all! RIP\\". Song then published another photograph on January 21, 2013, stating, \\"Shot this a while back!! reminded me of #lewismarnell 🙏 !! freedom is a gift and love and respect for each other makes for a better world !! #sorryboutpreaching\\". ===New sponsors=== In mid- December 2012, Song was added to the team of Brick Harbor, an online skateboard retailer that had been formed earlier in the same year. The announcement was made in the form of a brief video part, entitled \\"12 Dae's of Christmas\\", and a corresponding competition. Since the company's inception, Brick Harbor's team has predominantly consisted of professional skateboarders who had either originated from the East coast of the US, or who continue to be based on that side of the country—riders include Stevie Williams, Jake Johnson, Ishod Wair, Gino Iannucci, and PJ Ladd—and Song is the second West coast team rider to be added to the team, alongside Dennis Busenitz, whose hometown and city of residence is San Francisco, U.S. As of February 2017, though, the company is no longer in business. During 2012, Song was recruited onto the teams of two new companies that had been founded by fellow professional skateboarders, one who had skated for a clothing company, Matix, that Song had cofounded many years earlier. Paul Rodriguez and Joey Brezinski's (Brezinski had signed a contract with Tensor Trucks, the brand that also sponsors Song, in mid-2010) new bearing company, Andale, was officially launched in 2012 and Song left his position on the Bones bearing team (prior to Bones, Song had released signature model bearings and filmed a video part for the FKD company that, as of February 2013, is within the Syndrome Distribution company). Daewon is featured on the team page holding up a selection of Andale stickers and has joined former Almost professional Ryan Sheckler and ex-Deca rider JB GIllett on the team. Song is a featured as a sponsored rider on the Glassy Sunhaters sunglasses website and online store, co-owned/co-founded by professional skateboarder, Mike Mo Capaldi, and his brother, Vince. Shortly after the addition of Song, a signature sunglasses model, \\"The Daeviator\\", was released and promoted heavily on the relevant websites. The humorous line, \\"Daewon has personally blessed everyone single pair of these to give you a portion of his balance.....you're welcome.\\" accompanied the product's page on the Glassy Store website. Loud Headphones is a company that was founded by professional skateboarders, photographers, and videographers around 2012. The company states that its \\"main objective above all else is to start something that matters\\" and places an emphasis upon eco- friendly, low-cost packaging that allows more money to be spent on a worthwhile product and donations to its charitable partner the Let Them Hear Foundation. Song is one of the Loud-sponsored skateboarders, alongside other team members such as Sammy Baca and Fred Gall, and has released signature model earbud headphones. Song was announced as a team member of the newly formed Knox Hardware brand in early October 2013, alongside Chris Cole. The brand was founded by Song's longtime friend and Matix collaborator Gavin, and will also release apparel collections. Gavin explained to TransWorld Business: \\"Knox’s DNA and the story we want to tell is the Americana blue collar hard worker.\\" As of February 2017, though, the brand in no longer active. ===Setup=== On January 5, 2013, Song participated in an interview with the Alli Sports website to explain the hardware that he uses for his skateboard. Notable aspects of the interview were: Song rode a wide skateboard deck for over a decade and, in the period leading up to the interview, had followed through with a decision to transition to a wide deck—Song stated, \\"not much of a huge jump, but ... makes a difference.\\"; Song appreciates bright-colored skateboards for \\"something while it's flipping\\"—he cites red and black in the interview as preferred colors; Song tightens his trucks \\"fairly loose\\", with the back truck tighter than the front for stability—Song describes his front truck as \\"squirrelly\\", revealing that he strips down the components of the front truck so that there are only one bushing \\"below\\" the truck (between the deck and the truck) and two washers \\"above\\" the truck; and Song only rides radius wheels—he states that he has tried to ride wheels, but the difference was too significant. ===Sponsors=== As of February 2019, Song is sponsored by Thankyouskateboards, Matix Clothing, adidas Footwear, Tensor Trucks, Andale Bearings, Mob Griptape, Glassy, Spitfire Wheels, and Loud Headphones ===Video game appearances=== Song has made several appearances as a playable character in video games such as Grind Session and the Tony Hawk series of games. He remained a playable character in each iteration of the Tony Hawk series, starting with Tony Hawk's American Wasteland, and appears in every main game since, with the exception of Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam. He also appears in the game Tony Hawk: Ride. Song participated in \\"Tony Hawk's Secret Skatepark Tour\\" of America, which was organized to promote one of Hawk's video games. Alongside other skateboarders who appeared in the video game, Song toured the U.S. with Hawk's entourage and performed at random skatepark locations. During the tour, Song revealed his perspective in a magazine interview: \\"It's pretty crazy. I'm just used to some team manager knocking on your door, like, \\"Dude, we gotta get up.\\" On this one we have like schedules.\\" ===Contests=== Since cofounding Almost, Song's participation in contests has been limited to the single-elimination tournament \\"X Games Real Street,\\" in which sponsored skateboarders film a video part that they are judged on. Song competed in the 17th X Games contest in 2011. Alongside Chris Cole, Song was also nominated by Berrics viewers as the most-wanted contestant in the second edition, but failed to enter. Song later explained his reason for not entering contests such as Battle of the Berrics in a July 2013 interview: > Because I’m just the worst under pressure. When someone tells me that I am > supposed to do something, you’re not going to get it. I’m gonna slam. It has > to be spontaneous for me. Every once in a while, I’ll get a request and > somehow end up doing it, but usually, I can’t. Even if it’s fairly easy, I > won’t be able to do it. With those contests, there are all these people > watching who have such high expectations for me, I can only lose. I hate it. > I don’t want to let anybody down so I just shut down. In early 2014, Song was informed that he was a competitor in the \\"2Up\\" manual contest that was held at the Berrics and sponsored by Matix. (A manual is a trick whereby the skateboarder only uses two wheels.) The contest was an invitational and Song competed against nine other skateboarders, and the winner was voted by the fans of the website. Song was declared the winner on March 4, 2014 and received a trophy in addition to US$10,000 cash. Song was selected, again by the Berrics, for the \\"In Transition\\" contest that ran during October 2014. The Berrics \\"picked 10 of the most progressive skaters on the planet to choose one location each—any location in the world—and film a full part,\\" and Song chose to film his part at Channel Street in Los Angeles, U.S. ===Awards=== In 2006, Song was awarded the \\"Skater of the Year (SOTY)\\" title by Thrasher magazine. His SOTY feature article appeared in the April 2007 edition of the magazine, for which he also appeared on the front cover. After winning the Berrics' 2UP and In Transition contests during 2014, Song was voted as the most impactful skateboarder of the year in the Berrics' Populist poll. Song prevailed among a list of nominees that included Guy Mariano and Ben Raybourn, and received his trophy on January 27, 2015. In 2017, Daewon was inducted into the Skateboarding Hall of Fame. ==Influence== Song was identified by Transworld Skateboarding as the twenty-ninth most influential skateboarder of all time in a list that was published on the magazine's digital platform in December 2011. As part of the Transworld series, Stevie Williams, founder and owner of DGK (Dirty Ghetto Kids), identifies Song, together with Mullen, as one of his top five most influential skateboarders, while the same occurred during Tom Penny's interview for the same \\"Most Influential\\" series—Penny, identified as the twenty-first most influential, especially commended Song on his manual combinations. Skateboard photographer Giovanni Reda stated in an Instagram post in January 2013: \\"Daewon Song will forever be the greatest of all time in my eyes!\\" Paul Rodriguez identified Song in a \\"top ten\\" list of favorite professional skateboarders in July 2013: > Daewon to me has the best board control I have ever seen anyone have. The > things he can [do] with his skateboard.. technical abilities , the balance > he has while going a million miles a hour is incredible. I’ve never seen > anything like it. He still kills it, he’s still ripping and he’s been doing > it also for 20 plus years at the highest level. He is consistently getting > better, constantly pushing and reaching for [the] peak [of] his ability ... > My favorite video part of his would be ”RODNEY vs. DAEWON ROUND ONE”... When > that video was out and Round 2 I remember watching those video parts > countlessly. I may have seen those parts a million times, literally. Long-time friend and professional skateboarder Daniel Castillo explained his relationship to Daewon in relation to skateboarding in an August 2013 interview: > He has the same enthusiasm as he did when we were like 14-15. And he’s still > learning new tricks, which is insane because the dude has enough tricks. > He’s insane & is always amped to skate. It could honestly be anything. He’d > be amped to skate a little curb on the street. That’s why I love skating > with him because when I’m skating with him, it feels like I’m that age > again. Like I’m 14. Anytime I hang out or skate with him, I have no care in > the world except skating. In a 2005 Skateboarder interview, Song listed Rodney Mullen, Natas Kaupas, Christian Hosoi, Chris Haslam, and Eric Dressen as his top five \\"timeless influences.\\" In the same interview, Song listed his top five \\"Most underrated skaters\\" as Alan Peterson, Chany Jeanguenin, Cooper Wilt, Dan Drehobl, all pool skaters. After being named the twenty-ninth most influential skateboarder of all time by Transworld Skateboarding, Song listed his own top five all-time skateboarding influences: \\"Rodney Mullen. Christian Hosoi, just the way he flew—who else could make lycra shorts cool? Tommy Guerrero, Steve Caballero, and Natas Kaupas. Once he spun on that fire hydrant everyone was mesmerized, like going to their first magic show.\\" Song also revealed that he was interested in the Z-Boys when he was a young skateboarder. ==Perspectives== In an interview with Juice magazine, Song explained his passion for skateboarding: > I like skateboarding for what it is. I like being able to do it by myself. > You need another person to hit the ball. You need someone to pitch something > at you or block for you to make a basket. With skateboarding, I just pick up > my board and do exactly what I want to do. Some days I have a good day and > some days I feel like a complete dip-shit; like I’ve never been > skateboarding in my life. I love the experience of it. I love the fact that > on one day I can do everything I’ve ever learned and the next day I feel > like I’ve lost everything. That’s skateboarding. It’s amazing. I like the > challenges. Skateboarding is one of the most challenging things. Song has been vocal about the importance of fun in regard to skateboarding and the importance of individuality, in contrast to elitism and dogmatism in the sub-culture. In his appearance on Vice's Epicly Later'd program, Song inadvertently meets a fan at a public skate location that appeared in his video part for Love Child and shares an opinion with the teenage male: \\"Just keep skating. Don't even worry about ... don't ever sweat, like, 'is this good enough? Is that good enough?' Like, as long as you're happy with it, that's fine.\\" Song expanded upon this sentiment in a voiceover segment for Thrasher magazine, in relation to Haslam's footage in Cheese and Crackers, stating: > Do whatever you want—go skate a mini-ramp; go skate a really mini-ramp; go > skate a big ramp. Basically, just go skate; set up whatever you want and > don't worry about what people say, like, 'Ah, that was stupid', or, 'That > was ugly', or 'That's not cool'—it's, you know, who cares what's cool? > You're the one who gets to do it. They're just–some people are just jealous > 'cause they're not the ones who can do it, so, even if it is something that > they consider, 'Oh, that's ugly', once they–if they can do it and they think > it's ugly, then, you know, that's their opinion and that's cool, you know. > But when people that don't even skate at all and they wanna sit there and > go, 'That was lame', that's just, you know, that just sucks. Song listed the following video parts as his all-time favorites in a 2011 interview with online magazine, Caught in the Crossfire: John Cardiel: Sight Unseen, Sean Sheffey: Life, and PJ Ladd: PJ Ladd's Wonderful, Horrible Life. Song resides in San Pedro, Los Angeles, California, US. ===Fatherhood=== In 2005, Song provided the public with an insight into his role as a father: > It’s crazy. He [son’s name] brings a different perspective on the world. > Having a kid is a lot of work, though. Holy shit! I’d be filming all day and > get home sometimes at 12 or 1 in the morning, and he’d just get up—boom!—and > wouldn’t go to bed until 6 in the morning. This was seriously like every > other day. I was just exhausted. In a Twitter post and Pheed photo upload on January 1, 2013, Song featured an image of his son with a pet dog and the following blurb: \\"2013!!! it's amazing every time I get 2 see my son he teaches me something new, it's the small things i love about being a dad and am blessed to have such a great son !!\\" ==References== ==External links== *Almost Skateboards official website *DVS Shoe Company official website *Matix Clothing official website Category:American people of Korean descent Category:American skateboarders Category:South Korean emigrants to the United States Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Seoul Category:Asian- American skateboarders ","title":"Daewon Song"},{"id":"1278449","text":"Joel-Peter Witkin (born September 13, 1939) is an American photographer who lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico. His work often deals with themes such as death, corpses (and sometimes dismembered portions thereof), and various outsiders such as people with dwarfism, transgender and intersex persons, as well as physically deformed people. Witkin's complex tableaux often recall religious episodes or classical paintings. ==Biography== Witkin was born to a Jewish father and Roman Catholic mother. His twin brother, Jerome Witkin, and son Kersen Witkin, are also painters. Witkin's parents divorced when he was young because they were unable to overcome their religious differences. He attended grammar school at Saint Cecelia's in Brooklyn and went on to Grover Cleveland High School. In 1961 Witkin enlisted in the United States Army with the intention of capturing war photography during the Vietnam war. However, due to scheduling conflicts, Witkin never saw combat in Vietnam. Witkin spent his military time at Fort Hood, Texas, and was mostly in charge of Public Information and classified photos. In 1967, he became the official photographer for City Walls Inc. He attended Cooper Union in New York, where he studied sculpture, attaining a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1974. Columbia University granted him a scholarship for graduate school, but his Master of Fine Arts degree is from the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque .http://www.ethertongallery.com/html/artist_detail.php?recordID=10 == Influences and themes == Witkin claims that his vision and sensibility spring from an episode he witnessed as a young child, an automobile accident in front of his house in which a little girl was decapitated. He says his family's difficulties also influenced his work. His favorite artist is Giotto. His photographic techniques draw on early Daguerreotypes and on the work of E. J. Bellocq. Those of Witkin's works which use corpses have had to be created in Mexico to get around restrictive US laws. Because of the transgressive nature of the contents of his images, his works have been labelled exploitative and have sometimes shocked public opinion. His techniques include scratching the negative, bleaching or toning the print, and using a hands-in-the-chemicals printing technique. This experimentation began after seeing a 19th-century ambrotype of a woman and her ex-lover who had been scratched from the frame. Joel-Peter Witkin's photograph \\"Sanitarium\\" inspired the final presentation of Alexander McQueen's Spring/Summer 2001 collection based on avian imagery, the walls of another box within the faux psychiatric ward collapsed to reveal a startling tableau vivant: a reclining, masked nude breathing through a tube and surrounded by fluttering moths. == Documentary == In July 2011, filming began on the feature-length documentary, Joel-Peter Witkin: An Objective Eye. The film, directed by Thomas Marino, examines Witkin's life and photographs. Along with interviews with Joel-Peter Witkin, the film features interviews from gallery owners, prominent artists, photographers, and scholars who share insight into the impact of Witkin's work and influence on modern culture. Filming took place in Albuquerque, Los Angeles, New York City, and Paris. The film was released on July 6, 2013 for digital download and streaming/rental. The film will be part of the permanent collections at the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris, France, and the Biblioteca Nacional de Chile in Santiago, Chile. \\"Joel-Peter Witkin: An Objective Eye\\" was first publicly shown in Santiago, Chile at the Biblioteca Nacional de Chile on July 31, 2013, as part of the opening of the exhibition, \\"Vanitas: Joel-Peter Witkin en Chile\\". Those in attendance of this premiere included Joel-Peter Witkin, his wife Barbara, and gallery owner Baudoin Lebon. == Chronology == * 1939: Born in Brooklyn September 13, 1939 to Max and Mary (Pellegrino) Witkin.; one child, Kersen Ahanu Witkin; m.

It was part of the historic Kujawy region and the Greater Polish prowincja. Originally, its name was Brzesc Voivodeship (Wojewodztwo brzeskie), but after the 1569 Union of Lublin, it was renamed into Brzesc Kujawski Voivodeship, to distinguish it from Lithuanian Brest Litovsk Voivodeship (Polish: Wojewodztwo brzesko-litewskie). ==Geography== Its area was 3,276 sq. kilometers, divided into five counties. The seat of the voivode was at Brześć Kujawski, while local sejmiks for both Brześć Kujawski and Inowrocław Voivodeships took place at Radziejow. It was one of the smallest and most densely populated voivodeships of the Commonwealth. Zygmunt Gloger in his monumental book Historical Geography of the Lands of Old Poland provides this description of Brześć Kujawski Voivodeship: > “East of the land of the Polans lies the region of Kujawy, most of which > stretches along left bank of the Vistula. The region was divided into two > voivodeships: those of Brześć Kujawski, and Inowrocław. Third part of > historic Kujawy, the Dobrzyn Land, lies on the right bank of the Vistula. > Duke Boleslaw Krzywousty, while writing his testament in 1138, united Kujawy > and Mazovia, giving it to his son Boleslaw IV the Curly (...)

The nautical equivalent is a naval ensign. Under the strictest sense of the term, few countries today currently have proper war flags, most preferring to use instead their state flag or standard national flag for this purpose. __TOC__ ==History== Field signs were used in early warfare at least since the Bronze Age. The word standard itself is from an Old Frankish term for a field sign (not necessarily a flag). Babur and his Mughal Army saluting the Nine Standards of Timur. The use of flags as field signs apparently emerges in Asia, during the Iron Age, possibly in either China or India.flag. (2008). Encyclopædia Britannica.

The Roman Vexillum itself is also \\"flag- like\\" in the sense that it was suspended from a horizontal crossbar as opposed to a simple flagpole. Use of simple flags as military ensigns becomes common during the medieval period, developing in parallel with heraldry as a complement to the heraldic device shown on shields. The maritime flag also develops in the medieval period. The medieval Japanese Sashimono carried by foot-soldiers are a parallel development. Some medieval free cities or communes did not have coats of arms, and used war flags that were not derived from a coat of arms. Thus, the city of Lucerne used a blue-white flag as a field sign from the mid 13th century, without deriving it from a heraldic shield design. == Current war flags == === Used by armed forces only === === Army (land) use only === === War flags that are also naval ensigns === === Other war flags === == Former war flags == == See also == *Colours, standards and guidons ==References== ==Further reading== * Wise, Terence (1978) Military flags of the world, in color.

Each guitar fret is separated into six segments, creating independent contact switches for each string. The organ notes are keyed when a string touches a specific segment. An expression pedal is used to fade the organ sound in and out, while the guitar can be played at the same time. ==History== Controls of the Vox V251 Bob Murrell is credited with its invention and Musiconics International (MCI) of Waco, Texas claims to have introduced the Guitorgan. However, many others like Dan Johnson of The Johnson Music Co. St. Petersburg Fl. have created them starting with many models of the guitar. In any case, all have the basics in common: Convert a standard electric guitar into a Guitorgan through the addition of electronic organ components. The most critical part of making a Guitorgan is to separate each guitar fret into six segments, creating independent contact switches for each string. The organ notes are keyed when a string touches a specific segment, thus, making the ground connection necessary for the organ circuit to produce output. TTL logic circuitry determines the highest fret segment making contact on each string, and prevents simultaneous organ notes on the same string to activate; only the highest organ note played on a particular string will sound. The organ section in a Guitorgan is a 6-note polyphonic circuit, which allows full guitar chords to be played. The guitar section always remains playable, but organ notes can be played alone or simultaneously with the guitar. The idea behind being a \\"Guitorganist\\" is to use the Guitorgan's expression pedal to creatively and accurately bring the organ in and out of the musical foreground while playing the guitar at the same time (and vice versa) as if there are actually two separate musicians playing. Murrell worked on converting existing products from the late 1960s. In 1968, he had a significant run of instruments based on semi-hollow body guitars from Japan. The B-300 and M-340 are among the most common examples from this run. Also in existence are the M-300 and the B-35 models. The B-300 FSG (Frequency Synthesized Guitorgan) models, introduced in the early '70s along with the B-35, are based on a master oscillator circuit utilizing a special 12-note divider integrated circuit which is an improvement to the older 12 oscillator design, the advantage being that tuning the FSG organ circuit only requires adjustment of the master oscillator frequency rather than adjustment of each of the 12 oscillator frequencies on the older models. Note that FSG pedals cannot be used with non-FSG Guitorgans and vice versa, since the two versions run on a different DC voltage. The multi-pin cable that goes between an FSG pedal and an FSG Guitorgan was labeled with RED ends at MCI for a safety reminder. Bob continued to introduce upgrades to the Guitorgan design that included analog synthesizer interfaces and even MIDI in the mid-1980s. Following the creation of the Guitorgan, Vox quickly produced their own version, known as the Guitar Organ, which was roughly based on their Continental organ voice boards. In the mid-'70s, Godwin produced the rare Organ (Guitar) in two versions. The flagship model had 19 switches and 13 knobs, while the lower model had 16 switches and 4 knobs. Some of the sounds produced by the Guitorgan can be heard in Teisco Del Rey's \\"The Many Moods of.\\" Bill Dillon is another practitioner of the Guitorgan. He has performed on many Sarah McLachlan albums and appeared with Counting Crows. Woody Jackson's guitorgan playing can be heard on Orchestra Superstring's self-titled album and many film soundtracks Ocean's Thirteen, Ocean's Twelve, Fun with Dick and Jane and The Devil Wears Prada to name a few. Wellington-based frank-rock band Hotdog Cereal's \\"Everyday I'm Doggin'\\" E.P. includes a number of songs that showcase the guitorgan. These include Dog Me Out, Guitorgasm, and Mr Roth's Haunted Mansion.

It is the third racing game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, and the first to feature 3D computer graphics. The player races one of ten Sonic characters in various Sonic-themed race tracks as they attempt to stop Doctor Robotnik from stealing the Chaos Emeralds and enslaving the world. Sonic R features single-player and multiplayer game modes, and while similar to kart racing games such as Mario Kart, it places an emphasis on jumping and exploration. By collecting items and completing objectives, players can unlock secret characters. Development began after the completion of Sonic 3D Blast in 1996 and took nine months. It was the second collaboration between Traveller's Tales and Sonic Team and was designed to take advantage of the Saturn hardware. Sonic Team designed the race tracks, while Traveller's Tales handled implementation and programming using a custom game engine. The soundtrack was composed by Richard Jacques; tracks from the game, most notably \\"Super Sonic Racing\\", have been reused in subsequent Sonic titles. Sega released the game for the Saturn in late 1997, for Windows the following year, and for the GameCube and PlayStation 2 as part of Sonic Gems Collection in 2005. Sonic R was the only original Sonic title released for the Saturn; Sonic 3D Blast is a port of the Mega Drive game, and Sonic Jam is a compilation of the first four Sonic games. Initial reviews for the game were mixed, with retrospective reception being more negative. It was praised for its visuals and level design, but criticized for its controls and short length. Meanwhile, Jacques' soundtrack polarized audiences, who alternatively found it catchy and well produced or out of place in a racing game. Fan interest in Sonic R would inspire Sega to revisit the racing genre in future Sonic games, leading to the development of titles such as Sonic Riders (2006). == Gameplay == Sonic racing on the \\"Resort Island\\" race track Sonic R is a racing video game with single-player and multiplayer modes. The player selects a character and participates in a footrace on one of five race tracks, competing for the fastest time ahead of the other racers. Four characters are initially available, while the other six are secret characters that become available when the player completes certain in-game objectives.Official Guide, p. 31 Although the gameplay is considered similar to kart racing games such as the Mario Kart series, Sonic R places an emphasis on jumping and exploration, as each track has multiple paths and hidden areas. The tracks, although original creations, are thematically based on the art style and environments of classic Sonic games such as Sonic the Hedgehog's \\"Green Hill Zone\\" and Sonic the Hedgehog 2s \\"Chemical Plant Zone\\". During each race, the player is able to collect items scattered across the track, bestowing advantages. Rings, a staple Sonic series item, are abundant; the player can exchange rings to gain a temporary speed boost or open doors leading to short cuts or special items. \\"Item Panels\\" give a random temporary advantage, such as a speed increase or shields that grant abilities such as being able to run across water or attract nearby rings.Sonic R Instruction Booklet. North American, Sega Saturn version. p 13 (PDF) Collection of other special items, such as \\"Sonic Tokens\\" and the Chaos Emeralds, may lead to the unlocking of secret characters. Sonic R allows the player to select the type of weather seen during races. There is also a \\"Time Attack\\" mode, where the player races solo to get the fastest time, and a two player competitive mode, increased to four-players in the Gems Collection port. In addition to the standard time trial mode, there are two others: \\"Get 5 Balloons\\", where five balloons are scattered across the track and must be located, and \\"Tag 4 Characters\\", where the player chases and must catch four others.Official Guide, p. 33. === Characters === Sonic R features ten playable racers, each with unique attributes and abilities falling in line with their usual abilities.Official Guide, pp. 10-24. The title character, Sonic the Hedgehog, is the fastest and possesses the ability to \\"double jump\\" (being able to perform a second jump in mid-air).Sonic R Instruction Booklet. North American, Sega Saturn version. p 17 (PDF) Tails is able to fly through the air for a short time, and Knuckles the Echidna can glide through the air upon jumping.Sonic R Instruction Booklet. North American, Sega Saturn version. p 18 (PDF) Amy Rose, the last initially available character, drives a car, allowing her to hover over bodies of water and receive extra speed from driving over boost spaces. Secret characters include Sonic's archenemy Dr. Robotnik, who flies in a hovercraft and resists differences in terrain; robotic clones of Sonic (Metal Sonic), Tails (Tails Doll), and Knuckles (Metal Knuckles); Robotnik's robotic assistant EggRobo;Official Guide, p. 22. and Super Sonic, a faster version of Sonic powered by the Chaos Emeralds. == Plot == Sonic and Tails are about to take a holiday when Tails notices an advertisement for a \\"World Grand Prix\\".Instruction Booklet, p. 3 (PDF) While not initially interested, Sonic notices that Dr. Robotnik is also participating in the race, which persuades him to change his mind and enter the race. It is revealed that Robotnik has recently learned of the whereabouts of the rare and powerful Chaos Emeralds, with which he aspires to enslave the world, and the World Grand Prix is actually a trap used to distract Sonic. Knuckles and Amy overhear of Robotnik's plan and decide to compete. Together, the four must balance both winning races and obtaining the Chaos Emeralds to keep them out of Robotnik's reach. == Development == After the completion of Sonic 3D Blast in 1996, Sega approached Traveller's Tales about working on another Sonic game, this time being a racing game. Traveller's Tales, who coincidentally had been working on a 3D graphics engine without a purpose at the time, found this to be a logical progression, and accepted the project. Traveller's Tales chose to rebuild a Formula One game they were developing into a Sonic-branded title. Development started in February 1997 as a joint project between Sega's Sonic Team and Traveller's Tales. The game was originally known as Sonic TT (the TT standing for Tourist Trophy). It was first publicly announced as \\"Phase Two of Project Sonic\\" (with \\"Phase One\\" being Sonic Jam). The schedule was tight, and Traveller's Tales requested more freedom than they had with Sonic 3D Blast. Sonic Team designed the race tracks and the game's general flow, and Traveller's Tales were responsible for the implementation and programming. Each track was inspired by levels from previous Sonic games such as Green Hill and Casino Night, and it was due to the tight schedule that there were only five. Secret areas and exploration phases were added to follow the series' traditions (Sonic Team also wanted a cross between a racing game and a platforming game), and for this reason a map was developed. Sega of Europe producer Kats Sato handled communication with Sonic Team, as he was the only person who could speak both English and Japanese. Discussions led to the reward mechanisms, which Sato believed broadened the game. The courses' look and feel were inspired by other Sonic games, including Sonic 3D Blast. The 3D models were based on 2D sketches from Sonic Team. All models and animations were developed using Softimage, while Traveller's Tales created their own tools for the remaining game development. Implementing the two-player split- screen mode proved difficult; programmer Jon Burton stated that this was mainly because it was difficult to ensure cheating was not too easy, so shortcuts were made challenging, with a penalty incurred if players got them wrong. A major development goal was to maintain a consistent 30 frames per second frame rate during gameplay. A custom game engine was developed to take full advantage of the Sega Saturn hardware, and a graphical technique, described as \\"12 layer transparency\\", was used to transparentise distant textures to conceal the Sega Saturn's limited draw distance. Burton claimed that Sonic R could not have been replicated on other consoles during the timeframe, such as the PlayStation console, due to the technique developed specifically for the Sega Saturn hardware. Environment mapping was achieved by writing what Burton described as a software version of the PlayStation's hardware rendering, as the Saturn's hardware was incapable of it. An early build was unveiled at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Atlanta, Georgia in June 1997, with Sega releasing screenshots of a \\"40% complete build\\" to various magazines shortly afterwards. The builds would be largely the same as the final game, with the exception of minor tweaks, such as the ability to play the \\"Resort Island\\" level being in sunset, rather than bright sunshine, a change that was made because of the level's music track titled \\"Can You Feel The Sunshine?\\" Traveller's Tales had used programming techniques inspired by those (such as a type of fog known as \\"Pixie Dust\\") used on the Nintendo 64. Hirokazu Yasuhara of Sonic Team went to England and fine-tuned the game due to lack of time for communication. Technical and scheduling issues caused Sato to change the game design, leading to a dispute with producer Yuji Naka, and Sato removed his name from the credits. The game's final release would be first in North America on 18 November 1997, with releases in other regions occurring in late 1997 for the Sega Saturn, and into 1998 for the PC version. The PC versions allowed the user to alter graphics details such as allowing to change between software rendering and 3D acceleration or adjusting the game's draw distance, affecting how soon objects in the distance are visible.Sonic R Game, Options Menu Like many other previous Sonic games during this time period, a largely unrelated Sonic R game was released as a Tiger Electronics LCD handheld game around the same time in 1998. === Music === The soundtrack for Sonic R was composed by British composer Richard Jacques of Sega Europe, who had also previously worked on the soundtrack of the Sega Saturn and PC versions of Sonic 3D Blast. Work on the soundtrack began in March 1997 when Jacques travelled to Japan to meet with Sonic creator Yuji Naka to discuss the musical approach to take for the game. The first song written was \\"Super Sonic Racing,\\" which would be used for the game's reveal in June at E3. British singer TJ Davis provided the vocals for the song, which Naka liked so much that he requested that she be featured in all the game's songs. Jacques wrote all the lyrics for the songs with the intention that they would complement the on-screen action but still be appealing to someone who had never played the game. Tracks were recorded and programmed at Sega Digital Studios, and then worked on for two weeks at Metropolis Studios in London, where a week was spent on vocals, and a week was spent on producing, mixing, and finalising the tracks. Jacques stated that this task was amongst the most difficult in his career because the lyrics needed to \\"really mean something\\". Sonic R features two separate mixes of each song in its in-game soundtrack; ones with vocals and instrumental versions, giving the player the option to disable vocals. An official soundtrack CD was released on 21 January 1998.Official Guide, p. 112. == Reception == The Saturn version of Sonic R received mixed reviews from critics at the time of its release, although retrospective commentary has been more negative. It received an aggregate score of 69 per cent from GameRankings, based on six reviews, and the PC version received 70 per cent based on two. The game's visuals were considered its strongest feature. AllGame called the textures vibrant and noted they had \\"no pop-up or glitching\\", and Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) felt the environmental details were lush. EGM and Sega Saturn Magazine highlighted the consistent frame rate (which rarely dropped below 30 frames per second) as a noteworthy achievement, with the latter favourably comparing Sonic R to the Saturn version of Sega Rally Championship. Next Generation hailed the game as \\"the most visually outstanding Saturn title\\" for its use of transparency effects and reflective surfaces, a sentiment echoed by EGM. Sega Saturn Magazine cited the \\"Radiant Emerald\\" level, which is made from transparent polygons, as far superior when compared to Mario Kart 64s \\"Rainbow Road\\". GameSpot stated that the cartoonish style of previous Sonic games worked well in 3D. GameSpot, EGM, and GamePro criticised the background's graphical \\"pop-up\\", with GamePro opining that it ruined the multiplayer mode. However, Sega Saturn Magazine praised the two- player mode for maintaining the same speed and graphical detail as its single- player counterpart. Game Informer asserted that \\"the way they hid the background pop through translucent melting is innovative\\", but they panned the poor quality of the character animation. Finally, Sega Saturn Magazine complimented the replay mode's more dramatic camera angles. Critical reaction to the game's level design was also positive. Game Informer found the tracks imaginative and filled with secrets, while EGM and them \\"some of the most well-designed tracks ever\\". AllGame, EGM, and Game Informer thought similarly. Sega Saturn Magazine compared the level design to that of the 16-bit Sonic titles and Sonic Team's Nights into Dreams..., noting that \\"far more fun is to be gleamed from the exploration element\\" than \\"the temptation ... to leg it through each of the levels in a time trial-like way\\". In a similar vein, Next Generation described Sonic R and Nintendo 64 contemporary Diddy Kong Racing as \\"less of a racing title and more of a driving adventure game\\". Sega Saturn Magazine commented on the replay value provided by alternate modes, such as \\"Get 5 Balloons!\\", but conceded that \\"five tracks don't really suffice, even with the reverse mode\\". GameSpot, EGM, and Game Informer also expressed disappointment with the limited selection of levels. The title's controls and overall gameplay were criticised, with some questioning their accuracy and depth. GameSpot finished every level in first place within one hour using only one of the four initial characters. While the game also features a hard mode, GameSpot concluded that \\"Sonic R has more in the personality department than in the depth department\\". GameSpot and Game Informer cited finding the Chaos Emeralds and hidden coins as difficult, but GameSpot argued that such optional tasks offered little in return, because the hidden characters \\"are mostly robot versions of the already playable ones\\". Moreover, AllGame believed the controls took time to get used to, but added: \\"Start sliding around corners and letting off the gas at the right times and you'll be finding all of the secrets that Sonic R conceals in no time\\". Likewise, Sega Saturn Magazine called the controls \\"initially tricky ... but incredibly playable,\\" Next Generation stated \\"the proper techniques, with time, can be learned,\\" and Game Informer concluded \\"once you get used to it, you'll find a real solid game\\". Game Informer thought the game played better with the digital pad as opposed to Sega's analogue controller. GamePro agreed that the controls were responsive, but to a fault: \\"At high speeds, it's nearly impossible to run in a straight line\\". Sonic R's soundtrack was particularly divisive. Sega Saturn Magazine described the \\"storm of controversy [that] surrounds the accompanying music\\", which \\"has come in for a bit of a slagging on the Internet recently for the addition of vocals.\\" Although he was not a fan of dance music, Nutter stated that the tracks were \\"better than most chart stuff\\", while the included instrumental versions were sufficient \\"to appease everyone\\". AllGame offered high praise for the soundtrack, which they called \\"One of the most inspired ... I've ever heard\\", while GameSpot believed the songs gave the game so much more personality\\". Conversely, GamePro deplored the music as \\"unbelievably annoying\\". Computer and Video Games complimented the music, saying it \\"fits the Sonic style perfectly\\", and is reminiscent of Sonic CDs soundtrack. The ported version of the game available in Sonic Gems Collection was more negatively reviewed. Eurogamer called the game \\"too awkward to play for any length of time\\", and 1UP.com wrote the visuals were grainy—\\"mak[ing] it hard to tell where you're going\\"—and the controls were frustrating and imprecise. GameSpot described \\"its laughably bad soundtrack\\" as \\"[its] only redeeming quality\\", and GameSpy called Sonic R \\"a concept that works better in theory than in practice\\"—despite its \\"fantastic (if not bizarre) soundtrack\\". Conversely, Jeuxvideo.com, in a negative review of Sonic Gems Collection, praised the game, arguing that it was the only decent game in the compilation alongside Sonic CD. In a 2003 retrospective, Game Informer described the game as \\"decent, but unmemorable\\", while GamesRadar included Sonic R in a 2014 list of the top 50 Sega Saturn games, calling it \\"a technical tour de force\\". GameTrailers ranked it as the second worst Sonic game, behind 2006's Sonic the Hedgehog. Game designer Hirokazu Yasuhara, who helped Traveller's Tales rework the game in response to concerns over the quality of a preview version, has maintained that \\"the final version of Sonic R is actually quite good ... However, I do admit that the base concept of Sonic R, in which a player 'drives' running characters, is not great\\". == Legacy == Despite Sega releasing two Sonic racing games prior to Sonic R, Sonic Drift and Sonic Drift 2, for the Sega Game Gear, developer Takashi Yuda cited fans requesting more racing games in the vein of Sonic R would be Sega's actual inspiration for revisiting the genre in future years. This led to the development and release of the hoverboarding game Sonic Riders, although there are no connections between the two games other than both being racing games. Later Sonic racing games include Sonic Riders sequels Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity and Sonic Free Riders, and kart games Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed and Team Sonic Racing. Songs from Sonic Rs soundtrack were included in later games featuring Sonic in their original forms or as remixes, including Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Sonic Generations, Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing and Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed. The 2019 release Team Sonic Racing features several references to Sonic R, including remixes of songs from the soundtrack (including \\"Super Sonic Racing\\" and \\"Can You Feel the Sunshine\\") and the use of the distinctive red \\"R\\" in the game's logo and on the in-game currency. == Notes == == References == === Sources === * == External links == * Official Sega Minisite (Sega Saturn) * Official Sega Minisite (PC) Category:1997 video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Racing video games Category:Sega Saturn games Category:Sega video games Category:Sonic the Hedgehog video games Category:Traveller's Tales games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games produced by Yuji Naka Category:Video games scored by Richard Jacques Category:Windows games ","title":"Sonic R"},{"id":"1278484","text":"Siboney may refer to: ==Arts== * Siboney (film), a Mexican-Cuban drama film * \\"Siboney\\" (song), a 1929 song by Ernesto Lecuona * Siboney, a 1985 album by Slim Gaillard ==Places== * Siboney, Cuba, a town in eastern Cuba * Siboney, Oklahoma, a town absorbed by the town of Manitou, Oklahoma * Siboney, a neighborhood in Playa, Havana in Cuba ==Other uses== * The Ciboney or Siboney, an indigenous people of Cuba * Siboney (rum), a brand of rums * Siboney de Cuba, a cattle breed * , two U.S. Navy ships of the name ","title":"Siboney"},{"id":"1278486","text":"Inowrocław Voivodeship () was a unit of administrative division and local government in Poland from the 14th century to the First Partition of Poland in 1772. Together with the neighbouring Brześć Kujawski Voivodeship it was part of the Kuyavia region and the Greater Polish prowincja. With size of some 2,900 km2 (together with Dobrzyn Land, its area was 5,877 km2.), it was one of the smallest voivodeships of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In early years after its creation (14th century), it was called Gniewkowo Voivodeship (Województwo gniewkowskie), from the town of Gniewkowo, the seat of local Piast princes. Last mention of Gniewkowo Voivodeship was in 1420. Even though the capital of the voivodeship was in Inowrocław, its biggest urban center was Bydgoszcz.

Limping may be caused by pain, weakness, neuromuscular imbalance, or a skeletal deformity. The most common underlying cause of a painful limp is physical trauma; however, in the absence of trauma, other serious causes, such as septic arthritis or slipped capital femoral epiphysis, may be present. The diagnostic approach involves ruling out potentially serious causes via the use of X-rays, blood tests, and sometimes joint aspiration. Initial treatment involves pain management. A limp is the presenting problem in about 4% of children who visit hospital emergency departments. ==Definition== A limp is a type of asymmetric abnormality of the gait. When due to pain it is referred to as an antalgic gait, in which the foot is in contact with the ground for a shorter duration than usual; in severe cases there may be a refusal to walk. Hip deformities with associated muscular weakness, on the other hand, may present with a Trendelenburg gait, with the body shifted over the affected hip. ==Differential diagnosis== The causes of limping are many and can be either serious or non-serious. It usually results from pain, weakness, neuromuscular imbalance, or a skeletal deformity. In 30% of cases, the underlying cause remains unknown after appropriate investigations. The most common underlying cause of limping in children is minor physical trauma. In those with no history of trauma, 40% are due to transient synovitis and 2% are from Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome. Other important causes are infectious arthritis, osteomyelitis, and slipped capital femoral epiphysis in children. ===Infection=== ====Septic arthritis==== Septic arthritis can be difficult to separate from less serious conditions such as transient synovitis. Factors that can help indicate septic arthritis rather than synovitis include a WBC count greater than 12×109/l, fever greater than , ESR greater than 40 mm/h, CRP greater than 2.0 mg/dL, and refusal to walk. People with septic arthritis usually look clinically toxic or sick. Even in the absence of any of these factors, however, septic arthritis may be present. Joint aspiration is required to confirm the diagnosis. ====Other==== Other infections that classically lead to a limp include Lyme disease (a bacterial infection spread by deer ticks) and osteomyelitis (an infection of the bone). ===Mechanical=== ====Trauma==== Accidental or deliberate physical trauma may result in either a fracture, muscle bruising, or a contusion. It is the leading cause of a limp. Deliberate abuse is important to consider. ====Slipped capital femoral epiphysis==== Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is a condition in which the growth plate of the head of the femur slips over the underlying bone. It most commonly presents with hip pain in males during puberty and is associated with obesity. The majority of people affected have a painful limp and in half of cases both hips are affected. Nearly a quarter of people present with only knee pain. Treatment involves non-weight- bearing movement and surgery. If not identified early, osteonecrosis or death of the head of the femur may occur. ====Other==== A non-painful limp may be due to a number of mechanical conditions including hip dysplasia and leg length differences. ===Inflammatory=== ====Transient synovitis==== Transient synovitis is a reactive arthritis of the hip of unknown cause. People are usually able to walk and may have a low grade fever. They usually look clinically nontoxic or otherwise healthy. It may only be diagnosed once all other potential serious causes are excluded. With symptomatic care it usually resolves over one week. ====Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis==== Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis presents gradually with early morning stiffness, fatigue, and weight loss. ===Vascular=== ====Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome==== Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome is a degenerative disease of the head of the femur which results in bone loss and deformity. It usually presents as a chronic condition. ===Neoplastic=== Cancers including acute lymphocytic leukemia, osteosarcoma, and Ewing’s sarcoma may result in a gradual onset of limping in children. It is often associated with night sweating, easy bruising, weight loss, and pain most prominent at night. ==Diagnostic approach== The diagnosis of the cause of a limp is often made based on history, physical exam findings, laboratory tests, and radiological examination. If a limp is associated with pain it should be urgently investigated, while non-painful limps can be approached and investigated more gradually. Young children have difficulty determining the location of leg pain, thus in this population, knee pain equals hip pain. SCFE can usually be excluded by an x-ray of the hips. An ultrasound or x-ray guided aspiration of the hip joint maybe required to rule out an infectious process within the hip. ==Epidemiology== A limp at one hospital emergency department was the presenting complaint in 4% of children. It occurs twice as commonly in boys as in girls. ==References== == External links == Category:Gait abnormalities ","title":"Limp"},{"id":"1278531","text":"engraving of a Joshua Reynolds self-portrait John Keyse Sherwin (175124 September 1790) was an English engraver and history-painter. ==Biography== Sherwin was born at East Dean in Sussex. His father was a wood-cutter employed in shaping bolts for shipbuilders, and the son followed the same occupation till his seventeenth year, when, having shown an aptitude for art by copying some miniatures, he was adopted by his father's landlord, William Mitford. Sherwin was sent to study in London, first under John Astley, and then for three years under Francesco Bartolozzi – for whom he is believed to have executed a large portion of the plate of Clytie, after Annibale Carracci, published as the work of his master. Sherwin entered as a student of the Royal Academy, and gained a silver medal, and in 1772 a gold medal for his painting of \\"Coriolanus taking Leave of his Family\\". From 1774 till 1780 he was an exhibitor of chalk drawings and of engravings in the Royal Academy. Establishing himself in St James's Street as a painter, designer and engraver, he attained popularity and began to mix in fashionable society. His drawing of the \\"Finding of Moses\\", a work of but slight artistic merit, which introduced portraits of the princess royal of England and other leading ladies of the aristocracy, hit the public taste, and, as reproduced by his burin, sold largely. In 1785 he succeeded William Woollett as engraver to the king, and he also held the appointment of engraver to the Prince of Wales. His professional income rose to about £12,000 a year; but he was constantly in pecuniary difficulties, for he was shiftless, indolent, and without method, open-handed and even prodigal in his benefactions – and prodigal, too, in less reputable directions, for he became a reckless gambler, and habits of intemperance grew upon him. He did however have a notable student, John Thomas Smith who trained with him for three years. Sherwin died in extreme penury on 24 September 1790according to George Steevens, the editor of Shakespeare, at The Hog in the Pound, an obscure alehouse in Swallow Street, or, as stated by his pupil J.T. Smith, in the house of Robert Wilkinson, a printseller in Cornhill. It is as an engraver that Sherwin is most esteemed; and it may be noted that he was ambidextrous, working indifferently with either hand upon his plates. His drawing is correct, his line excellent and his textures are varied and intelligent in expression. Such of his plates as the \\"Holy Family\\" after Nicholas Poussin, \\"Christ Bearing the Cross\\" after Murillo, the portrait of the marquis of Buckingham after Thomas Gainsborough and that of Pitt occupy a high place among the productions of the English school of line-engravers. He also worked after Pine, Dance and Kauffman. ==Notes== ==References== * ==External links== *\\"The Keyse Family Tree\\" Category:1751 births Category:1790 deaths Category:18th-century English painters Category:English male painters Category:English engravers Category:History painters ","title":"John Keyse Sherwin"},{"id":"1278543","text":"Henry Cort (c. 1740 – 23 May 1800) was an English ironmaster. During the Industrial Revolution in England, Cort began refining iron from pig iron to wrought iron (or bar iron) using innovative production systems. In 1784, he patented an improved version of the puddling process for refining cast iron although its commercial viability was only accomplished by innovations introduced by the Merthyr Tydfil ironmasters Crawshay and Homfray. == Biography == Little is known of Cort's early life other than that he was possibly born into a family coming from Lancaster, England although his parents are unknown.Mott, R. A. (ed. P. Singer), Henry Cort: the Great Finer, The Metals Society, London 1983 Although his date of birth is traditionally given as 1740, this can not be confirmed and his early life remains an enigma. By 1765, Cort had become a Royal Navy pay agent, acting on commission collecting half pay and widows' pensions from an office in Crutched Friars near Aldgate in London. At that time, despite Abraham Darby's improvements in the smelting of iron using coke instead of charcoal as blast furnace fuel, the resultant product was still only convertible to bar iron by a laborious process of decarburization in finery forges. As a result, bar iron imported from the Baltic undercut that produced in Britain, (increasingly from Russia) at considerable expense.Evans, C., Jackson, O., and Ryden, G. ‘Baltic iron and the British iron industry in the eighteenth century’. Econ. Hist. Rev. (2nd ser.), 55, 642–665. 2002: King, P. ‘The production and consumption of bar iron in early modern England and Wales’ Econ. Hist. Rev. (2nd ser.), 58, 1-33. 2005: In 1768, Cort's second marriage was to Elizabeth Heysham, the daughter of a Romsey solicitor and steward of the Duke of Portland whose estates included Titchfield.Espinasse (1877), p. 225 whose uncle William Attwick although a successful London attorney had inherited the family ironmongery business in Gosport which supplied the navy with mooring chains, anchors and hundreds of different items of ironmongery. === Partnership with Samuel Jellicoe === In 1780, the Royal Navy's Victualling Commissioners agreed with Cort, who had taken over Attwick's business, to re roll iron hoops for their barrels. This led to Cort investing in a new rolling mill at an existing iron mill in Titchfield which was later used for the production of bar iron. Short of funds, he turned to Adam Jellicoe, at that time chief clerk in the Pay Office of the Royal Navy, who agreed to finance Cort to the amount of nearly £58 000 on seemingly little security beyond the value of the business. It was the accepted practice for clerks in the Pay Office to temporarily use surplus funds for their own benefit. As part of the arrangement, Jellicoe's son Samuel became a partner in the Fontley Works. The deal was later to have unfortunate repercussions for CortEspinasse (1877), p. 229. === Rolling mill and puddling furnace === Schematic drawing of a puddling furnace Cort developed his ideas at the Fontley Works (as he had renamed Titchfield Hammer) resulting in a 1783 patent for a simple reverberatory furnace to refine pig iron followed by d a 1784 patent for his puddling furnace, with grooved rollers which mechanised the formerly laborious process. His work built on the existing ideas of the Cranege brothers and their reverberatory furnace (where heat is applied from above, rather than through the use of forced air from below) and Peter Onions' puddling process where iron is stirred to separate out impurities and extract the higher quality wrought iron. The furnace effectively lowered the carbon content of the cast iron charge through oxidation while the \\"puddler\\" extracted a mass of iron from the furnace using an iron \\"rabbling bar\\". The extracted ball of metal was then processed into a \\"shingle\\" by a shingling hammer, after which it was rolled in the rolling mill. The original process of Cort was ineffectual until significant alterations were made by Richard Crawshay and other Merthyr Tydfil ironmasters as Cort used iron from charcoal furnaces rather than the coke smelted pig iron in general production by then. === Death of Adam Jellicoe === When Adam Jellicoe died suddenly on 30 August 1789, it became apparent that the £58 000 lent to Cort could not be repaid. As a result, the Crown seized all the Property of Adam Jellicoe as well as that of the partnership of Cort and Samuel Jellicoe. Cort was held responsible for Jellicoe's debt and declared bankrupt. The Crown later gave Samuel Jellicoe possession of the works at Fontley where he \\" remained ... undisturbed for long years afterward\\" and made no attempt to realize patent dues from ironmasters, as the system did not work with the grey iron produced in the Midlands and South Wales.Espinasse (1877), p 234 === Patents and royalties === The importance of Cort's improvements to the process of iron making were recognised as early as 1786 by Lord Sheffield who regarded them (undeservedly) along with James Watt's work on the steam engine as more important than the loss of America. In 1787, Cort came to an agreement with South Wales ironmaster Richard Crawshay whereby all iron manufactured according to the former's patents would result in a royalty of 10 shillings per ton.Espinasse (1877), p. 233 Cort seems to have alienated most of those with whom he came in contact. == Personal life == Cort's marriage to Elizabeth Heysham produced 13 children.Espinasse (1877), p.225 His business ventures did not bring him wealth, even though vast numbers of the puddling furnaces that he developed were eventually used (reportedly 8,200 by 1820), they used a modified version of his process and thus avoided payment of royalties. He was later awarded a government pension, but died a ruined man, and was buried in the churchyard of St John-at-Hampstead, London. == Legacy == Fifty years after Cort's death, The Times of London lauded him as \\"the father of the iron trade\\".The Times, editorial, 29 July 1856, cited from Rosen (2010), p. 328 His son, Richard Cort, became a cashier for the British Iron Company in 1825 – 6 and subsequently wrote several pamphlets severely critical of the management of the company. He also attacked a number of early railway companies. The Henry Cort Community College bears his name and is located in the town of Fareham, in the south of Hampshire, England. The busway between Fareham and Bridgemary, built on the trackbed of the old Gosport to Fareham railway line, is entitled Henry Cort Way on maps. == Notes == == References == * * * == Further reading == * Dickinson, H.

Tate Britain William Woollett (15 August 173523 May 1785) was an English engraver operating in the 18th century. ==Life== Woolett was born in Maidstone, of a family which came originally from the Netherlands. He was apprenticed to John Tinney, an engraver in Fleet Street, London, and studied in the St Martin's Lane academy. His first important plate was from The Destruction of the Children of Niobe of Richard Wilson, published by Boydell in 1761, which was followed in 1763 by a companion engraving from the \\"Phaethon\\" of the same painter. After Benjamin West he engraved his fine plate of the \\"Battle of La Hogue\\" (1781), and \\"The Death of General Wolfe\\" (1776), which is usually considered Woollett's masterpiece. In 1775 he was appointed engraver-in-ordinary to George III; and he was a member of the Incorporated Society of Artists, of which for several years he acted as secretary. Woollett's plates combined engraving, etching, and dry-point; and were considered highly esteemed examples of the English school of engraving.

CE marking is an administrative marking that indicates conformity with health, safety, and environmental protection standards for products sold within the European Economic Area (EEA). (It is not a quality indicator or a certification mark.) The CE marking is also found on products sold outside the EEA that have been manufactured to EEA standards. This makes the CE marking recognizable worldwide even to people who are not familiar with the European Economic Area. It is in that sense like the FCC Declaration of Conformity used for selling certain electronic devices in the United States. The CE marking is the manufacturer's declaration that the product meets EU standards for health, safety, and environmental protection. The mark consists of the CE logo and, if applicable, the four digit identification number of the Notified Body involved in the conformity assessment procedure. \\"CE\\" is sometimes indicated as an abbreviation of \\"Conformité Européenne\\" (French for \\"European Conformity\\"), but is not defined as such in the relevant legislation. The CE mark indicates that the product may be sold freely in any part of the European Economic Area, irrespective of its country of origin. ==Meaning== The CE mark on a product indicates that the manufacturer or importer of that product affirms its compliance with the relevant EU legislation and the product may be sold anywhere in the European Economic Area (EEA). It is a criminal offence to affix a CE mark to a product that is not compliant or offer it for sale. For example, most electrical products must comply with the Low Voltage Directive and the EMC Directive, among others; toys must comply with the Toy Safety Directive. (The Low Voltage Directive is about electrical safety; EMC or Electromagnetic Compatibility means the device will work as intended without interfering with, or being affected by, the use or function of any other device.) The CE mark indicates compliance with as many Directives as apply at the time of the declaration of compliance (see below). In the case of electrical products, several later Directives such as the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE) are relevant in addition to the Low Voltage Directive and EMC Directive. The exact significance of the CE mark therefore depends on when it was applied to a specific unit. The marking does not indicate EEA manufacture or that the EU or another authority has approved a product as safe or conformant. The EU requirements may include safety, health, and environmental protection. If stipulated in any EU product legislation, assessment by a Notified Body or manufacture according to a certified production quality system may be required. Where relevant, the CE mark is followed by the registration number of the notified body involved in conformity assessment. Not all products need CE marking to be traded in the EEA; only product categories subject to relevant directives or regulations are required (and allowed) to bear CE marking. Most CE-marked products can be placed on the market subject only to an internal production control by the manufacturer (Module A; see Self- certification, below), with no independent check of the conformity of the product with EU legislation; ANEC has cautioned that, amongst other things, CE marking cannot be considered a \\"safety mark\\" for consumers. ==Countries requiring the CE marking== CE marking is mandatory for certain product groups intended for sale within the European Union, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), Turkey and (at least until the end of the Brexit transition period) the United Kingdom. The manufacturers of products made within these countries, and the importers of goods made in other countries, affirm that CE-marked goods conform to EU standards. , CE marking was not required by countries of the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA), but members Albania, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Montenegro have applied for membership of the European Union, and are adopting many of its standards within their legislation (as had most Central European former member countries of CEFTA that joined the EU, before joining). ==Rules underlying CE marking== Responsibility for CE marking lies with whoever puts the product on the market in the EU, i.e. an EU-based manufacturer, the importer or distributor of a product made outside the EU, or an EU-based office of a non-EU manufacturer. The manufacturer of a product affixes the CE marking to it but has to take certain obligatory steps before the product can bear CE marking. The manufacturer must carry out a conformity assessment, set up a technical file, and sign a Declaration stipulated by the leading legislation for the product. The documentation has to be made available to authorities on request. Importers of products have to verify that the manufacturer outside the EU has undertaken the necessary steps and that the documentation is available upon request. Importers should also make sure that contact with the manufacturer can always be established. Distributors must be able to demonstrate to national authorities that they have acted with due care and they must have affirmation from the manufacturer or importer that the necessary measures have been taken. If importers or distributors market the products under their own name, they take over the manufacturer's responsibilities. In this case they must have sufficient information on the design and production of the product, as they will be assuming the legal responsibility when they affix the CE marking. There are certain rules underlying the procedure to affix the marking: * Products subject to certain EU directives or EU regulations providing for CE marking have to be affixed with the CE marking before they can be placed on the market. * Manufacturers have to check, on their sole responsibility, which EU legislation they need to apply for their products. * The product may be placed on the market only if it complies with the provisions of all applicable directives and regulations and if the conformity assessment procedure has been carried out accordingly. * The manufacturer draws up an EU declaration of conformity or a declaration of performance (for Construction Products) and affixes the CE marking on the product. * If stipulated in the directive(s) or regulation(s), an authorized third party (Notified Body) must be involved in the conformity assessment procedure or in setting up a production quality system. * If the CE marking is affixed on a product, it can bear additional markings only if they are of different significance, do not overlap with the CE marking and are not confusing and do not impair the legibility and visibility of the CE marking. Since achieving compliance can be very complex, CE-marking conformity assessment, provided by a notified body, is of great importance throughout the entire CE-marking process, from design verification, and set up of the technical file to the EU declaration of conformity. A guide to the implementation of directives based on the New Approach and the Global Approach (the \\"Blue Guide\\") was first published by the European Union in 2000. Updated versions were published on 28 February 2014Blue Guide on the Implementation of EU Product Rules and 26 July 2016.The 'Blue Guide' on the implementation of EU product rules 2016 ==Self- certification== Depending on the level of risk of the product, the CE marking is affixed to a product by the manufacturer or authorized representative who needs to ensure that the product meets all the CE marking requirements. In some cases, if a product has minimal risk, it can be self-certified by a manufacturer making a declaration of conformity and affixing the CE marking to their own product. Self-certification exists only for products which have a minimal risk for their use, and this is clearly foreseen in the relevant Directive according to the product \\"category\\". In order to certify, the manufacturer must do several things: :1. Investigate whether the product needs to have a CE marking. The product must conform to all Directives that apply to the product. :2. Choose the conformity assessment procedure from the modules called out by the directive for the product according to each category (level of risk) involved. There are several modules available for the Conformity Assessment Procedures, but only a few of them involve self-certification. The most of these procedure require a \\"type Approval\\" and a Production conformity assessment by a Notified Body. The common procedures (Modules) of certification are as listed below. A product normally needs more than one procedure (Module) to be implemented: ::*Module A – Internal production control. ::* Module B – EC type-examination. ::* Module C – Conformity to type. ::* Module D – Production quality assurance. ::* Module E – Product quality assurance. ::* Module F – Product verification. ::* Module G – Unit verification. ::* Module H – Full quality assurance. The level of risk is defined by the \\"category\\" of each equipment. The higher the category, the higher the risk. After defining the category, the manufacturer, in order to obtain certification, shall then apply the relevant procedures for the certain category of the product or choose the relevant procedures for a higher category product. The manufacturer, after insuring that the relevant modules for the product category have been applied, will affix the CE mark and draw up a Declaration of Conformity. The Declaration of Conformity contains a description of the product, the Directive(s) applied, the product category for each Directive, the Module chosen, and the name and registration number of the Notified Body involved in certification procedures (Models). Notified Bodies involved in certification procedures are organizations that has been nominated by a Member State (according to an accreditation procedure) and have been notified by the European Commission. These notified bodies act as Independent Inspection organizations and carry out the procedures as listed in the relevant Modules applied as stated by the relevant directives. A manufacturer can choose any notified body (notified for the certain directive and relevant Modules) in any Member State of the European Union. In reality the self- certification process consists of the following stages: Stage 1: Identify the applicable Directive(s) The first step is to identify whether the product needs to bear CE marking or not. Not all products are required to bear CE marking, only the products that fall within the scope of at least one of the sectoral directives requiring CE marking. There are more than 20 sectoral product directives requiring CE marking covering, but not limited to, products such as electrical equipment, machines, medical devices, toys, pressure equipment, PPE, wireless devices and construction products. Identifying which directive(s) may be applicable, as there may be more than one, involves a simple exercise of reading the scope of each directive to establish which apply to the product (Such as the \\"Low Voltage Directive,\\" 2014/35/EU). If the product does not fall within the scope of any of the sectoral directives, then the product does not need to bear CE marking (and, indeed, must not bear CE marking). Stage 2: Identify the applicable requirements of the Directive(s) Each Directive has slightly different methods of demonstrating conformity depending on the classification of the product and its intended use. Every Directive has a number of 'essential requirements' that the product has to meet before being placed on the market. The best way to demonstrate that these essential requirements have been met is by meeting the requirements of an applicable 'harmonised standard,’ which offer a presumption of conformity to the essential requirements, although the use of standards usually remains voluntary. Harmonised standards can be identified by searching the 'Official Journal' on the European Commission's website, or by visiting the New Approach website established by the European Commission and EFTA with the European Standardisation Organisations. Stage 3: Identify an appropriate route to conformity The process is not always a self-declaration process, there are various 'attestation routes' to conformity depending on the Directive and classification of the product. Many products (such as invasive medical devices, or fire alarm and extinguisher systems, Pressure Equipment, Lifts etc.) in most cases, have a mandatory requirement for the involvement of an authorised third party e.g. a \\"notified body\\". There are various attestation routes which include: *An assessment of the product by the manufacturer. *An assessment of the product by the manufacturer, with additional requirement for mandatory factory production control audits to be carried out by a third party. *An assessment by a third party (e.g. EC type test), with the requirement for mandatory factory production control audits to be carried out by a third party. Stage 4: Assessment of the product's conformity When all of the requirements have been established, the conformity of the product to the essential requirements of the Directive(s) needs to be assessed. This usually involves assessment and/or testing, and may include an evaluation of the conformity of the product to the harmonised standard(s) identified in step 2. Stage 5: Compile the technical documentation Technical documentation, usually referred to as the technical file, relating to the product or range of products needs to be compiled. This information should cover every aspect relating to conformity and is likely to include details of the design, development and manufacture of the product. Technical documentation will usually include: *Technical description *Drawings, circuit diagrams and photos *Bill of materials *Specification and, where applicable, EU declaration of conformity for the critical components and materials used *Details of any design calculations *Test reports and/or assessments *Instructions *EU declaration of conformity *Technical documentation can be made available in any format (i.e. paper or electronic) and must be held for a period of up to 10 years after the manufacture of the last unit, and in most cases reside in the European Economic Area (EEA). Stage 6: Make a declaration and affix the CE marking When the manufacturer, importer or authorised representative is satisfied that their product conforms to the applicable Directives, an EU declaration of conformity must be completed or, for partly completed machinery under the Machinery Directive, an ECU declaration of incorporation. The requirements for the declaration vary slightly, but will at least include: *Name and address of the manufacturer *Details of the product (model, description and the serial number where applicable) *List of applicable sectoral Directives and standards that have been applied *A statement declaring that the product complies with all of the relevant requirements *Signature, name and position of the responsible person *The date that the declaration was signed *Details of the authorised representative within the EEA (where applicable) *Additional Directive/standard specific requirements *In all cases, except for the PPE Directive, all of the Directives can be declared on one declaration. *Once an EU declaration of conformity has been completed, the final step is to affix the CE marking to the product. When this has been done, the CE marking requirements have been met for the product to be placed legally on the EEA market. ==EU declaration of conformity== The EU declaration of conformity must include: manufacturer's details (name and address, etc.); essential characteristics the product complies; any European standards and performance data; if relevant the identification number of the notified body; and a legally binding signature on behalf of the organization. ==Product groups== The directives requiring CE marking affect the following product groups: * Active implantable medical devices (excludes surgical instruments) * Appliances burning gaseous fuels * Cableway installations designed to carry persons * Construction products according to Regulation (EU) No. 305/2011 under specific rules * Eco-design of energy related products * Electromagnetic compatibility * Equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres * Explosives for civil uses * Hot- water boilers * In vitro diagnostic medical devices * Lifts * Low voltage * Machinery * Measuring instruments * Medical devices * Noise emission in the environment * Non-automatic weighing instruments * Personal protective equipment * Pressure equipment * Pyrotechnics * Radio Equipment * Recreational craft * Restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment RoHS 2 * Safety of toys * Simple pressure vessels ==Mutual recognition of conformity assessment== There are numerous 'Agreements on Mutual Recognition of Conformity Assessment' between the European Union and other countries such as the US, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Israel. Consequently, CE marking is now found on many products from these countries. Japan has its own marking known as the Technical Conformity Mark. Switzerland and Turkey (which are not members of the EEA) also require products to bear CE marking as an affirmation of conformity. ==Characteristics of CE marking== Proportion requirements on the CE marking * The CE marking has to be affixed by the manufacturer or its authorized representative in the European Union according to its legal format visibly, legibly and indelibly to the product * When a manufacturer puts the CE marking on a product it implies that it complies with all the Essential Health and safety requirements from all the directives that applies to its product. ** For example, for a machine, the Machinery directive applies, but often also: *** Low voltage directive *** EMC directive *** sometimes other directives or regulations, e.g. ATEX directive *** and sometimes other legal requirements. When the manufacturer of a machine puts the CE marking, it engages itself and guarantees, that it makes all the tests, assessments and evaluation on the product to conform to all the requirements of all the directives that apply to its product. * CE marking has been introduced by the COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 93/68/EEC of 22 July 1993 amending Directives 87/404/EEC (simple pressure vessels), 88/378/EEC (safety of toys), 89/106/EEC (construction products), 89/336/EEC (electromagnetic compatibility), 89/392/EEC (machinery), 89/686/EEC (personal protective equipment), 90/384/EEC (non-automatic weighing instruments), 90/385/EEC (active implantable medicinal devices), 90/396/EEC (appliances burning gaseous fuels), 91/263/EEC (telecommunications terminal equipment), 92/42/EEC (new hot-water boilers fired with liquid or gaseous fuels), 93/42/EEC (medical devices) and 73/23/EEC (electrical equipment designed for use within certain voltage limits) * The size of the CE marking must be at least 5 mm, if enlarged its proportions have to be kept * If the appearance and workmanship of a product do not allow for the CE marking to be affixed on the product itself, the marking has to be affixed to its packaging or accompanying documents * If a directive requires the involvement of a Notified Body in the conformity assessment procedure, its identification number has to be put behind the CE logo. This is done under the responsibility of the Notified Body. == Not to be confused with == === UNECE E mark === On motor vehicles and related parts, the UNECE \\"e mark\\" or \\"E mark\\", rather than the CE logo, has to be used. Unlike the CE logo, the UNECE marks are not self-certified. === Estimated sign on food labels === This mark is occasionally confused with the estimated sign (℮) on packaging labels on measurements of weight or volume. ===China Export=== In 2008, a logo very similar to CE marking was reported to exist and alleged to stand for China Export because some Chinese manufacturers apply it to their products.; However, the European Commission says that this is a misconception. The matter was raised at the European Parliament in 2008. The Commission responded that it was unaware of the existence of any \\"Chinese Export\\" mark and that, in its view, the incorrect application of the CE marking on products was unrelated to incorrect depictions of the symbol, although both practices took place. It had initiated the procedure to register CE marking as a Community collective trademark, and was in discussion with Chinese authorities to ensure compliance with European legislation. Chinese (and other non-EU) manufacturers are permitted to use the European mark provided that the goods have been manufactured in accordance with the relevant EU directives and regulations. Nevertheless, and despite the Commission's assurance that it is without foundation, this urban myth continues to be available on many websites., and many more. ==Misuse== The European Commission is aware that CE marking, like other certifications marks, is misused. CE marking is sometimes affixed to products that do not fulfill the legal requirements and conditions, or it is affixed to products for which it is not required. In one case it was reported that \\"Chinese manufacturers were submitting well-engineered electrical products to obtain conformity testing reports, but then removing non-essential components in production to reduce costs\\".Buckinghamshire Trading Standards: What’s in your socket?, 2008. Detailed article on hazards found due to poor-quality AC adapters. \\"The good news for the consumer is that there appears to be a cheap charger for any make or model of mobile phone, toy or hand-held games consoles that you might require – the bad news is that it could kill you!\\" A test of 27 electrical chargers found that all the eight legitimately branded ones with a reputable name met safety standards, but none of those unbranded or with minor names did, despite bearing the alt=CЄ mark; non-compliant devices were actually potentially unreliable and dangerous, presenting electrical and fire hazards. There are also cases in which the product complies with the applicable requirements, but the form, dimensions, or proportions of the mark itself are not as specified in the legislation. ===Domestic plugs and sockets=== Directive 2006/95/EC, the \\"Low Voltage\\" Directive, specifically excludes (amongst other things) plugs and socket outlets for domestic use which are not covered by any Union directive and therefore must not be CE marked. Throughout the EU, as in other jurisdictions, the control of plugs and socket outlets for domestic use is subject to national regulations. Despite this, the illegal use of CE marking can be found on domestic plugs and sockets, particularly so- called \\"universal sockets\\". It is fairly common to see domestic sockets (and adaptors) that have an inbuilt 5 volt power supply. In the case of these sockets they must be CE marked, but the CE mark applies to the 5 volt converter only and not the rest of the socket or adaptor. This is comparable to dedicated 5 volt power supplies. ===Legal implications=== There are mechanisms in place to ensure that the CE marking is put on products correctly. Controlling products bearing CE marking is the responsibility of public authorities in member states, in cooperation with the European Commission. Citizens may contact national market surveillance authorities if the misuse of the CE marking is suspected or if a product's safety is questioned. In the UK, sale of any product that carries a CE mark that is not so approved, or outside the scope of approval is a specific offence under Section 1 of the Trade Descriptions Act 1968. The seller of such an article is as equally guilty as the manufacturer or importer. Ignorance as to the true status of the sold item is no defence against a prosecution (strict liability). Under the Act, the misrepresentation is that the sold item conforms to a specification that it does not or that there is no such specification to which it can conform. The procedures, measures and sanctions applying to counterfeiting of the CE marking vary according to the respective member state's national administrative and penal legislation. Depending on the seriousness of the crime, economic operators may be liable to a fine and, in some circumstances, imprisonment. However, if the product is not regarded as an imminent safety risk, the manufacturer may be given an opportunity to ensure that the product is in conformity with the applicable legislation before being forced to take the product off the market. ==Unicode== , the mark does not have a Unicode code point, nor is one in prospect. According to the Unicode principles, the mark is a font choice for the two ordinary upper-case letters, C and E, with a specific kerning arrangement. Such a font may be obtainable from a professional type foundry. Alternatively, image files in various formats are available from the European Commission. ==See also== * Country of origin * Eurasian Conformity mark (EAC) – The Eurasian Economic Union's version of the CE mark * FCC Declaration of Conformity * FDA Food and Drug Administration * Geprüfte Sicherheit (GS) * Kitemark ==References== ==External links== * How to reproduce the CE mark (European Commission) * The CE marking web site at Europa.eu (European Commission's CE marking FAQ) * CE Marking of construction at veruscert.com * CE Marking FAQ for machineries * EU directives and regulations for CE marking at cemarkingnordic.se Category:European Economic Area Category:Consumer organizations Category:Certification marks ","title":"CE marking"},{"id":"1278560","text":"Schlechter is a family surname of German origin, which literally means “worse”.

These are referred to also as the Hesychast councils or the Palamite councils, since they discussed the theology of Gregory Palamas, whom Barlaam of Seminara opposed in the first of the series, and others in the succeeding five councils. The result of these councils is accepted as having the authority of an ecumenical council by Eastern Orthodox Christians, who sometimes call it the Ninth Ecumenical Council. Principal supporters of the view that this series of councils comprises the Ninth Ecumenical Council include Metropolitan Hierotheos (Vlachos) of Nafpaktos, Fr. John S. Romanides, and Fr. George Metallinos. As it became clear that the dispute between Barlaam and Palamas was irreconcilable and would require the judgment of an episcopal council. A series of six patriarchal councils was held in Constantinople on 10 June 1341, August 1341, 4 November 1344, 1 February 1347, 8 February 1347, and 28 May 1351 to consider the issues.Gregory Palamas: Historical Timeline Collectively, these councils are accepted as having ecumenical status by Orthodox Christians, some of whom call them the Fifth Council of Constantinople and the Ninth Ecumenical Council. The dispute over Hesychasm came before a synod held at Constantinople in May 1341 and presided over by the emperor Andronicus III Palaeologus. The assembly, influenced by the veneration in which the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius were held in the Eastern Church, condemned Barlaam, who recanted. Barlaam's primary supporter Emperor Andronicus III died just five days after the synod ended. Although Barlaam initially hoped for a second chance to present his case against Palamas, he soon realised the futility of pursuing his cause, and left for Calabria where he converted to the Roman Church and was appointed Bishop of Gerace. After Barlaam's departure, Gregory Akindynos became the chief critic of Palamas. A second council held in Constantinople in August 1341 condemned Akindynos and affirmed to findings of the earlier council. Akindynos and his supporters gained a brief victory at the third synod held in 1344 which excommunicated Palamas and one of his disciples, Isidore Buchiras. Palamas and Buchiras recanted. In 1347, however, after a vicious civil war, their protector, John Cantacuzenus, entered Constantinople and forced his opponents to crown him co- emperor. In February 1347, a fourth synod was held which deposed the patriarch, John XIV, and excommunicated Akindynos. Isidore Buchiras, who had been excommunicated by the third synod, was now made patriarch. In the same month, the Barlaamite party held a competing synod which refused to acknowledge Isidore and excommunicated Palamas. Akindynos having died in 1348, Nicephorus Gregoras became the chief opponent of Hesychasm. In May 1351, a patriarchal council conclusively exonerated Palamas and condemned his opponents. This synod ordered that the metropolitans of Ephesus and Ganos be defrocked and jailed. All those who were unwilling to submit to the orthodox view were to be excommunicated and kept under surveillance at their residences. A series of anathemas were pronounced against Barlaam, Akindynos and their followers; at the same time, a series of acclamations were also declared in favor of Gregory Palamas and the adherents of his doctrine. Gregoras refused to submit to the dictates of the synod and was effectively imprisoned in a monastery until the Palaeologi triumphed in 1354 and deposed Cantacuzenus. ==See also== *Hesychasm *Palamism ==References== == External links == *The Eighth and Ninth Ecumenical Councils Constantinople 5 1340s Constantinople Category:1340s in the Byzantine Empire Category:1350s in the Byzantine Empire ","title":"Fifth Council of Constantinople"},{"id":"1278572","text":"An open compensation plan (or system or policy) is one with a defined pay scale and no rules about keeping employee pay confidential.

It is the first major film produced by WWE Films and was released by Lionsgate on May 19, 2006. The film went through many different working titles before the final title of See No Evil was chosen. The original working title of the film was Eye Scream Man, but was later changed to The Goodnight Man, then Goodnight before settling on See No Evil. ==Plot== Officer Frank Williams (Steven Vidler) and his partner Blaine investigate an abandoned house, where they find a young woman with her eyes ripped out. A large figure with an axe then murders Blaine and Frank has his arm chopped off before he is able to shoot the attacker in the head. Afterwards, detectives find seven bodies in the house, all of which have had their eyes ripped out. Four years later, Frank and his partner Hannah take a group of delinquents - Christine (Christina Vidal), Kira (Samantha Noble), Michael (Luke Pegler), Tyson (Michael J. Pagan), Zoe (Rachel Taylor), Melissa (Penny McNamee), Richie (Craig Horner), and Russell (Mikhael Wilder) to clean up the abandoned Blackwell Hotel in order to turn it into a homeless shelter, as explained by the owner Margaret (Cecily Polson). That night, while Michael, Zoe, Russell, and Melissa go upstairs to the penthouse, Tyson and Richie decide to look for the previous owner's safe, and find what appears to be the body of a recently deceased man. Richie panics and runs off, only to be dragged into an elevator with a hook by Jacob Goodnight (Kane). When Margaret mentions the elevator is being used, Hannah goes to check on the group, but is killed in the elevator. Christine tries to help Kira escape the hotel, but Jacob attacks Kira with his hook and drags her into a dumbwaiter. Christine and Frank go upstairs to find the others, and run into Tyson who tells them what happened to Richie. Frank realizes it must be Jacob and is then pulled into the ceiling by the hook and killed. Kira is held hostage by Jacob because of her religious tattoos, and is kept captive in a cage where she witnesses Richie having his eyes torn out. Melissa and Russell go off into a room on their own, but are chased by Jacob. Russell tries to lower Melissa out of a window, but he is killed by Jacob. Then, Jacob drops Melissa out the window. She survives her fall, but then she is killed by a pack of stray dogs. Jacob then attacks Michael and Zoe. Zoe nearly escapes from Jacob but her cell phone rings, alerting Jacob to her location. He subsequently kills her by forcing the cell phone down her throat. Michael finds Christine and Tyson as they try to rescue Kira, but they are attacked again by Jacob, who knocks out Michael while the other two escape up the elevator shaft. The pair find Kira but are interrupted by Jacob before they can release her. Tyson creates a distraction but is electrocuted with his own taser and crushed with the bank vault. Margaret then shows up, and reveals herself as Jacob's mother, who lured Frank back to the hotel to get revenge on him for shooting her son, and explains the prisoners are merely a \\"bonus\\". Margaret attempts to shoot Kira, but Jacob intervenes and throws her headfirst into a nail on the wall. Michael reappears to help the girls battle Jacob, and the trio is eventually able to stab him through the eye with a pipe and throw him out of a window, where his heart is impaled by a shard of glass, apparently killing him. ==Cast== *Kane as Jacob Goodnight *Christina Vidal as Christine Zarate *Samantha Noble as Kira Vanning *Luke Pegler as Michael Montross *Michael J.

He graduated from Lincoln College, Oxford in 1777, and then studied medicine at the Universities of Edinburgh and Montpellier. In 1784, he succeeded his father to the Sherardian chair. Leaving his professional duties to a deputy, he left England for Göttingen and Vienna, in preparation for a botanical tour of Greece (1786) and Cyprus (1787). Returning to England at the end of the following year, he took part in the foundation of the Linnean Society in 1788, and set to work on a Flora of Oxfordshire, which was published in 1794 as Flora Oxoniensis. He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in Mar 1788. He made a second journey to Greece, but developed consumption on the way home and died in Bath on 8 February 1796. He was buried at Bath Abbey. His will bequeathed his books on natural history and agriculture to the University of Oxford, and also founded Oxford's Sibthorpian Professorship of Rural Economy (subsequently titled the Sibthorpian Professorship of Plant Science). He directed that his endowment should first be applied to the publication of his Flora Graeca and Florae Graecae Prodromus, for which, however, he had done little beyond collecting some three thousand species and providing the plates. The task of preparing the works was undertaken by Sir J.E. Smith, who issued the two volumes of the Prodromus in 1806 and 1813, and six volumes of the Flora Graeca between 1806 and 1828. The seventh appeared in 1830, after Smith's death, and the remaining three were produced by John Lindley between 1833 and 1840. The work's first edition ran to a mere thirty copies and featured 966 colour plates; a supplementary volume depicting wild flowers of Corfu was painted for Frederick North, 5th Earl of Guilford, and founder of the Ionian Academy, by G.

The village consists of two main parts: Portela and Bangaeira, founded in 1920 and 1917, respectively.Parc Naturel de Fogo – Chã das Caldeiras, Tentative list Unesco World Heritage sites At an elevation of about 1,700 meters, it is the highest village in Cape Verde. It is part of the municipality of Santa Catarina do Fogo. The main organizing body in the village is the Associação dos Agricultores de Chã (the agricultural cooperative), which holds considerable sway over the local economy. Chã is the only area in Cape Verde that grows significant quantities of grapes and produces export-quality wines. There is no running water or electricity in Chã, though people increasingly use generators at night to light and power their homes. All non-drinking water is collected rain, stored in large cistern tanks for use in the dry season (November to July). ==History== Village of Bangaeira before the November 2014 – February 2015 eruption Bangaeira in the aftermath of the 2014–15 eruption, remains of some buildings still exists, some houses were covered with lava, several suffered damages In 1870, the Count of Montrond (France) stopped on the island en route to Brazil. He stayed, and brought with him the vines that kicked off wine production in the caldera. Many of the inhabitants of Chã, with their light skin, blond hair, and blue eyes, trace their ancestry back to the biologically prolific Count. Two years after the 2014–15 eruption, these were some buildings that survived the lava flows In April 1995 an eruption of the Pico do Fogo damaged several houses in Chã das Caldeiras. Pico do Fogo erupted again in November 2014, destroying 75% of the buildings in Portela, Bangaeira and Ilhéu de Losna. Most of these were covered by lava. After the eruption, the majority of the inhabitants left the village. Cabeça Fundão on the park's edge became the seat of the natural park. A few homes have been rebuilt. ==Natural setting== A large crater rim with 1000-meter escarpments, called the Bordeira, encircles the village, which consists of two neighborhoods, Portela and Bangaeira. On the plain is one large volcanic peak (2,829 m from sea level) and several smaller peaks and lava fields from recent eruptions, most notably 1951, 1995 and 2014 (during which the entire population had to be evacuated). The entire caldera, some 67 km², is a protected area as part of the Fogo Natural Park (Parque Natural do Fogo), a cooperative effort between the German and Cape Verdean governments. ==Flora and fauna== ===Endemic plants=== 84% of the endemic plants (31 total species) on Fogo are located in Chã and on the Bordeira. 48% of these are designated as rare and/or threatened on the Ministry of Environment, Agriculture, and Fisheries' (MAAP) “Red List,” which includes the species Echium volcanorum, Erysimum caboverdeanum, Sarcostemma daltonii, Verbascum cystolithicum, Lavandula rotundifolia, Periploca laevigata sp. chevalieri, Euphorbia tuckeyana, and Tornabenea bischoffii and the genus Diplotaxis. These plants are specifically adapted to the caldera's climate (periodically Chã receives frost during the winter months) and volcanic soils. Chã's endemic plants, along with its unique terrain, are under increasing strain due to overgrazing and to the fuel and fodder collecting of the local populations. ===Fauna=== Its fauna mainly include insects, not as many in the lower areas, it is one of the places where it is non-existent. A warbler, the Cape Verde warbler (Acrocephalus brevipennis) are one of several places in the island that are not founded as their habitat is up to 1,300 meters of elevation. Main Street of Bangaeira before the 2014-15 eruption, much of it were covered with lava and is now earthened ==Climate== Unlike the rest of the archipelago (which has an extremely dry, arid, and warm variation of a desert climate), Chã das Caldeiras has a cool semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: \\"Bsk\\") due to its elevation, which also makes it Cape Verde's coldest village. Due to its climate, it has a pretty low average temperature at 13.5 °C, and a relatively high amount of precipitation (for Cape Verdean standards) at 524 millimeters; most of which fall in September (198 mm). It is also a factor that enables the village to grow and withhold a grape and winery industry; something that could hardly be achieved or sustained in any of its low-lying counterparts. Catholic Church of Portela. ==Agriculture== Coffee plant near Mosteiros. Chã has a lot of vegetation (albeit not in the lava fields), which grows in the rich volcanic soils adjacent to the crater rim. Because of its altitude (elevation 1,629 m), Chã is blessed with milder temperatures and greater precipitation than surrounding areas. Chã das Caldeiras apples in growth. Products in the caldera include fruits (apples, grapes, quince fruit, pomegranate, figs, peaches and tomatoes) and vegetables (beans, corn, potatoes, yams, manioc, and peppers) for local consumption and commercial production. The Associação buys excess fruit from the local farmers and turns it into white, red, rosé, and passito wine (label “Chã”); grape (grappa), apple, quince, and peach spirits (label “Espírito da Caldeira”); apple, quince, and peach marmalade; grape, fig, and quince compotes; apple and pomegranate jelly; and pomegranate and grape juice for commercial sale. Also famous is house-made goat cheese, queijo de cabra. The Associação also roasts and grinds Fogo coffee, Café do Fogo (label “Café das Caldeiras”), grown on the northern flank of the island. The local economy is based primarily on this speciality agriculture and animal-raising, the majority of which is sold domestically or to tourists. The “Chã” label wines, however, are available outside of the country on a limited basis, especially in Cape Verdean enclaves in Massachusetts, Lisbon, Paris, and Rotterdam. == Wines and Pomace brandy == The “Chã” label wines, made by the Associação (with help from the Italian NGO Cospe and the EU), are full-bodied and rich in color and extract. All of the grapes used in the wines are locally grown by farmers inside the caldera, which has a 120-year wine-making tradition. The first wines made in the crater to be exported were sent to Brazil and Guinea-Bissau, then a Portuguese colony like Cape Verde. Chã's climate and terrain are optimal for viticulture. Days are usually hot and dry, nights cool and humid. With sufficient rain, high- quality, semi-sweet grapes grow (1.2 km² total) in the caldera's rich volcanic soils. In 2006, the Associação produced 40,000 cases of wine (12 bottles each) from 100,000 kg of grapes. The percentage of alcohol in the “Chã” wines (14%) is greater than what is found in wines from the EU or California (usually between 11.5–12.5%). The red wine, vinho tinto, made from the low-lying Portuguese preta tradicional variety of grapes, has a dark red color with shades of purple. Odors include tones and flavors of small, dark fruits like the currant or blackberry. This sensation is enriched with shades of pepper and Muscat nut. The wine's rich body, best when served at room temperature (20 °C), combines well with the strength of the alcohol. The soft, velvet tannins of the wine can be appreciated when it is still young. (Market forces being such, Chã's reds have not yet been aged for any considerable time. The majority of the label is consumed within a year of production.) The red is perfect alone or to accompany any meat of strong taste. The white wine, vinho branco, made from locally grown Moscatel grapes, has a fresh taste, unique clarity, and golden shades. Odors include that of semi-sweet citric fruits like the grapefruit. These characteristics are noticed visually and on the palate, where the wine combines harmoniously with the alcohol content. The white also has a subtle, residual sweetness to be enjoyed with appetizers or with fish, shellfish, white meats, or Chã's goat cheese. This elegant wine is best served at a temperature of 10 °C and can be saved for 2–3 years if stored correctly. The rosé wine, vinho rosé, uses a similar variety of dark grapes as the red. It has an elegant rose color with flavors of small, sweet fruits like currants and strawberries. Like the white, the rosé is fresh on the palate and is best savored alone or with light meals, again at 10 °C. It too can be enjoyed up to three years. New to the “Chã” family of wines is the sweet vinho passito, made with the same Moscatel variety of grapes as the vinho branco. However, unlike with the white, the grapes used for the passito are first sun- dried, after which these uvas passas, or raisins, are put through the regular fermentation and filtration processes. Because dried grapes are used, the alcohol content in the passito is lower, at about 10.6%, than what is found in the other “Chã” wines (14%). The passito has a dark amber color; is slightly more viscous than the white, red, and rosé; and has a pleasant acidity to balance its sweetness. Odors include that of figs and dried fruits like raisins, prunes and dates. The passito is ideal between 12° and 14 °C as either a post-dinner or dessert wine or, simply, as a “wine of meditation.” ===Wine making at the Associação=== Cooperative (Associação dos Agricultores de Chã) in Portela During the wine-making process, much attention is given to the hygienic conditions of the cellar and machines. After arrival, the grapes are cleaned and are either crushed (to make red wine) or pressed (to make white and rosé). This process is done as quickly as possible to prevent contamination and odor. The pulp is then put in specially-designed barrels in the cellar, where the temperature remains cool even during the hottest days, to begin the fermentation process. This is when the sugar of the grapes turns to alcohol and where the unique characteristics of the wine begin to develop. The red wine ferments with the grape skins and is pressed afterwards. Then, the wine is fermented for a second time to eliminate remaining bacteria and reduce its vinegar-like acidity. After the second fermentation, the young wine is filtered and drawn into barrels for conservation. The white and rosé wines, on the other hand, are immediately filtered after the first fermentation to maintain freshness and to avoid bacteria growth. Until the wines are bottled, they remain in barrels (to avoid exposure to sunlight and air), except for periodic filtrations to improve clarity. ===Manecom=== Chã's best-known wine, however, is called Manecom, a traditional, semi-sweet or -dry, house-made wine. (It should not be confused with the “Chã” label red, white, rosé, and passito wines.) Most households make Manecom for commercial production and personal consumption. The wine can either be a red or white, dry or sweet, but the sweet red variety is by far the most popular. Manecom gets its name, legend has it, from a man named Manuel Montrond, supposedly the first person to live in Chã. Manuel Montrond in Portuguese, took a liking to the strong, sweet red wine he made. Other inhabitants coined Manuel's wine Manecom. The name stuck and remains to this day. ===Vinha Maria Chaves wines=== New since 2012 is the harvesting of grapes and the production of wines by \\"Vinha Maria Chaves\\", a new vineyard created during the last 10 years. The vineyard is about 25 hectares of surface and is located just beneath the crater. Adjoining, there is the newly constructed winery \\"Adega de Monte Barro\\", for the vinification, aging and bottling of the wines. 4 qualities of wines are produced : santaLuzia (white), sanVicente (rosé), sanTiago (red) and sanFilipe (red). These wines are produced with the grapes from the Maria Chaves vineyard and grapes from Chã das Caldeiras . These wines will be mainly exported. During the festivities of April 30, 2013, the \\"Adega de Monte Barro\\" was inaugurated and the new wines were presented to the President, the prime minister and other officials of Cape Verde. === Pomace brandy === “Espírito da Caldeira” label grape and quince spirits After the white wine is fermented, the remnant pomace of moscatel grapes is distilled to produce a pomace brandy : destilado de uva (label “Espírito da Caldeira”), that is bright and clear. The spirit's strength enables the drinker to taste, and feel on his/her palate, the flavor of Moscatel grapes. The after taste is smooth and has a hint of sweetness to balance the spirit's high alcohol content (45%). == Spirits of fruits or herbs == The quince spirit, destilado de marmelo, is produced from well-ripened quince fruit. Odors include that of the sweet, tart fruits of the caldera (like quince, apples, and grapes), flavors which combine nicely with the strength of the spirit's alcohol. The finish of the destilado de marmelo is smooth, gentle, and sweet. The destilado com ervas digestivas, or spirit with herbs, has the unique taste, aroma, potency, and medicinal properties to help with post-dinner digestion. The spirit is a combination of herbs that have been used as a traditional medicine by the people of Chã for generations. ==Sources== Else, David; Newton, Alex; Williams, Jeff; Fitzpatrick, Mary; and Roddis, Miles, 1999, West Africa.

It was executive produced by Vince McMahon through the film production division of WWE, called WWE Studios, and distributed in the United States by 20th Century Fox. The screenplay was written by Alan B. McElroy and Michelle Gallagher. Despite negative reviews, it was a financial success and since then, it is considered a cult film. It is the first entry The Marine film series, spawning five sequels, all of which were released direct-to-video. ==Plot== In Iraq, John Triton, a U.S. Marine arrives at an al-Qaeda hideout, where a group of terrorists are preparing to behead several hostages. Disregarding direct orders to wait for reinforcements, Triton attacks the extremists and rescues the hostages. The next morning, his colonel informs Triton that he is being honorably discharged for disobeying direct orders. Now retired, Triton finds it hard to settle back into normal life. He is fired from his job as a security guard for using excessive force on an employee's ex-boyfriend and his bodyguards. Triton's wife Kate decides the two need a vacation to help Triton adjust to his new life. Meanwhile, criminal Rome robs a jewelry store with his gang: girlfriend Angela, Morgan, Vescera, and Bennett. Rome is in collusion with an anonymous partner, with whom he is planning on sharing the profits from the diamonds. On the run, the gang stops at a gas station where Triton and Kate have stopped. When two policemen arrive to buy gas, Morgan shoots and kills one of the officers, causing Rome to shoot the other officer while Angela kills the gas station attendant. When Triton reacts to Kate being kidnapped, Bennett knocks him out. Triton regains consciousness and gives chase in the policemen's car. The chase leads to a lake, where Triton falls out of the patrol car and into the lake, seemingly to his death. Rome and his gang walk through a swamp to avoid the police. Kate tries to escape several times. Triton emerges from the lake to find Detective Van Buren, who is pursuing the gang. Van Buren denies Triton permission to pursue the gang, but Triton heads into the swamp anyway. After an altercation between Morgan and Vescera, Rome decides to kill Vescera. Rome gets a call from his anonymous partner, and Rome tells him that he intends to cut the partner out of the deal. The gang arrives at a lodge and decide to rest there for the time being. Meanwhile, Triton is kidnapped by two fugitives who believe he is a police officer looking for them. He subdues them and tracks the gang to the lodge. He kills Morgan and Bennett then drags the bodies under the lodge, where he again meets Detective Van Buren. Kate rushes out of the lodge, but Angela attacks and recaptures her. Meanwhile, Triton enters the lodge and finds himself face- to-face with Rome and his gun. Van Buren enters the room but points his gun at Triton, revealing himself to be the anonymous partner. Rome opens fire on Triton, who uses Van Buren as a human shield, killing him. Rome makes his escape and joins up with Angela and Kate before firing at a gasoline tank and blowing up the lodge. Triton makes a narrow escape, having been blown into the swamp. Rome escapes in Van Buren's car, but abandons it due to a police tracking device. Angela seduces then kills a truck driver for his truck. Triton is arrested by a marine patrol officer, but steals the officer's vessel after handcuffing him. He races to the marina that is Rome's destination, jumping on Rome's truck, throwing Angela into the windshield of an oncoming bus, killing her and spilling the diamonds. Rome scrapes Triton off the truck by driving into the side of a building, careening through a warehouse, then leaps out just before the truck crashes into a lake. Triton then stumbles out, leaving Rome in the fiery warehouse, then rescues Kate, who is drowning in the truck. A badly-burned Rome returns and tries to choke Triton with a chain. Triton kills Rome by breaking his neck with the chain. The final scene depicts Triton and Kate kissing as the police arrive. ==Cast== *John Cena as John Triton *Robert Patrick as Rome *Kelly Carlson as Kate Triton *Anthony Ray Parker as Morgan *Abigail Bianca as Angela *Damon Gibson as Vescera *Manu Bennett as Bennett *Jerome Ehlers as Detective Van Buren *Drew Powell as Joe *Frank Carlopio as Frank *Jeff Chase as Billy *Jamal Duff as Paul ==Production== The Marine was originally written with Al Pacino in mind for the part of criminal Rome, with Stone Cold Steve Austin as hero Triton. After Austin and WWE parted ways in 2004, Randy Orton was set to be the main character. Orton turned down the role because of his bad conduct discharge from the Marines in the late 1990s, and was replaced by John Cena. Al Pacino turned down the role of Rome due to the low salary offered. After Pacino turned it down, Ray Liotta was considered for the role of Rome, but Robert Patrick got the part instead. Principal photography for the film was actually shot and completed in 2004. In order to cover for John Cena's absence from WWE events, a storyline was written after Carlito beat Cena for the WWE United States Championship, saying that he was stabbed by Carlito's bodyguard Jesús and was taking time off to recover. Filming was done at Movie World Studios in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. The Marine Base was filmed at Bond University. The part in which skyscrapers are shown is the downtown area of Brisbane, Australia. Other footage was shot in bush land surrounding Brisbane. The opening segment of the downtown scenes was filmed in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Cena was approached by Vince McMahon to do the movie which he accepted for outside fame. On making the movie he said \\"I enjoyed the business plan, I didn't enjoy the experience\\". ==Release== Originally planned for a January or February 2006 release, it was later moved to Spring 2006, then September 8 (which was changed because former professional wrestler The Rock's Gridiron Gang was released September 15). It was released to theaters on October 13, 2006. ===Box office=== In its first weekend, the film made approximately $7.1 million at the United States box office. In its first weekend, it placed #6 domestically. After a total of ten weeks in theaters, the film grossed $18.8 million domestically. The Marine was at one time noted as being WWE Studios's most successful film, beating out its predecessor See No Evil, starring Kane, and its successor The Condemned, starring Stone Cold Steve Austin. It would later be surpassed by The Call, starring Halle Berry and WWE wrestler David Otunga. ===Critical response=== The film received mostly negative reviews, holding a 20% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 46 reviews (with an average rating of 4 out of 10), with the site's general consensus stating \\"Overblown in every possible way, The Marine is either so bad it's good or just really, really bad.\\" ===Home media=== The film was released on DVD on January 30, 2007. It is available in \\"Rated\\" and \\"Unrated\\" versions. The Blu-ray version was released on February 13, 2007, with a DTS-HD Lossless Master Audio 5.1 track and a 1080p HD transfer. The Region 2 DVD was released in the UK on May 7, 2007. The Marine was the number one most rented DVD in its first week of release. By March 2007, it had made over $24 million in home sales and rental. Overall, the film made $30 million in rentals in the first twelve weeks. ==Sequels== The film has spawned five direct-to-video sequels: * The Marine 2, featuring Ted DiBiase, Jr. in the main role, released on December 29, 2009 * The Marine 3: Homefront, released on March 5, 2013 * The Marine 4: Moving Target, released on April 21, 2015 * The Marine 5: Battleground, released on April 25, 2017 * The Marine 6: Close Quarters, released on November 13, 2018 The last four sequels have starred professional wrestler Mike \\"The Miz\\" Mizanin in the role of Jake Carter. ==References* Category:2006 films Category:2000s action comedy films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:American action comedy films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Don Davis (composer) Category:Films set in South Carolina Category:Films shot in Australia Category:Films shot in Calgary Category:Iraq War films Category:Films about the United States Marine Corps Category:WWE Studios films Category:2006 directorial debut films ","title":"The Marine"},{"id":"1278599","text":"Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag (1885-1954) or Yehuda Leib Ha-Levi Ashlag (), also known as the Baal Ha-Sulam (Hebrew: , \\"Author of The Ladder\\") in reference to his magnum opus, was an orthodox rabbi and kabbalist born in Łódź, Congress Poland, Russian Empire, to a family of scholars connected to the Hasidic courts of Porisov and Belz. Rabbi Ashlag lived in the Holy Land from 1922 until his death in 1954 (except for two years in England). In addition to his Sulam commentary on the Zohar, his other primary work, Talmud Eser Sefirot is regarded as the central textbook for students of Kabbalah. Ashlag systematically interpreted the wisdom and promoted its wide dissemination. In line with his directives, many contemporary adherents of Ashlag's teachings strive to spread Kabbalah to the masses. ==Biography== ===Poland=== Ashlag reputedly studied Kabbalah from the age of seven, hiding pages from the book Etz Chaim \\"The Tree of Life\\" by Isaac Luria in the Talmudic tractate he was meant to be studying. At the age of twelve, he studied the Talmud independently. By nineteen, Ashlag's knowledge of the Torah was profound enough for the rabbis of Warsaw to confer upon him the title of rabbi. During this period he worked as a judge in the court of the Warsaw rabbis and also gained experience as a teacher for training judges for Jewish courts. Ashlag also studied German while in Warsaw, and read original texts of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Arthur Schopenhauer. While still in Poland, he met an unidentified Warsaw merchant, who revealed himself to Ashlag as a Kabbalist. Ashlag studied with this particular teacher every night for three months, he said, “until my arrogance separated us,” and the teacher disappeared. A few months later Ashlag met the teacher again, and after pleading with him, convinced him to reveal an important kabbalistic secret. The next day, the teacher died. ===Israel=== In 1921, at the age of 36, Ashlag made the decision to emigrate to the Land of Israel, a journey that took several months. He spent the first few years living anonymously, supporting his family through manual labor by day and writing his commentaries at night. Eventually, he was recognized through his work, and was appointed Rabbi of Givat Shaul, Jerusalem in 1924. Ashlag was friendly with the Kabbalist and Chief Rabbi of Mandatory Palestine, Abraham Isaac Kook, who recognized Ashlag as a great follower of Isaac Luria. Ashlag had high hopes of meeting great Kabbalists in Jerusalem including the Sephardi followers of the great 18th century Yemenite Jewish Kabbalist Shalom Sharabi. However, he was profoundly disappointed by his encounter with them. Their views about Kabbalah ran contrary to Ashlag's experience with the teaching as a means of profound personal transformation and spiritual illumination, by becoming a vessel for divine light. In 1926 Ashlag left for London, and it was there that he wrote his commentary on Isaac Luria's book Etz Chaim. This work is entitled Panim Meirot wMasbirot. It took him one and a half years to complete this work. It was published in 1927, and in 1928 Ashlag returned to Mandatory Palestine. In 1932 Ashlag and his family moved to Jaffa. During this period, Ashlag also began one of his main works, Talmud Eser Sefirot, a commentary on all the writings of Isaac Luria. In this undertaking, he developed a comprehensive explanation of the sequence of the creation of all of the upper worlds (Olamot Elyonim), starting with the source of emanation (Ma'atzil) and finishing with our world (Olam HaZeh). The work is divided into six volumes, containing sixteen parts and over two thousand pages. Some today consider it as the core of the entire teaching of Kabbalah. In the 1930s Ashlag, now in his fifties, gathered around him a group of disciples, including Rav Yehuda Tzvi Brandwein, his closest student, and studied Kabbalah every night, often from shortly after midnight until dawn. He also composed many articles and letters at this time that openly promoted the study of Kabbalah on a mass scale. Ashlag went to great lengths to publish Kabbalistic material, in mediums suitable for disseminating the knowledge he had acquired across the entire nation. He began an independent Kabbalistic newsletter publication, HaUma \\"The Nation\\", of which only one issue survived. Its contents present Ashlag's analytical depths of using knowledge he had attained in Kabbalah to illuminate the cause of political and social problems in human egoism; giving reasons why communism was destined to fail, and offering solutions for correcting the property of human egoism through his teaching method of Kabbalah. Editor’s Note: Existence and content of this newsletter has not been verified yet. Ohel of Yehuda Ashlag on Har HaMenuchot Ashlag differs fundamentally from all Kabbalists of the past, who studied and taught Kabbalah in a concealed manner, in that he felt a great need to reveal and clarify the teaching of Kabbalah to the masses. This was because he saw that the evil inclination in people (human egoism) would rise to an altogether new height in this era of humanity, causing an altogether new era of internal suffering felt as a meaningless and confused existence. ===Writing of the Sulam === In 1943, Ashlag moved to Tel Aviv, and there began working on his book, HaSulam (The Ladder), a collection of commentaries on The Zohar. During this period, he wrote for eighteen hours a day, and due to a lack of money he was not able to afford a sufficient amount of paper and ink to write more precise explanations. He later said that if it had been within his capabilities, he would have written a full commentary on The Zohar in two-hundred volumes, but he was unable to begin the work only because of a lack of means.Ashlag, Y. \\"Speech in Celebration for the Conclusion of the Zohar.\\" Bnei Baruch Kabbalah Education and Research Institute. Trans., C. Ratz, available at . Published in original Hebrew as Maamar LeSium HaZohar in Kabbalah LaMathil. 2002. Israel: Bnei Baruch, pp. 28—36. He completed this work in 1953, and later added three more volumes. Rav Ashlag's closest student Rav Yehuda Tzvi Brandwein later finished the work by adding this three volumes called Tikkunei HaZohar \\"Maalot Hasulam\\". In honor of the completion of the entire work, his students organized a big feast in Meron, where Ashlag gave the speech that is today printed under the title “Maamar LeSiyum HaZohar” (“An Article for the Completion of the Zohar,” also known as “Speech in Celebration for the Conclusion of the Zohar”). Yehuda Ashlag died on the day of Yom Kippur in 1954. He was buried on cemetery Har HaMenuchot located in Givat Shaul, Jerusalem, Israel. ===Rabbi Brandwein=== Rabbi Yehudah Tzvi Brandwein a direct descendant of the famous first Admor of Stretin, Rabbi Yehudah Tzvi of Stretin, was a foremost disciple of Rabbi Yehudah HaLevi Ashlag (Baal HaSulam). His vast knowledge of the Lurianic system of Kabbalah enabled him to codify and edit the entire writings of the Ari HaKadosh, Rabbi Yitzchak Luria. He continued with a similar style of translation and commentary of Rabbi Yehudah Ashlag known as Maalot HaSulam (Extension of the Ladder) on those works of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, which Rabbi Ashlag didn't complete during his lifetime, namely Hashmatot HaZohar (Various other Writings) and Tikkunei HaZohar. Rabbi Brandwein was one of the first Jewish settlers within the Old City of Jerusalem after the Six Day War. Rabbi Yehuda Zvi Brandwein ran a religious school in Jerusalem called Yeshiva Kol Yehudah, founded in 1922 by Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag. For a while he also served as the chief rabbi for the Histadrut - the Israeli labor union, using his position to bring many secular Israelis back to Judaism. ==Books== Ashlag wrote and published two major works. The first, Talmud Eser Sefirot is a complete re-editing and commentary to the works of 16th century Kabbalist Rabbi Isaac Luria. This is a comprehensive exposition of the system of the upper worlds, Partzufim and Sefirot, in the scientific language of Kabbalah which was developed by Luria. As a core Kabbalistic text, it is especially unique in its utmost precision to detail to the structural organization and processes occurring in the upper worlds. It is set out as a comprehensive textbook, complete with commentaries, a section in each chapter dedicated to further reflection upon the commentaries, definitions of terms, tables of questions and answers, an introduction clarifying how to study Kabbalah in the correct manner, and also a summarized preface of the entire text. His other masterwork was his Sulam commentary on The Zohar, which earned him the name “Baal HaSulam”. This monumental work took him ten years to complete, written between the years 1943 and 1953. It includes a translation of The Zohar from Aramaic to Hebrew as well as an extensive interpretation.

Another publication is the notebook of Yehuda Ashlag's son and disciple, Baruch Ashlag. His notebook, entitled Shamati (I Heard]), contains over two hundred articles which were copied down from lessons and talks with his father. Baruch Ashlag kept this notebook with him in secret, until he was on his deathbed, in 1991. It was later published in Hebrew and has been translated into many different languages. The articles in Shamati form a unique kabbalistic work in their emotional depth of capturing the inner processes that a Kabbalist goes through on the path of spiritual attainment. ===Works of Interest=== *Matan Torah (Gift of the Bible) *Perush HaSulam (Commentary of the Ladder on the Zohar) *Talmud Eser haSefirot (Study of the Ten Luminous Emanations) *Panim Meirot u'Masbirot (Welcoming and Illuminating Revelations) *Ha’Akadama Le Talmud Eser haSefirot (Introduction to the Ten Luminous Emanations) *Ha’Akadama Le Sefer HaZohar (Introduction to the Zohar) *Mavo le Sefer HaZohar (Entrance to the Zohar) *Pticha le Hokhmat haKabbalah (Opening to the Wisdom of Kabbalah) *Sefer haIlan (Book of the Tree or Book of Illustrations) *Pticha le Perush haSulam (Opening to the Sulam Commentary) *Ha’Akadama Le Sefer Panim Meirot u’Masbirot (Introduction to Panim Meirot u’Masbirot [Welcoming and Illuminating Revelations]) *Pticha Kolelet leSefer Panim Meirot u’Masbirot (Opening to Panim Meirot u’Masbirot [Welcoming and Illuminating Revelations]) ==Teachings== Ashlag's commentary offered a systematic interpretation of the legacy of Isaac Luria. This was the first since the 18th century when the Baal Shem Tov, Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, the Vilna Gaon and Shalom Sharabi offered their interpretation of the Luria's teaching. Ashlag's system focused on the transformation of human consciousness from the \\"desire to receive\\" to the \\"desire to give,\\" i.e., from egocentricity to altruism. This path of transformation is described in Lurianic Kabbalah. Ashlag stated that the purpose of studying Kabbalah is equal to the purpose of why human beings were created, and that through its study, a person is capable of revealing the entirety of processes and structures that have taken place in the creation of the universe. \\"Equivalence of form\\" with this source means having the same attributes or qualities as it, and Ashlag defines the qualities of this source as being altruistic, namely the desire to give, or in Ashlag's words, the \\"will to bestow\\" (Ratzon LeHashpia). Through intensive study of Kabbalah, a person's desire to give to others is developed in relation to this goal. Ashlag believed that the coming of the Messiah meant that humans would attain this quality which would allow them to give up their selfishness and devote themselves to loving each other for the sake of life's purpose, as stated in the commandment \\"love thy neighbor as thyself.\\" Ashlag had strong political opinions, believing in a religious version of anarcho- communism, based on principles of Kabbalah. Though his anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist ideas show some Marxist influence, he strongly opposed communism instituted by force and believed in \\"developing a community based on love between its members and a society founded on economic justice.\\" He supported the Kibbutz movement and preached to establish a network of self- ruled internationalist communes, who would eventually “annul the brute-force regime completely, for ‘every man did that which was right in his own eyes.’”, because “there is nothing more humiliating and degrading for a person than being under the brute-force government”.Building the Future Society The Or HaGanuz community of Northern Israel is based on the principles of Yehudah Ashlag, and is led by Rabbi Mordechai Sheinberger, a prominent contemporary teacher of Ashlag's kabbalistic system. ==Ashlag's sons== * Baruch Ashlag (1906–1991) * Shlomo Benyamin Ashlag * Yaʿaqov (Jacob) Ashlag ==See also== *Ashlag (Hasidic dynasty) ==References== ==External links== * Ashlag.org - grandson of Yehuda * Jonatan Meir, \\"The Beginnings of Kabbalah in America: The Unpublished Manuscripts of R.

This event happened in 1514. Stańczyk (c. 1480-1560) () was a Polish court jester, the most famous in Polish history. He was employed by three Polish kings: Alexander, Sigismund the Old and Sigismund Augustus. ==Name, identity and historicity== Scarcity of sources gave rise to four distinct hypotheses in the 19th century: that he was entirely invented by Jan Kochanowski and his colleagues; or that he was \\"perhaps a typical jester dressed by his contemporaries in an Aesopian attire; or perhaps a Shakespearean vision of 19th century writers; or perhaps indeed a grey eminence of the societatis ioculatorum\\". In any measure, common consensus among modern scholars is that such a person indeed existed and even if he did not, he had a tremendous importance to Polish culture of later centuries, appearing in works of many artists of the 19th and 20th centuries. Almost nothing is known about Stańczyk's life and even his name and identity are a matter of dispute. Contemporary sources mention court jesters named Gąska and Stańczyk. Notably, both names are featured in two short poems by Jan Kochanowski. Both words are diminutives, of the words gęś (goose) and Stanisław, respectively, rather than proper names in their own right. All of the above led Aleksander Brückner and later scholars to believe that Gąska and Stańczyk are merely two nicknames of the same person. Because of that hypothesis Stańczyk is sometimes referred to as Stanisław Gąska, a name that resembles a typical Polish name, except it is of much later provenance and was coined in late 19th century rather than during the jester's times.The etymologic analysis of Stańczyk's name is provided in: By any measure Stańczyk's fame and legend were already strong during his own time, the Renaissance. The popularity later reappeared in 19th century and remained well-known to present times. Unlike jesters of other European courts, Stańczyk has been always considered to have been much more than a mere entertainer.The difference between Polish and foreign traditions in this context is discussed in: He is remembered as a man of great intelligence and a political philosopher gifted with formidable insight into Poland's current and future situation. He used his job to criticize and warn his contemporaries by the use of satire. His witty jokes often pertained to current political or court matters. Stańczyk's remarks and jokes were preserved by numerous contemporary writers and historians, including Łukasz Górnicki, Jan Kochanowski, Marcin Kromer, and Mikołaj Rej who praised him for fighting hypocrisy in the name of truth. Some sources even go as far as to call him a \\"personal friend to Marcin Kromer, to the dislike of the bishops\\". The best known anecdote about Stańczyk is that of a hunting incident. In 1533 King Sigismund the Old had a huge bear brought for him from Lithuania. The bear was released in the forest of Niepołomice near Kraków so that the king could hunt it. During the hunt, the animal charged at the king, the queen and their courtiers which caused panic and mayhem. Queen Bona fell from her horse which resulted in her miscarriage. Later, the king criticized Stańczyk for having run away instead of attacking the bear. The jester is said to have replied that \\"it is a greater folly to let out a bear that was already in a cage\\". This remark is often interpreted as an allusion to the king's policy toward Prussia which was defeated by Poland but not fully incorporated into the Crown. == Stańczyk as a symbol == Gamrat and Stańczyk, oil on wood, by Jan Matejko. Kościuszko Foundation, New York Stańczyk became a popular historical figure in Polish literature after the partitions (1795). Some writers treated him as a symbol of Poland's struggle for independence, others provided him with rather Shakespearean traits. He appears in a work of, among others, Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz (in Jan z Tęczna. Powieść historyczna, 1825) and several works by Józef Ignacy Kraszewski (1839, 1841). === Teka Stańczyka === The Prussian Homage (detail). Oil on canvas, by Jan Matejko, National Museum in Kraków In 1869 a group of young conservative publicists: Józef Szujski, Stanisław Tarnowski, and , published a series of satirical pamphlets entitled (Stańczyk's Portfolio). Only five years after the tragic end of the January Uprising, the pamphlets ridiculed the idea of armed national uprisings and suggested a compromise with Poland's enemies, especially the Austrian Empire, and more concentration on economic growth than on political independence. The political faction which adopted these ideas became known as \\"Stańczycy\\" (plural of \\"Stańczyk\\"). === Stańczyk in the arts === Stańczyk was also one of Jan Matejko's favorite historical figures and he appears in a number of his paintings, such as in the Prussian Homage. Matejko, giving the jester his own facial features, created the popular image of Stańczyk that is familiar to most modern Poles. The painter always depicted Stańczyk with a very concerned and reflective look on his face, in stark contrast to his cap and bells and other jester's gear. Matejko's vision of Stańczyk influenced the way other artists, such as Leon Wyczółkowski, later depicted the jester. The most notable appearance of Stańczyk in literature is in Stanisław Wyspiański's play Wesele (The Wedding) where the jester's ghost visits the Journalist, a character modeled after , editor of the Kraków-based paper Czas (Time), associated with the Stańczycy faction. In the play, Stańczyk accuses the Journalist, who calls the jester a \\"great man\\", of inactivity and passive acceptance of the nation's fate. At the end of their conversation, Stańczyk gives the Journalist his \\"caduceus\\" (the jester's marotte) and tells him to \\"stir the nation\\" but not to \\"tarnish the sacred things, for sacred they must remain\\". Thus Wyspiański reinforced Stańczyk's role as a symbol of patriotism and skeptical political wisdom. ==References== == Further reading == * * ==External links== * Stańczyk, WIEM Encyklopedia * Andrzej Solarz, Stańczyk, Internetowy Kurier Proszowicki - SERWIS Ziemi Proszowickiej * Liliana Sonik, \\"Stańczyk na dworze królowej Bony wobec straconego Smoleńska\\", Dziennik Polski, 26.04.2010 Category:1480s births Category:1560 deaths Category:Jesters Category:Polish comedians Category:15th- century Polish people Category:16th-century Polish people ","title":"Stańczyk"},{"id":"1278604","text":"The Silencers is the title of a 1962 spy novel by Donald Hamilton, the fourth in a series of books featuring assassin Matt Helm. ==Plot summary== When a female agent in Mexico is killed before Helm can complete his mission to extract her, he finds himself teamed up with the woman's sister as he fights to save the lives of a number of scientists and Congressmen. ==Film adaptation== The Silencers has the distinction of being the first Matt Helm novel adapted as a film.

Tagliacozzi began his medical studies in 1565. He studied at the University of Bologna under Gerolamo Cardano for medicine, Ulisse Aldrovandi for natural sciences and Julius Caesar Aranzi for anatomy. At the age of twenty-four, he earned his degree in philosophy and medicine. ==Career== He was then appointed professor of surgery and later was appointed professor of anatomy. He taught at the Archiginnasio of Bologna. The amphitheater in which Tagliacozzi taught was severely damaged by American bombing during World War II. The theater was rebuilt and currently houses a wooden statue of Tagliacozzi. It is in this room that Tagliacozzi taught until 1595. In 1568, two years before graduating, Tagliacozzi began practicing in the Hospital of Death, which was a sort of clinic for students since it was near the Archiginnasio. The hospital was run by a \\"Brotherhood of Death\\" whose job was to visit prisons and comfort those condemned to death. Through this brotherhood Tagliacozzi procured the bodies of executed prisoners for use in dissections. In his will, Tagliacozzi gave the responsibility of his burial to the brotherhood. He improved on the work of the Sicilian Surgeon Gustavo Branca and his son Antonio (who lived in Catania in the 15th century) and developed the so-called \\"Italian method\\" of nasal reconstruction. His principal work is entitled De Curtorum Chirurgia per Insitionem (1597) (“On the Surgery of Mutilation by Grafting”). In this book, he described in great detail the procedures that were being carried out empirically by the Branca and Vianeo families of Sicily since the 15th century AD. The work has bestowed upon him the honor of being one of the first plastic surgeons and a quote from the book has become synonymous with plastic surgery. \\"We restore, rebuild, and make whole those parts which nature hath given, but which fortune has taken away. Not so much that it may delight the eye, but that it might buoy up the spirit, and help the mind of the afflicted.\\" Original illustration of the now- called “Italian method”. ==Death and memorial service== Tagliacozzi died at Bologna on 7 November 1599 and was buried in the church of the nuns of St. John the Baptist as he had ordered in his will. On the 26th of the same month a solemn mass was held in the same church in his honor which was attended by all doctors collegiate. During the ceremony Muzio Piacentini, a colleague of Tagliacozzi, gave the funeral oration, while some of the other participants recited rhymes of praise ==Brief history of the Italian method== This operation for nasal reconstruction (rhinoplasty) was developed in Italy due to the popularity of duelling with rapier in the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The invention of the method is believed to be about surgeons Gustavo Branca and his son Antonio, who lived in 1400 in Catania. Branca de Branca (the senior) used a skin flap from the cheek and years later, his son Antonio Branca used a flap raised from the arm. It has been suggested that reconstructive surgical methods described in the Sushruta Samhita, which was translated into Arabic in the 8th century, traveled further to Italy and was then incorporated into the methods described by Branca.Lock etc., page 607 The technique was then taken up in Calabria during the sixteenth century by the brothers surgeons Peter and Paul Boiano (also called Vianeo). This process was described by the great anatomist Andreas Vesalius (1514-1564) but, incredibly wrong, advised to use the muscle and the skin of the arm to adjust the nose. The Italian method was however criticized by Gabriele Fallopio (1523-1562) as such a procedure could force the patient to remain with the arm immobilized for many months, and the result was not guaranteed as the skin would often detach. Tagliacozzi probably knew the method of Boiano through the description of Leonardo Fioravanti. Tagliacozzi's method was practiced by Fortunio Liceti, who mentions it in his De monstruorum nature caussis et differentiis of 1616, by Henricus Moinichen in Observationes Medical chirurgicae of 1691, by Thomas Feyens surgeon to the University of Louvain, who had studied in Bologna with Tagliacozzi, in his work De praecipuis Artis Chirurgicae controversiis, published posthumously in 1669. But this operation declined during the seventeenth century throughout Europe and the method of Tagliacozzi was actually forgotten, until it was rediscovered and applied in 1800 by the German surgeon Karl Ferdinand von Graefe, whereupon it was used right up to the early twentieth century. ==Notes== ==References== * *Jerome Pierce Webster, Martha Teach Gnudi - Documenti inediti intorno alla vita di Gaspare Tagliacozzi in Studi e memorie per la storia dell'Università di Bologna, 1935 *Pietro Capparoni, Profili bio-bibliografici di medici e naturalisti celebri Italiani, dal sec.

A film version was released in 2006. ==Plot summary== Rudolf \\"Dolf\\" Wega is a fifteen-year- old who volunteers for an experiment with a time machine. The experiment goes well, but accidentally Dolf is stranded in the 13th century. He saves the life of Leonardo Fibonacci da Pisa, without realizing who he is, and teaches him Arabic numerals. Together they join the German Children's Crusade, and through his modern-day knowledge, Rudolf manages to save a lot of children from horrible fates. However, his knowledge also leads to accusations of witchcraft. In the book, two slavers delude a group of children into coming with them with stories of how the innocent shall liberate Jerusalem. Their actual intent is to sell them as slaves for profit. With the aid of his twentieth-century knowledge and skepticism, and the aid of a \\"magical\\" device or two (such as a box of matches), the boy manages to keep most of the children alive and eventually gets them to safety. ==Characters== ;Dolf: Born in Amstelveen, his full name is Rudolf Hefting, and at the age of 15 becomes the active leader of the crusade. ;Leonardo: Born in Pisa, his full name is Leonardo Fibonacci. He is a very intelligent young man and one of the few historical characters in the book. The historical Fibonacci is often considered one of the greatest mathematicians in the Middle Ages. ;Marie: She is eleven years old, as stated by Leonardo. She is a parentless beggar with a very sensitive nature, and, during the crusade, both Dolf and Leonardo grow very fond of her. ;Frank: The twelve-year-old son of a tanner from Cologne. ;Peter: A strong child around the age of twelve, who, in the Crusade, became responsible for fisheries.
