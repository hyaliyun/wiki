He was born into rural poverty, his father died when he was only a few days old and was educated at a one-room school. He worked his way through college attending East Texas State Normal College in Commerce (now Texas A&M-Commerce;), Paris Junior College and graduated from Southern Methodist University with a BA in English in 1932. He received a PhD in English from the University of Iowa in 1941. In 1940, Owens made a live recording of Roosevelt \\"Grey Ghost\\" Williams singing \\"Hitler Blues,\\" a song written by Williams. The song received mention in TIME magazine and was broadcast by BBC Radio on a program hosted by Alistair Cooke in 1940 about the American musical response to World War II. This recording was instrumental to the development of Williams' career.Austin Music DatabaseAdapted from Roosevelt Williams. Owens served in the US Army from 1942 to 1945 and was awarded the Legion of Merit for his work in the intelligence service in the Philippines. Owens taught at Wesley College in Greenville, Texas, Mississippi State College in Starkville and Texas A&M; College in College Station, Texas.

An Egyptian attacking force that advanced beyond their line of defense at the Bar-Lev Line was repulsed with heavy losses by Israeli forces. This prompted the Israelis to launch Operation Abiray-Lev (Stouthearted Men) the next day, penetrating the Egyptian line of defense and crossing the Suez Canal. == Background == After Egyptian infantry had successfully crossed the canal and captured the Bar-Lev Line on October 6, Israeli forces made several counterattacks in attempts to push the Egyptians back across the Suez Canal. The Israelis suffered heavy losses in these attacks, and by October 9 Egyptian forces in the Sinai had managed to destroy 500 Israeli tanks.October 9, 1973 conversation (8:20‚Äì8:40 AM) between Israeli Ambassador to the United States Simcha Dinitz, military attach√© General Mordechai Gur, Henry Kissinger, Brent Scowcroft, and Peter Rodman. Transcript George Washington University National Security Archive Following this both sides dug in. The Egyptians would not attack for fear of extending their forces beyond the cover of their SAM defences. In the Golan Heights, Israel had repelled Syrian forces and pushed into Syria itself. By the time the Syrians, now aided by Iraqi and Jordanian expeditionary forces managed to put a halt to the Israeli advance, Israeli forces were 40 km from Damascus. Syrian president Hafez Al-Assad requested his Egyptian ally, Anwar El-Sadat, order an attack in the Sinai, which would draw Israeli attention away from the Syrian front. Sadat consented and ordered the attack. His War Minister, Ahmed Ismail, and his Chief of Staff, Saad El Shazly, opposed the idea; Shazli in particular stated that for Egyptian forces to advance outside their SAM defences would mean their exposure to the Israeli Air Force, which the Egyptian Air Force was too weak to challenge. Sadat insisted that the attack proceed, however, and both Ahmed Ismail and Shazli had no choice but to acknowledge the order.Shazly The Crossing of the Suez p.245‚Äì248El Gammasy The October War p.264‚Äì265 == Prelude == The attack was to proceed on October 13, but was postponed to October 14. Four armored brigades and one mechanized infantry brigade under the command of the Second and Third Armies were to make four independent thrusts. Awaiting for them was a dug-in force of 800 Israeli tanks supported by infantry equipped with SS.11 missiles, as well as American-made LAW and TOW anti-tank missiles. Israel had in the Sinai by October 14 around fifteen brigades totaling nearly 60,000 infantry. The Israeli air force provided intense air cover during the battle. == Battle and aftermath == The Egyptians launched their offensive in the early morning of October 14, at 6:30. The mechanized infantry brigade was to attack in the direction of the Gidi Pass, one armored brigade was to attack in the direction of the Mitla Pass, one brigade was to attack towards Baluza, and two brigades were to attack in the direction of Tasa. As anticipated by many Egyptian officers, the attack was a failure. Encountering stiff Israeli resistance, the Egyptian assault came to a halt after suffering heavy losses, and Egyptian troops retreated back to their lines on the Suez Canal.El Gammasy The October War p.277 Egyptian losses in the battle were 200‚Äì250 tanks and up to 1,000 men killed and wounded in action.

It usually measures changes in business revenue, business profits, personal wages, and/or jobs. The economic event analyzed can include implementation of a new policy or project, or may simply be the presence of a business or organization. An economic impact analysis is commonly conducted when there is public concern about the potential impacts of a proposed project or policy.Army Corps of Engineers: Glossary of Economic Impact Terms (http://corpslakes.usace.army.mil/employees/economic/glossary.html ) An economic impact analysis typically measures or estimates the change in economic activity between two scenarios, one assuming the economic event occurs, and one assuming it does not occur (which is referred to as the counterfactual case). This can be accomplished either before or after the event (ex ante or ex post). == Overview == An economic impact analysis attempts to measure or estimate the change in economic activity in a specified region, caused by a specific business, organization, policy, program, project, activity, or other economic event. The study region can be a neighborhood, town, city, county, statistical area, state, country, continent, or the entire globe. === Types of Economic Impacts === Economic impact analyses often estimate multiple types of impacts. An output impact is the total increase in business sales revenue. In turn, local businesses use some of this new revenue to pay for goods and services outside of the study region, so the output impact is not synonymous with local business profits. A more conservative measure of economic activity is the value added impact, which estimates the increase in the study region‚Äôs gross regional product. The gross regional product (GRP) is very similar to the nation‚Äôs gross domestic product (GDP), and represents the total size of the local economy. This impact estimates the increase in local employee wages plus local business profits (not total revenue, like the output impact). However, the value added impact may overstate local profits when they are transferred overseas (such as in the form of dividends or investments in foreign facilities). An even more conservative measure is the labour income impact, which represents the increase in total money paid to local employees in the form of salaries and wages. The increases in income may come in the form of raises and/or increased hours for existing employees, or new jobs for the unemployed. This is a measure of the economic impact on just personal incomes, not business revenues or profits. A similar measure is the employment impact, which measures the increase in the number of total employees in the local region. Instead of measuring the economic impact in terms of money, this measure presents the impact on the number of jobs in the region. Another measure of economic impact is the property value impact, measuring the increase in total property values, and is a reflection of generated income and wealth, both personal and business. === Sources of Economic Impacts === In addition to the types of impacts, economic impact analyses often estimate the sources of the impacts. Each impact can be decomposed into different components, depending on the effect that caused the impact. Direct effects are the results of the money initially spent in the study region by the business or organization being studied. This includes money spent to pay for salaries, supplies, raw materials, and operating expenses.a The direct effects from the initial spending creates additional activity in the local economy. Indirect effects are the results of business-to-business transactions indirectly caused by the direct effects. Businesses initially benefiting from the direct effects will subsequently increase spending at other local businesses. The indirect effect is a measure of this increase in business-to-business activity (not including the initial round of spending, which is included in the direct effects). Induced effects are the results of increased personal income caused by the direct and indirect effects. Businesses experiencing increased revenue from the direct and indirect effects will subsequently increase payroll expenditures (by hiring more employees, increasing payroll hours, raising salaries, etc.). Households will, in turn, increase spending at local businesses. The induced effect is a measure of this increase in household-to- business activity. Finally, dynamic effects are caused by geographic shifts over time in populations and businesses. === Methodology === Economic impact analyses usually employ one of two methods for determining impacts. The first is an input-output model (I/O model) for analyzing the regional economy. These models rely on inter-industry data to determine how effects in one industry will impact other sectors. In addition, I/O models also estimate the share of each industry's purchases that are supplied by local firms (versus those outside the study area). Based on this data, multipliers are calculated and used to estimate economic impacts. Examples of I/O models used for economic impact analyses are IMPLAN,Minnesota Implan Group RIMS-II, Bureau of Economic Analysis Chmura, Chmura Economics & Analytics and Emsi.Economic Modeling Specialists, Intl Another method used for economic impact analyses are economic simulation models. These are more complex econometric and general equilibrium models. They account for everything the I/O model does, plus they forecast the impacts caused by future economic and demographic changes. One such an example is the REMI Model.Regional Economic Models, Inc === Comparison to Other Analyses === Economic impact analyses are related to but differ from other similar studies. An economic impact analysis only covers specific types of economic activity. Some social impacts that affect a region's quality of life, such as safety and pollution, may be analyzed as part of a social impact assessment, but not an economic impact analysis, even if the economic value of those factors could be quantified. An economic impact analysis may be performed as one part of a broader environmental impact assessment, which is often used to examine impacts of proposed development projects. An economic impact analysis may also be performed to help calculate the benefits as part of a cost-benefit analysis. ===Applications=== Economic impact analyses are used frequently in transportation planning. Common tools for this application include the Transportation Economic Development Impact System (TREDIS) and TranSight. Several transportation agencies, including the Transportation Research Board and US Department of Transportation, publish guides, standards, and techniques for utilizing economic impact analyses in transportation planning projects. Economic impact analyses are often used to examine the consequences of economic development projects and efforts, such as real estate development, business openings and closures, and site selection projects. The analyses can also help increase community support for these projects, as well as help obtain grants and tax incentives. An economic impact analysis is commonly developed in conjunction with proposed legislation or regulatory changes, in order to fully understand the impact of government action on the economy. The United States Department of Energy economic impact model is one example of this type of application. Many times the economic impact analysis is developed by the party advocating for the legislative or regulatory change, to communicate the merits of the proposed action. It can be useful with lobbying, media relations, and community outreach efforts. ==See also== * Impact assessment * Economic impacts of climate change * Economic impact of illegal immigrants in the United States * Economic impact of AIDS ==References== Category:Evaluation methods ","title":"Economic impact analysis"},{"id":"20487807","text":"Jean-Yves Le D√©aut (born February 1, 1945 in Gu√©men√©-sur-Scorff) is a member of the National Assembly of France.

Born in 1949, al-Roumi worked as a lawyer before being elected to the National Assembly in 1985. Al-Roumi is considered an independent, liberal- leaning member. ==Pro Gun Control== In February 2005, in the wake of a wave of Al-Qaeda violence, the parliament unanimously passed a law giving police wide powers to search for and seize illegal weapons. Al-Roumi was one of the main proponents of the bill, which makes it easier for police to obtain a warrant to search a private house for illegal weapons. The law also allows female inspectors to search women's quarters in private homes‚Äîquarters which are off limits to men according to Islamic rules. The parliament passed a similar law in 1992 to deal with a jump in gun ownership after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Lawmakers refused to extend that law in 1994, arguing that possession of weapons was a right. ==Allegations Against Oil Minister Sheik Ali Al Jarrah Al Sabah== In June 2007, al-Roumi, Adel Al-Saraawi, and Musallam Al-Barrak led impeachment proceedings against Oil Minister Sheik Ali Al Jarrah Al Sabah on charges of corruption. Al-Roumi alleged that Sheik Ali intimidated a witness in the case. The minister swore that he called the witness for a meeting to tell him to provide all the information he has in the case. Sheik Ali resigned on June 27, after being publicly questioned and before a no-confidence vote could be held. During the impeachment proceedings, al-Roumi also made the following public statement against Sheik Ali: \\"You have to submit your resignation today because what you said has humiliated the Kuwaiti people.\\" Sheikh Ali had been quoted by the local Al Qabas newspaper as saying that he considers former oil minister Sheikh Ali Khalifa Al Sabah, a defendant in a major graft case, as \\"my master and that I consult him occasionally on oil issues.\\" ==Campaign to Reform Foreign Worker Sponsorship System== In August 2008, al-Roumi declared that he was going to draft a law to scrap Kuwait's foreign worker sponsorship system, under which expatriates must be sponsored by a local employer to get a work permit: \\"The government should be the only kafeel... We have scores of bachelors residing in Kuwait with an equal number of crimes. Many are caused due to the 'trading with humans' issue which taints the reputation of Kuwait.\\" ==Denmark Boycott== In February 2008, al-Roumi called for the Kuwaiti government to boycott Denmark in response to the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy and was quoted as saying, \\"No Muslim can accept this insult against the Prophet... It is a form of terrorism.\\" Al-Roumi on boycotting Denmark ==Support For Female Candidates== In 2008, al-Roumi expressed his support for women's active participation in the legislature. On May 10, 2008, he spoke at the inauguration of a women's campaign headquarters in the Salwa area. However, on November 30, 1999, al- Roumi voted against granting women the right to vote. ==Runner-Up in Speaker Election== On June 1, 2008, Jassem Al-Kharafi was re-elected National Assembly Speaker on Sunday, after gaining 52 votes against 11 to his opponent, Abdullah al-Roumi. ==Supports Government Funds for College Tuition== In 2002 Kuwait started allowing private universities in the country, beginning with the Gulf University for Science and Technology. On September 28, 2008, MPs Abdullah al- Roumi, Marzouq Al-Ghanem, Ali Al-Rashid, and Adel Al-Saraawi proposed a law to have the government pay half of Kuwaiti students' tuition at these private colleges. ==Reforming Mandatory Retirement Age for Teachers== On November 28, 2008, al-Roumi joined MPs Khalid Al-Sultan, Hassan Johar, Musallam Al-Barrak, and Marzouq Al-Hubaini in formulating a bill to extend the mandatory retirement age for Kuwaiti teaching staff at Kuwait University from 65 to 70 years. Al-Roumi argued that Item 32 of Law no. 15/1979 has denied the country services of able and intelligent academicians by restricting retirement age of Kuwaitis to 65 years. He recommended that a clause be added to the law such that the retirement age can become 70 years and can further be extended to 75 years. ==References *Abdullah al-Roumi's website Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the National Assembly of Kuwait ","title":"Abdullah Al-Roumi"},{"id":"20487861","text":"Jean Grellier (born May 17, 1947 in Moncoutant) is a member of the National Assembly of France.

The Hamiltonian operator can be written : \\\\hat H = \\\\frac{\\\\hat{p}^2}{2m} + V(\\\\hat q ) where V(\\\\hat q ) is the potential energy, m is the mass and we have assumed for simplicity that there is only one spatial dimension . The formal solution of the equation is :\\\\psi(t)\\\\rangle = \\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar} \\\\hat H t\\\\right) q_0\\\\rangle \\\\equiv \\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar} \\\\hat H t\\\\right) 0\\\\rangle where we have assumed the initial state is a free-particle spatial state q_0\\\\rangle . The transition probability amplitude for a transition from an initial state 0 \\\\rangle to a final free-particle spatial state F \\\\rangle at time is :\\\\langle F \\\\psi(T)\\\\rangle = \\\\left \\\\langle F \\\\bigg \\\\exp\\\\left(- \\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar} \\\\hat H T\\\\right) \\\\bigg 0 \\\\right \\\\rangle. ===Path integral formulation=== The path integral formulation states that the transition amplitude is simply the integral of the quantity :\\\\exp\\\\left( \\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar} S \\\\right) over all possible paths from the initial state to the final state. Here S is the classical action. The reformulation of this transition amplitude, originally due to Dirac and conceptualized by Feynman, forms the basis of the path integral formulation. ==From Schr√∂dinger's equation to the path integral formulation== The following derivationSee makes use of the Trotter product formula, which states that for self-adjoint operators A and B (satisfying certain technical conditions), we have ::e^{i(A+B)}\\\\psi=\\\\lim_{N \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} (e^{iA/N}e^{iB/N})^N\\\\psi , even if A and B do not commute. We can divide the time interval into segments of length : \\\\delta t = \\\\frac{T}{N}. The transition amplitude can then be written :\\\\left \\\\langle F \\\\bigg \\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar} \\\\hat H T \\\\right) \\\\bigg0 \\\\right \\\\rangle = \\\\left \\\\langle F \\\\bigg  \\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar} \\\\hat H \\\\delta t \\\\right) \\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar} \\\\hat H \\\\delta t \\\\right) \\\\cdots \\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar} \\\\hat H \\\\delta t \\\\right) \\\\bigg 0 \\\\right \\\\rangle. Although the kinetic energy and potential energy operators do not commute, the Trotter product formula, cited above, says that over each small time-interval, we can ignore this noncommutativity and write : \\\\exp\\\\left(- \\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar} \\\\hat H \\\\delta t \\\\right) \\\\approx \\\\exp\\\\left( {- {i \\\\over \\\\hbar } { {\\\\hat p}^2 \\\\over 2m} \\\\delta t} \\\\right) \\\\exp\\\\left( {- {i \\\\over \\\\hbar } V \\\\left( q_j \\\\right) \\\\delta t} \\\\right) . For notational simplicity, we delay making this substitution for the moment. We can insert the identity matrix : I = \\\\int dq q\\\\rangle \\\\langle q  times between the exponentials to yield : \\\\left \\\\langle F \\\\bigg \\\\exp\\\\left(- \\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar} \\\\hat H T \\\\right) \\\\bigg 0 \\\\right \\\\rangle = \\\\left( \\\\prod_{j=1}^{N-1} \\\\int dq_j \\\\right) \\\\left \\\\langle F \\\\bigg  \\\\exp\\\\left(- \\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar} \\\\hat H \\\\delta t \\\\right) \\\\bigg q_{N-1} \\\\right \\\\rangle \\\\left \\\\langle q_{N-1} \\\\bigg  \\\\exp\\\\left(- \\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar} \\\\hat H \\\\delta t \\\\right) \\\\bigg  q_{N-2} \\\\right \\\\rangle \\\\cdots \\\\left \\\\langle q_{1} \\\\bigg  \\\\exp\\\\left(- \\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar} \\\\hat H \\\\delta t \\\\right) \\\\bigg  0 \\\\right \\\\rangle.

If we take the limit of large the transition amplitude reduces to : \\\\left \\\\langle F \\\\bigg \\\\exp\\\\left( {- {i \\\\over \\\\hbar } \\\\hat H T} \\\\right) \\\\bigg 0 \\\\right \\\\rangle = \\\\int Dq(t) \\\\exp\\\\left[ {i\\\\over \\\\hbar} S \\\\right] where S is the classical action given by :S = \\\\int_0^T dt L\\\\left( q(t), \\\\dot{q}(t) \\\\right) and L is the classical Lagrangian given by : L\\\\left( q, \\\\dot{q} \\\\right) = {1\\\\over 2} m {\\\\dot{q}}^2 - V (q) Any possible path of the particle, going from the initial state to the final state, is approximated as a broken line and included in the measure of the integral :\\\\int Dq(t) = \\\\lim_{N\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\left(\\\\frac{-i m}{2\\\\pi \\\\delta t \\\\hbar} \\\\right)^{\\\\frac{N}{2}} \\\\left( \\\\prod_{j=1}^{N-1} \\\\int dq_j \\\\right) This expression actually defines the manner in which the path integrals are to be taken. The coefficient in front is needed to ensure that the expression has the correct dimensions, but it has no actual relevance in any physical application. This recovers the path integral formulation from Schr√∂dinger's equation. == From path integral formulation to Schr√∂dinger's equation == The path integral reproduces the Schr√∂dinger equation for the initial and final state even when a potential is present. This is easiest to see by taking a path- integral over infinitesimally separated times. : \\\\psi(y;t+\\\\varepsilon) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\psi(x;t)\\\\int_{x(t)=x}^{x(t+\\\\varepsilon)=y} \\\\exp\\\\left(i\\\\int\\\\limits_t^{t+\\\\varepsilon}\\\\left(\\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\dot{x}^2 - V(x)\\\\right)\\\\, dt\\\\right)\\\\, Dx(t) \\\\, dx\\\\qquad (1) Since the time separation is infinitesimal and the cancelling oscillations become severe for large values of , the path integral has most weight for close to . In this case, to lowest order the potential energy is constant, and only the kinetic energy contribution is nontrivial. (This separation of the kinetic and potential energy terms in the exponent is essentially the Trotter product formula.) The exponential of the action is : e^{-i\\\\varepsilon V(x)} e^{i\\\\frac{\\\\dot{x}^2}{2}\\\\varepsilon} The first term rotates the phase of locally by an amount proportional to the potential energy. The second term is the free particle propagator, corresponding to times a diffusion process. To lowest order in they are additive; in any case one has with (1): : \\\\psi(y;t+\\\\varepsilon) \\\\approx \\\\int \\\\psi(x;t) e^{-i\\\\varepsilon V(x)} e^\\\\frac{i(x-y)^2 }{ 2\\\\varepsilon} \\\\,dx\\\\,. As mentioned, the spread in is diffusive from the free particle propagation, with an extra infinitesimal rotation in phase which slowly varies from point to point from the potential: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = i\\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\tfrac12 abla^2 - V(x)\\\\right)\\\\psi\\\\, and this is the Schr√∂dinger equation. Note that the normalization of the path integral needs to be fixed in exactly the same way as in the free particle case. An arbitrary continuous potential does not affect the normalization, although singular potentials require careful treatment. ==References== Category:Concepts in physics Category:Statistical mechanics Category:Quantum mechanics Category:Quantum field theory Category:Schr√∂dinger equation ","title":"Relation between Schr√∂dinger's equation and the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics"},{"id":"20487959","text":"Spy published in Vanity Fair in 1888 Sir Edward Bates, 1st Baronet DL (17 March 1816 ‚Äì 17 October 1896) was a ship-owner and Conservative politician who represented Plymouth.

The vocals on all the group's songs were sung by John Matthews. == Overview == The first single they released was a cover version of Gerry Rafferty's 1978 UK/U.S. hit \\"Baker Street\\". It became their biggest hit, when it reached No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart in September 1992, held off from the top only by another dance track, \\"Rhythm Is a Dancer\\" by Snap!. It was the eleventh biggest selling single of 1992 in the United Kingdom, and also attained major chart success across Europe, selling over a quarter of a million units alone in Germany. Undercover released five more chart singles. The second single was a cover of Andrew Gold's \\"Never Let Her Slip Away\\", coincidentally also originally from 1978. It reached No. 5, and stayed in the charts in the United Kingdom for a total of eleven weeks. After the success of these two singles, an album, Check Out the Groove, was released, reaching No. 26 in the UK Albums Chart. \\"I Wanna Stay with You\\" (a cover of the Gallagher and Lyle song) and \\"Lovesick\\", both from 1993, managed No. 28 and No. 62, respectively. In 1994, Undercover released a new single, \\"Best Friend\\", and their second album, Ain't No Stopping Us. The musical style of Undercover's interpretations is best described as cheerful and upbeat, incorporating into the song electronic drums and short piano or organ harmonies, along with repetitive and layered vocal phrases, typical for club songs of the 1990s. ==DiscographyStudio albums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:12em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\" Album details ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"5\\" Peak chart positions - ! style=\\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\\" UK UK chart peaks: * * * ! style=\\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\\"  AUT ! style=\\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\\" EUR European albums chart peaks: * ! style=\\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\\" GER German albums chart peaks: * ! style=\\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\\" NED - ! scope=\\"row\\" Check Out the Groove  * Released: 18 September 1992 * Label: PWL International * Formats: LP, CS, CD  26  29  73  56  34 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Ain't No Stopping Us  * Released: 1994 * Label: PWL International * Formats: LP, CS, CD  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî -  align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"15\\" style=\\"font-size:90%\\" \\"‚Äî\\" denotes items that did not chart or were not released in that territory. } ===Singles=== { style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:2em;\\" Year ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\" Title ! colspan=\\"10\\" Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:10em;\\" Certifications !rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:10em;\\" Album - ! style=\\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\\" UK ! style=\\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\\"  AUT ! style=\\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\\" BEL ! style=\\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\\" DEN Danish singles chart peaks: * * ! style=\\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\\" EUR European singles chart peaks: * * * ! style=\\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\\" GER German singles chart peaks: * * * ! style=\\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\\" IRE Note: User needs to click on the \\"Search Charts\\" tab.

Both votes were nonbinding, meaning the Cabinet does not have to abide by them.

Note that the integrals of exponents and odd powers of x are 0, due to odd symmetry. ===Integrals with a linear term in the argument of the exponent=== : \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\exp\\\\left( -{1 \\\\over 2} a x^2 + Jx\\\\right ) dx This integral can be performed by completing the square: : \\\\left( -{1 \\\\over 2} a x^2 + Jx\\\\right ) = -{1 \\\\over 2} a \\\\left ( x^2 - { 2 Jx \\\\over a } + { J^2 \\\\over a^2 } - { J^2 \\\\over a^2 } \\\\right ) = -{1 \\\\over 2} a \\\\left ( x - { J \\\\over a } \\\\right )^2 + { J^2 \\\\over 2a } Therefore: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\exp\\\\left( -{1 \\\\over 2} a x^2 + Jx\\\\right) \\\\, dx &= \\\\exp\\\\left( { J^2 \\\\over 2a } \\\\right ) \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\exp \\\\left [ -{1 \\\\over 2} a \\\\left ( x - { J \\\\over a } \\\\right )^2 \\\\right ] \\\\, dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] &= \\\\exp\\\\left( { J^2 \\\\over 2a } \\\\right )\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\exp\\\\left( -{1 \\\\over 2} a w^2 \\\\right) \\\\, dw \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] &= \\\\left ( {2\\\\pi \\\\over a } \\\\right ) ^{1\\\\over 2} \\\\exp\\\\left( { J^2 \\\\over 2a }\\\\right ) \\\\end{align} ===Integrals with an imaginary linear term in the argument of the exponent=== The integral : \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\exp\\\\left( -{1 \\\\over 2} a x^2 + iJx\\\\right ) dx = \\\\left ( {2\\\\pi \\\\over a } \\\\right ) ^{1\\\\over 2} \\\\exp\\\\left( -{ J^2 \\\\over 2a }\\\\right ) is proportional to the Fourier transform of the Gaussian where is the conjugate variable of . By again completing the square we see that the Fourier transform of a Gaussian is also a Gaussian, but in the conjugate variable. The larger is, the narrower the Gaussian in and the wider the Gaussian in . This is a demonstration of the uncertainty principle. This integral is also known as the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation used in field theory. ===Integrals with a complex argument of the exponent=== The integral of interest is (for an example of an application see Relation between Schr√∂dinger's equation and the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics) : \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\exp\\\\left( {1 \\\\over 2} i a x^2 + iJx\\\\right ) dx. We now assume that and may be complex. Completing the square : \\\\left( {1 \\\\over 2} i a x^2 + iJx\\\\right ) = {1\\\\over 2} ia \\\\left ( x^2 + {2Jx \\\\over a} + \\\\left ( { J \\\\over a} \\\\right )^2 - \\\\left ( { J \\\\over a} \\\\right )^2 \\\\right ) = -{1\\\\over 2} {a \\\\over i} \\\\left ( x + {J\\\\over a} \\\\right )^2 - { iJ^2 \\\\over 2a}. By analogy with the previous integrals : \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\exp\\\\left( {1 \\\\over 2} i a x^2 + iJx\\\\right ) dx = \\\\left ( {2\\\\pi i \\\\over a } \\\\right ) ^{1\\\\over 2} \\\\exp\\\\left( { -iJ^2 \\\\over 2a }\\\\right ). This result is valid as an integration in the complex plane as long as is non-zero and has a semi-positive imaginary part. See Fresnel integral. ==Gaussian integrals in higher dimensions== The one-dimensional integrals can be generalized to multiple dimensions. :\\\\int \\\\exp\\\\left( - \\\\frac 1 2 x \\\\cdot A \\\\cdot x +J \\\\cdot x \\\\right) d^nx = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{(2\\\\pi)^n}{\\\\det A}} \\\\exp \\\\left( {1\\\\over 2} J \\\\cdot A^{-1} \\\\cdot J \\\\right) Here is a real positive definite symmetric matrix. This integral is performed by diagonalization of with an orthogonal transformation :D= O^{-1} A O = O^T A O where is a diagonal matrix and is an orthogonal matrix. This decouples the variables and allows the integration to be performed as one-dimensional integrations. This is best illustrated with a two-dimensional example. ===Example: Simple Gaussian integration in two dimensions=== The Gaussian integral in two dimensions is :\\\\int \\\\exp\\\\left( - \\\\frac 1 2 A_{ij} x^i x^j \\\\right) d^2x = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{(2\\\\pi)^2}{\\\\det A}} where is a two-dimensional symmetric matrix with components specified as : A = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a&c;\\\\\\\\\\\\ c&b;\\\\end{bmatrix} and we have used the Einstein summation convention. Diagonalize the matrix The first step is to diagonalize the matrix. Note that :A_{ij} x^i x^j \\\\equiv x^TAx = x^T \\\\left(OO^T\\\\right) A \\\\left(OO^T\\\\right) x = \\\\left(x^TO \\\\right) \\\\left(O^TAO \\\\right) \\\\left(O^Tx \\\\right) where, since is a real symmetric matrix, we can choose to be orthogonal, and hence also a unitary matrix. can be obtained from the eigenvectors of . We choose such that: is diagonal. =Eigenvalues of A= To find the eigenvectors of one first finds the eigenvalues of given by : \\\\begin{bmatrix}a&c;\\\\\\\\\\\\ c&b;\\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} u\\\\\\\\\\\\ v \\\\end{bmatrix}=\\\\lambda \\\\begin{bmatrix}u\\\\\\\\\\\\ v\\\\end{bmatrix}. The eigenvalues are solutions of the characteristic polynomial :( a - \\\\lambda)( b-\\\\lambda) -c^2 = 0 :\\\\lambda^2 - \\\\lambda(a+b) + ab -c^2 = 0 which are found using the quadratic equation: : \\\\lambda_{\\\\pm} = {1\\\\over 2} ( a+b) \\\\pm {1\\\\over 2}\\\\sqrt{(a+b)^2-4(ab - c^2)}. : \\\\lambda_{\\\\pm} = {1\\\\over 2} ( a+b) \\\\pm {1\\\\over 2}\\\\sqrt{a^2 +2ab + b^2 -4ab + 4c^2}. : \\\\lambda_{\\\\pm} = {1\\\\over 2} ( a+b) \\\\pm {1\\\\over 2}\\\\sqrt{(a-b)^2+4c^2}. =Eigenvectors of A= Substitution of the eigenvalues back into the eigenvector equation yields : v = -{ \\\\left( a - \\\\lambda_{\\\\pm} \\\\right)u \\\\over c }, \\\\qquad v = -{cu \\\\over \\\\left( b - \\\\lambda_{\\\\pm} \\\\right)}. From the characteristic equation we know : {a - \\\\lambda_{\\\\pm} \\\\over c } = {c \\\\over b - \\\\lambda_{\\\\pm}}. Also note : { a - \\\\lambda_{\\\\pm} \\\\over c } = -{ b - \\\\lambda_{\\\\mp} \\\\over c}. The eigenvectors can be written as: :\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\eta}\\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\frac{a - \\\\lambda_-}{c\\\\eta} \\\\end{bmatrix}, \\\\qquad \\\\begin{bmatrix}-\\\\frac{b - \\\\lambda_+}{c\\\\eta} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\eta} \\\\end{bmatrix} for the two eigenvectors. Here is a normalizing factor given by :\\\\eta = \\\\sqrt{1 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{a - \\\\lambda_{-}}{c} \\\\right)^2 } = \\\\sqrt{1 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{b - \\\\lambda_{+}}{c} \\\\right)^2}. It is easily verified that the two eigenvectors are orthogonal to each other. =Construction of the orthogonal matrix= The orthogonal matrix is constructed by assigning the normalized eigenvectors as columns in the orthogonal matrix :O = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\eta} & -\\\\frac{b - \\\\lambda_{+}}{c \\\\eta} \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\frac{a - \\\\lambda_{-}}{c \\\\eta} &\\\\frac{1}{\\\\eta}\\\\end{bmatrix}. Note that . If we define : \\\\sin(\\\\theta) = -\\\\frac{a - \\\\lambda_{-}}{c \\\\eta } then the orthogonal matrix can be written :O = \\\\begin{bmatrix}\\\\cos(\\\\theta) & -\\\\sin(\\\\theta) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(\\\\theta) & \\\\cos(\\\\theta)\\\\end{bmatrix} which is simply a rotation of the eigenvectors with the inverse: :O^{-1} = O^T = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos(\\\\theta) & \\\\sin(\\\\theta) \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\sin(\\\\theta) & \\\\cos(\\\\theta) \\\\end{bmatrix}. =Diagonal matrix= The diagonal matrix becomes : D = O^T A O = \\\\begin{bmatrix}\\\\lambda_{-}&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\lambda_{+}\\\\end{bmatrix} with eigenvectors :\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\end{bmatrix}, \\\\qquad \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} =Numerical example= :A = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 2&1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 1\\\\end{bmatrix} The eigenvalues are :\\\\lambda_{\\\\pm} = {3\\\\over 2} \\\\pm {\\\\sqrt{ 5} \\\\over 2}. The eigenvectors are :{1\\\\over \\\\eta}\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ -{1\\\\over 2} - {\\\\sqrt{5} \\\\over 2}\\\\end{bmatrix}, \\\\qquad {1\\\\over \\\\eta} \\\\begin{bmatrix} {1\\\\over 2} + {\\\\sqrt{5} \\\\over 2 }\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} where :\\\\eta = \\\\sqrt{{5\\\\over 2} + {\\\\sqrt{5}\\\\over 2}}. Then :\\\\begin{align} O &= \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\eta} & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\eta} \\\\left({1\\\\over 2} + {\\\\sqrt{5} \\\\over 2}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\eta} \\\\left(-{1\\\\over 2} - {\\\\sqrt{ 5} \\\\over 2}\\\\right) & {1\\\\over \\\\eta}\\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\\\\\\\\ O^{-1} &= \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\eta} & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\eta} \\\\left(-{1\\\\over 2} - {\\\\sqrt{5} \\\\over 2}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\eta} \\\\left({1\\\\over 2} + {\\\\sqrt{5} \\\\over 2}\\\\right) & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\eta} \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\end{align} The diagonal matrix becomes :D = O^TAO = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\lambda_- &0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\lambda_+ \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} {3\\\\over 2} - {\\\\sqrt{5} \\\\over 2}& 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & {3\\\\over 2} + {\\\\sqrt{5} \\\\over 2}\\\\end{bmatrix} with eigenvectors :\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\end{bmatrix}, \\\\qquad \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} Rescale the variables and integrate With the diagonalization the integral can be written :\\\\int \\\\exp\\\\left( - \\\\frac 1 2 x^T A x \\\\right) d^2x = \\\\int \\\\exp\\\\left( - \\\\frac 1 2 \\\\sum_{j=1}^2 \\\\lambda_{j} y_j^2 \\\\right) \\\\, d^2y where :y = O^T x. Since the coordinate transformation is simply a rotation of coordinates the Jacobian determinant of the transformation is one yielding : dy^2 = dx^2 The integrations can now be performed. :\\\\begin{align} \\\\int \\\\exp\\\\left( - \\\\frac{1}{2} x^T A x \\\\right) d^2x &= \\\\int \\\\exp\\\\left( - \\\\frac 1 2 \\\\sum_{j=1}^2 \\\\lambda_{j} y_j^2 \\\\right) d^2y \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\prod_{j=1}^2 \\\\left( { 2\\\\pi \\\\over \\\\lambda_j } \\\\right)^{1\\\\over 2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\left( { (2\\\\pi)^2 \\\\over \\\\prod_{j=1}^2 \\\\lambda_j } \\\\right)^{1\\\\over 2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\left( { (2\\\\pi)^2 \\\\over \\\\det{ \\\\left( O^{-1}AO \\\\right)} } \\\\right)^{1\\\\over 2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\left( { (2\\\\pi)^2 \\\\over \\\\det{ \\\\left( A \\\\right)} } \\\\right)^{1\\\\over 2} \\\\end{align} which is the advertised solution. ===Integrals with complex and linear terms in multiple dimensions=== With the two-dimensional example it is now easy to see the generalization to the complex plane and to multiple dimensions. Integrals with a linear term in the argument :\\\\int \\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{1}{2} x \\\\cdot A \\\\cdot x +J \\\\cdot x \\\\right) d^nx = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{(2\\\\pi)^n}{\\\\det A}} \\\\exp \\\\left( {1\\\\over 2} J \\\\cdot A^{-1} \\\\cdot J \\\\right) Integrals with an imaginary linear term :\\\\int \\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{1}{2} x \\\\cdot A \\\\cdot x +iJ \\\\cdot x \\\\right) d^nx = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{(2\\\\pi)^n}{\\\\det A}} \\\\exp \\\\left( -{1\\\\over 2} J \\\\cdot A^{-1} \\\\cdot J \\\\right) Integrals with a complex quadratic term :\\\\int \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{i}{2} x \\\\cdot A \\\\cdot x +iJ \\\\cdot x \\\\right) d^nx =\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{(2\\\\pi i)^n}{\\\\det A}} \\\\exp \\\\left( -{i\\\\over 2} J \\\\cdot A^{-1} \\\\cdot J \\\\right) ===Integrals with differential operators in the argument=== As an example consider the integralZee, pp. 21-22. :\\\\int \\\\exp\\\\left[ \\\\int d^4x \\\\left (-\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\varphi \\\\hat A \\\\varphi + J \\\\varphi \\\\right) \\\\right ] D\\\\varphi where \\\\hat A is a differential operator with \\\\varphi and functions of spacetime, and D\\\\varphi indicates integration over all possible paths. In analogy with the matrix version of this integral the solution is :\\\\int \\\\exp\\\\left[ \\\\int d^4x \\\\left (-\\\\frac 1 2 \\\\varphi \\\\hat A \\\\varphi +J\\\\varphi \\\\right) \\\\right ] D\\\\varphi \\\\; \\\\propto \\\\; \\\\exp \\\\left( {1\\\\over 2} \\\\int d^4x \\\\; d^4y J(x) D( x - y) J(y) \\\\right) where :\\\\hat A D( x - y) = \\\\delta^4 ( x - y) and , called the propagator, is the inverse of \\\\hat A, and \\\\delta^4( x - y) is the Dirac delta function. Similar arguments yield :\\\\int \\\\exp\\\\left[\\\\int d^4x \\\\left (-\\\\frac 1 2 \\\\varphi \\\\hat A \\\\varphi + i J \\\\varphi \\\\right) \\\\right ] D\\\\varphi \\\\; \\\\propto \\\\; \\\\exp \\\\left( - { 1\\\\over 2} \\\\int d^4x \\\\; d^4y J(x) D( x - y) J(y) \\\\right), and :\\\\int \\\\exp\\\\left[ i \\\\int d^4x \\\\left ( \\\\frac 1 2 \\\\varphi \\\\hat A \\\\varphi + J\\\\varphi \\\\right) \\\\right ] D\\\\varphi \\\\; \\\\propto \\\\; \\\\exp \\\\left( -{ i\\\\over 2} \\\\int d^4x \\\\; d^4y J(x) D( x - y) J(y) \\\\right). See Path-integral formulation of virtual-particle exchange for an application of this integral. ==Integrals that can be approximated by the method of steepest descent== In quantum field theory n-dimensional integrals of the form :\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\exp\\\\left( -{1 \\\\over \\\\hbar} f(q) \\\\right ) d^nq appear often. Here \\\\hbar is the reduced Planck's constant and f is a function with a positive minimum at q=q_0. These integrals can be approximated by the method of steepest descent. For small values of Planck's constant, f can be expanded about its minimum :\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\exp\\\\left[ -{1 \\\\over \\\\hbar} \\\\left( f\\\\left( q_0 \\\\right) + {1\\\\over 2} \\\\left( q-q_0\\\\right)^2f^{\\\\prime \\\\prime} \\\\left( q-q_0\\\\right) + \\\\cdots \\\\right ) \\\\right] d^nq. Here f^{\\\\prime \\\\prime} is the n by n matrix of second derivatives evaluated at the minimum of the function. If we neglect higher order terms this integral can be integrated explicitly. :\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\exp\\\\left[ -{1 \\\\over \\\\hbar} (f(q)) \\\\right] d^nq \\\\approx \\\\exp\\\\left[ -{1 \\\\over \\\\hbar} \\\\left( f\\\\left( q_0 \\\\right) \\\\right ) \\\\right] \\\\sqrt{ (2 \\\\pi \\\\hbar )^n \\\\over \\\\det f^{\\\\prime \\\\prime} }. ==Integrals that can be approximated by the method of stationary phase== A common integral is a path integral of the form : \\\\int \\\\exp\\\\left( {i \\\\over \\\\hbar} S\\\\left( q, \\\\dot q \\\\right) \\\\right ) Dq where S\\\\left( q, \\\\dot q \\\\right) is the classical action and the integral is over all possible paths that a particle may take. In the limit of small \\\\hbar the integral can be evaluated in the stationary phase approximation. In this approximation the integral is over the path in which the action is a minimum. Therefore, this approximation recovers the classical limit of mechanics. ==Fourier integralsDirac delta distribution=== The Dirac delta distribution in spacetime can be written as a Fourier transformZee, p. 23. : \\\\int \\\\frac{d^4 k}{(2\\\\pi)^4} \\\\exp(ik ( x-y)) = \\\\delta^4 ( x-y). In general, for any dimension N : \\\\int \\\\frac{d^N k}{(2\\\\pi)^N} \\\\exp(ik ( x-y)) = \\\\delta^N ( x-y). ===Fourier integrals of forms of the Coulomb potential=== Laplacian of 1/r While not an integral, the identity in three-dimensional Euclidean space :-{1 \\\\over 4\\\\pi} abla^2 \\\\left( {1 \\\\over r} \\\\right) = \\\\delta \\\\left( \\\\mathbf r \\\\right) where :r^2 = \\\\mathbf r \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf r is a consequence of Gauss's theorem and can be used to derive integral identities. For an example see Longitudinal and transverse vector fields. This identity implies that the Fourier integral representation of 1/r is :\\\\int \\\\frac{d^3 k}{(2\\\\pi)^3} { \\\\exp \\\\left ( i\\\\mathbf k \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf r \\\\right) \\\\over k^2 } = {1 \\\\over 4 \\\\pi r }. Yukawa Potential: The Coulomb potential with mass The Yukawa potential in three dimensions can be represented as an integral over a Fourier transformZee, p. 26, 29. :\\\\int \\\\frac{d^3 k}{(2\\\\pi)^3} { \\\\exp \\\\left ( i\\\\mathbf k \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf r \\\\right) \\\\over k^2 +m^2 } = {e^{-mr} \\\\over 4 \\\\pi r } where :r^2 = \\\\mathbf{r} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf r, \\\\qquad k^2 = \\\\mathbf k \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf k. See Static forces and virtual- particle exchange for an application of this integral. In the small m limit the integral reduces to . To derive this result note: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\int \\\\frac{d^3 k}{(2\\\\pi)^3} \\\\frac{\\\\exp \\\\left (i \\\\mathbf k \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf r\\\\right)}{k^2 +m^2} &= \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{k^2 dk}{(2\\\\pi)^2} \\\\int_{-1}^1 du {e^{ikru}\\\\over k^2 + m^2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= {2\\\\over r} \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{k dk}{(2\\\\pi)^2} {\\\\sin(kr) \\\\over k^2 + m^2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= {1\\\\over ir} \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{k dk}{(2\\\\pi)^2} {e^{ikr} \\\\over k^2 + m^2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= {1\\\\over ir} \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{k dk}{(2\\\\pi)^2} {e^{ikr} \\\\over (k + i m)(k - i m)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= {1\\\\over ir} \\\\frac{2\\\\pi i}{(2\\\\pi)^2} \\\\frac{im}{2im} e^{-mr} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi r} e^{-mr} \\\\end{align} Modified Coulomb potential with mass :\\\\int \\\\frac{d^3 k}{(2\\\\pi)^3} \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{k}}\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{r}}\\\\right)^2 \\\\frac{\\\\exp \\\\left (i\\\\mathbf{k} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{r} \\\\right)}{k^2 +m^2} = \\\\frac{e^{-mr}}{4 \\\\pi r} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{1 + \\\\frac{2}{mr} - \\\\frac{2}{(mr)^2} \\\\left(e^{mr}-1 \\\\right) \\\\right \\\\\\\\} where the hat indicates a unit vector in three dimensional space.

For applications of this integral see Darwin Lagrangian and Darwin interaction in a vacuum. Angular integration in cylindrical coordinates There are two important integrals. The angular integration of an exponential in cylindrical coordinates can be written in terms of Bessel functions of the first kind p. 113 :\\\\int_0^{2 \\\\pi} {d\\\\varphi \\\\over 2 \\\\pi} \\\\exp\\\\left( i p \\\\cos( \\\\varphi) \\\\right)=J_0 (p) and :\\\\int_0^{2 \\\\pi} {d\\\\varphi \\\\over 2 \\\\pi} \\\\cos( \\\\varphi) \\\\exp\\\\left( i p \\\\cos( \\\\varphi) \\\\right) = i J_1 (p). For applications of these integrals see Magnetic interaction between current loops in a simple plasma or electron gas. ==Bessel functionsIntegration of the cylindrical propagator with mass=== First power of a Bessel function :\\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} {k\\\\; dk \\\\over k^2 +m^2} J_0 \\\\left( kr \\\\right)=K_0 (mr). See Abramowitz and Stegun. Section 11.4.44 For mr \\\\ll 1 , we haveJackson, p. 116 :K_0 (mr) \\\\to -\\\\ln \\\\left( {mr \\\\over 2}\\\\right) + 0.5772. For an application of this integral see Two line charges embedded in a plasma or electron gas. Squares of Bessel functions The integration of the propagator in cylindrical coordinates is :\\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} {k\\\\; dk \\\\over k^2 +m^2} J_1^2 (kr) =I_1 (mr)K_1 (mr). For small mr the integral becomes :\\\\int_o^{\\\\infty} {k\\\\; dk \\\\over k^2 +m^2} J_1^2 (kr) \\\\to {1\\\\over 2 }\\\\left[ 1 - {1\\\\over 8} (mr)^2 \\\\right]. For large mr the integral becomes :\\\\int_o^{\\\\infty} {k\\\\; dk \\\\over k^2 +m^2} J_1^2 (kr) \\\\to {1\\\\over 2} \\\\left( {1\\\\over mr}\\\\right). For applications of this integral see Magnetic interaction between current loops in a simple plasma or electron gas. In general :\\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} {k\\\\; dk \\\\over k^2 +m^2} J_{ u}^2 (kr) = I_{ u} (mr)K_{ u} (mr) \\\\qquad \\\\Re ( u) > -1. ===Integration over a magnetic wave function=== The two-dimensional integral over a magnetic wave function isAbramowitz and Stegun, Section 11.4.28 :{2 a^{2n+2}\\\\over n!} \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} { dr }\\\\;r^{2n+1}\\\\exp\\\\left( -a^2 r^2\\\\right) J_{0} (kr) = M\\\\left( n+1, 1, -{k^2 \\\\over 4a^2}\\\\right). Here, M is a confluent hypergeometric function.

The set was written by Ed Greenwood and published by TSR. It featured box cover art by Brom. and was published in 1991. ==Contents== The set consists of a 128-page booklet titled Campaign Guide to Undermountain, a 32-page booklet titled Undermountain Adventures, 8 double-sided loose-leaf monster statistics pages, 8 double-sided heavy-stock \\"adventure aid\\" cards, and 4 color fold-out poster maps. It uses the same Brom cover art as the box cover itself, with interior art by Karl Waller and cartography by Diesel, Steve Beck, and David Sutherland. This book contains detailed information on the dungeon Undermountain, including non-player characters (such as Halaster Blackcloak) that can be encountered within the dungeons or in the city above it, as well as spells and magic items that can be found. The book also keys the maps to what can be found in various locations, and contains expansion guidelines for creating future adventures and deeper parts of the dungeon. The set provides the \\"first three levels of the original dungeon of Undermountain, beneath the city of Waterdeep\\". The entire Ruins of Undermountain is purported to be the \\"deepest dungeon of them all\\" with nine levels and fourteen sub- levels. It contains two books describing the Undermountain complex. The larger is the Campaign Guide to Undermountain. It includes Undermountain history and other related information. The second book contains adventures, monster descriptions, maps, and other products. There are over 350 rooms per level, but not all are detailed: \\"even with approximately 25 areas of interest on the first level, 26 on the second level, and none on the third, a remarkably high percentage of rooms are left completely undetailed\\". The Undermountain Adventures booklet describes seven adventures designed to be used within Undermountain, but can be used in any dungeon. The booklet also contains a \\"Monster Guide\\" of statblocks and descriptions of monsters not otherwise featured in the boxed set, and a description of the city of Skullport. The booklet has a detached cover, with cover art by Jeff Easley, and maps of some of the encounters on the inside, with cartography by David Sutherland. The monster sheets detail 11 monsters in the Monstrous Compendium style: elder orb beholder, death kiss beholder-kin, darktentacles, ibrandlin, scaladar, sharn, slithermorph, flying snakes (flying fang and deathfang), steel shadow, and watchghost. The cards are adventure aids for the Dungeon Master, detailing traps, encounters, treasure, and sundries that can be placed in the midst of adventures. The maps detail the first three levels of the ruins of Undermountain; level three takes up two of the maps. ==Publication history== Shannon Appelcline commented that \\"The Ruins of Undermountain (1991), located under the City of Waterdeep, was one of the first real \\"mega\\" dungeons ‚Äî though it trailed Greyhawk's own offering, Greyhawk Ruins, by a year.\\" ==Reception== The adventure was ranked the 17th greatest adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine for the 30th anniversary of the Dungeons & Dragons game in 2004. Keith Eisenbeis reviewed the module in the February 1992 issue of White Wolf Magazine. He noted the appearance of the product materials, especially the maps, as exceptional, but the remainder of lesser quality. Overall, he rated the product a 3 out of a possible 5. ==References== * Greenwood, Ed.

The clashes started on 7 September and lasted nearly two weeks, ending on 17 September. Some 1,000 people were killed during the riots. ==Causes== Religious and ethnic conflicts have repeatedly occurred in Jos due to the city's geographical placement in Nigeria. Jos, the capital of Plateau State, is located in the middle of the country, which lies between the predominantly Muslim north and the predominantly Christian south. Jos was also known for its job opportunities leading people from around Nigeria to move there for employment. The influx of people led to tensions between members of \\"indigene\\" (indigenous) ethnic groups and non-indigene ethnic groups (often referred to as \\"settlers\\"). In June 2001 the federal government appointed a Hausa Muslim politician, Alhaji Muktar Mohammed, as local coordinator of the federal poverty alleviation program, leading indigene Christians to protest his appointment. Tensions turned violent on 7 September 2001, when a Christian woman attempted to cross a barricaded street outside a mosque during Friday prayers. It led to a conflict between her and a group of Muslims. The fight eventually spread to other parts of the city. ==Riots== Fighting spread through various Jos neighborhoods and to surrounding communities. Property and even human beings were set on fire. Many houses, shops, mosques and churches were burned or damaged. Torched cars were left along the streets after the clashes. Christian leaders reported that Muslims spontaneously attacked Christians and burned churches, including three churches of the Church of Christ in Nigeria (presently known as, 'Church of Christ in Nations' COCIN), the main Assemblies of God church, and a Jos Apostolic Church. The military was eventually deployed and stopped the violence. Local sources said the military's intervention and strict enforcement of the curfew helped end the clashes. ==Aftermath== A hospitalized gunshot victim (left) from the 2001 Jos Riots The 10 days of violence left approximately 1,000 dead.Nigeria Christian and Muslim conflict timeline  Timetoast timelines. Timetoast.com. Because of the large number of people killed in the clashes, a mass burial had to be arranged. The riots caused the displacement of at least 50,000 civilians. The authorities arrested several hundred people and set up a commission of inquiry, which identified people who were allegedly involved in the violence, but no one was successfully prosecuted. ==See also== *2008 Jos riots *2010 Jos riots ==References== Jos riots Category:2001 riots Category:Political riots Category:Religious riots in Nigeria Category:Jos Category:Attacks on religious buildings and structures in Nigeria Category:September 2001 events in Africa ","title":"2001 Jos riots"},{"id":"20488149","text":"J√©r√¥me Chartier (born 14 November 1966) was a member of the National Assembly of France from 2002 to 2017. He represented the Val-d'Oise department, and was a member of The Republicans. == Family origins and studies == He was born in a catholic family and spent his childhood in the Paris area, between Paris and Domont (Val-d‚ÄôOise). When a teenager, he committed himself to the service of other people, as a member of the scout movement or as an instructor for the Red Cross Children‚Äôs Hospital in Margency (Val-d‚ÄôOise) . After graduating from the Sarcelles secondary school, he entered Paris V University. As he was interested in social sciences, he passed a double diploma in sociology and linguistics, then a public administration bachelor's degree and a political sciences master's degree. Then in 1990, he went to the ESSEC where he studied Urban Economics, which increased his awareness of issues and values in cities and territories. == Professional career == Parallel to his studies, he has always earned his living thanks to student‚Äôs jobs, -for instance in the Domont Driving school-, and freelance contribution to news papers such as La Gazette du Val-d‚ÄôOise or to free radio stations. After that, he became a half time parliamentary assistant for a Senator, then general secretary of the group of independent senators from 1989 to 1992. In 1993, after his military service, and when he graduated from the ESSEC, he joined a counsel agency as a project manager before becoming a mission manager. This was for him the opportunity to discover the political marketing techniques of the American campaigns. 1995 is the landmark of both his election as the mayor of Domont (Val-d‚ÄôOise, 15000 inhabitants) and his active commitment in Jacques Chirac‚Äôs successful presidential campaign. His election at the age of 28 made him one of the youngest mayors of France. That same year, he was also elected President of the association for the new developments in the area of ‚Äúl‚ÄôOuest de la Plaine de France‚Äù, before becoming the president of the urban community of ‚Äúl‚ÄôOuest de la Plaine de France‚Äù in 2001. Anxious to preserve his professional activity in the private sector, he created his own consultancy office, C and C, in 1997and worked successively for investment funds, industrial groups and management societies. In 2000, he parted with his office to create a participation holding society with some partners. He sold it in turn in 2002 after his election at the Parliament to be free to commit himself entirely to his political activities. He was equally in charge of responsibilities within the RPR, and notably became its Secretary for the Val-d‚ÄôOise, which is the 10th French federation and was at the same time in charge of the federations. He took an active part in the creation of the UMP and was in charge of the development of the professional federations. He created 21 federations within 6 months, gathering up to 8500 members. == Political Commitment == In 2002 J√©r√¥me Chartier appeared on the political national scene: on 16 June 2002 he was elected deputy of the 7th constituency in Val-d‚ÄôOise (townships of Domont, Ecouen, Montmorency, Sarcelles Sud-Ouest) with almost 58% of the votes. He sits in Parliament in the UMP Group. As a member of the Finance Commission he is in charge of the budgetary follow up of state fields: he was appointed official recorder of the Home Office funds (2002-2004), of the Foreign Office (2004-2008) and of the mission for Economy. He notably became official recorder for the Finance Commission for 4 laws: concerning the protection of business companies (2003) the opening up of the DCN capital (2004), the purchasing power (2007) and the bank and financial regulation (2010).Being recognized as a specialist of budgetary matters, he became the UMP Group spokesman on the State budget in 2007. He also got involved in the modernization of French institutions and political life. In 2002 he initiated the creation of a Group of reflection on the modernization of political life and gathered over a hundred members of Parliament of all tendencies. He presided over it until it disappeared in July 2008 after the vote of the constitutional law. On 22 April 2004, the anniversary of the presidential election first ballot, he gave over to the National Assembly President 15 propositions put forward by his group. To continue this reflection, in September 2005, he published Le lifting de Marianne, 50 propositions (l‚ÄôArchipel), which benefited from a fairly exceptional success for a political book. He suggested propositions for the evolution of the V¬∞ republic institutions. Then, in January 2006, he initiated the Convention for the V¬∞ Republic, passing references to Arnaud Montebourg‚Äôs Convention for the VI¬∞ Republic. His propositions were positively greeted notably by Nicolas Sarkozy during his 2007 presidential campaign. He was reelected deputy of Val-d‚ÄôOise on 17 June 2007 with nearly 57% of the votes (48% on the first ballot). His commitment in the constitutional debate had been such that, in 2008, he was appointed spokesman of the UMP group for the discussion of the law reforming the constitution of the V¬∞ Republic which was voted by the Congress in July 2008. Within the UMP group, he furthered a certain number of propositions and ideas of reforms in economical and social areas: in 2007 he was, notably, the author of a report on social VAT which will be at the origin of the ‚Äúpurchasing power VAT‚Äù concept. He became then in charge, within the presidential party, of the debate on purchasing power. In January 2008, he was appointed National Secretary of the UMP, in charge of the reforms follow up, then in September 2008, national spokesman on the reforms for the UMP group. In March 2009, Xavier Bertrand, National Secretary appointed him as National Secretary in charge of the public finances and the tax system.

Paddock Lake was named for him. == Background == Francis Paddock was born in Camillus, Onondaga County, New York, on September 15, 1814. He was the eldest of six children and took his education seriously from an early age, starting to teach at age seventeen. He attended Fairfield Medical College with the goal of becoming a physician.Curfman, R. J. (1986). The Paddock genealogy: Descendants of Robert Paddock of Plymouth Colony, blacksmith and constable, 1646. Fort Collins, Colo: Curfman, pp. 136‚Äì137. Fairfield Medical College was the first medical school west of the Hudson River.New York State Museum, & New York (State). (1842). Natural history of New York. Bulletin of the New York State Museum of Natural History, 66. New York: D. Appleton. He later received an appointment with a Dr. Hamilton of Auburn, allowing him to pursue his medical endeavors. == Life in Wisconsin == In 1838, at the age of twenty-five and finished with his medical education, Paddock and his family, three generations of it, traveled west from New York in a covered wagon to what was then the Wisconsin Territory. On the way, he passed Chicago and described it as \\"a marsh with a few Indian huts scattered here and there.\\" He and his family settled between two lakes now known as Paddock and Hooker Lakes in the town of Salem in Kenosha County, Wisconsin (now the village of Salem Lakes, Wisconsin). The eldest member of the group, David Paddock, Francis's grandfather, was a Revolutionary War veteran and died shortly after the trip. He was called 'Blind David' because he was blinded from powder burn injuries he sustained during the war. Starting their new life, the Paddock family was able to purchase about of land from the government at $1.50 an acre and built a log cabin on the land. On August 19, 1841, he married Martha Cecilla Munson. They had fourteen children together, nine of whom survived to adulthood with five dying in childhood. Paddock was the first medical professional in the area. However, he was a man of multiple trades. Not only a physician, he was also a businessman and a farmer. He ended up becoming one of the wealthiest and most influential members of his community. In 1843, he acquired of land from the U.S. Land Patent Office. He became well known and respected for his expertise in treating fevers and also for his large cattle herd. The Paddock farm had between 1500 and 2000 sheep and at one time over 100 cows and perhaps as many horses. Paddock was an example of the typical country doctor, having to ride horseback for miles in all kinds of Wisconsin weather. He carried medicines in saddlebags and had howling wolves following him during the winter months. Paddock would store his medicines on shelves in the pantry. Sometimes when his supplies got low, he would divide up what was left among patients. If someone needed a tooth pulled, he would do the job for 25 cents. One night he delivered a baby at a home that did not have a candle. He solved the problem by putting grease in a dish, placing a rag in it and lighting it. Concerned with providing his children the best education possible, Paddock's land became the site of the Paddock school house, which was built in 1843. The building still stands as a house next to Brass Ball Fruit Stand in Salem Lakes, Wisconsin. When there was a lack of funds to pay a teacher, he often kept a teacher in the house for his own children, as well as the neighbor children, and paid the salary himself. He converted the front room of his home into a school room for this purpose. == Public office == From 1842 to 1844, he was the supervisor of the town of Salem. He also served his town as the Commissioner of Schools and Justice of the Peace. He was elected on the Republican ticket to represent Kenosha County in the Wisconsin State Senate for the 1855 session. He ran for the Assembly in 1873, but lost to Reform Party candidate Robert S. Houston. == Death == Paddock died on March 29, 1889 in his home in Salem and was laid to rest in Salem Cemetery. In 1960, the hamlet known as Paddock Lake in the Town of Salem was approved to separate from Salem and The Village of Paddock Lake was created. ==NotesReferences== *Brass Ball Mobil and Burger King Web Site - Salem History Section *Curfman, R.

He played in Major League Baseball as an outfielder for the Chicago Cubs. ==Baseball career== Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Brooks began his professional baseball career in 1924 with the Columbus Senators of the Tri-State League where he had 195 hits in 145 games for a .342 batting average. His major-league debut came at the relatively advanced age of 27 on May 30, 1925. He reached 25 career RBI in 17 games, the fewest games for any major league player since the statistic came into existence in 1920, as per the Elias Sports Bureau. In his first 25 major league games he posted a .398 batting average along with 32 runs batted in and a 1.246 on-base plus slugging percentage. Brooks went on to be a regular for the Cubs that season, playing the second-most games of any outfielder. Every one of his defensive appearances came in center field. It was a rather successful rookie campaign; Brooks trailed only future Hall of Fame member Gabby Hartnett for the club's lead in home runs with 14, good enough to finish tenth in the entire National League in that category. Brooks was also second on the Cubs in runs batted in (72) and slugging percentage (.513). He finished his first season with a respectable .281 batting average. Brooks, however, fell victim to the Cubs' acquisition of star outfielder Hack Wilson and found himself all but useless in the 1926 season. He played his final game for the Cubs on June 22 of that year, finishing his final big- league campaign with modest marks of 1 home run, a .188 batting average, and 6 RBI. Brooks returned to the minor leagues where he played for a number of teams before retiring in 1931 at the age of 33. ==Career statistics== In a two-year major league career, Brooks played in 116 games, accumulating 107 hits in 397 at bats for a .270 career batting average along with 15 home runs, 78 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .316. His career fielding percentage of .979 was higher than the league average of .967. In eight minor league seasons, Brooks had a .300 career batting average. ==Death== Brooks died on December 6, 1976 in Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin. ==References Category:1897 births Category:1962 deaths Category:Baseball players from Wisconsin Category:Chicago Cubs players Category:Major League Baseball outfielders Category:Sportspeople from Milwaukee ","title":"Mandy Brooks"},{"id":"20488219","text":"Laurent H√©nart (born 15 October 1968) was a member of the National Assembly of France.

It employs 18 people and specializes in the sale of complete IT solutions to SMEs in the Savoy. He became vice president of the service sector of the CGPME of Haute- Savoie, and President from November 2005 to January 2007. He resigned to run for the 2007 French legislative election. Although new to politics, he was elected on 17 June 2007, for the XIIIth legislature (2007‚Äì2012), in the second district of Haute-Savoie, beating the second round, the incumbent Bernard Bosson (New Centre) with 55.51% of the vote. He is committed to Cumul des mandats. His election against a leading political figure can be explained by the informal support he enjoyed from many elected officials of the UMP, opposed to Mr. Bosson for his support of Nicolas Sarkozy during the presidential election. Although labeled \\"a member of the right\\", however he sits in the UMP, in the National Assembly. He is a member of the Committee on Economic Affairs and Vice President of SMB. He noted the 18 October 2007, during the budget debate in 2008, by an amendment to the heads of SMEs to reduce their ISF up to the amounts they invest for five years in society. This provision has raised some concerns in the ranks of the left, and among the UMP. He is Chairman of the Working Group on payment periods in the context of the law on the modernization of the economy. In 2009, during discussions on the Creation and Internet law (HADOPI law), he was the member for the Presidential Majority, investing most actively against the principle of flexible response, with technical and legal arguments, both in the chamber and the media. Part of the arguments were taken up by the Constitutional Council, in the revision of the law. He opposed the revised bill. In 2011, he proposed a \\"freedom of panorama\\" amendment, which was defeated. On 30 June 2010, he took part in the hearing of Raymond Domenech by Parliament about the World Cup in South Africa.

He currently drives in the FIA European Rallycross Championship and occasionally in the FIA World Rallycross Championship. Tommy is the son of former well known Norwegian racer Ola Rustad. ==Racing careerEarly Rallycross Years=== Rustad started his motor sport career in karting before racing in the Norwegian Rallycross Championship, winning the so-called Supernasjonal title for six years in a row between 1987 and 1992. On 14 June 1992 he claimed overall victory in the Irish round of the European Rallycross Championship at Mondello Park, racing one of the two 650bhp strong Ford RS200 Group B cars of his compatriot and mentor Martin Schanche. ===Single Seaters=== In 1993 he switched to circuit racing, becoming the Swedish Formula Opel Champion in his first year. He drove in the Formula Opel Euroseries in 1994, finishing fifth in points, and finished sixth in the 1995 Eurocup Formula Renault. In 1996 he was in the Italian Formula Three Championship finishing ninth, and the Renault Spider Eurocup, finishing second in his first year, and was champion in 1997. ===BTCC=== In 1998 Rustad got a drive in the British Touring Car Championship. He drove a Renault Laguna for the DC Cook Motorsport team in the Michelin Independents Cup, despite getting some backing from the Renault works team. With five class wins throughout the seasons, he was crowned independent champion. A sixteenth place overall finish saw him one place ahead of works Peugeot driver Tim Harvey. ===STCC=== Rustad driving a Volvo C30 at Falkenbergs Motorbana. Since his drive in the BTCC, he has spent most of his career driving in the Swedish Touring Car Championship. He was champion in both the STCC and the Norwegian Touring Car Championship in 2000, driving a works Nissan Primera. After this he spent a couple of seasons racing in the European Touring Car Championship, before returning to Sweden in 2003 in an Opel Astra. After another rallycross year he returned to the STCC Opel Team in 2007. 2008 had him drive a works Volvo C30 powered by bio-ethanol for Polestar Racing. He went on to win the championship for the second time in 2009 for Polestar. ===WTCC=== Rustad became the first Norwegian to drive in the World Touring Car Championship when his Polestar Racing team entered rounds 15 and 16 of the 2009 season at Brands Hatch. Rustad retired from both races. ===Rallycross=== Rustad competing in the 2014 World RX of Great Britain In 2006 Rustad went back to rallycross for one year, forming a team with his compatriot Sverre Isachsen for to compete in the FIA European Championships for Rallycross Drivers where he eventually finished third overall with a Ford Focus T16 4x4. After his retirement from tarmac racing, Rustad took the decision to return full-time to rallycross in 2013, driving a Volvo S40 Mk1 in all the rounds of the Norwegian Rallycross Championship for SuperNational cars with an engine capacity of over 2000cc. He was also seen in the two Scandinavian rounds (Norway and Sweden) of the 2013 European Rallycross Championship, driving a rented Volvo C30 SuperCar. In 2014 he participated in six of the twelve rounds of the inaugural FIA World Rallycross Championship, again racing a Volvo C30 SuperCar, but with little success. However, while finishing 27th of the final WorldRX standings only his sixth place overall in the EuroRX series was a much better result. For 2015 he was entrusted by his sponsor with a competitive VW Polo Mk5 SuperCar of the Volkswagen Team Marklund Motorsport, which he used successfully to claim his first European Rallycross title. Of the five rounds counting towards the EuroRX series Rustad won three, beating his strongest competitor J√©r√¥me Grosset-Janin from France to second place. ==Racing recordComplete British Touring Car Championship results=== (key) (Races in bold indicate pole position ‚Äì 1 point awarded all races) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap) (* signifies that driver lead feature race for at least one lap ‚Äì 1 point awarded) {  style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:85%\\" !

January 10, 1943. _Miocene Fishes of Southern California_ The Society p 104-115 ==Description and taxonomy== In life, the Euzaphlegidae would have borne a superficial resemblance to mackerels or wahoo, leading some researchers to place them within the Scombridae or Cybiidae, respectively. However, X-ray analysis of the bone structure strongly suggests a relationship with the snake-mackerels, with some experts placing them within the Gempylidae.Mikko's Phylogeny Archive Gempylidae ==Ecology and anatomy== The sharp teeth and mackerel-like forms strongly suggest that the euzaphlegids were predators, verified by the remains of numerous extinct deep sea smelt, Bathylagus, and herring, Xyne grex, found within the stomachs of several specimens of Thyrsocles and Euzaphleges. Researcher Lore Rose David proposed that, because the Euzaphlegidae were comparatively less adapted to a pelagic lifestyle like the gempylids, but had slender skeletons suggesting of a deep-water lifestyle, the Euzaphlegidae lived in deep, offshore communities near the ocean floor, where they preyed on other fish. David also suggested that the Euzaphlegidae presence in Miocene California excluded the gempylids from establishing themselves there at the time, while the presence of scombrids in shallower water ecosystems prevented the Euzaphlegidae from establishing themselves in shallow water. ==Taxonomy== Originally, the family Euzaphlegidae (synonym=Zaphlegidae) originally described containing only the three to four genera from Late Miocene Southern California strata. Later, the genus Palimphyes, whose 10 species are found in Paleogene Tethys and Paratethys strata from the Swiss Alps, the Carpathians, Caucasus, Iran, India and Turkmenistan, was placed within Euzaphlegidae as the subfamily Dipterichthyinae (named after a junior synonym, Dipterichthys). Recently, a new genus, Veronaphleges, was found and described from Monte Bolca, representing one of the very few mesopelagic fish known from that lagerst√§tte. Veronaphleges apparently is a basal form that can not be grouped in either subfamily. ==Extinction== The family originates in the Paratethys during the Paleocene, and becomes widespread throughout the Tethys and Paratethys Oceans, until the Late Oligocene, when the genus Palimphyes disappears from the fossil record. Euzaphlegids would survive in deep water habitats of what is now Southern California, where they became mesopelagic predators ecologically similar to their relatives, the snake mackerels and escolars. During the time of the Late Miocene, Southern California had a very warm, tropical climate. The transition from Late Miocene to Early Pliocene saw the climate cool, and this cooling event drove the surviving Euzaphlegidae and several other (locally) endemic fish species, such as the manefish Chalcidichthys and the spinyfin Absalomichthys, into extinction. This cooling event, coupled with the survival of the scombrids in southern Californian marine ecosystems, also helped prevent gempylids from replacing the Euzaphlegidae during the Pliocene or Pleistocene. ==See also== * List of prehistoric bony fish ==References== Category:Prehistoric ray-finned fish families Category:Paleocene fish Category:Eocene fish Category:Oligocene fish Category:Miocene fish Category:Miocene extinctions Category:Paleocene first appearances ","title":"Euzaphlegidae"},{"id":"20488314","text":"Liga Deportiva Universitaria de Cuenca is a football club based in Cuenca, Ecuador currently in the Second Category Ecuadorian football Championship. ==Honors== *Championship Champion Provincial Azuay (4): 2004, 2005, 2007, 2010 *Serie B (1): 1977 -E1 *Runner up of the Series B of Ecuador (1): 1980 -E1 *Runner up Second Category (2): 1986, 1988 Category:Football clubs in Ecuador Category:Association football clubs established in 1972 Category:Cuenca, Ecuador Category:1972 establishments in Ecuador ","title":"L.D.U.

It was originally established in 1974 as the Center of Higher Military Education. The college is named after the former Lebanese Army commander-in-chief and former Lebanese president Fuad Chehab. ==History== The LAF CSC was founded on September 1, 1974 under the name Center of Higher Military Education and headquartered at the LAF headquarters in Yarze, it was later renamed on January 24, 1980 into College of Higher Military Education, ultimately it was called Command & Staff College on August 18, 1983 and headquartered since then at the town of Rihania. As of October 10, 2005, the name of General Fuad Chehab was added to the name of the college as way to honor him. ==Mission== The LAF CSC prepares officers of different arms to exercise command over tactical, logistic units or administration services. It also prepares officers to fulfill staff function at different levels. Moreover, it organizes training periods for acquisition of staff techniques. The CSC also increases the officers' ability to better fulfill their missions by deepening their knowledge through studies and researches. In addition, the college carries out researches, in favor of the army command, into some subjects of military strategy that might interest the national defense. ==Courses== The initial training is three years at the Military Academy, on the third year an application course takes place, for some officers this course is followed abroad. The higher courses are taken after the initial training, depending on the track of each individual: # Captains‚Äô course: obligatory trainings for 3 months. # Battalion Commander course: obligatory trainings for 4 months followed in the CSC. # Staff course: selection based on competitive examination, lasts for 11 months and is followed in the CSC. ==Applications== The college employs Janus tactical simulator in its courses, which was officially ready for use in 2006. The simulator is used to train the major units' staff commanders and the officers enrolled for battalion commander and staff courses in the CSC, for fields skills and up to Brigade level command. This is done by making simulations on various changing tactical combat conditions, and experience them on assessing the combat situation under various realistic and pressuring conditions, while taking into account the practical application of the staff theories, techniques, and knowledge. In addition to conducting training on decision making and giving orders at the right time in the right place for the commanded units. ==Emblem== Each symbol on the emblem of the Command and Staff College represents a specific ideal for a member of the Army: * Two spread Swords: Symbol of the officer‚Äôs command * Two palms: Eternal vitality and generosity * The Cedar: symbol of Lebanon: in all circumstances, it remains green and at the top for good * The Flaming torch: Symbol of sacrifice and martyr ==See also== * Lebanese Armed Forces * Lebanese Army Military Academy ==References== Category:Lebanese Army Academies ","title":"Fouad Shehab Command and Staff College"},{"id":"20488334","text":"Louis Joachim Marie Fran√ßois Giscard d'Estaing (born 20 October 1958) is a French politician and former member of the National Assembly of France.

The women collected a burial society payout, a type of life insurance, on each death, and it was eventually found that they had been committing murders using arsenic to obtain the insurance money. Though Catherine Flannagan evaded police for a time, both sisters were eventually caught and convicted of one of the murders; they were both hanged on the same day at Kirkdale Prison. Modern investigation of the crime has raised the possibility that Flannagan and Higgins were known or believed by investigators to be only part of a larger conspiracy of murder-for-profit‚Äîa network of \\"black widows\\"‚Äîbut no convictions were ever obtained for any of the alleged conspiracy members other than the two sisters. ==Deaths== In the early 1880s, unmarried sisters Catherine and Margaret FlannaganReferences spell the last name both \\"Flannagan\\" and \\"Flanagan\\", but most use two Ns. ran a rooming house at 5 Skirving Street, Liverpool. The household in the final months of 1880 consisted of the two sisters, Catherine's son John, and two lodger families ‚Äì hod carrier Thomas Higgins and his daughter Mary, and Patrick Jennings and his daughter Margaret. John Flannagan, 22 and previously healthy, died suddenly in December 1880. His death did not raise any particular comment; Catherine collected ¬£71 (worth roughly ¬£ in 2012 pounds) from the burial society with which he had been registered and he was interred shortly thereafter. By 1882, a romance had sprung up between Margaret and lodger Thomas Higgins. The pair married in October of that year. Thomas's daughter Mary, 8, died within months of the wedding after a short illness. Once again, the burial society payout was collected upon death, this time by Margaret Higgins. In January 1883, Margaret Jennings, 19, died. Her burial payout was collected by Catherine. In the face of neighbourhood gossip about the death rate in the home, Catherine, Margaret, and ThomasSources are unclear about the point at which Patrick Jennings left the household, but he is not among the deaths attributed to it. moved their household to 105 Latimer Street and then again to 27 Ascot street. In September 1883, Thomas Higgins, then 45, became yet another member of the household to fall mysteriously ill. His stomach pains were severe enough that Doctor Whitford was called; the doctor attributed Higgins's illness to dysentery related to drinking cheap whiskey and prescribed opium and castor oil. Higgins died after two days of illness. Days later, the same doctor was contacted and asked to provide a death certificate. He did so, attributing the death to dysentery. ==Investigation== Though Thomas Higgins's death by apparent dysentery raised no questions for the attending doctor, Higgins's brother Patrick was surprised to hear that his brother, who had been strong and in good general health, could have succumbed so easily to illness. When he also discovered that his brother has been insured with five different burial societies, which left his widow with a profit of around ¬£100, he pursued the matter with the authorities. A postmortem examination was ordered on Higgins's body. To the surprise of mourners, the coroner arrived at the home to perform the examination during the wake being held there for Higgins. Catherine Flannagan, upon hearing that a full autopsy was to be performed, fled the home. When a full autopsy of Higgins's body was carried out, evidence of arsenic poisoning was found: Higgins's organs showed traces of arsenic, in quantities indicating the poisoning had taken place over several days. Evidence from the home, including \\"a bottle containing a mystery white substance and a market pocket worn by [Margaret]\\" was examined by poison expert Dr Campbell Brown, who verified the presence of arsenic ‚Äì dust in Margaret's pocket, and an arsenic solution (containing unusual adulterants) in the bottle. Margaret Higgins was arrested immediately; Catherine, after moving from one boarding house to another to avoid police for nearly a week, was taken into custody in Wavertree. On 16 October 1883, the sisters were formally charged with the murder of Thomas Higgins. Orders for the bodies of the previously-deceased members of the household to be exhumed were issued when it became clear that arsenic was the mechanism of Thomas Higgins's death. The bodies of John Flannagan, Mary Higgins, and Margaret Jennings all showed evidence of minimal deterioration ‚Äì a quality associated with arsenic poisoning ‚Äì and traces of arsenic were found in the remains of all three. Investigators initially assumed that the arsenic used to poison the victims had come from rat poison, but when common adulterants used in rat poison failed to show up in autopsies, they were forced to come up with a new theory. It was unlikely that the illiterate sisters would have been able to acquire arsenic through the usual method of visiting a chemist, a route more open to doctors than spinsters. Eventually it was discovered that common flypaper at the time contained arsenic, and that by soaking the flypaper in water, a solution substantially identical ‚Äì including the same adulterants ‚Äì to that found in a bottle at the Higgins residence could be obtained. ==Aftermath== At the time of her arrest, Catherine claimed to her solicitor that the murders the sisters committed were not isolated, and provided a list of six or seven other deaths that she claimed to be murders related to burial society fraud, as well as a list of five other women who had either perpetrated those murders or provided insurance to those who did. ===Alleged conspiracy=== Catherine Flannagan's list of alleged conspirators to the arsenic deaths contained three poisoners other than herself, one accomplice, and three agents of the insuring groups who had provided payouts upon the deaths. Margaret Evans, Bridget Begley, and Margaret Higgins were named as the poisoners; Margaret Potter, a Mrs Fallon, and a Bridget Stanton were the insurers; and Catherine Ryan was alleged to have obtained the arsenic needed by one of the poisoners. According to Flannagan, Margaret Evans had been the instigator of the crime ring, beginning with the murder of a mentally handicapped teenager in which Ryan obtained the poison and Evans administered it. Though Evans did not personally receive an insurance payout from this death, there were implications that she had dealings with the boy's father and may have profited from those. The women Flannagan alleged to have been involved in the conspiracy all appear often in accounts of suspicious deaths in this period; Mrs Stanton, for example, was linked to the insurance policies of three of the deaths, and groups of two or more of the involved women were seen visiting those who died shortly before their deaths. In one case, when an insurance company supervisor requested to meet Thomas Higgins in the course of issuing the insurance on him, he was greeted at the Higgins home by a woman who was neither Flannagan nor Higgins, who presented to him a \\"Thomas\\" who he later realised, upon seeing the deceased Thomas Higgins, was not Thomas Higgins at all. Flannagan's testimony was sometimes contradictory to both herself and to what seemed to be obvious facts of the conspiracy, however; in one case, despite Mrs Stanton's close links to the insurance payouts of murder victims and Flannagan's identification of her as part of the conspiracy, Flannagan \\"exonerated\\" Stanton after police arrested the woman. Ultimately it was decided by the Prosecuting Solicitor for Liverpool that while the additional deaths were, indeed, likely to be murder, it would be difficult to prove that anyone other than Higgins or Flannagan had committed them, especially considering that the primary evidence against the other women was being provided by Flannagan, who had every reason to attempt to minimise her own responsibility in such crimes. As a result, only Flannagan and Higgins were tried for the crime of murdering Thomas Higgins, despite continuing suspicion by all investigating parties that there had been more deaths than just the four household ones, and more murderers than just the two sisters. ===Trial=== At the trial in 1884, prosecutors implicated the sisters in the three other deaths in their household, as well as that of Thomas Higgins, with which they were officially charged. Catherine Flannagan's offer to provide evidence against other conspirators for the prosecution in exchange for leniency was refused. The sisters were found guilty and sentenced to be hanged. The sentence was carried out on 3 March 1884 at Kirkdale Prison, with the sisters attended to by a Roman Catholic priest. The deaths were witnessed by a reported one thousand people. ==In media== Contemporary accounts of the Flannagan sisters referred to them as \\"disciple[s] of Lucrezia Borgia\\" or as \\"the Borgias of the Slums\\", in reference to their use of poison and the tales of how Borgia had been known to do the same. Modern accounts of the Flannagan sisters, such as those by Angela Brabin and the television series Deadly Women, have focused more on the cooperative aspect of the crimes rather than the poison aspect, and tend to refer to them as \\"black widows\\" or \\"The Black Widows of Liverpool\\", particularly in reference to the allegation that the Flannagan sisters were part of a larger murder ring. Wax effigies of Flannagan and Higgins were placed in Madame Tussaud's Chamber of Horrors after their executions. A radio dramatization of the murders and following events entitled Life Assurance, written by Chrissie Gittens based on the book The Black Widows of Liverpool by Angela Brabin (Palatine Books, 2003 /2nd Revised Edition 2009 ) and directed by Claire Grove, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2005, with Sorcha Cusack as Catherine Flanagan, Gillian Kearney as Ellen Flanagan, Anny Tobin as Margaret Higgins, Robert Hastie as Inspector Keighley, Stephen Hogan as Thomas Higgins, Hugh Dickson as Dr. Whitford and Nicholas Boulton as Patrick Jennings.https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0004ljx ==See also== *Black Widow Murders ==ReferencesNotes== Category:1884 deaths Category:Executed Irish people Category:Murder in England Category:Poisoners Category:Murderers for life insurance money Category:1882 crimes Category:1883 crimes Category:People convicted of murder by England and Wales Category:19th-century executions by England and Wales Category:Irish female murderers Category:Filicides in England Category:Irish female serial killers Category:Executed serial killers Category:Sibling duos Category:Executed Irish women Category:1880s in Liverpool Category:Mariticides Category:1880s murders in the United Kingdom ","title":"Black Widows of Liverpool"},{"id":"20488433","text":"Marc Francina (February 2, 1948 in √âvian-les-Bains ‚Äì October 26, 2018) was a member of the National Assembly of France.

He was appointed Secretary of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast in 1973, the middle of the Brezhnev era. His predecessor Gurgen Melkumyan was removed after leader of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR Heydar Aliyev came into conflict with the Armenian leadership of the autonomous oblast. Melkumyan was a native of Nagorno-Karabakh, unlike Kevorkov. Although an Armenian, Kevorkov was very loyal to Aliyev and other Azerbaijani leaders in Baku, and was resented by the Armenian community. He was married to an Azerbaijani woman. Kevorkov reportedly never once visited Armenia during his fourteen years in the post. During the Karabakh movement, 87 Armenian deputies from the Regional Soviet called an emergency session of the assembly on 20 February 1988 in response to Armenian demonstrations in Stepanakert calling for the unification of Karabakh and Armenia. Kevorkov and First Secretary of the Azerbaijan Communist Party Kamran Baghirov tried and failed to stop the session from taking place. Late in the evening, 110 Armenian deputies voted unanimously for the resolution, calling for Nagorno-Karabakh to join Soviet Armenia. The Azerbaijani deputies refused to vote. Kevorkov tried to steal the stamp needed to confirm the resolution. On 24 February 1988, Kevorkov was removed from office by Moscow emissaries. His deputy, Genrikh Poghosyan, who was much more popular among Armenians, took his place. ==Last years== As the Nagorno- Karabakh War intensified, Kevorkov decided to move to Moscow, but was arrested at the airport by the Azerbaijani authorities on May 24, 1992. Kevorkov was released from a Baku jail in 1993 by the decree of President Heydar Aliyev. He subsequently settled in Moscow and worked as a middle school history teacher. He died there in December 1998. ==ReferencesBibliography== * * * Category:1932 births Category:1999 deaths Category:People from Shamakhi Category:Politicians from the Republic of Artsakh Category:Nagorno-Karabakh War Category:Soviet politicians Category:Azerbaijani Armenians Category:Azerbaijani politicians Category:Soviet Armenians ","title":"Boris Kevorkov"},{"id":"20488568","text":"Marguerite Lamour Marguerite Lamour (Marguerite Arzel; born June 12, 1956 in Ploudalm√©zeau, Finist√®re) is the mayor of Ploudalm√©zeau.

She graduated from the Institut d'√âtudes Politiques de Paris. She studied at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, where she specialised in economic and social issues. She also attended Harvard University but did not receive a degree. She is fluent in Spanish. ==Political career== From 1988 to 1991, Touraine was an advisor to Prime Minister Michel Rocard on geostrategic issues. Touraine served as a member of the National Assembly of France for Indre-et-Loire (3rd constituency) from 1997 to 2002 for the Socialiste, radical, citoyen et divers gauche political party. She was defeated in the second round of the 2002 elections by Jean-Jacques Descamps (UMP). She regained the district in the 2007 elections with a small majority (50.22%), and served until 2012. On the regional level, Touraine has been counselor general for Indre-et-Loire since the 2001 elections. She served as Vice-President of the General Council of Indre-et-Loire from 2008 to 2011, and as its President from 2011 to 2012, when she resigned. She has served as General councillor of Indre-et-Loire since 1998, having been re-elected in 2004 and in 2011. In the French presidential election, Touraine endorsed Dominique Strauss-Kahn before later supporting Hollande. ===Minister of Health and Social Affairs=== On 16 May 2012, Touraine was named by Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault as Minister of Health and Social Affairs. The designation was accepted by President of France Fran√ßois Hollande, in line with tradition. In her ministerial post, she worked to improve HIV/AIDS prevention and early diagnosis, promoted universal hepatitis C treatment with innovative drugs, implemented plain tobacco packaging and launched a nutrition labelling system.Former French Minister of Social Affairs, Health and Women‚Äôs Rights Marisol Touraine elected chair of the Unitaid Executive Board Unitaid, press release of June 6, 2019. In October 2012, Touraine announced that trial centres could open in 2012 in France for drug addicts to safely inject their own drugs. This measure met with criticism coming from both the opposition and members of the majority. She entered into negotiations with doctors and health insurance professional organisations to limit the prices of medical assistance.Drug 'shooting galleries' to be tested by France, France24 During her time in office, Touraine oversaw a 2013 pension reform which gradually extended the mandatory pay-in period from 41.5 years to 43 by 2035 and required workers, retirees and employers to fill in an annual deficit set otherwise to reach 20 billion euros ($26 billion) in 2020.Hugh Carnegy (June 6, 2012), Hollande restores right to retire at 60 Financial Times.Catherine Bremer and Emmanuel Jarry (September 2, 2013), France says pension reform enough for several years Reuters.

By the end of her term, Touraine was widely expected to join her party‚Äôs presidential primaries in 2017; she eventually decided not to run for president. When Prime Minister Valls declared that he would seek the Socialist Party‚Äôs nomination and quit the government to focus on campaigning, Touraine was seen by news media as possible choice to replace him and lead what would effectively become a caretaker government; instead, the post went to Bernard Cazeneuve.Christian Hartmann (December 5, 2016), French PM Valls launches presidential bid, quits government Reuters. In the ensuing cabinet reshuffle to form the Cazeneuve government, she lost the responsibility for women‚Äôs rights to newly appointed minister Laurence Rossignol. ==Life after politics== In 2019, Touraine was elected chair of the Executive Board of Unitaid.Former French Minister of Social Affairs, Health and Women‚Äôs Rights Marisol Touraine elected chair of the Unitaid Executive Board Unitaid, press release of June 6, 2019. ==Other activities== In 2009, Touraine belonged to the \\"Future of Health Club\\" (Club Avenir de la sant√©), a lobby group funded by GlaxoSmithKline, the world's No. 7 of pharmecetics products, producing amongst other things, nicotine patches. ==Political positions== In 2016, Touraine was one of two ministers who came out in open disagreement with the government‚Äôs stance on a ban of burkinis. She argued that ‚Äúto pretend that swimming veiled or bathing on a beach dressed is in itself threatening to public order and the values of the Republic is to forget that those (secular) values are meant to allow each person to safeguard their identity.‚ÄùRichard Lough (August 25, 2016), French PM defends burkini ban but some in cabinet wary Reuters. ==Personal life== Touraine is the daughter of French sociologist Alain Touraine and Chilean academic Adriana Arenas Pizarro (d. 1990).

Brown found himself with the American Association's Orioles in the 1886 season in a similar role for a brief period of time. He pitched in four games, completing and losing each one for a record of 0‚Äì4 and an ERA of 5.68. He also appeared in one game as a second baseman.

They share a set of beliefs, which provide a value-based foundation for the actions of members. Members of an epistemic community also share causal beliefs, which result from their analysis of practices that contribute to set of problems in their issue-area that then allow them to see the multiple links between policy and outcomes. Third, they share notions of validity, or internationally defined criteria for validating knowledge in their area of know-how. However, the members are from all different professions. Epistemic communities also have a common set of practices associated with a set of problems towards which their professional knowledge is directed, because of the belief that human welfare will benefit as a result. Communities evolve independently and without influence of authority or government. They do not have to be large; some are made up of only a few members. Even non-members can have an influence on epistemic communities. However, if the community loses consensus, then its authority decreases. == Emergence == Epistemic communities came to be because of the rapid professionalization of government agencies. The Columbia Basin Inter-Agency Committee was created by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt to coordinate the planning process. However, it did not actually participate in the planning process, but rather, was the venue that the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation used to divide construction projects. The failure of the Columbia Basin Inter-Agency Committee to be part of the planning process shows that ‚Äúcommittees imposed from the top may be less likely to promote coordination than to provide agency officials with a means to enhance their autonomy,‚Äù (Thomas 1997, 225). Another reason why epistemic communities came to be is that decision makers began turning to experts to help them understand issues because there were more issues and all were more complicated. This caused greater interest in planning, and future-oriented research, which caused the establishment of environmental and natural resource agencies in 118 countries from 1972-1982. Growing professionalization of bureaucracies caused more respect towards experts, especially scientists. The first achievement by epistemic communities was the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty between the United States and Russia. ==Role in international relations== Epistemic communities influence policy by providing knowledge to policy makers. Uncertainty plays a large role in an epistemic community's influence, because they hold the knowledge that policy makers need to create the wanted outcomes in policy. According to Robert Keohane they fill the absence of ‚Äúa research program‚Äù [that shows] in particular studies that it can illuminate important issues in world politics,‚Äù (Adler/Haas 1992, 367). They can influence the setting of standards and the development of regulations as well as help coordinate structure of IR. The communities influence through communicative action; diffusing ideas nationally, transnationally, and internationally. An epistemic community‚Äôs scope of cooperation is directly linked to the comprehensiveness of their beliefs. The strength of cooperative agreements depends on the power that the epistemic community has gathered within agencies and governments. The duration of cooperation is determined by the epistemic community‚Äôs continued power. The most important contributions of epistemic communities are; that they direct attention towards the conditions which will likely cause a coalition to form and the possibilities of expansion, they insists on the importance of awareness and knowledge in negotiation, and they deepen the knowledge of how various actors define their interests. ==Role in international policy coordination== Epistemic communities usually aid in issues concerning a technical nature. Normally, they guide decision makers towards the appropriate norms and institutions by framing and institutionalizing the issue-area. Epistemic communities are also a source of policy innovation. Communities have indirect and direct roles in policy coordination by diffusing ideas and influencing the positions adopted. Policy evolution occurs in four steps: policy innovation, diffusion, selection, and persistence. Through framing the range of political controversy surrounding an issue, defining state interests, and setting standards epistemic communities can define the best solution to a problem. The definition of interest is specially important because there are many different definitions of what is a priority for a government. Intellectual innovations (produced by epistemic communities) are carried by domestic or international organizations (epistemic communities are a part of these organizations) then are selected by political process. Peter M. Haas argued ‚Äúthat epistemic communities help to explain the emergence and character of cooperation at the international level,‚Äù (Thomas 1997, 223). The shared interests they represent last more than the disagreements about a specific issue. Epistemic communities create a reality that is hindered by political factors and related considerations. If an epistemic community only acquires power in one country or international body, then its power is a direct effect of that country or body‚Äôs power. ==Impact == Epistemic communities became institutionalized in the short term because of change into the policy-making process and to persuade others that their approach is the right approach. Long-term effects occur through socialization. There are a myriad of examples of the impact that epistemic communities have had on public policy. Arms control ideas are reflected in the ABM Treaty and agreements following it during Cold War. Epistemic communities brought attention to chlorofluorocarbons and their polluting consequences. This realization led to the creation of environmental international agencies in a majority of the world‚Äôs governments. This caused environmental decisions to go through the United Nations Environment Programme rather than through General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) who would normally dispute these issues. Such was the case when the 1989 Basel Convention on the Control of Trans-boundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal. An epistemic community helped identify issues and direct the parameters that provided outline for GATT and some free trade agreements. They have also helped in telecommunications agreements and economy issues around the world. In telecommunications, ‚Äúwithout the influence of an epistemic community of engineers concerned about design and international coordination of telecommunications equipment and standards, the regime would not have moved in the direction of multilateral agreements,‚Äù (Adler/Haas 1992, 377). Epistemic communities were directly involved in the creation of the Board of Plant Genetic Resources. As well as the creation of food aid and the way that food aid functions. Epistemic communities also have brought attention to the habitat fragmentation and decline of biodiversity on the planet. This has led to reform throughout the world creating conservation agencies and policies. In California, an ecological epistemic community succeeded in creating the Memorandum of Understanding Biological Diversity (MOU on Biodiversity). The agreement covered all habitats and species in California for protection. The MOU on Biodiversity was followed by the Endangered Species Act which applied to all of the United States. Epistemic communities have a direct effect on agenda setting in intergovernmental organizations and indirect effect on the behavior of small countries. The ideas and policies of an epistemic community can become orthodoxy through the work of that community and through socialization. However, their effect is limited because there is a need for a shock to cause policy makers to seek epistemic community. == References == *Adler, Emanuel. ‚ÄúThe Emergence of Cooperation: National Epistemic Communities and the International Evolution of the Idea of Nuclear Arms Control.‚Äù International Organization.

Its name originated due to the land on which it is built being used as a clandestine dueling ground.\\"Images of America, Lynchburg 1757-2007\\", page 31, 2007, , Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 2006934432 ==History== Its builder and designer, Dr. George Cabell, was a friend of Thomas Jefferson, and physician to Patrick Henry. and Accompanying photo Before building the house, he purchased 856 acres of land including Daniel's Island, Treasure Island and Woodruff Island from Lewellen Jones, who had bought it from Christopher Lynch, son of Quaker patriot Charles Lynch (1736‚Äì1796) and nephew of John Lynch, who started the ferry for which the city is named. After Cabell died of complications after falling off a horse in 1823, and his widow died three years later, it passed to William Lewis Cabell, who may have leased it to the Langhorne family (as discussed below), before he and his wife Eliza Daniel died of tuberculosis in 1830. It was inherited by her father, Judge William Daniel (delegate to the Virginia general assembly 1798‚Äì1799). When he too died in 1839, it passed to his son William Daniel Jr. (Eliza's brother and also the father of United States Senator John Warwick Daniel, \\"the Lame Lion of Lynchburg.\\")Gayle Grisser, \\"Point of Honor: Dedicated individuals helpe landmark survive\\" in Tales of the Hill City: Lynchburg Bicentennial 1786‚Äì1796 (Carter Glass Newspapers Inc.) pp. 90‚Äì91. David P. Payne bought the house in two acres of land in 1848, and in 1857 sold it back to Daniel, who sold it to Colonel Robert L. Owen Sr., who was President of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, and whose son Robert Latham Owen Jr. later became a United States Senator. Owen ran the railroad during the American Civil War, and became a state senator immediately afterward, but resigned his post because he opposed consolidating this railroad with others acquired by William Mahone. Owen died a financially ruined man in 1873, the same year the merged railroad went bankrupt, and the family mansion again changed hands. At two different times in the 19th century, members of the Langhorne family owned Point of Honor. Henry Langhorne, who owned the Langhorne Mills in Lynchburg, purchased it in 1828. Later, but still before the war, John S. Langhorne held the residence. His eldest son Chiswell Langhorne became a wealthy industrialist, and daughter Elizabeth Langhorne Lewis was a prominent suffragette. John S. Langhorne's granddaughters included Mrs. Charles Dana Gibson (the original Gibson Girl), and Nancy Langhorne, Viscountess Lady Astor (the first woman elected to the British Parliament). By 1878 it was owned by L.E. Lichford, a grocery wholesaler who also had a warehouse nearby. Three generations of the family owned the property, during which time the surrounding area developed. James R. Gilliam Jr. bought the house in 1928 and deeded it to the City of Lynchburg, which used part of the property as a recreation center until the Historical Foundation received the deed in 1968.Griisser p. 91 ==Architecture== The irregularly shaped two-story Federal mansion is built of stuccoed brick. The facade is composed of a three- bay center section flanked by two octagonal ended projections. Construction was started in 1806, and completed in 1815. It was renovated about two decades later, with wallpaper and stucco added, and perhaps a porch which was removed during the 1977 restoration.Griiser p. 91 It bears a strong relationship to the Hancock-Wirt-Caskie House in Richmond, Virginia. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, and opened as a public museum in 1978. ==References * Point of Honor website *Point of Honor, Cabell Street between A & B Streets, Lynchburg, VA: 1 drawing, 5 photos, 2 data pages, and 1 photo caption page, at Historic American Buildings Survey *Historic Sandusky - Lynchburg, Virginia Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Virginia Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia Category:Museums in Lynchburg, Virginia Category:Historic house museums in Virginia Category:Federal architecture in Virginia Category:Houses completed in 1815 Category:Houses in Lynchburg, Virginia Category:National Register of Historic Places in Lynchburg, Virginia ","title":"Point of Honor"},{"id":"20488896","text":"SP-345 is a state highway in the state of S√£o Paulo in Brazil.

After recording this album, Haggard would score his first #1 hit since 1976's \\"Cherokee Maiden\\" with \\"Bar Room Buddies,\\" a duet he recorded with actor Clint Eastwood for the soundtrack to the film Any Which Way You Can. ==Reception== The LP was released in April 1980 and peaked at number 16 on the Billboard country album charts. Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine describes The Way I Am as \\"pretty much a straight-ahead honky tonk album that pays little mind to the contemporary trends of the day. Where it differs from Serving 190 Proof or Back to the Barrooms is that the performances are a little inconsistent, as is the material.\\" Music critic Robert Christgau wrote \\"...

The gunman, 17-year-old Anthony F. Barbaro, an honor student and member of the school's rifle team, indiscriminately shot at people on the street from windows at the third floor of the school building. Three people were killed and another 11 people were injured during the shooting. On November 1, 1975, Barbaro hanged himself in his cell at the Cattaraugus County Jail. ==Details== The incident began during the afternoon of December 30, 1974, when Barbaro left his house with his mother's car. He told his brother, Chris, that he was going target shooting. Barbaro arrived at Olean High School at approximately 2:50 p.m. After leaving his car, he entered the school building through an opened side entrance and proceeded to the third floor where he set off a coke bottle filled with gasoline and a wick. Unable to open the locked door to the student council room, Barbaro shot off the lock, entered the student council room, and tied the door shut. A 12-man custodial crew was doing routine maintenance in the basement of the school at this time. When they heard a fire alarm sound, the superintendent dispatched Earl Metcalf to see what the problem was at the 3rd floor. He met Joe Kosidlo, the 3rd floor custodian, who asked him to vacate because he thought he heard gun shots. Mr. Metcalf did not listen and proceeded to where he heard the noise. Anthony Barbaro was then confronted by Earl Metcalf. Seeing Metcalf through the glass window of the student council room, he opened his door, shot and killed him. Barbaro then positioned himself in the student council room on the third floor of the school. There, he began shooting at people outside of the school. Fire trucks began to respond to the fire alarm, then local police and finally New York State troopers. At this time there were no students present and only Principal Louis Nicol, secretaries, business office, maintenance and custodians were at the school. All but the Supt. secretary immediately went to the boiler room at the rear of the school. By 5:20 p.m., local and State Police officers were surrounding the school building, and a National Guard tank had arrived to remove the injured victims. Before night fall, two New York State Police entered the school and threw tear gas grenades into the student council room, where Barbaro was found unconscious inside the room wearing a defective gas mask. Barbaro was laid onto a stretcher and transported by ambulance to the hospital, examined and, suffering no injuries, was then transferred to the Olean City Jail. According to police Barbaro had fired 31 shots. Three people were killed in the shooting, and eleven others were wounded. Those killed were Earl Metcalf, Neal Pilon, and Carmen Wright Drayton, who was six months pregnant. Earl Metcalf, 62, was killed inside the school building, while Columbia Gas Co. employee Neal Pilon, 58, was shot while crossing the street outside of the school. Carmen Wright, 25, was shot in the head inside her car while driving by the school. Both Pilon and Wright were pronounced \\"dead on arrival\\" at Olean General Hospital. Seven people survived the shooting with gunshot wounds, while four others sustained injuries from flying glass fragments. Eight of the wounded victims were Olean city firemen responding to a fire complaint at the school.Honor student held as sniper, Ocala Star-Banner (December 31, 1974) ==Perpetrator and motives== The perpetrator of the shooting was 17-year-old Anthony Barbaro, a lifelong Olean resident. He had attended Olean High School, where he was an honor student and a star marksman on his school's rifle team.Sniper kills 3, hurts 11, Boca Raton News (December 31, 1974) He ranked eighth highest academic score in his senior class, and was inducted into the National Honor Society in February 1974.Student kills 3 at school in sniper fire, Toledo Blade (December 31, 1974) He had also won a Regents Scholarship to New York University that December.Young honor student held as sniper in death of three, Spokane Daily Chronicle (December 31, 1974)They Threaten, Seethe and Unhinge, Then Kill in Quantity, The New York Times (April 9, 2000) Those who knew Barbaro remember him as being quiet, and his school principal described him as a \\"more of a loner than not.\\". Louis Nicol, former principal of Olean High School, and present in the building at the time of shooting, said that Barbaro excelled scholastically and caused no disciplinary problems at school. Barbaro lived in Olean, New York, with his parents and his three younger siblings - sister Cecile, brothers Steven and Chris. His father was an executive of a successful manufacturing firm, while Anthony worked with his mother at a local fast-food restaurant. Barbaro had also shown an interest in engineering, and had hoped to become a scientist. Police have found no apparent motives as to why Barbaro committed his crimes. A teammate of Barbaro on the school's rifle team recalls Barbaro having spoken of wanting to \\"hold up\\" the Olean Armory and engage in a police standoff. Barbaro had just tried out for the bowling team but did not qualify. In a note explaining his motives Barbaro wrote: > I guess I just wanted to kill the person I hate most -- myself, I just > didn't have the courage. I wanted to die, but I couldn't do it, so I had to > get someone to do it for me. It didn't work out. ==Aftermath== On December 31, 1974, Anthony Barbaro was arraigned on three counts of second-degree murder, six counts of first-degree assault, and five counts of first-degree reckless endangerment.Honor student charged in Olean sniper deaths, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (January 1, 1975)Honor student charged with sniper shooting in New York, Kingman Daily Miner (December 31, 1974)\\"Quiet\\" 17-year-old sniper charged with murder of 3, Columbia Missourian (January 1, 1975) Barbaro was then being held without bail at the Olean City Jail. Following the shooting, police had found homemade smoke bombs, as well as gasoline and glass bottles, and empty propane canisters in Barbaro's bedroom. Police also found, in Barbaro's bedroom, bomb recipes and a journal that detailed his plans for the shooting. In April 1975, he had entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, however he was found competent to stand trial by two court-appointed psychiatrists. Barbaro was soon transferred from the Olean City Jail to the Cattaraugus County Jail in Little Valley. On October 21, 1975, a grand jury was seated for Barbaro's trial at the Olean Municipal Building.3 killed by young sniper shooting from high school, The Spokesman-Review (December 31, 1974) On October 27, defense attorney Vincent E. Doyle, Jr. presented his testimony at a preliminary hearing, stating that Barbaro had a \\"serious, deep-rooted mental illness that precluded his [Barbaro's] conviction.\\" On November 1, 1975, Barbaro hanged himself with a bedsheet in his cell at the Cattaraugus County Jail.Sniper suspect found hanged in N.Y. jail cell, St. Petersburg Times (November 2, 1975) Cattaraugus County coroner Dr. Harry C.

One note was addressed to his family, another note was addressed to a woman he corresponded with in prison, and the third note was addressed \\"to whom it may concern\\".

Born in 1957, Bouramiya studied public health and worked in as a doctor before being elected to the National Assembly in 2003. He is an independent deputy. ==Removing Health Minister Al-Jarallah== On April 4, 2005, Bouramiya grilled Health Minister Mohammad Al-Jarallah over alleged mismanagement, leading the minister to resign two days later. As party of the grilling, Bouramiya read out a long list of accusations, including deterioration of health services and squandering of public funds in medical purchases and hospital rehabilitation projects. The minister resigned before he could be brought before a no-confidence vote, which was to be led by Bouramiya and ten other MPs. Some newspapers alleged that the MPs behind the motion were upset that no member of the powerful Awazem tribe or Shiite had been named minister in recent Cabinet changes. ==Resignation of Oil Minister Bader Mishari al-Humaidhi== After Al-Humaidhi was appointed oil minister in the October 28, 2007, cabinet shuffle, Bouramiya and Musallam AlŸÄBarrak wanted to question him about failing to curb consumer debts and embezzlement in state investments abroad during his time as finance minister. The prime minister preempted the parliamentary grilling and angered lawmakers who accused him of covering up corruption and undermining their constitutional right to question ministers. The political standoff reached unprecedented levels when the prime minister and the speaker of the house, Jassem Al-Kharafi, exchanged criticism and accusations in a television interview and a statement published in the country's newspapers. ==Opposed Guaranteeing Bank Deposits== On October 28, 2008, the parliament voted 50-7 to insure all types of deposits in all local banks within Kuwait. Bouramiya opposed the bill, along with Jabir Al-Azmi, Hussein AlŸÄQallaf Al-Bahraini, Mohammed Al-Obaid, Mohammed Hayef AlŸÄMutairi, Musallam AlŸÄBarrak, and Waleed AlŸÄTabtabaie. Bouramiya accused the Cabinet of speeding up the bill's passage for the benefit of monetary tycoons. ==Advanced Treatment Hospital== On January 1, 2009, Bouramiya submitted a draft law to set up a specialty hospital to treat Kuwaiti citizens who require advanced medical treatment. The document states that a separate hospital to treat critical cases be built and suggests that government own 50 percent shares while the rest be open for public subscription. ==Walk-Out Protest Against Cabinet== On January 13, 2009, Bouramiya and ten other MPs walked out of the year's first session complaining of a lack of new faces in the new cabinet. ==References== Category:Kuwaiti people of Arab descent Category:Members of the National Assembly of Kuwait Category:Living people Category:1957 births ","title":"Daifallah Bouramiya"},{"id":"20489026","text":"Naomi Peak, or Mount Naomi, is the highest peak in the Bear River Range in northern Utah and southern Idaho, United States. ==Description== The summit is located northeast of Logan, in the Mount Naomi Wilderness of the Wasatch-Cache National Forest.

He made his only major league appearance on September 21, 1968 against Pittsburgh at Forbes Field. Brown relieved Bobby Tiefenauer, who had in turn relieved the Cubs' starter that day, Joe Niekro.

Brown was removed for pinch-hitter Clarence Jones in the next inning. He would never pitch in the majors again. ==Acting career== Brown's first television role was uncredited as a police officer on a 1964 episode of Arrest and Trial, titled \\"The Black Flower.\\" He first worked as a stunt man the next year on episodes of I Spy.

After his execution he gained notoriety because his body was gibbeted at the scene of the crime on Attercliffe Common between Sheffield and Rotherham, where it hung for 36 years. ==Biography== Little is known of Broughton's early life. He is thought to have been born near Sleaford in Lincolnshire. The son of a farmer, he took up farming too, married and had three children. He developed a gambling habit and left his wife for the cockfighting scenes of Sheffield, Grantham and Derby. ==The crime== The robbery took place on 29 January or 9 February 1791 (sources differ) at Ickles, on the Rotherham edge of Attercliffe Common. Broughton and his accomplice John Oxley stayed in Sheffield the night before the robbery and then walked out of the town on the Rotherham road where they met the mail coming towards Sheffield. However, they intended to rob it on its way back to Rotherham so they lay in wait for it to arrive. George Leasley, the boy driving the mail cart, described how he was led into a field, blindfolded with a handkerchief, and his hands tied behind his back and fixed to a hedge. After about an hour he freed himself and found his horse, but the Rotherham post bag was gone. Broughton and Oxley escaped towards Mansfield. On their way they went through the contents of the post bag and found that the only item of value was a French bill of exchange worth ¬£123; they disposed of the rest of the contents in a brook and parted, with Oxley proceeding to London to cash the bill. ==Capture and trial== Broughton and Oxley were arrested, along with John Shaw, in London in October 1791 following further robberies at Cambridge and Aylesbury. Broughton was sent to Newgate Prison, and Oxley to Clerkenwell Prison. Though it has since been alleged that Shaw was the instigator of the crimes, at trial Shaw gave evidence that Broughton was the ring-leader‚ÄîOxley alleged that he did this because he and Broughton shared an interest in the same woman. Oxley himself escaped from Clerkenwell on 31 October, leaving Broughton to stand trial alone. The trial took place in York on 24 March 1792. Shaw testified that Broughton and Oxley had come to him after robbing the Rotherham mail to ask him where they could cash the ¬£123 bill. Next to testify was John Close, who said that he had met Broughton in London looking for Oxley, and Broughton had complained to him that Oxley had not given him his share of the proceeds from the robbery. John Townsend, the arresting officer, described the events on the day of the arrest, after which the jury found Broughton guilty and the judge, Mr. Justice Buller, sentenced him to death by hanging \\"and afterwards to be hung in chains on the Common, within three miles of Sheffield, where the robbery was committed.\\" The trial took only 90 minutes. Spence Broughton was executed at Knavesmire, York on 14 April 1792. In the days before his execution Broughton is purported to have shown great remorse, writing: > Surely I have greatly transgressed the laws both of God and man! In what > manner shall a sinful wretch, like me, presume to approach the throne of > mercy? Alas! my repeated provocations do now wound me to the very soul. At his execution he is reported to have professed his innocence, \\"saying that he was a murdered man; that, though he came down with the intent to rob the mail, he was six miles from the place at the time of the robbery\\", though he admitted receiving part of the proceeds. ==Gibbeting and folklore== Drawing of Attercliffe Common c1792 showing the gibbet (right) and the Arrow pub (left). On 16 April Broughton's body was taken to Attercliffe Common to be hung in a gibbet. George Drabble, the keeper of a pub called the Arrow that was located near the site, reported that crowds started to gather on the common the day before. The gibbet is reported to have attracted 40,000 visitors to the Common on the first day alone. Broughton's body remained hanging in the gibbet on Attercliffe Common for nearly 36 years. It was finally removed in 1827 when Henry Sorby, who had bought the land it stood on, had it cut down because he had grown tired of trespassers on his land. The remains of the gibbet post were claimed to have been rediscovered in 1867 when a solid oak post was found embedded in a framework in the ground during excavations for the cellars of some new houses in Clifton Street, Attercliffe Common. The discovery once again drew large crowds to Attercliffe Common. The length of time that the rotting body of Spence Broughton hung on Attercliffe Common and the great interest that it attracted led to Broughton becoming a hero of local folklore. One story was that a group of drunken potters from the Don Pottery, passing the site of the gibbet, threw stones at the skeleton and managed to dislodge two fingers. Taking these as trophies they were calcined and incorporated into the body of a jug. Songs were also written about Broughton including Spence Broughton reported by C. J. Davison Ingledew and Spence Broughton's Lament by Joseph Mather: > Hark, his blood, in strains so piercing, > Cries for justice night and day; > In these words which I'm rehersing, > Now methinks I hear him say‚Äî > \\"Thou, who art my spirit's portion > In the realms of endless bliss, > When at first thou gav'st me motion > Knew that I should come to this. > The fate of John Oxley became the subject of speculation, with reports that he was smuggled out of Folkestone to America. However, the Sheffield newspapers reported in January 1793 that Oxley had been discovered dead of hunger and cold in a barn on Loxley Moor near Sheffield. ==References and notes== Category:1746 births Category:1792 deaths Category:People executed by the Kingdom of Great Britain Category:Executed people from Lincolnshire Category:History of Sheffield Category:People executed by England and Wales by hanging Category:People executed for robbery Category:People from Sleaford, Lincolnshire Category:English highwaymen ","title":"Spence Broughton"},{"id":"20489145","text":"Marylise Lebranchu ( ; born 25 April 1947 in Loud√©ac, C√¥tes-d'Armor) is a French politician.

He is backed by Norm Hamlet and Don Markham of The Strangers. ==Background== As the title suggests, Back to the Barrooms features some of Haggard's hardest drinking songs since his early honky-tonk classics \\"Swinging Doors\\" and \\"The Bottle Let Me Down.\\" \\"I Think I'll Just Stay Here and Drink,\\" his only solo #1 hit at MCA, features an extended jam unusual for a country single at the time, consisting of Larry Muhobarec on piano, Don Markham on saxophone, and Reggie Young on guitar. The self- explanatory \\"I Don't Want To Sober Up Tonight\\" and the title track are also unabashed odes to getting drunk. The single \\"Misery and Gin\\" had appeared on the soundtrack to the film Bronco Billy, in which Haggard had a cameo role, appearing as himself. A music video was also made for the song. \\"Leonard\\" is Haggard's tribute to his friend and mentor Tommy Collins. Haggard had been recording songs written by Collins throughout his career, beginning with the novelty \\"Sam Hill\\" in 1964 and scoring a #1 single with \\"Carolyn\\" in 1971. Collins, who had never heard the song, was in the studio the day Haggard cut it and, as he tells Daniel Cooper in the liner notes to the 1994 box set Down Every Road, he was overwhelmed: \\"It's hard to describe how you feel when you first fall in love, it's hard to explain how you feel when you become the father of a child. It's one of those things it's hard to explain. I was very honored, and very humbled by the fact that he did that.\\"Down Every Road 1962‚Äì1994 compilation album. Liner notes by Daniel Cooper The song became a Top 10 hit. Other notable tracks include \\"(I Don't Have) Any More Love Songs\\", which is a Hank Williams, Jr. song from his 1979 Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound, and \\"Can't Break the Habit,\\" a song co-authored by Haggard and his third wife Leona Williams. Haggard and Williams, who married in 1978, began having troubles around this time and their divorce would begin Haggard's long descent into alcoholism and cocaine addiction. \\"Easy Come, Easy Go\\" is a cover of a song by The Sutherland Brothers from their 1979 album, When the Night Comes Down. ==Reception== The LP was released in October 1980 and reached number 8 on the Billboard country albums chart. Thom Jurek of AllMusic insists that Back to the Barrooms \\"is really about is the wreckage caused by broken amorous relationships and boozy escape as the only way to cope.\\" Calling it his strongest album on MCA, Jurek compliments Jimmy Bowen's \\"progressive country style\\" and calls it Haggard's \\"most consistent, inspiring performance since he left Capitol, and was the beginning of a creative renaissance, though the personal toll it took on him would prove considerable.\\" ==Track listing== All tracks composed by Merle Haggard; except where indicated # \\"Misery and Gin\\" (John Durrill, Snuff Garrett) ‚Äì 2:50 # \\"Back to the Barrooms Again\\" (Merle Haggard, Dave Kirby) ‚Äì 2:34 # \\"Make-Up and Faded Blue Jeans\\" ‚Äì 4:05 # \\"Ever- Changing Woman\\" (Dave Kirby, Curly Putman) ‚Äì 2:28 # \\"Easy Come, Easy Go\\" (Iain Sutherland) ‚Äì 3:32 # \\"I Don't Want to Sober Up Tonight\\" ‚Äì 3:30 # \\"Can't Break the Habit\\" (Merle Haggard, Leona Williams) ‚Äì 3:04 # \\"Our Paths May Never Cross\\" ‚Äì 2:44 # \\"I Don't Have Any More Love Songs\\" (Hank Williams, Jr.) ‚Äì 3:04 # \\"Leonard\\" ‚Äì 3:39 # \\"I Think I'll Just Stay Here and Drink\\" ‚Äì 4:31 ==Personnel== *Merle Haggard ‚Äì lead vocals, harmony vocals, acoustic guitar *Norm Hamlet ‚Äì pedal steel guitar, dobro *Don Markham ‚Äì trumpet, saxophone *Johnny Gimble ‚Äì fiddle, mandolin *Billy Joe Walker, Jr. ‚Äì acoustic guitar, electric guitar *Reggie Young ‚Äì electric guitar *Larry Muhoberac ‚Äì keyboards *Joe Osborn ‚Äì bass guitar *Jerry Kroon ‚Äì drums *Larrie Londin ‚Äì drums *Dennis William Wilson ‚Äì harmony vocals Strings on \\"Misery and Gin\\" arranged and conducted by Steve Dorff ==Production notes== *Produced by Jimmy Bowen (all tracks except 1), Snuff Garrett (track 1) *Engineered by Grover Helsley, Jimmy Bowen, Ron Treat ==Chart performance== {  !

It is a two-story Greek Revival frame house completed in 1852 and located within the Daniel's Hill Historic District. It was built for Judge William Daniel Jr. (1806‚Äì1873) and his second wife, Elizabeth Hannah Cabell (1811‚Äì1892). In 1997 the Lynchburg Redevelopment and Housing Authority gained title to the property and donated it to The Rivermont House, Inc. and Accompanying photo It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. ==References== Rivermont is one of Lynchburg's most important antebellum mansions. It was completed in 1852, during the year the U.S. Census declared the city to be the second- wealthiest in the country. The handsome Greek Revival mansion is located on F Street, just off Cabell Street, the main thoroughfare of Daniel's Hill. Rivermont follows the pattern of the few Lynchburg Greek Revival houses of the 1840s and 1850s in several respects: It has a three bay facade, is raised on a high basement, has a hipped roof, and a one-story portico centered on the facade. It differs from the normal pattern in Lynchburg in that it is made of frame rather than brick and its huge windows on the facade are unique‚Äîeach is a triple composition with a central panel flanked by sidelights. Their monumental scale and sash are spectacular and were obviously designed to take advantage of the sweeping views down the James River. In Lynchburg, the other best examples of the Greek Revival style are the Edward Murrell House in Garland Hill on Madison and Second Streets. It was built in 1859 and was made of brick. And the City Court House, also a Greek Revival style structure built between 1853-1855. Rivermont is 48' wide x 38' deep with a ground floor, main floor and second floor. It has four internal brick chimneys and the raised foundation is brick, which was later covered with stucco. Other external details include a dentil cornice and a front entry with transom and sidelights. A one-story portico protected this entrance centered on the facade. Its columns were of the delicate \\"Temple (Tower) of the Winds\\" pattern, a variant of the Corinthian Order that was used only occasionally in Greek Revival architecture, generally for the finest buildings employing the style. Corinthian columns are adapted from the Choregic Monument of Lysikrates in Athens, c. 334 B.C. The portico has been restored. The interior features a two-room deep center passage plan with high-ceilinged rooms of generous proportions. The main floor has ceilings over 12 feet tall, the second floor has ceilings that are 9 feet tall and the ground level has 8 foot ceilings. The enter passage features a wide two-run stair with turned newel posts, balusters, and a thick continuous mahogany hand rail. Walls and ceilings have plaster finishes, except for three rooms on the ground floor which have brick walls. Doors and windows have molded surrounds, and doors are four panel. Surviving original mantels have simple Greek Revival pilaster and frieze compositions although some have battered jambs with eared friezes. Also in the house are two c. 1900 two stage mantels with colonnettes. Under the large windows in the three downstairs rooms are paneled aprons. The west rooms are connected by pocket doors. The chimneys rise from the ground level to the second story and there is a fireplace in each room. Rivermont was built by Lynchburg contractors Bailey and Lanahan, who had undertaken the second St. Paul's Episcopal Church at 7th & Church Streets a year earlier. They also built the second Presbyterian Church at the corner of 9th and Church Streets, which was demolished in 1931. And, they built the Rucker house in 1867 at the corner of 7th and Clay streets. It was unfortunately taken down in 1887 to build the third St. Paul's church. Fortunately, we still have Bailey and Lanahan's hand-written building specifications that describe in detail all of the interior and exterior of Rivermont. They also called for the construction of a smokehouse and kitchen building. The plans reference design elements taken from William Ranlett's architectural pattern book called The American Architect: A series of Original Designs for Domestic and Ornamental Cottages and Villas. Here are several slides of the actual pattern that was used to design the Rivermont House. We know that the on the roof of Rivermont there used to be two balustrades, one near the eaves and one at the apex, just like the pattern shows. We did not replace those balustrades but hope they can be added in the future. The hand written specifications were signed by William Daniel, the owner, in 1848. The plans called for a first floor bedroom with an adjoining bathing room and dressing room, which is an unusual convenience for this era. There was a stairway from the ground floor hall up to the main floor and another stair from the main floor to the second floor. There was also a small stairway in the passage between the bathing and drawing room to the second floor. The floors on the main and second floor are made of \\"secret laid\\" kiln. There are four bedrooms upstairs. The plans called for Venetian blinds in all rooms. On the ground level, we find the dining room and living area for the family. The floors in the ground level hall and dining room were made of flagging and in the other ground level rooms the floors were brick. Aside from the front porch, which is described in detail, there was also a back porch with turned columns that was 28'x 8'. The smokehouse was to be 12x14 with 12 foot ceilings and framed with weather board. The kitchen was 16 x 32 with a chimney in the center and was framed with weatherboard. It had four fireplaces, two above and two below and a small window in each gable. The main house was to receive 3 coats of paint and the kitchen and smokehouse were to receive 2 coats of paint. Rivermont's structure is of balloon frame construction, which was generally not employed in this area of the country until much later. This early example of balloon frame construction is one of the main reasons the Rivermont House is on the National Register of Historic Places. Balloon frame construction was first documented in the Chicago area in 1833, where Augustine Taylor built the Saint Mary's Church. Taylor eliminated the old mortised beams and fittings and replaced them with light 2x4s and 2x6s set close together. Wood studs extend in one piece from the top of the foundation sill plate to the top roof plate. Floor joists are nailed to the studs and are supported with horizontal boards. Taylor used these studs and cross members and held the whole thing together with nails, no joints. Balloon frame construction, which would be better described as basket weave construction, proved to be incredibly sturdy, light, flexible and tough. Stresses were taken throughout the structure and there are stories of tornadoes knocking balloon frame houses off their foundations with the houses rolling away unbroken like tumbleweeds. These buildings can be easily moved on a flat bed truck. Rivermont was built by Judge William Daniel, Jr. for his second wife, Elizabeth Cabell of Richmond. They were married in 1850. Before this he was married to Sarah Warwick and they had a son, John Warwick Daniel (who later came to be known as the Lame Lion of Lynchburg and was a high ranking U.S. Senator), and a daughter. When William Daniel was married to Sarah, he lived in Point of Honor, which he inherited upon his father's death in 1839. The problem was, when his father died, a large portion of his money went to William's sisters, so William did not have enough money to run Point of Honor as a working plantation. He had to get rid of most of his slaves and had financial trouble. His wife Sarah and their children quite often stayed \\"in town\\" on Court Street at Sarah's parent's house (the Warwick House). They felt Point of Honor was too far out in the country. In 1845, Sarah died (possibly in childbirth). William was unable to take proper care of his children by himself, so they lived with Sarah's parents on Court Street. William then offered the large Point of Honor tract of land for sale in 1845. He was willing to sell it as one estate or to break it (around 800 acres plus the dwelling house) into lots. It was at this time that Daniel's Hill was created and Cabell Street became the main thoroughfare. William leased Point of Honor for a number of years and the finally sold it in 1862 to the Owen family. William was very active in politics. He served as a Judge of Lynchburg's General Court in the 1820s and was elected to the House of Delegates in 1831 before he was 25. He served three terms. In 1846 he was elected to the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia and served until the Civil War. Daniel was also instrumental in organizing the Lynchburg-based Virginia and Tennessee Railroad. William must have met Elizabeth Cabell while spending time in Richmond in the House of Delegates. Elizabeth was the sister of his law partner Henry Colter Cabell. When he married her, he hoped for a happy life with a mother for his children. He used the highest piece of land in Daniel's Hill to build Rivermont. Elizabeth is credited with naming the house. Unfortunately, Elizabeth was miserable in Lynchburg and she didn't really like William Daniel, either. They never had any children. Their relationship is documented in letters from Elvira Daniel Ellet, William's sister, who visited William quite often. She was married to Col. Charles Ellet, the distinguished civil engineer and chief engineer of the James River and Kanawha Canal. Charles Ellet had to travel extensively, leaving Elvira alone for long spells. To fill the time, she would visit William at Rivermont. The University of Michigan houses the \\"Ellet Papers\\" and the Lynchburg Museum System sent Martha Terrell Harris Burruss to Ann Arbor to research the papers and document references to Lynchburg. Following are some excerpts from Elvira's letters to Charles regarding William, his marriage and Rivermont: ‚Ä¢ Elvira, formerly blaming her brother, not seems to pity him as she writes \\"poor brother looks wild, haggard, and unhappy in the extreme, but seems to be doing as nearly as he can what is right.\\" ‚Ä¢ On Feb. 2, 1852 she writes: \\"Brother's wife is in a wretched condition‚Ä¶She is acting in a way the best calculated to ruin both herself and her husband.\\" Elvira says Mrs. Cabell, Elizabeth's mother is a problem and she does not lay the blame on her brother. ‚Ä¢ On February 7, 1852 she writes further news of William's marital difficulties including an interfering mother-in-law when she says \\"My impression is that she was disappointed and chagrined, and having really no affection for her husband, allowed him to see it too. He has always said his transient derangement was produced by his discovery of her want of affection for him.\\" Elvira reports that Mrs. Cabell thinks her daughter is a martyr and sleeps with her, making William sleep in the dressing room. ‚Ä¢ On March 3, 1852 Elvira reports that \\"Brother's wife has determined not to accompany him to Lynchburg, where he will remain two or three weeks alone, exposed to temptation, which I fear he never resists there in consequence of his entire loneliness. The election for his office will take place in April and Mr. Bouldin says a frolic at this time would cause his certain defeat.\\" Elvira decides to go to Lynchburg with her brother at this time because she has some influence over him. ‚Ä¢ On March 8, 1852, Elvira and William arrive at Rivermont. Elvira will stay for a month and it is the first time she has seen his new house. Of the house she says, \\"The view from this house is the most extensive and beautiful one that I remember anywhere. The position is far superior to that occupied by the old house (Point of Honor) and when the trees grow, which have been planted out, nothing will be wanting to make it one of the most delightful and elegant homes that could well be imagined. The view is even more beautiful than my memory made it.\\" She then referred to seeing the mountains she used to watch when she was a girl and the memories of seeing the approach of heavy rains. It took several hours to heat up Rivermont with wood fires when they first arrived. William had horses and a carriage for them to use. ‚Ä¢ On March 10, 1852 Elvira reports to her husband again that the view is magnificent. She says the house is very pretty and convenient and exceedingly cheerful having so much light from the numerous large windows in all the rooms. She says the greatest defect is that it was built for the summertime or for a very warm climate. Just now, though, she says it is very comfortable with large wood fires in all the rooms they use. She says William is unhappy and that she still doesn't understand his position with regard to his wife and that there is some mystery there. William is worried about the upcoming election because Judge Mason in running against him. ‚Ä¢ On March 12, 1852 Elvira writes that the children are playing in the clover fields around Rivermont. She says Rivermont is in a rather lonely situation and that they are too far out of town to see many visitors. ‚Ä¢ On May 15, 1853, a year later, Elvira writes to her husband the following. \\"From all accounts Brother's wife must be on the brink of insanity. Who would have dreamed of such a fate for one so petted and idolized. I sincerely believe that if she could be removed altogether from her Mother's influence that she would be more likely to return to a healthy condition.\\" In 1867, after the Civil War, William Daniel lost everything and was forced to declare bankruptcy. Anyone working as part of the Confederate government was forced out after the war. He died in 1873. According to historian W. Asbury Christian, William's \\"great legal acquirements and the soundness of his judicial opinions gave his decisions a place with the foremost in the records of Virginia.\\" A much happier era in Rivermont history began in 1874, when Rivermont was sold by the estate of William Daniel to Edward Sixtus Hutter and his wife Nannie Francis Langhorne Hutter. Edward was the son of Major George Christian Hutter, who was paymaster in the United States navy and lived at \\"Sandusky.\\" His mother was Miss Harriet Risque Hutter. Nannie Hutter was the daughter of Major John S. and Elizabeth Dabney Langhorne. Edward and Nannie had 13 children, 5 of whom died young, so there was a big happy family growing up at Rivermont during the last half of the 19th century. Edward Sixtus was educated at VMI and later served in the Civil War as a staff person for Jeb Stuart. He was in charge of the arsenal in Danville during the last half of the war. After the war he worked for his father-in-law in the insurance business and then, after moving to Rivermont, took up the profession of Civil engineering, which he had learned at VMI. According to Al Chambers, \\"he took the name \\"Rivermont\\" and ran with it.\\" He sold off portions of his Rivermont estate to create \\"Danielstown,\\" a working-class neighborhood. Danielstown was one of the first signs of post war prosperity in Lynchburg. Then, Hutter helped form the \\"Rivermont Company,\\" Lynchburg's largest real estate venture of the 1880-1890s boom era, the era of the \\"New South.\\" Edward Hutter helped design the Rivermont Bridge that spanned Blackwater Creek at a height \\"within three feet of the height of the suspension bridge at Brooklyn.\\" the bridge provided access to the new suburb and to Rivermont Avenue, which Hutter platted in generous, sweeping curves following the dictates of topography. He also laid out the lots of the new development and named it, along with the bridge and the avenue, after his home, Rivermont. Several years after this boom fizzled out, Edward Hutter pursued the development of iron mines with his son E. Risque Hutter. During his time in Rivermont House he must have hosted a number of elegant parties. One that we know about is his daughter's wedding on April 2, 1902. We got a copy of their wedding write-up in the paper from Phyllis Workman, a Hutter descendant, as well as this photo of the big day. Here are some notes on the wedding from that article. MARRIED AT ST. PAUL'S on April 2, 1902 Miss Lucy Boyd Hutter Becomes the Bride of Mr. T. Rush Ragland One of the most interesting marriages that has been chronicled in Lynchburg in recent years was that of Miss Lucy Boyd Hutter, daughter of Major Edward S. Hutter, and Mr. T. Rush Ragland, of Kanawha, WV, which took place at St. Paul's Episcopal Church. The popularity of the bride in Lynchburg was attested by an immense assemblage which not only filled every seat, but taxed the capacity of standing room. Wedding party members included Miss Mary Christian, Miss Elizabeth Lewis, Miss Nina Armistead, Miss Mazie Hutter, Miss Norvie Craighill, Miss Ruby Hanmer, Miss Fannie Cheatwood, and Miss Evelyn Early. Ushers were Messrs. George Lancaster, G.O. Howard, and Forest Scales, of Holcombe Rock, and C.S. Hutter, D.A. Payne, and Dexter Otey, of Lynchburg. The ushers were followed by eight groomsmen Messers. E.R. Hutter, R.T. Watts, Samuel Adams, R.C. Blackford, Keene Langhorne and Henry Johnson, of Lynchburg: Robert Rose, of New York, and Colonel Joseph Button, of Richmond. Bridesmaids were exquisitely gowned in white mousseline and lace trimmings over taffeta with large white picture hats and long gloves, and carried bunches of maiden hair fern. The two maids of honor, Miss Edna Hutter, sister of the bride, and Miss Florence Langhorne, of Campbell County, were handsomely and becomingly gowned in white mousseline over white taffeta and wore large white chiffon hats with pink roses and carried la France roses. The bride followed the maids of honor, and proceeded up the aisle on the arm of her father. She wore an elegant and lovely bridal costume of heavy white satin with white chiffon over dress and point lace, with a long veil caught with a cluster of dainty orange blossoms, and carried a bunch of graceful Easter lilies. On reaching the foot of the chancel steps, the bride was joined by the groom, who had approached from the vestry room accompanied by his best man, Mr. Marion Scales, of New York. From the church the party repaired to the home of the bride's parents on Daniel's Hill, where an elaborate bridal breakfast was served. The gracious hospitality never presented a fairer appearance The young couple received the guests in the large hall, and later the company adjourned to the spacious drawing rooms, where the breakfast tables were spread. The bridal party was seated at a large circular table, exquisitely decorated with Easter lilies and garlands of smilax. Many candles in silver candelabra shed their light on the beautiful scene, and after a delicious menu had been served, the bride's cake was cut amid much mirth and eagerness. When Edward Sixtus Hutter died in June 1904 his obituary summarized his personality as follows: Edward Hutter \\"was a man of splendid personality and unusual amiability. His great business sagacity and intelligence was recognized and admitted by all who knew him. Everything he applied himself to he did well. He was charming in manner and of a generous and kindly disposition and was warmly beloved and admire by all who knew him.\\" When his wife, Nannie Langhorne died in 1907, she had an equally glowing obituary: \\"A child of unusual brightness and promise, she early developed into a brilliant and fascinating woman, and many still recall with appreciative affection and admiration \\"Miss Nannie Jack Langhorne\\" in the bloom of her beautiful girlhood, her charm of manner, quick wit and lovely gift of song, which made her a center of attraction on every occasion graced by her presence. As a writer, her style was easy, bright and humorous, and her magazine articles and letters to the papers were always read with interest and amusement. A little book of poems also, published in 1898, contains some very sweet and tuneful lyrics.\\" After the Hutter occupancy of Rivermont, the house was sold 11 times. It eventually became a run-down apartment building. It was chopped into apartments by the addition of partitions to divide each floor into at least two apartments. It was in this condition that the Lynchburg Redevelopment and Housing Authority took possession of it by eminent domain in 1996 and asked the Lynchburg Historical Foundation for help in creating a non- profit entity to oversee its restoration. Paul Barringer, now deceased, was one of the main commissioners of the Housing Authority who thought the house should be saved. Rivermont House, Inc. became a non-profit entity in September 1997. The House was sold by Rivermont House, Inc. in 2010 to a private individual and is being restored as a private residence.

He won the Total Cup For Privateers with the TOM'S Team Brookes, ran by his father Jon. Although running as an independent driver, Brookes did have limited works backing from Toyota. In 1997 he replaced the car with a Peugeot 406 that had been used by the Peugeot works team the previous year. The car suffered reliability problems that he hadn't had with the previous years car. He finished second in the independents cup, narrowly losing out to Robb Gravett. He teamed up with Gravett a year later, Brookes Motorsport entered one Honda Accord for Gravett. Brookes himself raced in just two rounds at Oulton Park. The two drivers also entered the Bathurst 1000 that year. Brookes drove the Honda Accord for a part season in 1999, finishing fourth in the independents cup. Brookes Motorsport reformed as TCR, which still runs on the TOCA support package, with some success.http://www.totalcontrolracing.com/about ==Racing recordComplete British Touring Car Championship results=== (key) (Races in bold indicate pole position ‚Äì 1 point awarded all races) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap) (* signifies that driver lead feature race for at least one lap ‚Äì 1 point given 1998 onwards) {  style=\\"text-align:center; font- size:85%\\" !

Though Rhodesia declared independence in 1965, succeeding political developments and wars changed the status of the country and the National Assembly was reformed and has continued since 1970 while Zimbabwe regained independence in 1980. By 2003, the 50th anniversary of the Bah√° º√≠s in Zimbabwe, a year of events across the country culminated with a conference of Bah√° º√≠s from all provinces of Zimbabwe and nine countries. There were 43 local spiritual assemblies in 2003. ==Early phase== In a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States and Canada in 1916-1917 by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, then head of the religion, asked the followers of the religion to take the religion to regions of Africa; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. The publication was delayed until 1919 in Star of the West magazine on December 12, 1919 after the end of World War I and the Spanish flu. In 1929 Shoghi Effendi, then Guardian of the religion, was the first Bah√° º√≠ to visit the area and then came again with his wife, R√∫h√≠yyih Khanum, in 1940‚Äì1. They visited the Victoria Falls, Matopos, and Bulawayo. Early in 1953 Izzat'u'llah Zahrai from Iran attempted to settle in what was then South Rhodesia but his application for residency was rejected. Along with Zahrai, Claire Gung, Eyneddin and Tahirih Ala'i, (some from the United Kingdom), and Dr. Kenneth and Mrs. Roberta Christian, American Bah√° º√≠ pioneers, were each credited with being Knights of Bah√° ºu'll√°h for Southern Rhodesia and were under strict instructions by the Guardian to attempt to spread the religion among the indigenous peoples, not the settlers. However the Christians knew Sylvia and \\"Sue\\" (Salvator) Benatar, who though Sephardic Jews, became Bah√° º√≠s after the Christians left Zimbabwe when they came in contact with Larry and Carol Hautz who were succeeding pioneers. Later Mrs. Benatar performed with Norman Bailey. The Hautz' established a motel, service station, and a snake farm for venom on the Bulawayo road just outside Harare. The school was initially for the 20 indigenous children of the staff, but it eventually expanded to a total enrollment of 400. The first indigenous person to accept the Faith was Morton Ndovi in January 1955 who soon pioneered to Malawi and then Nyasaland. Other local people accepted the Faith soon afterwards, and in April that same year the first Local Spiritual Assembly was formed in Harare (then called Salisbury). The region was gathered together under a regional National Spiritual Assembly of South West Africa in 1956. The first African woman to become a Baha'i in Zimbabwe was Mabel Chiposi, who accepted the religion in 1957. Wide scale growth in the religion across Sub-Saharan Africa was observed to begin in 1950s and extend in the 1960s. By the end of 1963 there were several communities of Bah√° º√≠s including nine Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assemblies: {  -  Local Assemblies  Bulawayo  Filabusi  Greendale  Highfields  Mondoro  Mrewa  Salisbury(now Harare)  Salisbury Motel  Waterfalls -  Groups  Bangira  Chirundu  Filabusi Village  Gwanda  Gwelo  Hatfield  Norton  Rusapi  Umtali - Isolated Individuals  Beitbridge  Crowborough  Gatooma  Marandellas  Wankie  West Nicholson } ==Growth== Hand of the Cause John Robarts lived in Bulawayo with his family from 1957 to 1967. While still a colony of the United Kingdom, the Bah√° º√≠s nevertheless organized a separate National Spiritual Assembly in 1964, and Hand of the Cause Enoch Olinga represented the Universal House of Justice at the first national convention. Though Rhodesia declared independence in 1965, succeeding political developments and wars changed the status of the country and the National Assembly was reformed and has continued since 1970. In October 1979 some 60 members of the religion from nine communities in Matabeleland participated in the first regional conference at Bulawayo. In April 1980 more than 50 attended the four-day summer school at the national Center in Salisbury. Zimbabwe regained independence in 1980. In 1983 the national convention had 67 delegates. In 1985 182 local assemblies were elected and some one hundred women attended a National Bah√° º√≠ Women's Conference. Bah√° º√≠s estimated the Zimbabwean community at 20,000 in 1985, a 20 fold increase from 1971. Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bah√° º√≠s were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bah√° º√≠ teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bah√° º√≠ socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. In 1984 a literacy project was begun and operated entirely by local members of the religion. In 1986 the Bah√° º√≠s of Zimbabwe hosted a conference on the education of children with speakers from government ministries and UNICEF addressing the meetings and coverage by radio stations. By 1988 teacher training for tutorial schools, literacy and pre-school programs was held in Zimbabwe. In November 1988 a national women's conference gathered 71 Bah√° º√≠s. In 1989 a Bah√° º√≠ expert and businessman in using appropriate technology from Swaziland traveled through six southern and eastern African countries including Zimbabwe training local people in the manufacture of several kinds of fence-making machines and other technologies in building, agriculture and water programs. The 10-day training courses were organized by the National Spiritual Assemblies in each of the six countries. Two major arts events took place in Zimbabwe in 1994 among the Bah√° º√≠s. The first was a national music and drama congress, held in August in Mhondoro, with approximately 200 attending. The drama group from Murewa and the Epworth children's choir won in their respective categories. The second major event was in December with participants 30 different countries for the Zimbabwe Bah√° º√≠ International Summer School and Music and Drama Festival. In the music competition of that event, a group called Voice of the Youth, from Bulawayo, walked away with the first prize, the Murewa Choir came second, and the Epworth Choir came third. ==Modern community== After smaller regional congresses held throughout the nation, Bah√° º√≠s from all provinces of Zimbabwe and nine countries attended the festivities of the 50th anniversary of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Zimbabwe that were held from 12 to 14 December 2003. The festivities included performances by groups \\"Isitsha Sothando\\" from Ndebele tribe, \\"Letters of the Living,\\" from Mashonaland Central Province, and others. Some 80 Bah√° º√≠s from Zimbabwe, including a 2008 member of the National Spiritual Assembly, attended the first of 41 conferences called for by the Universal House of Justice in October for between November and February 2008‚Äì9, held in neighboring Zambia along with Bah√° º√≠s from Malawi. ===Demographics=== As of 2003 Bah√° º√≠s lived in more than 1,600 localities in urban and rural areas of Zimbabwe, and there are 43 local spiritual assemblies. There are Bah√° º√≠ centers in Harare, Bulawayo, Chinamora, Mubaira, and Murewa. ==See also== *Religion in Zimbabwe *History of Zimbabwe ==References *Bah√° º√≠ Community of Zimbabwe Category:Religion in Zimbabwe Zimbabwe Zimbabwe ","title":"Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Zimbabwe"},{"id":"20489338","text":"SOF medic the proper procedure for controlling a mannequin. Medical simulation, or more broadly, healthcare simulation, is a branch of simulation related to education and training in medical fields of various industries. Simulations can be held in the classroom, in situational environments, or in spaces built specifically for simulation practice. It can involve simulated human patients ‚Äì artificial, human or a combination of the two, educational documents with detailed simulated animations, casualty assessment in homeland security and military situations, emergency response, and support virtual health functions with holographic simulation. In the past, its main purpose was to train medical professionals to reduce error during surgery, prescription, crisis interventions, and general practice. Combined with methods in debriefing, it is now also used to train students in anatomy, physiology, and communication during their schooling. ==History== Link Trainer. Modern day simulation for training was first utilized by anesthesia physicians to reduce accidents. When simulation skyrocketed in popularity during the 1930s due to the invention of the Trainer Building Link Trainer for flight and military applications, many field experts attempted to adapt simulation to their own needs. Due to limitations in technology and overall medical knowledge to a specific degree at the time, medical simulation did not take off as acceptable training until much later.Chakravarthy, Bharath. Academic Resident. Medical Simulation in EM Training and Beyond When the sheer cost effectiveness and training of which simulation was capable surfaced during extensive military use, hardware/software technology increased, and medical standards were established, medical simulation became entirely possible and affordable, although it remained un-standardized, and not widely accepted by the larger medical community. By the 1980s software simulations became available. With the help of a UCSD School of Medicine student, Computer Gaming World reported that Surgeon (1986) for the Apple Macintosh very accurately simulated operating on an aortic aneurysm. Others followed, such as Life & Death (1988). In 2004, the Society for Simulation in Healthcare (SSH) formed to assist in collaboration between associations interested in medical simulation in healthcare. The need for a \\"uniform mechanism to educate, evaluate, and certify simulation instructors for the health care profession\\" was recognized by McGaghie et al. in their critical review of simulation-based medical education research. In 2012 the SSH piloted two new certifications to provide recognition to educators in an effort to meet this need. ==Modern medical simulation== The American Board of Emergency Medicine employs the use of medical simulation technology in order to accurately judge students by using \\"patient scenarios\\" during oral board examinations. However, these forms of simulation are a far cry from high fidelity models that have surfaced since the 1990s. Due to the fact that computer simulation technology is still relatively new with regard to flight and military simulators, there is still much research to be done about the best way to approach medical training through simulation, which remains un-standardized although much more universally accepted and embraced by the medical community. That said, successful strides are being made in terms of medical education and training. Although amount of studies have shown that students engaged in medical simulation training have overall higher scores and retention rates than those trained through traditional means. The Council of Residency Directors (CORD) has established the following recommendations for simulation # Simulation is a useful tool for training residents and in ascertaining competency. The core competencies most conducive to simulation-based training are patient care, interpersonal skills, and systems based practice. # It is appropriate for performance assessment but there is a scarcity of evidence that supports the validity of simulation in the use for promotion or certification. # There is a need for standardization and definition in using simulation to evaluate performance. # Scenarios and tools should also be formatted and standardized such that EM educators can use the data and count on it for reproducibility, reliability and validity. The Association of Surgeons in Training has produced recommendations for the introduction, availability and role of simulation in surgical training == Clinical Skills and Simulations Centers (CSSC) for Medical Simulation == The two main types of medical institutions that train people through medical simulations are medical schools and teaching hospitals. According to survey results from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), simulation content taught at medical schools spans all four years of study; while hospitals utilize simulations during the residency and subspecialty period. Internal medicine, emergency medicine, obstetrics / gynecology, pediatrics, surgery and anesthesiology are the most common areas taught in medical schools and hospitals. The AAMC reported that there were six main types of simulation centers ‚Äì facility location, centralized, decentralized, mobile units, other or a small mixture of centralized & decentralized and centralized & mobile. Most CSSC are owned by the facilities, 84% for medical schools and 90% for teaching hospitals, the majority of simulation centers where housed in a centralized location, 77% for medical schools and 59% for teaching hospitals. Common medical school CSSC locations contain rooms for debriefs training/scenario, exam /standardized patient rooms, partial task trainer, offices, observation area, control room, class and storage. On average a medical schools CSSC can have around 27 rooms dedicated to training with simulations. == Medical Simulation Centre Design & Operations == A medical simulation centre is an educational centre in a clinical setting. The key elements in the design of a simulation center are building form, room usage and technology. For learners to suspend disbelief during simulation scenarios, it is important to create a realistic environment. It may include incorporating aspects of the environment not essential in simulation activities, but that play a big role in patient safety. For instance, many reports show that patient falls and injuries occur in the hospital bathroom, so the simulation rooms were designed with bathroom spaces. A successful simulation center must be within walking distance of the medical professionals who will be using it. Often, clinical and medical faculty are responsible for the day-to-day operations of simulation centers, typically in addition to other responsibilities. However, the technology that has emerged within medical simulation has become complex, and can benefit from the utilization of specialists. In 2014, Society for Simulation in Healthcare introduced the Certified Healthcare Simulation Operations Specialist (CHSOS) certification. The CHSOS certification endeavors to standardize and authenticate the minimum competencies to be demonstrated by simulation center operations specialists. ==Debriefing & Education in Medical Simulation== Example of a Medical Simulation The origins of debriefing can be traced back to the military, whereby upon return from a mission or war game exercise, participants were asked to gather as a group and recount what had happened. These gatherings had the primary intention of developing new strategies to use in future encounters; these gatherings also provided a learning opportunity for other members of the team who were not present at the events being debriefed. In the field of psychology, debriefing is used in the processing of traumatic events. Here, the emphasis is on the narrative; in a facilitator-led environment, participants reconstruct what happened and review facts, share reactions, and develop a shared meaning of the events. The aim is to reduce stress, accelerate normal recovery, and assist in both the cognitive and emotional processing of the experience.Mitchell, J.T. & Everly, G.S. (1993). Critical incident stress debriefing: An operations manual for the prevention of traumatic stress among emergency services and disaster workers. Ellicott City, MD: Chevron Publishing. In all instances, debriefing is the process by which people who have gone through an experience are intentionally and thoughtfully led through a discussion of that experience. Debriefing in simulation is a critical component of learning in simulation and is necessary to facilitate change ‚Äúon an individual and systematic level‚Äù. It draws from the above-mentioned forms of debriefing, but the emphasis here is on education. Debriefing in education can be described as a ‚Äúfacilitator-led participant discussion of events, reflection, and assimilation of activities into [participants‚Äô] cognitions [which] produce long-lasting learning‚Äù. More specific descriptions of debriefing can be found, such as the following in relation to debriefing in healthcare simulations, described by Cheng et al. (2014): ‚Äú...a discussion between two or more individuals in which aspects of a performance are explored and analysed with the aim of gaining insights that impact the quality of future clinical practice‚Äù. Or another regarding debriefing in gaming, by Steinwachs (1992), ‚Äú‚Ä¶a time to reflect on and discover together what happened during game play and what it all means.\\" ===Debriefing in Medical Simulation=== Medical simulation is often defined as, ‚Äúa technique (not a technology) to replace and amplify real life experiences with guided ones, often ‚Äúimmersive‚Äù in nature, that evoke or replicate substantial aspects of the real world in a fully interactive fashion‚Äù. This definition deliberately defines simulation as a technique and not a technology, implying that simulation is greater than the technology or tools which it adopts. Also note the use of the word guided in the definition, further implying that the interactions which occur in a simulated environment are not left solely to those persons immersed in the simulation, but that a ‚Äúguide‚Äù also be present. This guide may be virtual in nature, such as prompts from a computer program, or may be physically present, in the form of an instructor or teacher. The human guide is often referred to as a ‚Äúfacilitator‚Äù. It is this facilitator who guides the debriefing which occurs after a simulation scenario has completed. When these elements are present, the simulation is often referred to as ‚ÄúInstructional simulation\\", \\"Educational simulation,‚Äù or ‚ÄúSimulation-based learning‚Äù. Favourable and statistically significant effects for nearly all knowledge and process skill outcomes when comparing simulation AND debriefing versus simulation with no intervention (in healthcare) has been shown. When applied in a capacity to further professional development, simulation and debriefing may be referred to as ‚ÄúSimulation-based training‚Äù. === Simulation, Debriefing, & Education Theory === Experiential learning, which draws from prominent scholars such as John Dewey, Jean Piaget, and Carl Rogers, amongst others, underpins simulation- based learning.Zigmont, J. J., Kappus, L. J., & Sudikoff, S. N. (2011, April). The 3D model of debriefing: defusing, discovering, and deepening. Seminars in perinatology, 35(2), 52‚Äì58. WB Saunders. Often referred to as ‚Äúlearning by doing‚Äù, or more broadly, a ‚Äútheory of experience‚Äù,Dewey, J. (1938). Education and experience. New York: Simon & Schuster. Experiential Learning Theory states that experience plays a central role in human learning & development. The six principles of Experiential Learning Theory align with educational simulation. The six principles are: # Engaging students in a process that enhances learning. This includes ‚Äúfeedback on the effectiveness of their learning efforts,‚Äù (p. 194) and focus on the process, not the outcome. # Students have prior beliefs and ideas. A process which draws these beliefs & ideas out, with the intent of re-examining & re-testing them against a topic in order to accommodate new ideas, will lead to learning. # Learning is a process which cycles between reflection and action, feeling and thinking. ‚ÄúConflict, differences, and disagreement are what drive the learning process‚Äù (p. 194); the resolution of these is what leads to learning. # Learning happens in interactions between the person and the environment which surrounds them. # Learning is more than cognition; it also involves thinking, feeling, perceiving, and behaving. # Learning is grounded in constructivist philosophy; ‚ÄúLearning is the process of creating knowledge‚Äù. Simulation also aligns with Guided Discovery learning. Developed by Jerome Bruner in the 1960s, discovery learning also stems from the work of Jean Piaget and can be described as a learning environment where there is little to no instructor-guidance. Guided discovery learning, on the other hand, continues to place learners in a discovery environment, but where an instructor is available to help guide learning via coaching, feedback, hints, and/or modeling. Both Experiential & Discovery Learning are based on constructivist philosophy. Broadly, Constructivism is based on the belief that learning is an active process whereby learners make sense of new knowledge by building upon their prior experiences; each person has a unique set of experiences which frame their interpretation of information.Fosnot, C. T., & Perry, R. S. (1996). Constructivism: A psychological theory of learning. Constructivism: Theory, perspectives, and practice, 2, 8‚Äì33. New York & London: Teachers College Press, Columbia University. ===Debriefing Frameworks=== While many models for debriefing exist, they all follow, at a minimum, a three-phase format. Debriefing models can be divided into two categories: the ‚ÄúThree-Phase Debriefing Structure,‚Äù and the ‚ÄúMultiphase Debriefing Structure‚Äù.  Three- Phase Debriefing Structure  A benchmark in all forms of facilitator- guided, post-event debriefing conversational structures, the three conventional phases of debriefing are: description, analysis, and application. Frameworks which make use of the three-phase debriefing format include Debriefing with Good Judgment, the 3D Model, the GAS model, and Diamond Debrief. = Description = Also labelled as ‚Äúreaction,‚ÄùRudolph, J., Simon, R., Dufresne, R. & Raemer, D. (2006.) There‚Äôs no such thing as \\"nonjudgmental\\" debriefing: a theory and method for debriefing with good judgment. Simulation in Healthcare, 1(1), 49‚Äì55. \\"defusing,\\" \\"gather,\\"Phrampus, P. E., & O‚ÄôDonnell, J. M. (2013). Debriefing using a structured and supported approach. The comprehensive textbook of healthcare simulation, 73‚Äì84. Springer New York. and \\"identify what happened,\\" the description phase of debriefing sees simulation participants describing and exploring their reactions, emotions, and overall impact of the experience. It is the opening phase of systematic reflection, enabled by a facilitator who poses key questions such as: * ‚ÄúHow did that feel?‚Äù * ‚ÄúHow did that go?‚Äù * ‚ÄúCan you take us through the scenario as it unfolded?‚Äù A facilitator is to keep asking these questions of the learners until they feel confident that all participants have voiced their understanding of the situation. The point of the description phase is to identify the impact of the experience, gain insights into what mattered to the participants throughout the simulation, and to establish a shared mental model of the events which occurred. A debate in the healthcare simulation community exists regarding the exploration of feelings in the descriptive phase. One camp believes that the descriptive phase should allow an opportunity for participants to ‚Äúblow off steam,‚Äù and release any tension which may have accumulated during the simulation scenario in order for learners to continue the debrief and subsequent reflection without pent-up emotion. Others believe that the ‚Äúventing‚Äù phase is not necessary and may explicitly make this statement in their debriefing models, or simply omit any reference to emotions or feelings at all. = Analysis = The second phase of debriefing is often referred to as ‚Äúanalysis,‚Äù \\"description,\\" or \\"discovering\\". This is the phase in which the bulk of the time of debriefing is spent, with a focus on participant performance, rationales, & frames. It is meant to be a time of reflective practice on what actually occurred during the scenario, and the reasons why events unfolded as they did. The analysis phase uncovers the decision-making process behind observed actions. Common questions posed, or statements made, by a facilitator during this phase include: * ‚ÄúTell me about [insert performance/event here, i.e. teamwork] during the scenario.‚Äù * ‚ÄúWhat went well? Why?‚Äù * ‚ÄúWhat made things challenging?‚Äù * ‚ÄúWhy do you think that happened?‚Äù Participant performance is a key component during the analysis phase. However, performance can often be a difficult topic to broach with participants, as criticism or constructive feedback often incur negative feelings. There exists a framework for questioning named ‚ÄúAdvocacy-Inquiry,‚Äù or the ‚Äúdebriefing with good judgment‚Äù approach, which aims to reduce negative experiences in medical simulation debriefing. Advocacy Inquiry. The use of advocacy-inquiry (AI) questioning is highly encouraged by nearly all authors of debriefing models. Advocacy-inquiry consists of pairing ‚Äúan assertion, observation, or statement‚Äù (advocacy), together with a question (inquiry), in order to elicit the mental frameworks ‚Äì or schema ‚Äì of both the facilitator and the participants. In phrasing questions this way, participants are made aware of the facilitator‚Äôs own point of view in relation to the question being posed. Note that the use of AI is most encouraged when a facilitator has a judgment about something which was observed during the simulation scenario. Using AI eliminates the tone of judgment as well as the ‚Äúguess what I‚Äôm thinking‚Äù which can occur when asking questions. = Application = The third and final phase of three- phase debriefing structures is most commonly referred to as ‚Äúapplication,\\" or \\"summary\\". Participants are asked to move any newly acquired insights and/or knowledge gained throughout the simulation experience forward to their daily activities or thought processes. This includes learning which may have occurred during the previous phases in the debriefing process. Common questions posed, or statements made, by a facilitator during this phase include: * ‚ÄúWhat are you going to do differently in your practice tomorrow?‚Äù * ‚ÄúWhat new insights have you gained?‚Äù * ‚ÄúWhat one thing will you commit to doing differently after this?‚Äù Note that the summary here is not always in terms of re-stating the major points which were visited throughout the simulation & debrief, but more so emphasize the greatest impact of learning. The summary may be done by either the facilitator or the participants ‚Äì debriefing models differ in which they suggest. In the latter, the participants summarize what was of most value for them. A summary by the facilitator consists of re-stating key learning points which occurred throughout the debrief.  Multi-Phase Debriefing Structure  While all debriefing models include the phases of the three-part debriefing structure, there are several with additional phases. These additions either explicitly call out specific features which may be included in the three-part debriefing model, such as reviewing learning objectives, or provide additional process recommendations, such as immediately re-practicing any skills involved in the original simulation scenario. Examples of multi-phase debriefing structures include the Promoting Excellence and Reflective Learning in Simulation (PEARLS) framework, TeamGAINS, and Healthcare Simulation After-Action Review (AAR). === Learning Objectives === As with any other educational initiative, learning objectives are of paramount importance in simulation and debriefing. Without learning objectives, simulations themselves and the subsequent debriefs are aimless, disorganized, and often dysfunctional. Most debriefing models explicitly make mention of stating learning objectives. The exploration of learning objectives ought to answer at least two questions: What competencies ‚Äì knowledge, skills, and/or attitudes ‚Äì are to be learned, and what specifically should be learned about them? The method of debriefing chosen should align with learning objectives through evaluation of three points: performance domain ‚Äì cognitive, technical, or behavioural; evidence for rationale ‚Äì yes/no; and estimated length of time to address ‚Äì short, moderate, or long. Learning objectives may be predetermined and included in the development of a simulation scenario, or they may be emergent as the scenario unfolds. It can be challenging for the novice facilitator to adapt to emergent learning objectives, as the subsequent discussion may be purely exploratory in nature with no defined outcome. Conversely, the discussion may lead to a specific area of expertise which neither the facilitator nor participants are familiar with. In such situations, the facilitator and participants must be flexible and move on to the next objective, and follow-up with the debriefing of the emergent outcome at a later time. === Environment === The debriefing environment consists of two main features: the physical setting, as well as the psychological environment.  Physical setting  When choosing a space in which to debrief, one must consider whether the scenario which unfolded was a complex case. Complex cases usually involve heightened emotions, interdependent processes, and require more time spent debriefing. As such, it is recommended that these types of debriefings occur in a separate room from where the simulation scenario took place. This allows for a release of tension as participants move from one place to another and encounter new surroundings. Note, however, that it is important to remind participants not to begin debriefing during the walk to the new room. The momentum of the simulation leads participants to begin debriefing with one another as soon the scenario has finished. However, in order to establish a shared mental model with all participants, debriefing must occur in a fashion whereby all participants can hear one another and have a chance to respond. This is difficult to accomplish while walking down a hallway, or in any disorganized fashion. The location of the debriefing is ideally somewhere comfortable and conducive to conversation and reflection, where chairs can be maneuvered and manipulated. It is recommended that, during the debriefing, the facilitator(s) and/or participants be seated in a circle. This is done so that everyone can see each other and increase group cohesion. Furthermore, the use of a circle implies equality amongst the group, and decreases any sense of hierarchy which may be present.  Psychological environment  Establishing psychological safety and a safe learning environment is of utmost importance within both the simulation and the debriefing period. As simulation participants often find the experience stressful and intimidating, worried about judgment from their peers and facilitator(s), establishing safety must be done from the outset of the simulation event. Note that psychological safety does not necessarily equate to comfort, but rather that participants ‚Äúfeel safe enough to embrace being uncomfortable‚Ä¶without the burden of feeling that they will be shamed, humiliated, or belittled‚Äù. It is recommended that establishing safety begin in the pre-brief phase by alerting participants to the ‚Äúbasic assumption.‚Äù The basic assumption, derived from the Centre for Medical Simulation at Harvard University (n.d.), is an agreed upon, predetermined mental model whereby everyone involved in the simulation & debrief believe that all participants are intelligent, well-trained, want to do their best, and are participating to learn and promote development. Additionally, Rudolph et al. (2014) have identified four principles to guide the formulation of a psychologically safe environment: # Communicate clear expectations # Establish a ‚Äúfiction contract‚Äù # Attend to logistic details # Declare & enact a commitment to respecting learners & concern for their psychological safety Included in these principles is the notion of confidentiality. Explicitly reminding participants that their individual performance and debriefing reflections are not meant to be shared outside of the simulation event can help foster participation. Confidentiality builds trust by increasing transparency and allowing participants to practice without fear. ===Evidence & Further Study=== There exists a paucity of quantitative data regarding the effectiveness of debriefing in medical simulation, despite Lederman‚Äôs 1992 seminal Model for the Systematic Assessment of Debriefing. Nearly every article reviewed had a cry for objective studies regarding the effectiveness of debriefing, whether it be comparing: the myriad options of conversational structures, debriefing models, or the comprehensive 5 W‚Äôs of Who ‚Äì debriefer, What ‚Äì content & methods, When ‚Äì timing, Where ‚Äì environment, and Why ‚Äì theory. Currently, there are critical limitations in the presentation of existing studies, a sparsity of research related to debriefing topics of importance, and debriefing characteristics are incompletely reported. Recommendations for future debriefing studies include: * Duration of debriefing * Educator presence * Educator characteristics * Content of debriefing * Structure & method of debriefing * Timing of debriefing and/or: * Who: debriefer number & characteristics * What: the purpose of the debrief, formative vs summative assessment, individual vs team debriefing, method of debriefing, content covered, mechanics, etc. * When: duration, post-event vs during-event vs delayed, etc. * Where: in-situ, separate room, hospital, learning centre, etc. * Why: theoretical underpinning of the debriefing model chosen & rationale * PICO: population, intervention, comparator, outcome Current research has found that simulation training with debriefing, when compared with no intervention, had favourable, statistically significant effects for nearly all outcomes: knowledge, process skill, time skills, product skills, behaviour process, behaviour time, and patient effects. When compared with other forms of instruction, simulation and debriefing showed small favourable effects for knowledge, time & process outcomes, and moderate effects for satisfaction. == Types of Simulations used in Medical Schools and Teaching Hospitals == There many different types of simulations that are used for training purposes. Some of the most known are the use of mannequins (referred to by the simulation company METI as Human Patient Simulators, or HPS for short) and standardized patients. As seen in the chart titled \\"Types of Simulation Used in Medical Education\\" retrieved from the AAMC article, medical schools are leading the way when it comes to the use of standardized patients, but teaching hospitals and medical schools are close when it comes to full-scale mannequins and partial task trainers. === Examples of Full-scale Mannequins.

Kunkler states that, \\"medical simulators can be useful tools in determining a physician's understanding and use of best practices, management of patient complications, appropriate use of instruments and tools, and overall competence in performing procedures.\\" ==Training== The main purpose of medical simulation is to properly educate students in various fields through the use of high technology simulators. According to the Institute of Medicine, 44,000 to 98,000 deaths annually are recorded due primarily to medical mistakes during treatment. Other statistics include: * 225,000 deaths annually from medical error including 106,000 deaths due to \\"nonerror adverse events of medications\\" * 7,391 deaths resulted from medication errors If 44,000 to 98,000 deaths are the direct result of medical mistakes, and the CDC reported in 1999 that roughly 2.4 million people died in the United States, the medical mistakes estimate represents 1.8% to 4.0% of all deaths, respectively. A near 5% representation of deaths primarily related to medical mistakes is simply unacceptable in the world of medicine. Anything that can assist in bringing this number down is highly recommended and medical simulation has proven to be the key assistant. The use of high-fidelity simulation for health professional education is strongly recommended by the WHO because it leads to greater acquisition, retention, and transfer of technical and non-technical skills. In addition to reducing error, simulation is commonly used in medical and nursing education to prepare health professionals to perform sensitive exams such as the breast or pelvic exam or to assist with breastfeeding. ===Examples=== The following is a list of examples of common medical simulators used for training.Kincaid, J.P. & Khaled, A.

In its first season in the fourth division, La Nuc√≠a finished in third position in the regular season, thus qualifying for the promotion playoffs, being eliminated by UD Las Palmas Atl√©tico (1‚Äì1 at home, 1‚Äì2 away loss). The team met the same fate in the following campaign, being ousted by RSD Alcal√° in the third round (0‚Äì2 on aggregate). On 30 June 2019, La Nuc√≠a achieved their first promotion ever to the third division after beating Linares in the last round of the promotion playoffs, with a latest goal in the 93rd minute. It was scored by San Jul√≠an, who gave the historic promotion to the club in the last game of his entire career. ==Season to season== { valign=\\"top\\" width=0% {  - f0f6fa;\\" !Season !Tier !Division !Place !Copa del Rey - 77DD77;\\"1995/96 77DD77;\\"7 77DD77;\\"2¬™ Reg. 77DD77;\\"4th !efefef;\\" - 77DD77;\\"1996/97 77DD77;\\"7 77DD77;\\"2¬™ Reg. 77DD77;\\"6th !efefef;\\" - 77DD77;\\"1997/98 77DD77;\\"7 77DD77;\\"2¬™ Reg. 77DD77;\\"2nd !efefef;\\" - 25A8F9;\\"1998/99 25A8F9;\\"6 25A8F9;\\"1¬™ Reg. 25A8F9;\\"5th !efefef;\\" - 25A8F9;\\"1999/00 25A8F9;\\"6 25A8F9;\\"1¬™ Reg. 25A8F9;\\"7th !efefef;\\" - 25A8F9;\\"2000/01 25A8F9;\\"6 25A8F9;\\"1¬™ Reg. 25A8F9;\\"14th !efefef;\\" - 77DD77;\\"2001/02 77DD77;\\"7 77DD77;\\"2¬™ Reg. 77DD77;\\"7th !efefef;\\" - 77DD77;\\"2002/03 77DD77;\\"7 77DD77;\\"2¬™ Reg. 77DD77;\\"2nd !efefef;\\" - 25A8F9;\\"2003/04 25A8F9;\\"6 25A8F9;\\"1¬™ Reg. 25A8F9;\\"3rd !efefef;\\" - 25A8F9;\\"2004/05 25A8F9;\\"6 25A8F9;\\"1¬™ Reg. 25A8F9;\\"6th !efefef;\\" - 25A8F9;\\"2005/06 25A8F9;\\"6 25A8F9;\\"1¬™ Reg. 25A8F9;\\"1st !efefef;\\" - CECE1B;\\"2006/07 CECE1B;\\"5 CECE1B;\\"Reg.

For other similarly named results, see Birkhoff's theorem (disambiguation). In mathematics, Birkhoff's representation theorem for distributive lattices states that the elements of any finite distributive lattice can be represented as finite sets, in such a way that the lattice operations correspond to unions and intersections of sets. The theorem can be interpreted as providing a one-to-one correspondence between distributive lattices and partial orders, between quasi-ordinal knowledge spaces and preorders, or between finite topological spaces and preorders. It is named after Garrett Birkhoff, who published a proof of it in 1937.. The name ‚ÄúBirkhoff's representation theorem‚Äù has also been applied to two other results of Birkhoff, one from 1935 on the representation of Boolean algebras as families of sets closed under union, intersection, and complement (so- called fields of sets, closely related to the rings of sets used by Birkhoff to represent distributive lattices), and Birkhoff's HSP theorem representing algebras as products of irreducible algebras. Birkhoff's representation theorem has also been called the fundamental theorem for finite distributive lattices.. == Understanding the theorem == Many lattices can be defined in such a way that the elements of the lattice are represented by sets, the join operation of the lattice is represented by set union, and the meet operation of the lattice is represented by set intersection. For instance, the Boolean lattice defined from the family of all subsets of a finite set has this property. More generally any finite topological space has a lattice of sets as its family of open sets. Because set unions and intersections obey the distributive law, any lattice defined in this way is a distributive lattice. Birkhoff's theorem states that in fact all finite distributive lattices can be obtained this way, and later generalizations of Birkhoff's theorem state a similar thing for infinite distributive lattices. ==Examples== The distributive lattice of divisors of 120, and its representation as sets of prime powers. Consider the divisors of some composite number, such as (in the figure) 120, partially ordered by divisibility. Any two divisors of 120, such as 12 and 20, have a unique greatest common factor 12 ‚àß 20 = 4, the largest number that divides both of them, and a unique least common multiple 12 ‚à® 20 = 60; both of these numbers are also divisors of 120. These two operations ‚à® and ‚àß satisfy the distributive law, in either of two equivalent forms: (x ‚àß y) ‚à® z = (x ‚à® z) ‚àß (y ‚à® z) and (x ‚à® y) ‚àß z = (x ‚àß z) ‚à® (y ‚àß z), for all x, y, and z. Therefore, the divisors form a finite distributive lattice. One may associate each divisor with the set of prime powers that divide it: thus, 12 is associated with the set {2,3,4}, while 20 is associated with the set {2,4,5}. Then 12 ‚àß 20 = 4 is associated with the set {2,3,4} ‚à© {2,4,5} = {2,4}, while 12 ‚à® 20 = 60 is associated with the set {2,3,4} ‚à™ {2,4,5} = {2,3,4,5}, so the join and meet operations of the lattice correspond to union and intersection of sets. The prime powers 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 appearing as elements in these sets may themselves be partially ordered by divisibility; in this smaller partial order, 2 ‚â§ 4 ‚â§ 8 and there are no order relations between other pairs. The 16 sets that are associated with divisors of 120 are the lower sets of this smaller partial order, subsets of elements such that if x ‚â§ y and y belongs to the subset, then x must also belong to the subset. From any lower set L, one can recover the associated divisor by computing the least common multiple of the prime powers in L. Thus, the partial order on the five prime powers 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 carries enough information to recover the entire original 16-element divisibility lattice. Birkhoff's theorem states that this relation between the operations ‚àß and ‚à® of the lattice of divisors and the operations ‚à© and ‚à™ of the associated sets of prime powers is not coincidental, and not dependent on the specific properties of prime numbers and divisibility: the elements of any finite distributive lattice may be associated with lower sets of a partial order in the same way. As another example, the application of Birkhoff's theorem to the family of subsets of an n-element set, partially ordered by inclusion, produces the free distributive lattice with n generators. The number of elements in this lattice is given by the Dedekind numbers. ==The partial order of join-irreducibles== In a lattice, an element x is join-irreducible if x is not the join of a finite set of other elements. Equivalently, x is join-irreducible if it is neither the bottom element of the lattice (the join of zero elements) nor the join of any two smaller elements. For instance, in the lattice of divisors of 120, there is no pair of elements whose join is 4, so 4 is join-irreducible. An element x is join-prime if, whenever x ‚â§ y ‚à® z, either x ‚â§ y or x ‚â§ z. In the same lattice, 4 is join-prime: whenever lcm(y,z) is divisible by 4, at least one of y and z must itself be divisible by 4. In any lattice, a join-prime element must be join-irreducible. Equivalently, an element that is not join-irreducible is not join-prime. For, if an element x is not join-irreducible, there exist smaller y and z such that x = y ‚à® z. But then x ‚â§ y ‚à® z, and x is not less than or equal to either y or z, showing that it is not join-prime. There exist lattices in which the join-prime elements form a proper subset of the join- irreducible elements, but in a distributive lattice the two types of elements coincide. For, suppose that x is join-irreducible, and that x ‚â§ y ‚à® z. This inequality is equivalent to the statement that x = x ‚àß (y ‚à® z), and by the distributive law x = (x ‚àß y) ‚à® (x ‚àß z). But since x is join-irreducible, at least one of the two terms in this join must be x itself, showing that either x = x ‚àß y (equivalently x ‚â§ y) or x = x ‚àß z (equivalently x ‚â§ z). The lattice ordering on the subset of join-irreducible elements forms a partial order; Birkhoff's theorem states that the lattice itself can be recovered from the lower sets of this partial order. ==Birkhoff's theorem== Distributive example lattice, with join-irreducible elements a,...,g (shadowed nodes). The lower set a node corresponds to by Birkhoff's isomorphism is shown in blue. In any partial order, the lower sets form a lattice in which the lattice's partial ordering is given by set inclusion, the join operation corresponds to set union, and the meet operation corresponds to set intersection, because unions and intersections preserve the property of being a lower set. Because set unions and intersections obey the distributive law, this is a distributive lattice. Birkhoff's theorem states that any finite distributive lattice can be constructed in this way. :Theorem. Any finite distributive lattice L is isomorphic to the lattice of lower sets of the partial order of the join- irreducible elements of L. That is, there is a one-to-one order-preserving correspondence between elements of L and lower sets of the partial order. The lower set corresponding to an element x of L is simply the set of join- irreducible elements of L that are less than or equal to x, and the element of L corresponding to a lower set S of join-irreducible elements is the join of S. For any lower set S of join-irreducible elements, let x be the join of S, and let T be the lower set of the join-irreducible elements less than or equal to x. Then S = T. For, every element of S clearly belongs to T, and any join- irreducible element less than or equal to x must (by join-primality) be less than or equal to one of the members of S, and therefore must (by the assumption that S is a lower set) belong to S itself. Conversely, for any element x of L, let S be the join-irreducible elements less than or equal to x, and let y be the join of S. Then x = y. For, as a join of elements less than or equal to x, y can be no greater than x itself, but if x is join- irreducible then x belongs to S while if x is the join of two or more join- irreducible items then they must again belong to S, so y ‚â• x. Therefore, the correspondence is one-to-one and the theorem is proved. ==Rings of sets and preorders== defined a ring of sets to be a family of sets that is closed under the operations of set unions and set intersections; later, motivated by applications in mathematical psychology, called the same structure a quasi- ordinal knowledge space. If the sets in a ring of sets are ordered by inclusion, they form a distributive lattice. The elements of the sets may be given a preorder in which x ‚â§ y whenever some set in the ring contains x but not y. The ring of sets itself is then the family of lower sets of this preorder, and any preorder gives rise to a ring of sets in this way. ==Functoriality== Birkhoff's theorem, as stated above, is a correspondence between individual partial orders and distributive lattices. However, it can also be extended to a correspondence between order-preserving functions of partial orders and bounded homomorphisms of the corresponding distributive lattices. The direction of these maps is reversed in this correspondence. Let 2 denote the partial order on the two-element set {0, 1}, with the order relation 0 < 1, and (following Stanley) let J(P) denote the distributive lattice of lower sets of a finite partial order P. Then the elements of J(P) correspond one-for-one to the order-preserving functions from P to 2. For, if ∆í is such a function, ∆í‚àí1(0) forms a lower set, and conversely if L is a lower set one may define an order-preserving function ∆íL that maps L to 0 and that maps the remaining elements of P to 1. If g is any order-preserving function from Q to P, one may define a function g* from J(P) to J(Q) that uses the composition of functions to map any element L of J(P) to ∆íL ‚àò g. This composite function maps Q to 2 and therefore corresponds to an element g*(L) = (∆íL ‚àò g)‚àí1(0) of J(Q). Further, for any x and y in J(P), g*(x ‚àß y) = g*(x) ‚àß g*(y) (an element of Q is mapped by g to the lower set x ‚à© y if and only if belongs both to the set of elements mapped to x and the set of elements mapped to y) and symmetrically g*(x ‚à® y) = g*(x) ‚à® g*(y). Additionally, the bottom element of J(P) (the function that maps all elements of P to 0) is mapped by g* to the bottom element of J(Q), and the top element of J(P) is mapped by g* to the top element of J(Q). That is, g* is a homomorphism of bounded lattices. However, the elements of P themselves correspond one-for-one with bounded lattice homomorphisms from J(P) to 2. For, if x is any element of P, one may define a bounded lattice homomorphism jx that maps all lower sets containing x to 1 and all other lower sets to 0. And, for any lattice homomorphism from J(P) to 2, the elements of J(P) that are mapped to 1 must have a unique minimal element x (the meet of all elements mapped to 1), which must be join- irreducible (it cannot be the join of any set of elements mapped to 0), so every lattice homomorphism has the form jx for some x. Again, from any bounded lattice homomorphism h from J(P) to J(Q) one may use composition of functions to define an order-preserving map h* from Q to P. It may be verified that g** = g for any order-preserving map g from Q to P and that and h** = h for any bounded lattice homomorphism h from J(P) to J(Q). In category theoretic terminology, J is a contravariant hom-functor J = Hom(‚Äî,2) that defines a duality of categories between, on the one hand, the category of finite partial orders and order-preserving maps, and on the other hand the category of finite distributive lattices and bounded lattice homomorphisms. ==GeneralizationsInfinite distributive lattices=== In an infinite distributive lattice, it may not be the case that the lower sets of the join-irreducible elements are in one-to-one correspondence with lattice elements. Indeed, there may be no join-irreducibles at all. This happens, for instance, in the lattice of all natural numbers, ordered with the reverse of the usual divisibility ordering (so x ‚â§ y when y divides x): any number x can be expressed as the join of numbers xp and xq where p and q are distinct prime numbers. However, elements in infinite distributive lattices may still be represented as sets via Stone's representation theorem for distributive lattices, a form of Stone duality in which each lattice element corresponds to a compact open set in a certain topological space. This generalized representation theorem can be expressed as a category-theoretic duality between distributive lattices and spectral spaces (sometimes called coherent spaces, but not the same as the coherent spaces in linear logic), topological spaces in which the compact open sets are closed under intersection and form a base for the topology.. Hilary Priestley showed that Stone's representation theorem could be interpreted as an extension of the idea of representing lattice elements by lower sets of a partial order, using Nachbin's idea of ordered topological spaces. Stone spaces with an additional partial order linked with the topology via Priestley separation axiom can also be used to represent bounded distributive lattices. Such spaces are known as Priestley spaces. Further, certain bitopological spaces, namely pairwise Stone spaces, generalize Stone's original approach by utilizing two topologies on a set to represent an abstract distributive lattice. Thus, Birkhoff's representation theorem extends to the case of infinite (bounded) distributive lattices in at least three different ways, summed up in duality theory for distributive lattices. ===Median algebras and related graphs=== Birkhoff's representation theorem may also be generalized to finite structures other than distributive lattices. In a distributive lattice, the self-dual median operation. :m(x,y,z)=(x\\\\vee y)\\\\wedge(x\\\\vee z)\\\\wedge(y\\\\vee z)=(x\\\\wedge y)\\\\vee(x\\\\wedge z)\\\\vee(y\\\\wedge z) gives rise to a median algebra, and the covering relation of the lattice forms a median graph. Finite median algebras and median graphs have a dual structure as the set of solutions of a 2-satisfiability instance; formulate this structure equivalently as the family of initial stable sets in a mixed graph.A minor difference between the 2-SAT and initial stable set formulations is that the latter presupposes the choice of a fixed base point from the median graph that corresponds to the empty initial stable set. For a distributive lattice, the corresponding mixed graph has no undirected edges, and the initial stable sets are just the lower sets of the transitive closure of the graph. Equivalently, for a distributive lattice, the implication graph of the 2-satisfiability instance can be partitioned into two connected components, one on the positive variables of the instance and the other on the negative variables; the transitive closure of the positive component is the underlying partial order of the distributive lattice. ===Finite join-distributive lattices and matroids=== Another result analogous to Birkhoff's representation theorem, but applying to a broader class of lattices, is the theorem of that any finite join-distributive lattice may be represented as an antimatroid, a family of sets closed under unions but in which closure under intersections has been replaced by the property that each nonempty set has a removable element. ==See also== *Lattice of stable matchings, also representing every finite distributive lattice ==NotesReferences== *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *.

The closest city is Balmorhea, Texas. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department manages the park. The park is open year- round, and visitation is capped at 900 people per day. ==Features== The main feature of the park is the , freshwater pool built around the springs. It is the world‚Äôs largest spring-fed swimming pool. The spring has a constant flow of 22 to a day so no chlorination is required. The water temperature ranges from and up to deep. The pool bottom is flat in the more shallow areas and has a more natural rock bottom in the deeper areas. The pool is used for both swimming, snorkeling and scuba diving. ==History== The Texas State Parks Board bought San Solomon Springs and the surrounding land in 1934. Company 1856 of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) built the pool between 1936 and 1941 as part of the New Deal during the Great Depression as a way to open up jobs for people needing work. The CCC also built San Solomon Springs Courts, which rents rooms available for overnight stays. Camping and recreational vehicle sites are also available. A private concessionaire operated the facility until 1968, when the Parks and Wildlife Department took over management, and it became part of the state parks system. The Balmorhea State Park Cienega Project, started in 1995, recreated a desert wetland in the park. The original cienega was lost when the CCC channeled water from the springs in to the pool. The cienega now serves as a habitat for endangered fish such as the Comanche Springs pupfish and Pecos gambusia as well as other aquatic life, birds and other animals. In early 2018, a wall in the pool around the diving board collapsed, and the pool was shut down. Houston-based Apache Corporation pledged to match all donations made to repair the pool up to one million dollars. The goal was reached in about four months. Sixty percent of the donations were under $100, however, other Texas companies made significant contributions, including Saulsbury Industries, Texas Pacific Land Trust, McCoy Remme Ranches, Legend Energy Services, Pioneer Energy Services and Garrison Brothers Distillery. Apache Corporation also established a one million dollar endowment fund for the park. The pool reopened March 1, 2019 after repairs to the pool were completed. Currently only day-use facilities are available as the renovation of San Solomon Courts and campgrounds are still under way with no predicted reopening date. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department shut the park again on September 3, 2019 to repair the park's failing septic system. The park is expected to reopen in the spring of 2020.

Lieutenant William Hamilton of Gilbertfield in Lanarkshire still owned Ladyland, but rented Gilbertfield, where he lived, making only the occasional visit to Ladyland. William was a published poet and a friend and correspondent of the poet Allan Ramsay. In 1722, Hamilton published an abridged and modernised version of Blind Harry's Wallace, which, though an artistic failure, aroused Robert Burns's boyhood interest and enthusiasm and, as he recorded in the Autobiographical Letter: 'poured a Scottish prejudice in my veins which will boil along there till the flood gates of life shut in eternal rest.'Blind Harry and 'Wallace'.

In 1803 their son William succeeded and married Catherine Hamilton on 5 September 1815. Catherine was a distant relation of the Hamiltons of Ladyland. They had two daughters, Agnes and Janet Glasgow Cochran; the eldest inherited upon his death in 1832; she had married William Charles Richard Patrick in April 1832.

Robert William Cochran-Patrick (1842‚Äì1897) was Dean of Faculties at Glasgow University, 1882 to 1885 and was awarded an honorary LLD by the University in 1879. Robert was born at Ladyland and studied at the University of Edinburgh and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He returned to Ayrshire to live the life of a country gentleman and study archaeology, becoming a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland and of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and in 1874 he was one of the founders of the Ayrshire and Wigtownshire Archaeological Association. Robert was best known as a numismatist and he assembled one of the country's greatest collections of early Scottish coins and medals. He wrote the two volumes of 'Records of the Coinage of Scottish.'Cochran-Patrick, R. W. (1876), Records of the Coinage of Scotland. Pub. Edmonston and Douglas, Edinburgh.

As stated Hugh or Hew Barclay of Ladyland was a Roman Catholic and became involved in a plot in 1592 and upon discovery he was imprisoned in the Tolbooth in Edinburgh, but was released, by the King's directions, in 1593 following assurances of good conduct. Hugh again became involved in plotting, for which he was imprisoned for a time in the Castle of Glasgow, but escaped and fled to Spain where he was in communication with Jesuits. In 1597 he returned and took possession, with several others, of Ailsa Craig. He was intent on using it as a provisioning and stopping off point for a Spanish invasion that would re- establish the Catholic faith in Scotland--a plot originally established by the Earls of Angus, Errol, and Huntly.Dobie, James D. (ed Dobie, J.S.) (1876). Cunninghame, Topographized by Timothy Pont 1604‚Äì1608, with continuations and illustrative notices. John Tweed : Glasgow, pp. 308‚Äì9. He was discovered on Ailsa Craig by the Protestant Minister of Paisley, Andrew Knox, and upon being discovered and reflecting upon his previous assurances of good conduct, he either tried to escape and had an accidental death or he deliberately drowned himself in the sea off the island. He had been a close friend of Alexander Montgomerie of Hessilhead, the famous poet, to whom he had on one occasion addressed his own poetry. Metcalfe records that Knox actually reached Ailsa Craig first and Hugh drew his sword, found himself under determined attack and falling into the sea, drowned. Knox was charged with Hugh's death by his friends, however upon appeal to the King in Council, his actions were justified as loyal and good service done to His Majesty and country. The King forbade any to molest him, and charged all magistrates and others in office to assist in protecting him.* Metcalfe, William M. (1905).

Ladyland or Lady LandAitken, Robert (1827), Map of the Parish of Kilbirnie. Castle (NS 3230 5791) was the caput of the Barony of Ladyland and was a typical tower house of the 16th-century, probably with three storeys and a typical corbelled parapet around the roof; each corner originally having a small turret, later modified, probably in 1669, when a typical pitched roof was added and the building made more comfortable and less defensive for William Hamilton of Ardoch who obtained the property from the Earl of Eglinton. A more impressive door was created at the existing first floor level, a pediment above being inscribed with W.H. I.B. and dated 1669. This inscription refers to Hamilton and his Barclay bride. This pediment survives and is now above the gateway into the walled garden. The castle had low buildings either side that looked a little like wings, and were probably for stables and storage. A sundial dated 1673 survives, and may have been built to commemorate the completion of the 'modernisation' works. In the walled garden, another stone, dated 1817, bears the inscription W.C. C.H.. Workers discovered a cavity in one of the walls when the castle was being partially demolished in 1815;Paterson, James (1863‚Äì66). History of the Counties of Ayr and Wigton.

Two of the urns had handles and all were tightly closed with shreds or trimmings of woven cloth. One of the urns contained the breast and side bones of a chicken and the others a sort of greasy soil. A coin was found in the grounds near the old tower, bearing the legend 'FESTINA LENTE' ('Make Haste Slowly'); other details being too worn too make out.Paterson, James (1863‚Äì66).

A portion of the castle survives, about 20 feet long and 25 feet in height, forming the north elevation of the walled garden. It has an elliptical gun port in it and a rectangular window. Some square bee bole recesses are also present. In 1691 the Hearth Tax records show that Ladyland had ten hearths and eighteen other dwellings were associated with the estate.Urquhart, Robert H. et al. (1998). The Hearth Tax for Ayrshire 1691. Ayrshire Records Series V.1. Ayr : Ayr Fed Hist Soc . p. 79 W. C. Patrick of Ladyland strengthened the walls of Glengarnock Castle in 1841 as recorded on a tablet attached to the building. ==Ladyland House and stables== Ladyland House from the main driveway. A view of Glengarnock Castle with the tablet recording repairs by Cochran of Ladyland. Ladyland House is an A-listed building about two miles from Kilbirnie, and is one of David Hamilton's most picturesque country houses, designed for William Cochran. The large pilasters on each corner are a distinguishing feature for this architect and an interesting feature is the tartan-checked window-bar pattern and bold corner quoins. The nearby stables were designed by Brown & Wardrop Architects, most likely by Francis Drummond Greville Stanley in 1860 and 1861, who adopted a style similar to Hamilton. The stables have since been carefully converted into private dwellings; possibly incorporating original 17th-century building work in their wings.Love, Dane (2003), Ayrshire : Discovering a County. Ayr: Fort Publishing. , p. 73.Close, Robert (1992), Ayrshire and Arran: An Illustrated Architectural Guide. Pub. Roy Inc Arch Scot. , p. 94. The house was built sometime between 1816‚Äì1821. In 1925 a wing designed to blend in with the original house was added by the architect James Houston of Kilbirnie. The house was purchased in 2017 by Dr. Kiril Sharapov and the landscape architect, Colin Burden. ===The Ladyland sundials=== The 1821 sundial inscribed to William Cochran and his wife Catherine Hamilton.MacGibbon, T. and Ross, D.

A Scottish sundial at the stables is dated 1821, and may commemorate the completion of building works, as with the fine example of a 1673 Scottish sundial--originally from the old castle--that now stands in front of the mansion house. The older sundial stands on a pedestal more like those usually found with horizontal dials, and bears the monogram M.P.C. The 1821 dial may not have originally been made for its current graceful and highly ornamented pedestal.MacGibbon, T. and Ross, D. (1887‚Äì92). The castellated and domestic architecture of Scotland from the twelfth to the eighteenth centuries, 5v, Edinburgh. ===The policies and curtilage=== A Sycamore covered with epiphytic Common Polypody ferns growing in the Ladyland Glen. The Ladyland Burn runs through the site, probably deriving its name from a typical pre-reformation chapel, long forgotten, such as those at Trearne, Blair House, Chapeltoun House, etc. The Maich Water rises from Mistylaw Muir and runs through an attractive Glen nearby with a small reservoir upstream created by Renfrew County Council of old. The Maich Water forms the Local Authority boundary here and harbours a geocache upon its course before it empties into Kilbirnie Loch. The Smuggler's Cave is on the side of the Maich Water, formerly reached through an entrance guarded by sandstone pillars off the driveway. An impressive main entrance off the road from Ford Cottage sets the stage for the rural and aristocratic nature of Ladyland. The 'Sheep Linn' is situated on the Maich Water above Cockston Farm. ===Maich Water and Ladyland Moor=== A waterfall on the Maich Water near Ladyland. The Scottish Wildlife Trust have designated these areas as part of a Provisional Wildlife Site under the title 'Glengarnock and surrounding uplands'. The following plants are rare species found here ‚Äî Whorled Caraway (Carum carvi), Fragrant Orchid (Gymnadenia conopsea), Aspen (Populus tremulans), Ivy-leaved Crowfoot (Ranunculus hederaceus L. ), Dovedale Moss or Mossy Saxifrage (Saxifraga hypnoides), Hairy Stonecrop (Sedum villosum), Wilson's Filmy Fern (Hymenophyllum wilsonii), Bay Willow (Salix pentandra), Beech Fern (Phegopteris connectilis), Oak Fern (Gymnocarpium dryopteris) and Mountain Pansy (Viola lutea).Paul, L. and Sargent, J. (1983), Wildlife in Cunninghame. Vol. II. Site 64. ===The De'il's Chuckie Stane, the Cat Craig and archaeological finds=== Near the Ladyland Burn beneath a copse of trees to the side of the mansion house is the 'De'il's Chuckie Stane' as indicated on old maps. It has survived being broken up and does not seem to be a glacial erratic, unlike many other obvious 'erratic' stones that have become linked to local folklore traditions.Love, Dane (2009). Legendary Ayrshire. Custom : Folklore : Tradition. Auchinleck : Carn Publishing. . p. 25 No surviving local legends have explained its evocative name. Chuckie's are pebbles, often made of quartz, a white stone, which this stone is not.Warrack, Alexander (1982). \\"Chambers Scots Dictionary\\". Chambers. . Its significance most likely links with an emphasis on the implied giant stature of the De'il if this is his 'chuckie stane'. The Cat Craig is located beside the lane running up to Cockston farm and is one of two drystone wall enclosed crags. The name 'Cat' is applied to many stones, such as the 'Cat Stone' on the Isle of Arran near the village of CorrieHall, T. S. (1960). Tramping in Arran. Edinburgh : Gall & Inglis. Page 59 and the Cat Stane near Edinburgh Airport.Wickham-Jones, C. R. (2009), The Landscape of Scotland. Stroud : The History Press. . pp. 23 - 24. 'Cat' is thought to come from 'Cath', a Celtic word, meaning a 'battle.' The Norwegian term, 'Bauta Stein', means the same thing. The first edition of the OS 6 inch maps shows a 'Castle Hill' in line with Cockston Farm on the other side of the Maich Water and this may make the meaning of the name 'Cat Craig' more plausible. Cockston Farm and sheep fauld date from at least 1827. About 1810, Mr. Cochran of Ladyland removed a stone cairn near Ladyland above the Ford farmhouse during agricultural improvements; an urn with burnt bones was found in the centre of it. At Ladyland itself a small bronze axe was dug up. It measures 5 3/8 inches by 3 inches wide. This axe is a Coles' type I, found at NS 322 578; it was donated to the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland (NMAS) in 1886 by R W Cochran-Patrick (Accession no: DC 53). It has slight flanges and a stop ridge. Image:Deil's Chuckie Stane at Ladyland.JPGThe Chuckie stone amongst the trees with Ladyland house in the background.

On the hills above Ladyland are the signs left by ancient cultivation of the land at a time when the climate was more appropriate for growing crops in these elevated situations. These cultivation marks were difficult to explain in times past and they were referred to as 'Elf furrows'.Smith, John (1895). Prehistoric Man in Ayrshire. Pub. Elliot Stock. p. 77. ==Micro-history== Captain William Hamilton had been a privateer during the second Dutch War and following the flight of King James II he was the captain of a cruiser fighting on the side of William and Mary. He was killed in 1689 aboard his ship when engaged in an action against French ships off Ireland who were engaged in transporting Jacobite troops to Mull.History Scotland. Vol. 11, No.1., Page 30. Little Auchenbourach Hill The ancestors of the Cochran-Patricks lived originally at Edge whose ruins still stand on the hillside overlooking the road to Muirshiel Country Park, just beyond Clovenstone Cottage. Aiton in 1811 records that J. Cochrane Esq experimented with improving coarse hill pastures by diverting a mountain rill to run over it the site and as a consequence the pasture greatly improved, enough to yield a good crop of hay. His neighbours had scorned the expense of enclosing the land with a dyke, however he proved them wrong.Aiton, William (1811). General View of The Agriculture of the County of Ayr; observations on the means of its improvement; drawn up for the consideration of the Board of Agriculture, and Internal Improvements, with Beautiful Engravings. Glasgow. p. 402 Commemorative cairn on the summit of Little Auchenbourach Hill. On the summit of Little Auchenbourach hill, above Calder glen, is a cairn of stones surrounded by metal railings. A plaque on this cairn commemorated William Arthur Cochran-Patrick, son of R W Cochran-Patrick, who was born on 12 June 1860, and died on 29 January 1881 aged 20 of tetanus whilst studying at Cambridge University. A Latin inscription translates as 'You were loved by all.' The Cochran-Patricks of Ladyland owned Auchenbourach Hill. The monument was financed by William's friends and the tenants of Ladyland. Eleanora Cochran-Patrick, a daughter of RW Cochran-Patrick married Sir Neil James Kennedy, however he took his wife's surnames to preserve the ancient family patronym.Lochwinnoch Village Website Retrieved 2010-11-24 In June 1911 the Misses Cochrane-Patrick of Ladyland House were driving home in their waggonette from the Kerse Mission on a Sunday night; the horse shied at a dog on the roadside and fell, overturning the machine at the same time. Miss Harriet Cochrane-Patrick who was driving was thrown to the ground and a wheel of the waggonette passed over her right shoulder while her sister, Miss Cochrane-Patrick was pinned to the ground by the overturned machine lying on her breast. The coachman, William Benson, jumped from the back seat and held the horse down till the ladies were extricated by some people who witnessed the accident. Benson had his right hand severely injured. The horse was badly hurt and the waggonette smashed. Mr Simpson of Langslie Farm, conveyed the ladies home in his machine and they were afterwards attended by Dr Milroy and Nurse Cooper. Miss Cochrane-Patrick was almost unconscious from bruises and shock and Miss Harriet Cochrane-Patrick was also bruised, but fortunately no bones were broken. Both ladies were very popular for their charitable work in the Kilbirnie and Beith districts.Alarming Accident == See also == * Hessilhead == References  External links == * General Roy's Military map of Scotland * William Hamilton of Gilbertfield Category:Castles in North Ayrshire Category:Category A listed buildings in North Ayrshire Category:Listed castles in Scotland ","title":"Barony of Ladyland"},{"id":"20489460","text":"The Tampa Bay Rays Radio Network is a 21-station radio network (19 AM, 2 FM plus 2 FM translators) in the southeastern United States and Pennsylvania that broadcasts baseball games and related programming for the Tampa Bay Rays of Major League Baseball.

It is sponsored by a coalition of multinational corporations, non-profit organizations, and universities. ==History== On October 29, 2008, the Global Network Initiative (GNI) was founded upon its \\"Principles of Freedom of Expression and Privacy\\". The Initiative was launched in the 60th anniversary year of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), and is based on internationally recognized laws and standards for human rights on freedom of expression and privacy set out in the UDHR, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). ==Profile== As a human rights organization, GNI seeks to safeguard freedom of expression and personal privacy against government restrictions. The protections are facilitated by a coalition of companies, investors, civil society organizations, academics, and other stakeholders. GNI esteems freedom of expression and privacy each as a \\"human right and guarantor of human dignity\\". Participants are expected to respect and protect information available to users and users' ability to freely create and distribute information, provided that they operate outside narrowly defined circumstances necessary to adhere to international laws and standards set by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Participants are also expected to protect users' personal information from illegal or arbitrary interference when confronted with government demands, laws, or regulations that compromise a user's privacy. The same principle of adherence of international laws and standards applies. Collaboration among stakeholders is key to the goals of the Global Network Initiative. The GNI's outline of principles encourages participants to explore ways to engage governments advance their cause, individually or collectively. GNI recognizes that the actions of their corporate participants alone cannot guarantee the protection of human rights. One fundamental commitment is to promote the adoption of laws, policies, and practices that protect freedom of expression and privacy. GNI considers governments to be ultimately responsible for the fulfillment of their citizens' human rights, specifically pursuant to freedom of expression and privacy. ==Staff and Board of Directors == *Judith Lichtenberg, Executive Director *Mark Stephens (solicitor), Independent Chair ICT Companies: Miranda Sissons, Facebook Lewis Segall, Google Steve Crown, Microsoft/LinkedIn Fiona Cura-Pitre, Nokia Yves Nissim, Orange Anita Househam, Telenor Group Patrik Hiselius, Telia Company Nicole Karlebach, Verizon Media Laura Okkonen, Vodafone Group Civil Society Organizations: Greg Nojeim, Center for Democracy & Technology Robert Mahoney, Committee to Protect Journalists Charles Bradley, Global Partners Digital Julie Owono, Internet sans Fronti√®res Kat Duffy, Internews Academics and Academic Organizations: Jessica Fjeld, Berkman Klein Center Meg Roggensack, Georgetown University (Independent) K.S.

Now located within Buffalo National River, the district includes ruins dating from 1880 to 1940. The area was an important part of what became known as the North Arkansas Lead and Zinc District, and played a role in the development of railroads and modern infrastructure in the area. During World War I the Rush Creek mines were the center of the zinc industry in Arkansas. Ten mining companies operated 13 developed mines within the district, more than in any other mining district within the North Arkansas District. The buildings, structures, and ruins at Rush are the last visible remains of historic zinc mining activity in Arkansas. Of the other mining districts which once stretched across northern Arkansas, only limited debris now marks those sites. Rush is the only area left to retain not only the mines, but also buildings, structures, and ruins pertaining to mining and community life. The Rush Historic District exists today within the same environment and setting as it did during its periods of historic significance. Nearly as isolated today as it was historically, it has been little touched by time. The ghost town, mines, and waste piles visible on the bluffs immediately set the flavor of the district as an abandoned mountain mining community.

Al-Ghanim earned a BSc in mechanical engineering from Seattle University and worked for Boubyan Petrochemical Company before being elected to the National Assembly in 2006. He is the son of Ali Mohammed Thunayan Al- Ghanim and Faiza Al-Kharafi. He was elected as the Speaker in 2013.Former Presidents of the National Assembly ==Family Background== Marzouq Al-Ghanim's father, Ali Mohammed Thunayan Al-Ghanim is the Chairman of Ali Alghanim & Sons Company, a multi-line conglomerate which includes the BMW car dealership in Kuwait, and is formerly the Chairman of the Kuwait Chamber of Commerce and Industry. His paternal uncle, Fouad Mohammed Thunayan Alghanim, is Chairman of Fouad Alghanim & Sons Group of Companies, a multi-line conglomerate consisting of a number of fully and partly owned subsidiary companies based in the U.S., Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Ethnically, the Al-Ghanim claim descent from the 30 or so Bani Utub families (historically urban Sunnis from Najd known locally as \\"Neyada\\") which settled Kuwait along with the Sabah and by the first decades of the twentieth century comprised the narrow and well- established elite. Marzouq Al-Ghanim's mother, Faiza Al-Kharafi, is a former proctor of Kuwait University and heir to the M. A. Kharafi & Sons conglomerate. His maternal uncle, Jassem Al-Kharafi was speaker of the Kuwait National Assembly for 12 years. ==Political Career== On December 19, 2006, parliament voted 39-20 to reject a bill that would have seen the government write off $27bn of its citizens' private debts. Marzouq al-Ghanem voted against the bill, telling the assembly, \\"What do we tell those who did not borrow? What do we tell those who paid back their loans or part of their loans?\\" On April 25, 2007, MP Saleh Ashour called in a statement for reopening Kuwait's embassy in Baghdad and for strongly supporting the government in Baghdad. But al-Ghanim said he believes that it was too early to reopen the Kuwaiti embassy in Baghdad and that this issue should wait until security situations improve. On February 8, 2008, al-Ghanim, as head of the Youth and Sports Committee, agreed reform the Kuwaiti football program in line with the recommendations of FIFA. In November 2007, FIFA had suspended Kuwait from all international matches because of governmental interference in the national football program. The dispute originated with Kuwait's October 9 elections for key posts in the country's soccer federation. FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) refused to recognise the polls. FIFA said Kuwait had ignored the two bodies' \\"road map\\" of reforms requiring them to set up an interim board to organize fresh elections and draft new guidelines to prevent governmental interference in the game. On September 28, 2008, al-Ghanim, along with MPs Abdullah Al-Roumi, Ali Al-Rashid, and Adel Al-Saraawi have proposed a draft law which suggests that the government fund Kuwaiti students' higher education at private colleges. According to the bill, the government would bear half of the expenses for students enrolled in private universities in Kuwait, excluding Kuwait University. On December 28, 2008, Kuwaiti lawmakers Mikhled Al-Azmi, Musallam Al-Barrak, Marzouq al-Ghanim, Jaaman Al-Harbash, Ahmad Al-Mulaifi, Mohammad Hayef Al-Mutairi, Ahmad Al-Saadoun, Nasser Al-Sane, and Waleed Al-Tabtabaie protested in front of the National Assembly building against the attacks by Israel on Gaza.

The Chorus Master is Gavin Carr. == Foundation == The Philharmonia Chorus was founded in 1957 by Walter Legge as a choral counterpart to the Philharmonia Orchestra which he had founded twelve years earlier. The Chorus‚Äôs first concert, a performance on 12 November 1957 of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, completed a cycle of Beethoven symphonies in London‚Äôs Royal Festival Hall with the Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Otto Klemperer and was recorded with the same performers. To create his chorus, Legge turned to Wilhelm Pitz, then chorus master of the Bayreuth Festival. Between the first rehearsal in February 1957 and first concert there was a long period of preparation during which Pitz rehearsed the Chorus in not only the scheduled Beethoven but also in choral passages from Wagner‚Äôs Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg. From that preparatory work emerged a chorus unique for its blend of the British choral tradition and German musical training and discipline, and for a dramatic quality found more typically in opera than in a symphony chorus. The full yet homogeneous and professionally disciplined sound immediately attracted critical notice. == Early years == Under Legge‚Äôs management and Pitz‚Äôs training the Chorus worked with many of the most distinguished conductors of the time: Wolfgang Sawallisch, Sir Thomas Beecham, Herbert von Karajan, Leopold Stokowski, Sir John Barbirolli, Sir Adrian Boult and - in a relationship that became especially close - Carlo Maria Giulini. Benchmark recordings of Lucia di Lammermoor with Maria Callas and Tullio Serafin, Sir William Walton conducting his own Belshazzar's Feast, Brahms Ein deutsches Requiem, Beethoven‚Äôs Fidelio and Mahler‚Äôs Second Symphony under Klemperer, and Verdi Requiem and Quattro Pezzi Sacri with Giulini won particular acclaim. Tours followed to the Edinburgh Festival, to Lucerne, and with Giulini to Parma where the audience in the Teatro Regio paid it the remarkable compliment of showering carnations on this British chorus singing Verdi to Italians. == Self-governance == When Legge relinquished management in 1964, the re-formed New Philharmonia Chorus became a self-governing body independent of the Philharmonia Orchestra with a Council of Management of twelve Directors elected by the members, a system of governance which remains in place today. The first concert of both New Philharmonia Orchestra and New Philharmonia Chorus took place on 27 October 1964, a performance of Beethoven‚Äôs Ninth Symphony again conducted by Klemperer. In succeeding years the Chorus performed and recorded works with further renowned conductors: Lorin Maazel, George Szell, Daniel Barenboim and Rafael Fr√ºhbeck de Burgos (notable recordings of Mendelssohn‚Äôs Elijah, Orff‚Äôs Carmina Burana and Haydn's Die Sch√∂pfung), and further collaborations with Walton, Benjamin Britten conducting his Spring Symphony, and a landmark performance, later released on LP and then CD, of Britten‚Äôs War Requiem conducted by Giulini, with Britten himself conducting the chamber ensemble. During the 1960s the Chorus was considered by many critics to be the finest symphony chorus in the UK and perhaps also in Europe. On his retirement in 1971, Wilhelm Pitz was succeeded as Chorus Master by Walter Hagen-Groll (from the Deutsche Oper of West Berlin), in 1975 by Norbert Balatsch (chorus master of both the Vienna State Opera and the Bayreuth Festival), in 1980 by Heinz Mende (former chorus master of the Chor des Bayerischen Rundfunks in Munich), and then in 1984 by Horst Neumann (chorus master of the MDR Rundfunkchor). == Re-instatement of the original name == On 1 September 1977 the Chorus was able to take back its former name, Philharmonia Chorus, and later the same month gave two performances of Mahler‚Äôs Eighth Symphony in Belgium with the similarly reinstated Philharmonia Orchestra under Michael Tilson Thomas. These years saw the Chorus tour widely throughout Europe: several staged operas in the Roman Th√©√¢tre Antique d‚ÄôOrange, Haydn‚Äôs Die Sch√∂pfung in Paris and London to celebrate the UK‚Äôs entry into the European Economic Community in 1973, Handel‚Äôs Judas Maccabeus with Sir Charles Mackerras at the Teatro alla Scala Milan in 1980 followed ten years later by a second appearance at La Scala in Bach‚Äôs Mass in B minor under Giulini. A 1979 recording of Mozart‚Äôs Requiem with the Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Giulini won the 1981 Grammy Award for Best Choral Performance. In the UK there were engagements with Riccardo Muti, Sir Georg Solti, Lovro von Mataƒçiƒá, Giuseppe Sinopoli (appointed Principal Conductor of the Philharmonia Orchestra in 1984 and with whom the Chorus appeared in Parma and Taormina), Rafael Kubelik, Kurt Sanderling (including the Chorus' second recording of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony), Sir Andrew Davis, Seiji Ozawa, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Bernard Haitink, Charles Dutoit, and in 1980 the Chorus's first appearance at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden in a performance of Verdi‚Äôs Requiem at the Rudolf Kempe Memorial Concert. A second appearance in the same House six years later in Britten‚Äôs War Requiem with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sir Simon Rattle was a Memorial Concert for Sir Peter Pears. These years also saw the Chorus appearing regularly in the UK outside London with notable visits to Cardiff, Brighton, Nottingham, Derby, Cheltenham, Cambridge and Aldeburgh. At Aldeburgh in 1985 the Chorus gave the world premi√®re of Britten's unfinished final composition Praise We Great Men, with the Philharmonia Orchestra under Mstislav Rostropovich, and three years later took part in a semi-staged performance of Britten's Paul Bunyan. Two years later in 1988 a particular honour was paid the Chorus: an invitation to perform in Mahler‚Äôs Eighth Symphony in Amsterdam‚Äôs Concertgebouw to mark the 100th Anniversary of the Concertgebouw Orchestra and concert hall, the hall‚Äôs re-opening after renovations, and Bernard Haitink‚Äôs last concerts as chief conductor of the Concertgebouw Orchestra. == New horizons == In 1992 David Hill became Chorus Master and Artistic Director. Director of Music at Westminster Cathedral and later at Winchester Cathedral, he was the first Briton to hold the post. He was succeeded in 1998 by Robert Dean, formerly Head of Music at Scottish Opera and Professor of Singing at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama. In these years the Chorus performed Rachmaninov‚Äôs Vespers in Westminster and Winchester Cathedrals and recorded it, accompanied Luciano Pavarotti ‚Äúin the Park‚Äù and at Leeds Castle, remixed Beatles numbers, and performed before HM The Queen for the 50th Anniversary of VE Day. At London's Royal Festival Hall, its traditional home, the Chorus appeared regularly with Claus Peter Flor and the Philharmonia Orchestra's then Principal Guest Conductor, Leonard Slatkin. In December 1997 the Chorus celebrated its 40th Birthday with its patron The Prince of Wales in attendance at a Gala performance of Verdi‚Äôs Requiem with the Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by James Levine, followed three days later by a performance of Mahler‚Äôs Eighth Symphony with the same conductor. During this period the Chorus performed for the first time with Valery Gergiev and Sir Mark Elder. Several European tours of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony followed with Giulini and the European Community Youth Orchestra, with Sir Yehudi Menuhin and the Sinfonia Varsovia, and in December 1999 with Sir Simon Rattle and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, culminating in a Millennium Concert broadcast by BBC Television from Ely Cathedral. Other overseas tours took place to Strasbourg, the first visit to the US (to Baltimore), and in 2000 the Chorus was invited to perform in the Vatican's Paul VI Audience Hall for Pope John Paul II on his 80th birthday. In autumn 2002 the Chorus joined the orchestra and chorus of Norddeutscher Rundfunk and the BBC Singers in the presence of the President of Germany Johannes Rau and former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev for a concert of reconciliation, Britten‚Äôs War Requiem conducted by Mstislav Rostropovich, performed in the Turbine Hall of the former Nazi rocket development factory in Peenem√ºnde, north Germany. In 2004, following a semi-staged concert performance of Weber‚Äôs Der Freisch√ºtz at the Edinburgh Festival the previous year, Sir Charles Mackerras agreed to become the Chorus‚Äôs first President, which post he held until his death in 2010. The 50th anniversary was celebrated in June 2007 with a performance of Verdi‚Äôs Requiem with the Philharmonia Orchestra under Riccardo Muti in the presence of their Patron The Prince of Wales. In Autumn 2008 Edward Caswell became Artistic Director, training the Chorus for a performance of Bernstein‚Äôs Kaddish Symphony in London‚Äôs Barbican Centre conducted by John Axelrod in a concert to mark the 70th Anniversary of Kristallnacht. == Recent developments == In April 2010 the Philharmonia Chorus returned to its tradition of German musical training with the appointment as Chorus Master of the Berlin-based conductor Stefan Bevier who was himself also a singer as well as being a former player with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. Earlier the same year was launched the Philharmonia Chorus Professional Singer Scheme, through which specially auditioned professional singers in the early years of their career join a pool, to be drawn on when required. Then in 2013 was launched the Student Singer Scheme to attract to the Chorus as members young singers with potential to progress to a professional career. The resultant choral make-up thus blends amateur singers with student and professional singers. The Chorus‚Äôs performing repertory continues to combine new or seldom heard works with choral staples. The Chorus gave the London premi√®re of Jeajoon Ryu‚Äôs Sinfonia da Requiem with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, and the world premi√®re of John Powell‚Äôs A Prussian Requiem with the Philharmonia Orchestra. The Chorus‚Äôs several appearances at the ‚ÄúEaster at King‚Äôs‚Äù Festival conducted by Stephen Cleobury and broadcast by BBC Radio from King‚Äôs College Chapel Cambridge have included James MacMillan‚Äôs recently composed St John Passion in the presence of the composer, Frank Martin‚Äôs Golgotha in the presence of the composer‚Äôs widow, and Herbert Howells‚Äôs Stabat Mater. Opera in concert performances have included Der fliegende Holl√§nder, Fidelio and Die Fledermaus. There have been recordings with Benjamin Zander of Beethoven‚Äôs Ninth Symphony and Mahler‚Äôs Second Symphony. Performances including Brahms‚Äôs Ein deutsches Requiem, Beethoven‚Äôs Ninth Symphony and Missa solemnis, Mahler‚Äôs Second and Eighth Symphonies, Britten‚Äôs War Requiem and Verdi‚Äôs Requiem have been given with conductors including Christoph von Dohn√°nyi, Charles Dutoit, Daniele Gatti, Daniel Harding, Vladimir Jurowski, Lorin Maazel, Paul McCreesh, Andris Nelsons, Gianandrea Noseda, Vasily Petrenko and Esa-Pekka Salonen. The Chorus has also performed in live showings of the films Amadeus, Breakfast at Tiffany's and Gladiator. A performance in Hamburg of Elgar‚Äôs The Dream of Gerontius conducted by Sir Jeffrey Tate, a former member of the Chorus, led to his appointment as President, which position he held until his death in 2017. The Chorus has continued to tour abroad, performing in Germany at the Rheingau Festival, and in Spain and France, with several appearances in Valencia with the Orquesta de Valencia conducted by Yaron Traub and in Lille with the Orchestre National de Lille including a cycle of Mahler Symphonies under Alexandre Bloch and Poulenc's late work Sept r√©pons des T√©n√®bres. Other highlights have included performances of Berlioz‚Äôs Grande Messe des morts with the Orchestre National de Lyon under Leonard Slatkin in Lyon and in the composer‚Äôs birthplace of La C√¥te-St-Andr√©, and Beethoven‚Äôs Missa solemnis under Sir Jeffrey Tate in the opening festival of Hamburg‚Äôs remarkable new Elbphilharmonie, the Chorus being the sole British group to be so featured. The Chorus's 60th Anniversary in November 2017 was celebrated with a performance of Walton‚Äôs Belshazzar‚Äôs Feast with the Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Edward Gardner. Following Stefan Bevier's sudden death in January 2018, another singer and conductor, Gavin Carr, was appointed Chorus Master. Before Covid-19 brought activity to a halt Gavin had prepared the Chorus for performances in London, Bath and Lille, a particular highlight being the performance of Berlioz's Grande Messe des morts with the Philharmonia Orchestra in St Paul's Cathedral under John Nelson to mark the sesquicentenary of the composer's death. The Chorus has a full programme in waiting as soon as Covid-19 allows, including appearances in London, King's College Cambridge and Lille. == Chorus Masters == 1957-1971 Wilhelm Pitz 1971-1975 Walter Hagen-Groll 1975-1980 Norbert Balatsch 1980-1983 Heinz Mende 1984-1992 Horst Neumann 1992-1998 David Hill (Artistic Director) 1998-2007 Robert Dean (Artistic Director) 2008-2010 Edward Caswell (Artistic Director) 2010-2018 Stefan Bevier 2018 Gavin Carr == Accompanists == The Chorus has had four Accompanists: first, Viola Tunnard, followed in 1962 by her duet partner Martin Penny, both collaborators with Britten at Aldeburgh. From 1984 to 2012, the Accompanist was Stephen Rose, Senior Coach at the Opera department of the Guildhall School of Music & Drama and of the National Opera Studio in London.

He was a member of the Kuwaiti National Assembly, representing the fourth district. ==Background== Born on January 30, 1956, Al-Barrak studied geography and worked in the Municipal Council before being elected to the National Assembly in 1996. Al-Barrak affiliates with the Popular Action Bloc. Al-Barrak had been elected for six consecutive terms, making him the longest-serving member of parliament. == Parliamentary career == Al-Barrak was a member of the opposition parliamentary group Popular Action Bloc. In the 2006 parliamentary election, he won re- election with over 8,000 votes, the highest total in the election and an all- time record. In the February 2012 parliamentary election, Al-Barrak set a national record for the highest votes received in Kuwait elections history more than 30.000 votes. In 2011 and 2012, Al-Barrak played a significant role in protests. In April 2012, he was stripped of his parliamentary immunity by the National Assembly for participating in the storming of the parliament building by protesters. In October 2012, Al-Barrak made a speech in which he broke with Kuwaiti precedent by saying that \\"we will not allow you (Sabah Al- Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah) to rule individually...\\" He was arrested on 29 October for undermining the Emir and released on bail four days later. On 15 April 2013, he was sentenced to two years in prison. In May 2003, Al-Barrak spoke against visiting Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri, criticizing him for opposing the US-led invasion of Iraq. Holding an egg, he said: \\"This is what you are worth Hariri,... a rotten egg from the Kuwaiti people\\". Along with other Popular Action Bloc MPs, he criticized the government's Project Kuwait, which proposed international development of northern oil fields; Al- Barrak stated that they should be developed by a Kuwaiti company. In 2006, he and fellow MP Ahmad Al-Saadoun questioned the government's cancellation of several contracts, and began meeting with the Audit Bureau. Also in 2006, he and Mohammed Al-Sager led the opposition to Minister of Information Mohammed Al-Sanousi's re-appointment, due to the limits they said he had placed on freedom of the press. Al-Sanousi resigned on 17 December 2006, one day before he was due to be grilled by parliament. Al-Barrak suggested Al-Sanousi had been forced to quit, calling it \\"a victory for the constitution, democracy and freedom\\". Public prosecutors requested in July 2010 that the National Assembly strip Al-Barrak of his parliamentary immunity so that he could face charges of harming the national security, but the request was refused. In December 2010, the television station Al Jazeera was shut down in Kuwait after refusing to censor a broadcast of a telephone interview with Al-Barrak. Following the incident, Al-Barrak, Jamaan Al-Harbash and Saleh Al-Mulla called for Prime Minister Nasser Al-Mohammad Al-Sabah to be grilled before parliament. On December 29, Al-Barrak and nine others filed a motion of no-confidence against the PM. In August 2011, following reports that some MPs had received millions of dinars to their accounts, Al-Barrak called for the governor of the Central Bank of Kuwait to resign. In November, he participated in the storming of the parliament by protesters calling for Nasser Al Mohammad Al Sabah's resignation for corruption charges. He told reporters, \\"We are now waiting for the dissolution of government and the parliament ... Until this happens, Wednesday was only the first step among many. We don't fear anything except God.\\" == Loss of immunity and arrest == In April 2012, the Public Prosecutor requested that the National Assembly strip Al-Barrak of his parliamentary immunity for his role in the November 2011 storming of the parliament. On April 24, the Assembly voted in favor of removing Al-Barrak's immunity, as well as that of eight other MPs. On 20 June, the Constitutional Court ruled the February 2012 parliamentary elections unconstitutional, dissolving the new parliament in favor of the previous. Al-Barrak assailed the decision, calling it a \\"blatant attack on the choice of the people\\" and \\"a coup against the constitution\\". Al- Barrak was arrested on 29 October for charges of \\"undermining the status of the emir\\". On 1 November, thousands of people marched to the prison to protest his arrest. After the crowd refused an order to disperse, police fired smoke bombs and tear gas to break up the protest. Amnesty International issued a statement on Al-Barrak's behalf, stating that he had been detained \\"purely for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression\\" and calling for the charges against him to be dropped. On 15 April 2013, Al-Barrak was sentenced to two years in jail for his critical comments about the Emir. Thousands of people took to the streets in protest of the verdict. A lawyer for Al-Barrak stated that \\"the ruling is null and void because it violated the legal procedures and for failing to provide the defence team with sufficient guarantees\\". The Kuwaiti Ministry of Information released its own statement saying that \\"Kuwait has a transparent and independent judicial system ... All citizens, regardless of their position, are equal in the eyes of the law. Anyone accused of a crime in Kuwait will get a fair trial with a comprehensive legal defense and open appeals process.\\" == Release == On 21 April 2017, he was released by authorities after serving a two-year prison sentence in Kuwait's Central Prison. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1956 births Category:Members of the National Assembly of Kuwait Category:Popular Action Bloc politicians ","title":"Musallam Al-Barrak"},{"id":"20489740","text":"A tramp bike is a specifically converted BMX bike that can be used on a trampoline.

Born in 1955, Al-Sane obtained a PhD in Business Administration before being elected to the National Assembly in 1992. While political parties are illegal in Kuwait, Al-Sane affiliates with the Islamist Hadas party. ==Opposes Project Kuwait== Project Kuwait is a $7 billion, 25-year plan, first formulated in 1997 by the SPC, to increase the country's oil production (and to help compensate for declines at the mature Burgan field), with the help of international oil companies. In particular, Kuwait aims to increase output at five northern oil fields (Abdali, Bahra, Ratqa, Raudhatain, and Sabriya) from their current rate of around to within three years. Al-Sane opposes Project Kuwait and allowing foreign oil companies into Kuwait. On December 23, 2005, Al-Sane told the press that he opposed the entry of these foreign companies because it is barred by the constitution: \\"The step the government wants to take is against the law, and we have to stand against it strongly...

The MPs claimed that the awarding of the contracts was not made under the country's Tenders Law which governs all major public contracts. The MPs also threatened to grill Al-Olaim if he signed the contracts and demanded that the project be scrutinized by the Audit Bureau to make sure that it did not involve squandering of public funds. After initially rejecting the calls, the minister later bowed to pressure and agreed to ask the cabinet to refer the project to the Bureau. Al-Sane strongly defended Olaim and alleged that vested interests were behind the attacks on the minister. Al-Olaim was a leading member of the Hadas party to which Al-Sane belongs. ==Protested Against Israeli Attacks== On December 28, 2008, Kuwaiti lawmakers Mikhled Al- Azmi, Musallam Al-Barrak, Marzouq Al-Ghanim, Jaaman Al-Harbash, Ahmad Al- Mulaifi, Mohammad Hayef Al-Mutairi, Ahmad Al-Saadoun, Nasser Al-Sane, and Waleed Al-Tabtabaie protested in front of the National Assembly building against the attacks by Israel on Gaza.

He worked in a wide variety of genres and provided illustrations for magazines such as ' (Ivy), ' (Ears) and Tygodnik Ilustrowany. He was also the author of some popular historical novels. == Biography == He was born to a middle-class family and his father worked in the Bochnia Salt Mine. When he was of age, he was sent to Krak√≥w to attend a gymnasium. After graduating in 1879, he was undecided about his future, simultaneously studying philosophy at the Jagellonian University and painting at the Academy of Fine Arts. Couple Playing Checkers (1894) After two years, he decided to devote himself entirely to art. Izydor Jab≈Ço≈Ñski, W≈Çadys≈Çaw ≈Åuszczkiewicz, Florian Cynk, Leopold L√∂ffler and Jan Matejko were among his teachers. During this time, he received several awards from the Krak√≥w Society of Friends of Fine Arts. In 1886, he continued his studies in Vienna under August Eisenmenger and was later in Munich,Brief biography @ the Museum of Bochnia. where he studied with Alexander von Wagner and Alexander von Liezen- Mayer. After returning home, he became a regular exhibitor with the Krak√≥w Society, showing 142 works in all. He also had exhibits at the Zachƒôta. His first solo exhibit was in 1893. Two years later, after travelling in Austria and Germany, with a brief stay in Warsaw, he returned to Bochnia and opened a studio which became a gathering point for artists of the Young Poland movement. In 1898, to counter the dominance of German and Austrian painters in the art print business, he founded the publishing house, \\"Bochni Wydawnictwo Obraz√≥w Tre≈õci Religijnej\\", which later became the art publisher \\"Stella\\". He served as artistic director and many of the works presented were later issued as color postcards. In 1900, he helped organize a major exhibition of Polish artists in Kiev. Pilgrims at Jasna G√≥ra Monastery (postcard from 1914) After 1901, his interests turned from painting to literary work. He wrote historical novels, short stories and three volumes of humorous sketches, all of which proved to be very popular. He also became interested in the sculptor, Veit Stoss (Wit Stwosz), a major figure in Medieval Krak√≥w. After extensive research, he concluded that Stoss was actually of Polish, not German origin, and wrote several works supporting that thesis.

The present product portfolio consists of trumpets, cornets, flugelhorns, trombones, and a baritone horn. Four generations of the Getzen family have participated in the company. Most Getzen instruments are rated well by consumers, and it is well known for its custom line of Edwards trumpets and trombones. ==HistoryFounding=== In 1939, Anthony James (T.J.) Getzen founded the Getzen Company, in Elkhorn, Wisconsin. Getzen had trained in instrument repair with the C.G. Conn company and worked as a plant superintendent for the Frank Holton Company. Initially opened as a repair shop, the company expanded after World War II to instrument manufacture. In 1946, Getzen produced its first trombones. In 1947, Getzen started producing trumpets and cornets as well. In 1949, J. Robert Getzen, T.J.'s son, assumed the position of plant superintendent, and Getzen started to produce piston bugles. These bugles became popular with Drum and Bugle Corps.Brian Priestly, Tony Bacon, Dave Gelly and Paul Trynka, The Sax and Brass Book, Backbeat Books, San Francisco, California, 2007 ===Expansion and sale=== In 1959, J. Robert Getzen left the company to found Allied Music. His brother Donald Getzen briefly assumed the leadership of the company in 1960 and acquired control of the Hoosier Band Instrument Company. Late in 1960, the family sold the company to attorney Harold M. Knowlton. No longer a family-owned business, the company continued to follow the same business model, expanding its visibility through an association with trumpeter Carl ‚ÄúDoc‚Äù Severinsen of The Tonight Show fame. In addition to the marketing aspect, this association also produced the Getzen 900 Severinsen Model Eterna trumpet. Producing both student and professional lines, the Getzen company was preparing to expand in October 1963 when the existing facility was destroyed by fire. The new factory opened in February 1964 with only a brief interruption in business.Happy Anniversary, The Getzen Gazette, February 4, 2009 Founder T.J. Getzen died in 1968. ===Modern family business=== In 1985, Harold Knowlton sold Getzen to Charles F. Andrews, and the same year, J. Robert Getzen sold Allied Music to his sons Thomas and Edward. Edward concurrently founded Edwards Trombones. Charles Andrews lost control of the company in bankruptcy in 1991, and the Getzen brothers purchased the firm's assets. Transitioning Allied Music to the original role of the Getzen Company, instrument repair only, the family focused on the Getzen name for brass instrument manufacture with Edwards as a subsidiary. In 1999, Thomas Getzen bought out his brother to become sole owner of the Getzen Company. In 2003, J. Robert Getzen died. In 2009, two of Thomas Getzen's sons were working for the company maintaining the family business model under the leadership of their father. ==Products== The Getzen Company produces a line of trumpets including the professional level Genesis and Artist lines, the beginner level 300 and 400 series, the step-up line Capri and 700 series, and the semi-pro Eterna series. Additionally, the company builds two models of piccolo trumpet (Capri and Eterna), a herald trumpet, bass trumpet, and field trumpet.Brown, Joshua, Getzen Company Website Product Catalogue, The Getzen Company http://www.getzen.com/ The instruments are particularly known for their reliable and durable piston valves. The company also produces cornets in the 300, 400, Capri, 700, Eterna, and Custom series. flugelhorns are available in the Capri, Eterna, and Custom series. Trombones are produced in the 300, 400, Capri, 700, Eterna, Custom, and Custom Reserve series.

Anderson (1919‚Äì1994) was the first African American to receive a Ph.D. in Meteorology. He was a dean at University of Wisconsin, Madison. ==BiographyHigher education and army life=== Anderson was born August 13, 1919, in Clayton, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. His mother and father were from Mississippi. He earned a bachelor of science degree in Chemistry in 1941 from Lincoln University and received high accolades as he graduated third in his class. Lincoln University was also the place where he met his wife-to- be, Marjorie Anderson. Upon graduating, World War II had begun and enlisted in U.S. Army Air Forces. He was assigned to the meteorology division and Anderson claims that this came about due to the process of elimination. The Army sent him, along with 150 other cadets to the University of Chicago to study meteorology. While there along with an exceptionally heavy academic course load, Anderson also underwent physical training, weapons training, and specific training in military intelligence. Anderson completed this training in May 1943 and earned his meteorological certification. Upon finishing, he was stationed in Tuskegee, Alabama where he was assigned as a weather officer for the 332nd Fighter Group now known as the Tuskegee Airmen. After his service in Tuskegee, Anderson became a squadron weather officer and trained fighter pilots across the country. ==Post-war career== Anderson temporarily left the Army Air Corps after the war to pursue an opportunity in high polymer chemistry at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in 1946. After receiving his master's degree, Anderson became a research and development officer for Watson Laboratories, supervising the works of many notable German scientists. In 1955, Anderson decided to further pursue his academic studies and applied to the doctoral program in Meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. During this time he wrote his dissertation: \\"A Study of the Pulsating Growth of Cumulus Clouds.\\" Anderson earned his Ph.D. in 1960, becoming the first African American to earn a Ph.D. in Meteorology. ==References * Answers.com Charles Anderson * The Faces of Science: African Americans in the Sciences Category:1919 births Category:1994 deaths Category:United States Army Air Forces officers Category:American meteorologists Category:Polytechnic Institute of New York University alumni ","title":"Charles E.

The academy is situated at Shikri Ghanem military base, Faiyadiyeh, Baabda District, and is attached administratively to the command and administration department. It is one of the oldest military institutions in Lebanon, and was founded in Damascus in 1921 under the French mandate. ==History== Following World War I, the French Army organized different army units in the mandated countries. As a result, the necessity for national officers, translators and specialists was needed in order to establish departments for these units and then to become preparation for their independence. A Military School was established in Damascus in 1921 to prepare and train officers needed for these new units. In 1932, the Military School was relocated to Homs. The managerial Staff of the School during that period consisted of a school commander (a French Officer), a commander assistant (a Lebanese or Syrian officer) and training officers with their Non-Commissioned Officers‚Äô assistants (Lebanese, Syrian or French). The enrollment and graduation took place during the month of October of every year. The provisos of admission to the military academy back then required an individual to be 18 to 25 years of age, hold a brevet certificate, pass the admissions test and to be a Lebanese or Syrian national or have a Lebanese or Syrian father. The military school trained cadets for various periods, 3 years for those who were not proficient in French, 2 years for those who were proficient in French and one year for Non-Commissioned Officer‚Äôs. At the end of the training period, they graduate and get promoted to lieutenant rank according to a degree. During the graduation ceremony which is often chaired by the Syrian prime minister, the graduating officers are given Platoon commander certificate each in his own specialty (Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery, Engineering) and a certificate of competence for the rank of lieutenant. After the graduation, the officers are assigned to different army units where they establish the necessary departments and units in order to train, habilitate and lead. On August 15, 1945, the school barracks were handed over to the Syrian authorities and the Lebanese and French units moved to Lebanon. Instructors and students joined the Kobbeh barracks in Tripoli and they were put administratively under the authority of the third battalion's company located there. After that, students were given a 15 days leave and joined a camp in Kousba. On September 25, the school moved to St. Anthony convent in Baabda, and settled there for about a year. On October 14, 1946, the school moved to Shikri Ghanem base, the buildings consisted of barracks that were used by the British before they left Lebanon and the school remained in this location till now. On December 31, 1951, the Lebanese president Bechara El Khoury inaugurated the school's new buildings. ==Mission== The mission of the military academy is to habilitate and train: * Students officers to become 2Lt as a platoon leader in the various branches (Army, Navy, Airforce, Internal Security, Customs, General Security, State security). * Specialized officers recruited as experienced officers according to their fields of studies. * Subordinate officers (Company Commander Course, or divers courses). * conscription officers (military draft Officers). * NCOs who are eligible to become officers. ==EnrollmentAdmission requirements=== The current requirements a candidate must possess and have are: #Lebanese citizen for more than 10 years. #Age: between 18 and 24 #Not governed by felony or the attempt of a felony of any kind, or by disgraceful misdemeanor or the attempt of an indecent misdemeanor, or by imprisonment for a period that exceed six months and these judgments applied on people who benefit from the pardon (general pardon or special pardon). #Bachelor, divorced or widower (no children). #Good reputation, not addicted to alcohol, gambling or drugs. #Lebanese baccalaureate II or its equivalence. #Fit for military service and actions. #Undergo a test and be chosen according to his level. #Ready to sign a contract for a period which is defined by the institute that he is applying for. #Ready to commit in writing when accepted and before entering the military school his readiness to break ties and cancellation of his affiliation to any party, association, or union and the non attendance of their meetings. ===Admission tests=== The admission test to the military school goes through four phases: * First phase: IQ test. * Second phase: physical fitness test. * Third phase: Medical test. * Fourth phase: writing and evaluation test.

It is adapted from the novel of the same title by Fernando Vallejo. == Synopsis == Fernando (Germ√°n Jaramillo) meets Alexis (Anderson Ballesteros), a handsome gay youth, at a party of one of his old friends and immediately falls for him. The two begin a relationship which, apart from the sex, consists mainly in Fernando telling Alexis how pastoral the city was when he left, while Alexis explains to Fernando the ins and outs of everyday robbery, violence, and shootings. Even though Fernando has come home to die, his sarcastic worldview is mellowed somewhat by his relationship with Alexis. He soon discovers that Alexis is a gang member and hitman (or sicario) himself, and that members of other gangs are after him. After several assassination attempts fail because of Alexis' skillful handling of his Beretta, he is finally killed by two boys on a motorcycle. Fernando is partly responsible for this, as Alexis' weapon has been lost before the murder due to Fernando's suicidal impulses. Fernando visits Alexis' mother and gives her some money, and then walks through the streets aimlessly when he encounters Wilmar (Juan David Restrepo), who bears a striking resemblance to Alexis, not only in his looks but in his entire manner. He invites Wilmar for lunch and the two begin an affair, rekindling the kind of relationship he had with Alexis. Wilmar is also a killer, but it is a shocking revelation to Fernando when he finds out that Wilmar is the one who shot Alexis. He vows to kill Wilmar, but then learns it was Alexis who started the violence by killing Wilmar's brother, calling for vengeance on him by Wilmar. When Wilmar goes to say goodbye to his mother before he and Fernando leave the country together, he is killed as well. Seeing that the vicious cycle of atrocities in Medell√≠n denies happiness, Fernando presumably commits suicide, if the last scene is taken to hint at that. ==Cast== *Germ√°n Jaramillo as Fernando *Anderson Ballesteros as Alexis *Juan David Restrepo as Wilmar *Manuel Busquets as Alfonso == Film production == The film was shot with early high-definition video cameras (Sony HDW-700) in the year 2000.

The three men were able to escape from their cells and leave the island in a raft. The fate of the escapees after they entered San Francisco Bay has remained unknown. A fourth inmate, Allen West, did not manage to escape his cell in time to join the others and decided to abort his escape attempt. The escape was marked by elaborate planning and execution, including crafting dummy heads to fool the guards, and the manufacture of improvised tools and a raft. In 1979, the FBI officially closed its investigation, concluding that the men drowned in San Francisco Bay, while trying to reach land. However, the US Marshals Service has continued to keep the escapees on its wanted list. New circumstantial and material evidence has continued to surface, stoking further research and debates on whether the inmates managed to survive. == Previous attempts == Of the 36 inmates who staged 14 escape attempts over the 29 years that Alcatraz served as a federal penitentiary, twenty-three were recaptured, six were shot and killed, two drowned, and five (three being Morris and the Anglins and the other two being Theodore Cole and Ralph Roe) are listed as \\"missing and presumed drowned.\\" == Inmates  Frank Morris === Frank Lee Morris (September 1, 1926 ‚Äì disappeared June 11, 1962) was born in Washington, D.C. He was abandoned by his mother and father during his childhood, and orphaned at age 11, and spent most of his formative years in foster homes. He was convicted of his first crime at age 13, and by his late teens had been arrested for crimes ranging from narcotics possession to armed robbery. He spent most of his early years in jail serving lunch to prisoners. As he got older, he was arrested for grand larceny in Miami Beach, for stealing cars and armed robbery. The associate warden's record card at Alcatraz Prison lists his \\"Crimes Involved\\" as \\"Juv. Deliq.-2; Runaways-2; Breaking & Entering-1; Burglary-1; Narcotics & Armed Robbery-1; Unlawful Flight, Mann Act, & Bank Robbery-1.\\" Morris reportedly ranked in the top 2% of the general population in intelligence, as measured by IQ testing, displaying an IQ of 133. He served time in Florida and Georgia, then escaped from the Louisiana State Penitentiary while serving 10 years for bank robbery. He was recaptured a year later while committing a burglary and sent to Alcatraz on January 20, 1960 as inmate number AZ1441. === John and Clarence Anglin === The Anglin brothers, John William (May 2, 1930 ‚Äì disappeared June 11, 1962) and Clarence (May 11, 1931 ‚Äì disappeared June 11, 1962) were born into a family of thirteen children in Donalsonville, Georgia. Their parents, George Robert Anglin and Rachael Van Miller Anglin, were seasonal farm workers; in the early 1940s, they moved the family to Ruskin, Florida, 20 miles south of Tampa, where the truck farms and tomato fields provided a more reliable source of income. Each June they migrated north as far as Michigan to pick cherries. Clarence Anglin was known to have a tattoo of \\"Zona\\" on his left wrist and one of \\"Nita\\" on his right upper arm. The brothers worked as farmers and laborers. Clarence was first caught breaking into a service station when he was just 14 years old. They began robbing banks and other establishments as a team in the early 1950s, usually targets that were closed, to ensure that no one got injured. They claimed that they used a weapon only once, during a bank heist ‚Äì a toy gun. They were arrested in 1958 after robbing the Bank of Columbia branch in Columbia, Alabama. In 1958 John Anglin robbed the Columbia, Alabama, Columbia Savings Bank Building with a toy gun together with his brothers Clarence and Alfred. Both received 15-to-20-year sentences, which they served at Florida State Prison, Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary, and then Atlanta Penitentiary. After repeated failed attempts to escape from the Atlanta facility, the brothers were transferred to Alcatraz. John arrived on October 24, 1960, as inmate AZ1476, and Clarence on January 10, 1961, as inmate AZ1485. === Allen West === Allen Clayton West (March 25, 1929 ‚Äì December 21, 1978) was born in New York City. He was imprisoned for car theft in 1955, first at Atlanta Penitentiary, then at Florida State Prison. After an unsuccessful escape attempt from the Florida facility, he was transferred to Alcatraz in 1957 and became inmate AZ1335. When West was transferred to Alcatraz, he was 28 years old and had the education of an eighth grader. West was arrested over 20 times throughout his lifetime. In December 1978, suffering severe abdominal pains, West was sent to the Shands Teaching Hospital, where he died of acute peritonitis on December 21 at the age of 49. == Escape == Escapee's prison cell, with widened vent opening beneath the sink. As soon as the four inmates were assigned adjacent cells in December 1961, they began formulating the escape plan together, though always under the leadership of Morris, the chief mastermind and unilateral orchestrator of the plot. It helped to ensure their mutual trust that they already knew each other from their time in an Atlanta prison years before. Over the subsequent six months, the men widened the ventilation ducts beneath their sinks using discarded saw blades found on the prison grounds, metal spoons smuggled from the mess hall, and an electric drill improvised from the motor of a vacuum cleaner. The men concealed the progress of their holes with walls of painted cardboard, and the noise of their work with the louder noise of Morris‚Äô accordion on top of the ambient din of music hour. Once the holes were wide enough to pass through, the escapees nightly accessed the utility corridor left unguarded directly behind their cells' tier and climbed to the vacant top level of the cellblock, where they set up a clandestine workshop unbeknownst to prison staff. Here, with over fifty raincoats among other stolen and donated materials, they constructed life preservers, based on a design one of them chanced to find in Popular Mechanics, as well as a six-by-fourteen-foot rubber raft, the seams carefully stitched by hand and sealed by steam pipes' heat. Having manufactured the raft, they inflated it with a concertina rigged to serve as bellows and furnished the necessary paddles from scrap wood and pilfered screws. Finally, they climbed up a ventilation shaft bound for the roof, and, finding a ponderous fan-grille in the way, removed the rivets holding it in place. Dummy head found in Morris' cell. The broken nose resulted when the head rolled off the bed and struck the floor after a guard reached through the bars and pushed it. The men concealed their absence while working outside their cells‚Äîand after the escape itself‚Äîby sculpting dummy heads from a home-made papier- m√¢ch√©-like mixture of soap, toothpaste, concrete dust, and toilet paper, and giving them a realistic appearance with paint from the maintenance shop and hair from the barbershop floor. With towels and clothing piled under the blankets in their bunks and the dummy heads positioned on the pillows, they appeared to be sleeping. On the night of June 11, 1962, with all preparations in place, the men began their escape. However, the cement employed to shore up crumbling concrete around West's vent had hardened, diminishing the hole in size and fixing the grill in place. By the time he managed to remove the grill and re-widen the hole to egress, the others had already left, as he was soon to discover; he busted out to the prison roof only to return to his cell around sunrise and go to sleep.Full text of Alcatraz Escape FBI Files. Archive.org, retrieved November 2, 2015. West went on to cooperate fully with investigators and give them a detailed description of the escape plan, in consequence of which he was not punished for his role in it. Unguarded utility corridor behind the escapees' cells. From the service corridor, Morris and the Anglins climbed the ventilation shaft to the roof. Guards heard a loud crash as they broke out of the shaft, but since nothing further was heard, the source of the noise was not investigated. Hauling their gear with them, they descended to the ground by sliding down a kitchen vent pipe, then climbed two barbed-wire perimeter fences. At the northeast shoreline, near the power plant‚Äîa blind spot in the prison's network of searchlights and gun towers‚Äîthey inflated their raft with the concertina. At some time after 10 p.m., investigators estimated, they boarded the raft, launched it and departed toward their objective, Angel Island, two miles to the north. == Investigation == FBI wanted poster of John Anglin. The escape was not discovered until the morning of June 12, 1962, due to the successful dummy head ruse. At the time of the escape, Warden Olin G. Blackwell was on vacation in Lake Berryessa in Napa County, California, and he did not believe the men could have survived the waters and made it to shore. In a joint effort, multiple military and law- enforcement agencies conducted an extensive air, sea, and land search over the next 10 days. On June 14, a Coast Guard cutter picked up a paddle floating about off the southern shore of Angel Island. On the same day and in the same general location, workers on another boat found a wallet wrapped in plastic complete with names, addresses, and photos of the Anglins' friends and relatives. On June 21, shreds of raincoat material, believed to be remnants of the raft, were found on a beach not far from the Golden Gate Bridge. The following day, a prison boat picked up a deflated life jacket made from the same material off of Alcatraz Island. No other physical evidence of the men's fate was ever found.Kerr, J. (October 17, 1993). Flight from Alcatraz. SunSentinel.com, retrieved June 7, 2016. According to the final FBI report, the escapees' raft was never recovered. The FBI officials were, at least publicly, positive the men had drowned. They cited the fact that \\"the individuals' personal effects were the only belongings they had, and the men would have drowned before leaving them behind.\\" However, when authorities searched for bodies, none were found. Patrick Mahoney, who ran the launch that traveled between Alcatraz and the mainland, had some doubts that the men perished, saying \\"I felt that they didn't make it, but I thought we'd find a body. We didn't find a body.\\" As U.S. Marshal Michael Dyke told the news, the bodies of two out of every three people who go missing in San Francisco Bay are eventually recovered. During the investigation, Robert Checchi, a San Francisco police officer, said that at 1 a.m. on the morning of June 12, he saw an illegal boat in the bay near Alcatraz. A few minutes later, the boat left heading under the Golden Gate Bridge. This led to speculation that the prisoners might well have enlisted outside confederates to pick them up by boat.Riddle of the Rock: The Only Successful Escape from Alcatraz During the investigation, the FBI dismissed Checchi's account out of hand. According to FBI reports, on July 17, 1962, a month after the escape, a Norwegian ship, SS Norefjell, spotted a body floating in the ocean from the Golden Gate Bridge. The ship did not retrieve the body and did not report the sighting until October.Leithead, A. (June 12, 2012). Alcatraz escape still surprises, 50 years on. BBC.com. San Francisco County Coroner Henry Turkel cast doubt on speculation that it could have been one of the escapees, emphasising the improbability that a body would still be floating on the surface of the ocean after more than a month; instead, Turkel proposed that the corpse may have been that of Cecil Phillip Herrman, a 34-year-old unemployed baker who had committed suicide by jumping from the Golden Gate Bridge five days earlier. Several coroners from neighbouring counties challenged Turkel's opinion, stating that it was possible the remains had belonged to one of the escapees.Escaping Alcatraz: The Untold Story of the Greatest Prison Break in American History Human bones were located eight months after the escape, having washed up on the shore to the north of the Golden Gate Bridge at Point Reyes, near the place where the Norwegian ship had spotted a body. The bones were recovered and buried under the name \\"John Bones Doe.\\" At the time, a pathology report on the bones indicated that they had belonged to a man of Morris' age and height, but was otherwise inconclusive. FBI investigators announced their official position to the public that, while it was theoretically possible for the men to have reached Angel Island, the odds of them having survived the turbulent currents and frigid waters of the bay were negligible. In what doubtless served to shore up the line of official denial, the final FBI report followed the disclosure that the escapees, as per West, had planned to steal clothes and a car upon reaching land, with the categorical insistence that no such thefts whatsoever were reported in the immediate area. == Aftermath == West was the only conspirator not to participate in the actual escape; he could not get his ventilator grill unstuck to leave his cell in time, so the others were forced to leave him behind. He fully cooperated with the investigation into the escape and was therefore not charged for his role. Great Escape from Alcatraz. AlcatrazHistory.com. West was transferred to McNeil Island, Washington, when Alcatraz was deactivated in 1963, and later, back to Atlanta Penitentiary. After serving his sentence, followed by two additional sentences in Georgia and Florida, he was released in 1967, only to be arrested again in Florida the following year on charges of grand larceny. At Florida State Prison, he fatally stabbed another inmate in October 1972, in what may have been a racially motivated incident. He was serving multiple sentences, including life imprisonment on the murder conviction, when he died of acute peritonitis in 1978. On December 16, 1962, inmate John Paul Scott successfully swam a distance of from Alcatraz to Fort Point, at the southern end of the Golden Gate Bridge. He was found there by teenagers, suffering from hypothermia and exhaustion. After recovering in Letterman General Hospital, he was immediately returned to Alcatraz. It is the only proven case of an Alcatraz inmate reaching the shore by swimming. Scott's escape, undertaken in slightly more unfavorable conditions than Morris and the Anglins faced, and using a means of flotation that was far inferior to the raft constructed by Morris and the Anglins (Scott made water wings by inflating stolen rubber gloves) shook the line of reasoning that Morris and the Anglins had likely drowned. Today, a multitude of athletes swim the same Alcatraz to Fort Point route as part of one of two annual triathlon events.Escape From Alcatraz Triathlon , retrieved November 9, 2015.San Francisco Triathlon at Alcatraz , retrieved November 9, 2015. Because the penitentiary cost much more to operate than other prisons (nearly $10 per prisoner per day, as opposed to $3 per prisoner per day at Atlanta), and half a century of salt water saturation had severely eroded the buildings, then-Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy ordered the penitentiary closed on March 21, 1963. The FBI closed its file on December 31, 1979, after a 17-year investigation. Their official finding was that the prisoners most likely drowned in the cold waters of the bay while attempting to reach Angel Island, it being unlikely that they made it the to shore with the strong ocean currents and the cold seawater temperatures ranging from . They cited the remnants found of the raft as well as the personal effects of the men, as evidence to bolster the official line that the raft broke up and sank at some point after having launched from Alcatraz and that the three convicts tried to swim for it, but then surely succumbed to hypothermia, their bodies swept to sea by the rapid currents of the San Francisco Bay. However, the FBI did hand the investigation over to the U.S. Marshals Service, who have not closed theirs since. As Deputy U.S. Marshal Michael Dyke told NPR in 2009: \\"There's an active warrant, and the Marshals Service doesn't give up looking for people.\\" Dyke also pointed out that the bodies of two out of every three people who go missing in San Francisco Bay are eventually recovered. The warrant for the missing men will expire between the years of 2026 and 2030 when the age of each of the three missing men will be between 99 and 100 years old, casting doubt that any one of them may be alive at that time. == Reported sightings == Since the escape of the three men, there have been many sightings of them reported and leads to their whereabouts submitted. A day after the escape, a man claiming to be John Anglin called a lawyer, Eugenia MacGowan, in San Francisco to arrange a meeting with the U.S. Marshals office. When MacGowan refused, the caller terminated the phone call.Nolte, C. (March 18, 2013). Alcatraz escapees' family convinced brothers alive. sfgate.com. The FBI dismissed the call as a prank. In January 1965, the FBI investigated a rumor that Clarence Anglin was living in Brazil. It was considered so significant that agents were dispatched to South America to find him. A male tipster called the Bureau in 1967 claiming to have been at school with Morris and having known him for 30 years. He said he had bumped into him in Maryland and described him as having \\"a small beard and moustache\\", but refused to give further details. Family members of the Anglin brothers occasionally received many unsigned postcards and messages over the years. Once a card came signed \\"Jerry\\" and another \\"Jerry and Joe,\\" The family also produced a Christmas card, purportedly received in the family mailbox in 1962, saying, \\"To Mother, from John. Merry Christmas.\\" Another of the Anglins' 11 siblings, Robert, also said that sometimes the phone would ring and all that could be heard was breathing on the other end; Robert said, \\"I suppose all that could have been pranks, but maybe it was my brothers.\\" The mother of the Anglin brothers received flowers anonymously every Mother's Day until her death in 1973, and two very tall, unusual women in heavy makeup were reported to have attended her funeral before disappearing. Federal officials say that in the mid-to-late 1960s and into the 1970s there were \\"six or seven\\" sightings reported of the Anglin brothers, all in north Florida or Georgia. Robert also said that in 1989, when the father of the Anglin brothers died, two strangers in beards showed up at the funeral home. According to Robert, \\"They stood in front of the casket looking at the body a few minutes ‚Å†‚Äî they ‚Å†‚Å†. ‚Å†. ‚Å†. wept ‚Å†‚Äî then, they walked out,\\" he said. In 1989, a woman who identified herself only as \\"Cathy\\" called Unsolved Mysteries tip line to report that she recognized a photo of Clarence Anglin, as a man who lived on a farm near Marianna, Florida. The brothers also were linked to the area by a woman, who recognized a photo of Clarence Anglin and said he lived near Marianna. She correctly identified his eye color, height, and other physical features. Another witness identified a sketch of Frank Morris, saying it bore a striking resemblance to a man she had seen in the area. In the early 2000s, according to The New York Times best selling author Frank M. Ahearn, the US Marshals received a tip that one of the Anglin brothers was in Brazil. The US Marshals went down to Brazil and got a confirmation from a local bartender that one of the brothers was there. Deputy U.S. Marshal Michael Dyke told NPR in 2009 that he still received leads on a regular basis. == Claims and developments == The escape was investigated in a segment by Robert Stack in 1989 on Unsolved Mysteries. Two theories were tested, one by having a triathlete swim from Alcatraz to the mainland and the other having three experienced kayakers paddle the same route in a replica of the raft used by the Anglins and Morris. While the rafters failed due to their raft being unseaworthy and had to be rescued by a motorboat that was shadowing their progress, the swimmer succeeded in making it to shore. In 1993, a former Alcatraz inmate named Thomas Kent told the television program America's Most Wanted that he had helped plan the escape, and claimed to have provided \\"significant new leads\\" to investigators.Higbee, A. (November 13, 1993). American Topics : Alcatraz Escapees May Still Be Alive. New York Times archive, retrieved December 10, 2015. He said that Clarence Anglin's girlfriend had agreed to meet the men on shore and drive them to Mexico. He declined to participate in the actual escape, he said, because he could not swim. Officials were skeptical of Kent's account, because he had been paid US$2,000 for the interview. Art Roderick, a retired Deputy U.S. Marshal, investigated a man named John Leroy Kelly (who died in 1993), who dictated an extended deathbed confession to his nurse. Kelly claimed that he and his partner picked up Morris and the Anglins from the bay in a boat and transported them to the Seattle Washington area. Later, under the guise of transporting the three escaped convicts to Canada, Kelly and his partner double crossed and murdered the escapees to get the $40,000 their families had collected for them. Kelly, feeling lifelong guilt over his part, felt obligated to confess what he did to a priest and to his nurse. Roderick and others found a location in Seattle, where Kelly said the three escapees were buried. A dig at the site failed to turn up any bones. Modern experimental and computer-simulated evidence has suggested that the ultimate outcome of the attempt may have depended on the exact time of the men's departure aboard the raft, and on whether they were sitting on top of the raft, using their paddles or partially submerged in the water, clinging to the raft and using their legs as the primary propelling force. A 2003 MythBusters episodeMythBusters, season 1, episode 11 on the Discovery Channel tested the feasibility of an escape from the island aboard a raft constructed with the same materials and tools available to the inmates, and determined that it was possible. Contrary to the inmates' intended destination after escaping Alcatraz being Angel Island, the MythBusters theorized that the escapees used the tides to go to a different location. The makeshift raft crafted and crewed by the MythBusters team successfully made it across the bay and made it to the Marin Headlands. A portion of the scale tests (cut for time but later shown in MythBusters Outtakes) also show that debris found in the bay afterwards could have been released by the prisoners to float to where they were found through strategic use of the bay's tides to throw the authorities off their trail. The mythbusters explored the idea that the paddle that was found floated back into the bay in the direction of Angel Island after the prisoners made it to the Marin Headlands as a way to throw the FBI off the convicts' trail. Using a scale model of the San Francisco Bay area, the tide could have washed the paddle in the direction of Angel Island if released from the Marin Headlands, but as with their theory of how the escape could have succeeded, no concrete evidence existed to prove or disprove the theory. When the case was transferred from the FBI to the US Marshals, all the files were examined in detail on a 2011 documentary on the National Geographic Channel entitled Vanished from Alcatraz. Michael Dyke, the Deputy U.S. Marshal, discovered in the newly uncovered official records, it was reported that, contrary to the official FBI report of the escapee's raft never being recovered and no car thefts being reported, a raft was discovered on Angel Island on June 12, 1962, the day after the escape. It was also reported that footprints were leading away from the raft. Furthermore, it was reported that a car, a 1955 blue Chevrolet (with Californian license plate; KPB-076), had been reported stolen in Marin County the day after the escape. It was also reported that at 11:30 a.m., on June 12, a motorist in Stockton, California (80 miles East of San Francisco) reported to the California Highway Patrol, that he had been forced off the road by three men in a blue Chevrolet. Researchers did some digging and discovered that the information was not new at all; several newspapers, such as Humboldt Times and San Francisco Examiner, actually reported the theft of a car, matching the story in the documents.quote=\\"The message also alerted authorities to be on the lookout for an auto stolen in Marin countv early yesterday morning, possibly by the convicts. It was described as a 1955 Chevrolet sedan, license number KPB 076.\\"quote=\\"A speeding car with three men in it forced a motorist off Highway 108 near Modesto and started a subsidiary manhunt there.\\"quote=\\"The theft of an automobile in Marin county was put on the police teletype. This caused a flurry of action near Oakdale, in Stanislaus county, in mid-afternoon, when a motorist told the California Highway Patrol at Modesto that he had been forced off Highway 108 by the car. It contained three men, and the Highway Patrol immediately started an intensive ground and air search of the Sonora pass road.\\" According to Dyke, there were boats docked on the opposite side of Angel island and so the inmates could have gained access to one of them and gotten to the mainland. This discovery prompted speculation that officials knew of the evidence suggesting the trio survived, and that a cover-up of the evidence had taken place, along with them declaring the men drowned, not only to save Alcatraz's reputation as an \\"escape-proof\\" prison, but to hope the escapees would relax and then become easier targets to find. During Vanished from Alcatraz, Marshal Dyke exhumed the remains of \\"John Bones Doe,\\" and DNA from the bones was compared to a DNA sample from one of Morris's paternal relatives. The DNA did not match and so the bones were not Morris'. That same year, an 89-year-old man named Bud Morris, who claimed he was a cousin of Frank Morris, claimed that on \\"eight or nine\\" occasions prior to the escape he delivered envelopes of money to Alcatraz guards, presumably as bribes. He further claimed to have met his cousin face to face in a San Diego park shortly after the escape. His daughter, who was \\"eight or nine\\" years old at the time, said she was present at the meeting with \\"Dad's friend, Frank\\", but \\"had no idea [about the escape]\\". His story and his relation to Morris has never been proven. In 2012, the 50th anniversary of the escape attempt, Michael Dyke, the Deputy U.S. Marshal, conceded that he \\"still [receives] leads once in a while regarding the case and there are still active warrants.\\"Leithead, A. (June 12, 2012). Alcatraz escape still surprises, 50 years on. BBC.com. That same year, the Anglins' two sisters, Marie Anglin Winder and Mearl Anglin Taylor, and two of the Anglins' nephews, David and Kenneth Widner, made public their belief that another of the Anglins' 11 siblings, Alfred, who was electrocuted while attempting to escape from Kilby Prison in Montgomery Alabama in 1964, was actually beaten to death by guards because he would not help investigators locate his brothers. A 2014 study of the ocean currents by scientists at Delft University and the research institute Deltares indicates that if the prisoners left Alcatraz at 11:30 pm on June 11, they could have made it to Horseshoe Bay just north of the Golden Gate Bridge, and that any debris released into the bay would have floated in the direction of Angel Island, consistent with where the paddle and belongings of the prisoners were actually found.Morelle, R. (December 15, 2014). Alcatraz 1962 escapees had small chance of success. BBC.com. Retrieved from https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-30349106. A 2015 History Channel documentary entitled Alcatraz: Search for the Truth presented further circumstantial evidence gathered over the years by the Anglin family. Kenneth and David Widner displayed Christmas cards containing the Anglins' handwriting, and allegedly received by family members for three years after the escape. While the handwriting was verified as the Anglins', none of the envelopes contained a postmarked stamp, so experts could not determine when they had been delivered. The family cited a story from family friend Fred Brizzi, who grew up with the brothers and claimed to have recognized them in Rio de Janeiro in 1975. They produced photographs taken, they said, by Brizzi, including one showing two men who, according to Brizzi were John and Clarence Anglin, standing next to a large termite mound, as well as several showing what they claimed was a Brazilian farm purportedly owned by the men. Forensic experts confirmed that the photos were taken in 1975, and asserted that the two men were \\"more than likely\\" the Anglins. Brizzi's story also presented an alternative escape theory; according to him, the escapees did not use the raft to cross the bay, but instead paddled around the island to the boat dock, where they then escaped by attaching a length of an electrical cord‚Äîwhich had been reported missing from the prison's dock on the night of the escape‚Äîto the rudder of a prison ferry boat that departed the island shortly after midnight, and were towed along behind it as it sailed to the mainland, after which they untied the cord, and paddled to the boat seen by eyewitness and former police officer Robert Checchi. During the documentary, the family gave permission for Alfred Anglin's body to be dug up from the family cemetery in Ruskin, Florida. A coroner did not find any significant trauma to Alfred, confirming his cause of death was most likely electrocution, but Alfred's DNA was compared with a sample from \\"John Bones Doe\\"; It was not a match and so the bones did not belong to either Anglin brother. Art Roderick, working with the Anglin family, called Brizzi's photograph of the two men \\"absolutely the best actionable lead we've had,\\" but added, \\"it could still all be a nice story which isn't true\\"; or the photograph could be a misdirection, aimed at steering the investigation away from the Anglins' actual whereabouts. Michael Dyke, the Deputy Marshal assigned to the case, said Brizzi was \\"a drug smuggler and a conman,\\" and was suspicious of his account. Brizzi's widow has declared that she never heard him mention ever seeing the Anglin brothers in Rio, and she frankly admitted that he was ‚Äúa con man‚Äù who was prone to making up stories. An expert working for the U.S. Marshals Service compared measurements of the photo subjects' physical features to those of the Anglin brothers' arrest photos, believed it most likely is a picture of John and Clarence Anglin; although the age and condition of the photo, and the fact that both men were wearing sunglasses, hindered efforts to make a definitive determination.Noyes, D. (May 15, 2016). New leads in manhunt for Alcatraz escapees. ABCnews.com, retrieved June 15, 2016. Other circumstantial evidence included the deathbed confession of Robert Anglin, who is said to have told family members in 2010 that he had been in contact with John and Clarence from 1963 until approximately 1987. Surviving family members, who said they have heard nothing since Robert lost contact with the brothers in 1987, announced plans to travel to Brazil to conduct a personal search; but Roderick cautioned that they could be arrested by Brazilian authorities, because the Alcatraz escape remains an open Interpol case.Notorious Alcatraz escapees may still be on the lam (October 19, 2015). CBC.ca, retrieved November 2, 2015. In a 2016 episode of American PBS television series Secrets of the Dead, three Dutch scientists using tidal flow data tried to recreate the attempt. Creating handmade replicas of the raft and paddles, they tried for Horseshoe Bay, which they considered a more realistic landing site. While the rafters failed due to their raft being unseaworthy and had to be rescued by a motorboat that was shadowing their progress, they almost made it to the shore. In 2018, the FBI confirmed that the existence of a letter, allegedly written by John Anglin, had compelled them to reopen the investigation into the case. The author of the letter, received by the San Francisco Police Department in 2013, asserts that Frank Morris died in 2008 and was buried in Alexandria under a different name, and that Clarence Anglin died in 2011. The alleged Anglin further states that he has cancer, and wants to strike a deal with the FBI ‚Äî offering to be locked up again for a year in exchange for medical care. When analyzed for a link to Anglin, it was deemed inconclusive. The U.S. Marshals office is still investigating this case, which will remain open on all three escapees until their 100th birthdays. On an episode of the series Mission Declassified (2019), investigative journalist Christof Putzel investigated the escape. Paddling with two other men in a replica of the makeshift raft used by the Anglins and Morris, they determined that due to the shifting tide, it is plausible that the trio could have paddled to Angel Island without a great degree of difficulty. Noting the documents mentioning a raft being found on Angel Island, and the 1955 blue Chevrolet being stolen, Putzel combed through hundreds of documents and discovered various reports mentioning a Chevy of the same description making its way across the country over a couple months after the escape. According to one report two weeks after the escape, a Chevy was spotted in Oklahoma with men who met the description of the escapees, a Chevy discovered in Indiana, a Chevy spotted in Ohio, and in South Carolina, three months after the initial escape, three men matching the description of the Anglin brothers and Frank Morris trying to acquire a hideout in the woods. Interviewing Kenneth Widner, Widner had to say about Morris; \\"in letters and conversations I've had with certain people, there's a very good indication that he left; I did kind of hear where I thought he went\\". Putzel travelled to Taubat√©, Brazil, where he discovered that there was a farm, called \\"The Farm of the Americans\\", and learned that residents recalled of two American men renting the farm and living there from 1965 to the 1970s and discovered the nearby site of the 1975 photograph, called El Dutra, discovering similar large termite mounds similar to the one in the photo. In January 2020, Rothco, an Irish creative agency, teamed up with AI specialists at Identv to analyze the alleged photo of the Anglin brothers in Brazil. Using facial recognition techniques, a convolutional neural network was trained on past images of the brothers and confirmed with high confidence that the identities of the men in the photo were John and Clarence Anglin. == In popular culture == J. Campbell Bruce's 1963 book Escape from Alcatraz documents the 1962 escape, along with other escape attempts over the 29 years that Alcatraz Island served as a prison.

It is generally of little importance to through traffic. Being the last mile of the road system, it generally carries little traffic. Common characteristics of a side street include low speed limits (usually not more than 30 mph or 50 km/h), curbside parking, and few or no painted line markings to display lanes. Intersections in urban or suburban areas are usually marked by stop signs, or occasionally yield signs in some suburban areas when intersecting other side streets. In rural areas, some intersections are uncontrolled. Most side streets are lined with residences. Occasionally, a place of worship or a school may be located on a side street, but in a residential area, it is rare to find any commercial development (this is often prohibited by local zoning laws, unless directly adjacent to a major street). Side streets, when built, are mostly intended only for the traffic of their residents and visitors.

Built in Algiers, Louisiana in 1847 as a towboat, the paddle steamer Ocean was selected in January 1862 by Capt. James E. Montgomery, former river steamboat master, for his River Defense Fleet. At New Orleans, on 25 January, Captain Montgomery began her conversion to a cotton-clad ram, installing oak and iron sheathing over her bow, with cotton bales sandwiched between double pine bulkheads to protect her boilers. ==Service historyBattle of Plum Point Bend=== Conversion completed on 5 April, and now renamed CSS General Beauregard, the ship steamed to Fort Pillow, Tennessee, to defend the approaches to Memphis. On 10 May 1862, General Beauregard, Capt. J. H. Hart, and seven more of Montgomery's fleet, attacked the Federal Mississippi ironclad flotilla. The Battle of Plum Point Bend witnessed effective ramming tactics by the Confederates, although General Beauregard succeeded only in keeping her four 8-inch guns bravely firing in the face of a withering hail of Union shells. Montgomery's force held off the Federal rams until Fort Pillow was safely evacuated, 4 June, then fell back on Memphis to coal, on the fifth. ===Battle of Memphis=== After Fort Pillow fell, Flag Officer Charles Henry Davis, USN, commanding the Mississippi River Squadron, lost no time in appearing off Memphis, on 6 June 1862. Montgomery, with a smaller squadron short of fuel, was unable to retreat to Vicksburg; unwilling to destroy his boats, he fought against heavy odds. In the ensuing Battle of Memphis, \\"witnessed by thousands on the bluff,\\" Beauregard unluckily missed ramming and \\"cut away entirely the port wheel and wheel-house\\" of her partner, CSS General Sterling Price, also engaging Monarch. General Beauregard, backing out, gave Union flagship a close broadside with a 42-pounder, and Benton replied with a shot into the Confederate's boiler, killing or scalding many of her crew, 14 of whom, in agony, were rescued by Benton. General Beauregard exploded and was sinking fast as Monarch captured the rest of her complement and took her in tow towards the Arkansas shore, where the wreck remained for a short time partially visible in shoal water. ==See also== *Bibliography of early American naval history == References == * ==External links== * Naval Historical Center Online Library of Selected Images: CSS General Beauregard Category:Cottonclad rams of the Confederate States Navy Category:Ships built in New Orleans Category:1847 ships Category:Shipwrecks of the American Civil War Category:Shipwrecks of the Mississippi River Category:Maritime incidents in June 1862 ","title":"CSS General Beauregard"},{"id":"20490011","text":"Alfred Aberdam (1894-1963) was a painter of School of Paris, born in Lviv, capital of Galicia, Austro-Hungarian Empire. ==Biography== Born in Lviv in 1894, in 1911 he started to study art at the Munich Academy.

The theory was developed by Andras Pellionisz and Rodolfo Llinas in the 1980s as a geometrization of brain function (especially of the central nervous system) using tensors. Metric tensor that transforms input covariant tensors into output contravariant tensors. These tensors can be used to mathematically describe cerebellar neuronal network activities in the central nervous system. ==History== Neuronal network schematic. The sensory inputs get transformed by the hidden layer representing the central nervous system which in turn outputs a motor response. ===Geometrization movement of the mid-20th century=== The mid-20th century saw a concerted movement to quantify and provide geometric models for various fields of science, including biology and physics. The geometrization of biology began in the 1950s in an effort to reduce concepts and principles of biology down into concepts of geometry similar to what was done in physics in the decades before. In fact, much of the geometrization that took place in the field of biology took its cues from the geometrization of contemporary physics. One major achievement in general relativity was the geometrization of gravitation. This allowed the trajectories of objects to be modeled as geodesic curves (or optimal paths) in a Riemannian space manifold. During the 1980s, the field of theoretical physics also witnessed an outburst of geometrization activity in parallel with the development of the Unified Field Theory, the Theory of Everything, and the similar Grand Unified Theory, all of which attempted to explain connections between known physical phenomena. The geometrization of biology in parallel with the geometrization of physics covered a multitude of fields, including populations, disease outbreaks, and evolution, and continues to be an active field of research even today. By developing geometric models of populations and disease outbreaks, it is possible to predict the extent of the epidemic and allow public health officials and medical professionals to control disease outbreaks and better prepare for future epidemics. Likewise, there is work being done to develop geometric models for the evolutionary process of species in order to study the process of evolution, the space of morphological properties, the diversity of forms and spontaneous changes and mutations. ===Geometrization of the brain and tensor network theory=== Around the same time as all of the developments in the geometrization of biology and physics, some headway was made in the geometrization of neuroscience. At the time, it became more and more necessary for brain functions to be quantified in order to study them more rigorously. Much of the progress can be attributed to the work of Pellionisz and Llinas and their associates who developed the tensor network theory in order to give researchers a means to quantify and model central nervous system activities. In 1980, Pellionisz and Llinas introduced their tensor network theory to describe the behavior of the cerebellum in transforming afferent sensory inputs into efferent motor outputs. They proposed that intrinsic multidimensional central nervous system space could be described and modeled by an extrinsic network of tensors that together describe the behavior of the central nervous system. By treating the brain as a \\"geometrical object\\" and assuming that (1) neuronal network activity is vectorial and (2) that the networks themselves are organized tensorially, brain function could be quantified and described simply as a network of tensors. *Sensory input = covariant tensor *Motor output = contravariant tensor *Cerebellar neuronal network = metric tensor that transforms the sensory input into the motor output ==Example== Six rotational axes about which the extraocular muscles turn the eye and the three rotational axes about which the vestibular semicircular canals measure head-movement. According to tensor network theory, a metric tensor can be determined to connect the two coordinate systems. ===Vestibulo-ocular reflex=== In 1986, Pellionisz described the geometrization of the \\"three-neuron vestibulo-ocular reflex arc\\" in a cat using tensor network theory. The \\"three-neuron vestibulo-ocular reflex arc\\" is named for the three neuron circuit the arc comprises. Sensory input into the vestibular system (angular acceleration of the head) is first received by the primary vestibular neurons which subsequently synapse onto secondary vestibular neurons. These secondary neurons carry out much of the signal processing and produce the efferent signal heading for the oculomotor neurons. Prior to the publishing of this paper, there had been no quantitative model to describe this \\"classic example of a basic sensorimotor transformation in the central nervous system\\" which is precisely what tensor network theory had been developed to model. Here, Pellionisz described the analysis of the sensory input into the vestibular canals as the covariant vector component of tensor network theory. Likewise, the synthesized motor response (reflexive eye movement) is described as the contravariant vector component of the theory. By calculating the neuronal network transformations between the sensory input into the vestibular system and the subsequent motor response, a metric tensor representing the neuronal network was calculated. The resulting metric tensor allowed for accurate predictions of the neuronal connections between the three intrinsically orthogonal vestibular canals and the six extraocular muscles that control the movement of the eye. ==ApplicationsNeural Networks and Artificial Intelligence=== Neural networks modeled after the activities of the central nervous system have allowed researchers to solve problems impossible to solve by other means. Artificial neural networks are now being applied in various applications to further research in other fields. One notable non- biological application of the tensor network theory was the simulated automated landing of a damaged F-15 fighter jet on one wing using a \\"Transputer parallel computer neural network\\". The fighter jet's sensors fed information into the flight computer which in turn transformed that information into commands to control the plane's wing-flaps and ailerons to achieve a stable touchdown. This was synonymous to sensory inputs from the body being transformed into motor outputs by the cerebellum. The flight computer's calculations and behavior was modeled as a metric tensor taking the covariant sensor readings and transforming it into contravariant commands to control aircraft hardware. ==References * Andras Pellionisz Google Scholar page Page Category:Computational neuroscience ","title":"Tensor network theory"},{"id":"20490095","text":"(, ) was a Magonid king of Carthage in present-day Tunisia from 510 to 480 BCE. ==RuleTreaty with Rome=== Carthage concluded treaties with several states, most notably with Rome. Signed in 509 BC, the treaty formalized a division of influence and commercial activities. This treaty is the first known source suggesting that Carthage had gained control over Sicily and Sardinia, as well as Emporia and the area south of Cape Bon in Africa. Carthage may have signed the treaty with Rome, then an insignificant backwater, because Romans had treaties with the Phocaeans and Cumae, who were aiding the Roman struggle against the Etruscans at that time. Carthage had similar treaties with Etruscan, Punic and Greek cities in Sicily. By the end of the 6th Century BC, Carthage had conquered most of the old Phoenician colonies e.g. Hadrumetum, Utica and Kerkouane, subjugated some of the Libyan tribes, and had taken control of parts of the North African coast from modern Morocco to the borders of Cyrenaica. It was also fighting wars to defend its Punic colonies and commerce. However, only the details of her struggle against the Greeks have survived, which has led to the impression that Carthage seemed \\"obsessed with Sicily\\". ===First Sicilian War=== The island of Sicily, lying at Carthage's doorstep, became the arena on which this conflict played out. From their earliest days, both the Greeks and Phoenicians had been attracted to the large island, establishing a large number of colonies and trading posts along its coasts. Small battles had been fought between these settlements for decades. Carthage had to respond to at least three Greek incursions, in 580 BC, in 510 BC (involving Dorieus the Spartan, brother of Cleomenes I) and, according to Diodorus Siculus, a war in which the city of Heraclea Minoa was destroyed. The Punic domain in Sicily by 500 BC contained the cities of Motya, Panormus and Soluntum. By 490 BC, Carthage had concluded treaties with the Greek cities of Selinus, Himera, and Zankle in Sicily. Gelo, the tyrant of Greek Syracuse, backed in part by support from other Greek city-states, was attempting to unite the island under his rule since 485 BC. When Theron of Akragas, father in law of Gelo, deposed the tyrant of Himera in 483 BC, Carthage decided to intervene at the instigation of the tyrant of Rhegion, who was the father-in-law of the deposed tyrant of Himera. Hamilcar prepared the largest Punic overseas expedition to date and after three years of preparations, sailed for Sicily. This enterprise coincided with the expedition of Xerxes against mainland Greece in 480 BC, prompting speculation about a possible alliance between Carthage and Persia against the Greeks, although no firm evidence of this exists. The Punic fleet was battered by storms en route, and the Punic army was destroyed and Hamilcar killed in the Battle of Himera by the combined armies of Himera, Akragas and Syracuse under Gelo. Carthage made peace with the Greeks and paid a large indemnity of 2000 silver talents, but lost no territory in Sicily. ==Weakening of kings== This defeat had far reaching consequences, both political and economic, for Carthage. Politically, the old government of entrenched nobility was ousted, replaced by the Carthaginian Republic. ‚ÄúKings‚Äù were still elected, but their power began to erode, with the senate and the \\"Tribunal of 104\\" gaining dominance in political matters, and the position of \\"Suffet\\" becoming more influential. Economically, sea-borne trade with the Middle East was cut off by the mainland GreeksThucidides, VI, p34 and Magna Graecia boycotted Carthaginian traders. This led to the development of trade with the West and of caravan-borne trade with the East. Gisco, son of Hamilcar was exiled, and Carthage for the next 70 years made no recorded forays against the Greeks nor aided either the Elymians/Sicels or the Etruscans (then locked in struggles against the Greeks) or sent any aid to the Greek enemies of Syracuse, then the leading Greek city in Sicily. Based on this absence from Greek affairs, it has been suggested that Carthage was militarily crippled for some time after the defeat at Himera.Baker, G.P, Hannibal, p 16-18, ==See also== * Other Hamilcars in Carthaginian history ==ReferencesCitations=Bibliography=== * .

He is the founder and president of YSRCP. He was Leader of opposition in the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly from 19 June 2014 until 29 May 2019. He is the son of the former Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy. Jaganmohan Reddy started his political career by campaigning for Indian National Congress in the 2004 elections in Kadapa District, and in the 2009 elections he was elected as Member of Parliament from Kadapa constituency as a member of the Indian National Congress. After his father's sudden death, his popular Odarpu yatra tour led to his formation of the YSRCP in 2011. He led the party to several victories at both the state and national levels. However, he has been implicated in several high-profile corruption scandals. ==Personal life== Jaganmohan Reddy was born on 21 December 1972 in Kadapa district of Andhra Pradesh to Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy and Y. S. Vijayamma. He went to The Hyderabad Public School, up to 12th grade. He graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree. He married Bharathi Reddy on 28 August 1996. The couple has two daughters, the eldest of whom studied undergraduate in London. He is a Catholic Christian. He has a younger sister, Y. S. Sharmila, who is also a politician. ==Political career== Jaganmohan Reddy's father YS Rajasekhara Reddy popularly known as YSR, was a two-time Chief Minister of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, serving from 2004 to 2009. Jaganmohan Reddy started his political career campaigning for Indian National Congress during the 2004 elections in Kadapa District. In 2009, Reddy was elected as Member of Parliament from Kadapa constituency. ===Post YSR's death=== Following the death of his father in Sep 2009, Jaganmohan Reddy started his earnest efforts to take up the political legacy left by his father. The majority of the legislators favored him to be appointed as the Chief Minister. Sonia Gandhi, party chief of the Indian National Congress and her son Rahul Gandhi, party general secretary did not agree to this. Six months after his father's death, he began an odarpu yatra (condolence tour) as promised earlier to go and meet the families of those alleged to have either committed suicide or suffered ill health on the news of his father's death. The Congress party's central leadership directed him to call off his odarpu yatra, an order which he defied leading to a fallout between the high command and himself. He went ahead with the yatra, stating that it was a personal matter. ===Founding YSR Congress=== On 29 November 2010, he resigned, after a fallout with the Congress party high command. He announced on 7 December 2010 from Pulivendula that he would be starting a new party within 45 days. In March 2011, he announced his party name at Jagganapeta of East Godavari district. Later, his party went to by polls in YSR Kadapa district and won almost all the seats with a huge majority. Reddy, as the president of YSR Congress, faced by-election from the Kadapa constituency and won by a large margin of 545,043 votes. ===2012 disproportionate assets case === The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has disclosed that Reddy, accepted Rs 1,172 crore from various investors as a bribe and in turn, helped them get favours from the state government. The favours are mainly land, mining leases, and licences for new industries. Reddy, Member of Parliament from Kadapa and late chief minister Y S Rajasekhara Reddy's son, was arrested by the investigating agency on 27 May in connection with a disproportionate assets case. A CBI special court in Hyderabad on 28 May remanded him to judicial custody for 14 days. He remained in the Chanchalguda Central Prison till 11 June. Arrest and 16 months in jail Reddy was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation on embezzlement charges and his Judicial custody was extended repeatedly as the investigation proceeded. The Supreme Court also dismissed his petition on 4 July 2012, 9 August 2012, and on 13 May 2013. Other Congress ministers arrested for issuing orders In March 2012, the Supreme Court directed the CBI to extend their investigations to six ministers (Kanna Lakshminarayana, Mopidevi Venkata Ramana, Sabita Indra Reddy, Ponnala Lakshmaiah, J Geetha Reddy and Dharmana Prasada Rao), and eight senior bureaucrats, who were implicated in issuing 26 Government orders that helped the companies investing in Reddy's firms. Andhra Excise minister Mopidevi Venkataramana was arrested on 24 May 2012. CBI also summoned BCCI chief N Srinivasan on 7 June 2012. As a sequel to allegations that CBI had selectively released information to the press to tarnish the image of Reddy, the Central Vigilance Commissioner sought a report on the matter from the investigating agency. Charges of political vendetta The YSR Congress and Reddy's family have been alleging a political conspiracy behind Reddy's investigations. BJP has noted that CBI has been pursuing this case with greater vigour than that of government-aligned politicians with similar charges such as Sushil Kumar Shinde or Vilasrao Deshmukh. ===Opposition to the formation of Telangana=== While in jail, Reddy started a hunger strike opposing the United Progressive Alliance's decision to endorse the creation of a separate Telangana state. After 125 hours of indefinite hunger strike, his sugar levels and blood pressure were down. He was moved to Osmania General Hospital for treatment. His mother, MLA Vijayamma, was also on hunger strike protesting the formation of Telangana out of AP. After his release, Reddy called for a 72-hour bandh protesting the formation of Telangana. Both Reddy and his mother resigned from their legislatures opposing the decision favoring the formation of Telangana === 2014 Election Defeat === In 2014, the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP), was a pre- poll favourite among most analysts and psephologists. But, the YSRCP lost the 2014 elections, winning only 67 of 175 seats in the state assembly, with 45% of vote share. In the 2014 election, the Telugu Desam Party vote share went up to 47% and the 2% gap led to the defeat of YSRCP. === PrajaSankalpaYatra - Padayatra of more than 3,648 km === As a leader of the Opposition in Assembly and YSR Congress Party president, Reddy launched his 3,000-km-long walkathon named PrajaSankalpaYatra on 6 November 2017. The YSRC chief launched his ‚ÄòPraja Sankalpa Padayatra‚Äô at RK Valley in his native Kadapa district after paying homage at the grave of his father.YSR Congress party coined a slogan \\"Raavali Jagan, Kaavali Jagan\\" () for the foot march that took to him across 125 Assembly segments in 13 districts of the state in 430 days. This Yatra was started on 6 November 2017 and ended on 9 January 2019.  Knife Attack  Reddy while boarding a Flight to Hyderabad was attacked with a cock fighting knife in the VIP Lounge of Visakhapatnam Airport on 25 October 2018. He received an injury on shoulder and had to undergo a surgery. ===2019 Election Win & Chief Ministership=== In the 2019 National and State election held in April‚ÄìMay 2019, YSR Congress Party swept the polls and won 151 of the total 175 assembly seats and 22 of the 25 Lok Sabha seats in AP.

The construction of the canal was required by the provincial government of British Columbia as a condition of the canal's promoter receiving substantial land concessions from the provincial government of British Columbia in the area of Creston, BC. The promoter, William Adolf Baillie-Grohman (1851‚Äì1921), was a wealthy adventurer, hunter author, and business promoter. He declared the canal to be complete in 1889. The canal was an expensive failure, being used only three times during its entire existence. In 1902, on the last use by a vessel, the sternwheeler North Star, the sternwheeler's captain, Frank P. Armstrong deliberately blew out the canal's lower lock gates with dynamite to allow the transit of his vessel. ==Geographic setting== This birds-eye tourist map, published in 1913, gives a rough idea of the potential significance of a shipping canal at Canal Flats, roughly in the center of valley shown on this map. The Baillie-Grohman Canal was suggested by the unusual geographic setting of the sources of the Columbia and the Kootenay Rivers. The Columbia River begins at Columbia Lake, flows north in the Rocky Mountain Trench through the Columbia Valley to Windermere Lake to Golden, BC. The Kootenay River flows south from the Rocky Mountains, then west into the Rocky Mountain Trench, coming within just over a mile from Columbia Lake, at a point called Canal Flats, where a shipping canal was built in 1889. The Kootenay then flows south down the Rocky Mountain Trench, crosses the international border and then turns north back into Canada and into Kootenay Lake near the town of Creston, BC.Downs, Art, Paddlewheels on the Frontier -- The Story of British Columbia and Yukon Sternwheel Steamers, at pages 100-112, Superior Publishing, Seattle, WA 1972The same river is spelled \\"Kootenay\\" in Canada and \\"Kootenai\\" in the United States. Mills, Randall V., Sternwheelers up Columbia -- A Century of Steamboating in the Oregon Country, at 86-87, University of Nebraska, Lincoln NE 1947 (1977 printing by Bison Press) Rail construction in Canada and the United States made steam navigation possible in the Rocky Mountain Trench. There were two important railheads, Golden, BC and Jennings, Montana, near Libby. At Golden, the transcontinental line of the Canadian Pacific Railway (\\"CPR\\"), which parallels the Columbia south from the bridge at Donald, turns east to follow the Kicking Horse River,Previously referred to as the Wapta River. Lyman, at 277 surmounting the Continental Divide at Kicking Horse Pass, then running past the resort at Banff then east to Calgary. Jennings was reached by the Great Northern Railway, built across the Northern United States from Minnesota to Washington by James J. Hill. Between these railheads the Rocky Mountain Trench ran for 300 miles, almost all of which was potentially accessible to steam navigation. Canal Flats was close to the midpoint, being just south of Columbia Lake, 124 miles upstream from Golden.Lorraine, M.J., Columbia Unveiled, at 439 Times-Mirror Press, Los Angeles CA (1924) ==William A. Baillie-Grohman== In the early 1880s a wealthy European adventurer, William Adolf Baillie-Grohman (1851‚Äì1921), travelled to the Kootenay Region and became obsessed with developing an area far down the Kootenay River near the southern end of Kootenay Lake called Kootenay Flats.Wilson, D.M., The History of Creston, BC Virtual Crowsnest Highway (revised 05-04-2008)Zuehlke, Mark, Scoundrels, Dreamers and Second Sons : British remittance men in the Canadian west, at 76-80, Dundurn Press, (2d Ed. 2001) The problem for Baillie-Grohman was that the Kootenay River kept flooding Kootenay Flats. Baillie-Grohman thought the downstream flooding could be lessened by diverting the upstream portion of the Kootenay River into the Columbia River through the Canal Flats. This would have increased the water flow through the Columbia River, particularly near Golden and Donald, where Baillie-Grohman's proposal, if it had been implemented, would have threatened to flood the newly built transcontinental railroad and other areas of the Columbia Valley.Downing, at 102-103. The provincial government refused to allow the diversion. However, Baillie-Grohman was able to obtain ownership of large areas of land in the Kootenay region, provided he engaged in certain forms of economic development, including construction of a shipping canal and a lock. The lock was necessary because the Kootenay River was 11 feet higher than the level of the Columbia Lake. ==Transport to the canal site== Baillie-Grohman arranged to have shipped to Golden a large amount of supplies, including complete equipment for a steam-powered sawmill, which was necessary to cut the lumber to build the canal locks and shelters for the workers at the canal. Baillie-Grohman also had hired a complement of workers, including a skilled millwright, to build the sawmill and supervise construction of the canal. But when the time came to transport the supplies and the people by water to Canal Flats, Duchess, then the only steamer available, was then sunk in the deepest part of the river up to her smokestack. River transport was the only way Baillie-Grohman could move the heavy sawmill and construction equipment the 124 miles to Canal Flats. The provincial government required Baillie-Grohman to complete the canal by the summer of 1889, then two years in the future. If he did not finish the canal on time, he would not receive the land far downstream. With Duchess under water and no other transport in sight, the clock was running on Baillie- Grohman's dream. There was at this time in Golden a man named Jack Hayes who had collected the pieces of a potential steamboat. These included an unpowered heavy-duty railroad construction barge, a vertical boiler from a Manitoba steam plow, and machinery salvaged from an old tugboat. Hayes however lacked the skill to assemble these components into a steamboat. Baillie-Grohman's only option was to task his millwright to help Jack Hayes complete the Clive.Baillie-Grohman, Wm A., Fifteen Years Sport and Life in the Hunting Grounds of Western America and British Columbia, at pages 252-278, Horace Cox, London, 1900 Clive was much too heavy for the shallows of the Columbia River, which were often choked with snags, that is, dead trees which had become lodged in the bed of the river. Snags could block navigation or sink a vessel that might strike them. Under these conditions, it took Clive 23 days to cover the 100 miles from Golden to the point upriver where the sawmill could be unloaded. ==Construction of the canal and locks== As was common for construction projects in western North America at that time, the hard labor of building the canal was done by Chinese immigrant laborers. According to E.M. Sandilands, who worked on the canal, the project was fatally defective from the start, because nothing in the stipulations between Baillie-Grohman and the provincial government required Baillie-Grohman to dredge or prepare the approaches to the canal. All Baillie-Grohman had to do was to build the canal and locks . However, without proper approaches, it would be near-to-useless. When these were completed, and after a ceremony enhanced by what Sandiland described as \\"a canoe well laden with the 'good cheer' demanded by such an occasion\\",Freeman, at 69 Sandiland was ordered by the foreman to break out the false dam which had been keeping the Kootenay River from flooding the works. With the aid of another worker he did so, and thus became, as he later realized, the man who made the entire Selkirk and Purcell mountain range into an island. With the canal in place, this entire huge alpine region was completely encircled by the Columbia River, the Arrow Lakes, the Kootenay Lake and River, and finally the canal itself.Freeman, Lewis R., Down the Columbia, at 20-21, 28, 68-70, 140-167, Dixon-Price Publishing, Kingston, WA (reprint of Dodd, Mead 1921 edition) ISBN I-929516-18-5 On-line first edition viewable at American Libraries internet archive here ==Size and cost== When on July 29, 1889Virtual Crowsnest Highway (regional history website), \\"Time Line for Southwestern Canada\\" complete, the canal was long and wide. Baillie-Grohman had raised funds for the venture in England, and was reputed to have sunk a major part of his own considerable personal wealth into the financing syndicate. The locks alone cost $100,000, enough to build five or six steamboats the size of the 1897 upper Kootenay sternwheeler J.D. Farrell. ==Limited use of canal== Despite its cost, the Baillie-Grohman canal was only transited three times by steam-powered vessels. :Transits of the Gwendoline in 1893 and 1894: In 1893, Armstrong built Gwendoline at Hansen's Landing on the Kootenay River, and took the vessel through the canal north to the shipyard at Golden to complete her fitting out. By this time it appears that the canal had been damaged or deteriorated to the boat where at least some of the transit of Gwendoline had to be accomplished by pulling the vessel out of the water, partially dismantling the boat, and pulling her along on rollers.Other sources state that the entire northbound transit was made on rollers, and Gwendoline was not partially dismantled, but rather had never been fully completed at Hansen's Landing. See Moore, D.M., Riverboating on the Kootenay. Over the winter, Armstrong, it is reported, was able to prevail on the provincial government to expend funds to repair the canal.Newell, Gordon R. ed., H.W. McCurdy Marine History of the Pacific Northwest, at pages 4-5, Superior Publishing, Seattle WA 1966 In late May 1894 Armstrong returned the completed Gwendoline back to the Kootenay River, this time transiting normally the rehabilitated canal.Timmen, Fritz, Blow for the Landing -- A Hundred Years of Steam Navigation on the Waters of the West, at 87-88, Caxton Printers, Caldwell, ID 1973 Another source states that the southbound transit was possible only because of a luckily high level of water in the canal, and mentions nothing about repair. Moore, D.M., Riverboating on the Kootenay :Transit of the North Star in 1902: From 1892 to 1898, steamboats transported ore from the mines in the southern part of the Rocky Mountain Trench down the Kootenay River to Jennings Montana. In the fall of 1898, railroads were completed in this area which put the three surviving steamboats out of business, and for the most part they were little used after that. Armstrong, the dominant personality in river transport in the East Kootenay region, had been away steamboating on the Stikine River as part of the Klondike Gold Rush. With no work for North Star on the upper Kootenay with he returned, Armstrong decided in 1902 to bring the vessel through the Baillie-Grohman canal to be worked on the Columbia river side of the trench. It took a month to move North Star through the sloughed-in canal. Among other problems, North Star was 130 feet long, 30 feet longer than the lock. Armstrong solved this problem by ripping out the lock gates, building cofferdams out of ore sacks filed with sand, then blowing out the lower coffer dam with dynamite. ==Deterioration of the works== Whatever commercial value the canal may have had was completely wiped out by the dynamite-aided transit of the North Star. The remains of the canal and the lock gradually deteriorated. In 1920, when the journalist- adventurer Lewis R. Freeman visited Canal Flats, he could see traces of the canal running in from Columbia Lake which came to a sharp stop at a collapsing wall of rotting logs, which Freeman believed must have been the remnants of one of the lock gates. M.J. Lorraine, a retired civil engineer, found, photographed and diagrammed a similar situation in 1922. ==Failure of the Baillie-Grohman development scheme== Although Baillie-Grohman had completed the canal on time, or at least could claim he had done so, his plan for acquiring ownership of the Creston area failed when the provincial government was found to have exceeded its authority when it entered into the bargain with Baillie-Grohman. ==Image gallery== File:Canal construction at Canal Flats, Chinese work crew 1887.JPGChinese construction crew at work on canal.

Therefore, it is generally used with verbs that are high in transitivity, a property that describes the effect a verb has on its object; b«é does not occur grammatically with verbs that express states or emotions, such as \\"love\\" and \\"miss,\\" or with verbs that express activities that have no effect on the direct object, such as \\"sing\\" and \\"see.\\"Li & Thompson (1981), p. 467. The direct object of a b«é construction must meet certain requirements as well. It is usually definite, meaning that it is specific and unique (as in phrases beginning with the equivalent of this, that, these, or those). It may sometimes also be generic, such as \\"salt\\" in the sentence \\"She sometimes eats salt thinking it's sugar.\\"Li & Thompson (1981). p. 465. The object of a b«é construction is nearly always something that both the speaker and hearer know about and are aware of. ==Research== Because of the numerous constraints on the kinds of words that may be used in b«é construction, this construction has often been used in studies on language processing and on grammaticality judgments of native speakers. For example, sentences with b«é construction that have syntactic violations (such as b«é being followed by a verb rather than a noun) and semantic violations (such as b«é being followed by a verb that doesn't express \\"disposal\\") have been used to study the interaction of syntactic and semantic processing in the brain using the neuroimaging technique of ERP, and to evaluate construction grammar's model of meaning-building. ==NotesReferences== *Chao Yuen Ren (1968).

The season was the first to have a uniform start date for both southern and northern teams. The change from previous seasons, in which weather allowed southern teams to begin play weeks before northern teams, was an attempt to improve parity between warm- weather and cold-weather teams. The season progressed through the regular season, many conference tournaments and championship series, and concluded with the 2008 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament and 2008 College World Series. The College World Series, which consisted of the eight remaining teams in the NCAA Tournament, was held in its annual location of Omaha, Nebraska at Rosenblatt Stadium. It concluded on June 25, 2008, with the final game of the best of three championship series. Fresno State defeated Georgia two games to one to claim their first championship. Fresno State was the first team seeded fourth in its regional tournament to win a national championship since the NCAA Tournament adopted the current 64-team format in 1999. ==RealignmentNew programs=== Five new programs joined Division I baseball for the 2008 season, four from the NCAA Division II. Florida Gulf Coast, previously a Division II independent; North Carolina Central, previously of the Division II Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association; Presbyterian, previously of the Division II South Atlantic Conference; and South Carolina Upstate, previously of the Division II Peach Belt Conference, all made the transition to Division I. The fifth new program, Houston Baptist, joined Division I from the NAIA. ===Conference changes=== Entering the 2008 baseball season, the Mid-Continent Conference was renamed The Summit League. The renamed conference was one of several conferences to make membership changes. Both the renamed Summit League and the Atlantic Sun Conference added multiple members. The Summit added three schools, IPFW, North Dakota State, and South Dakota State, all previously Division I independents. The Atlantic Sun added two schools, Florida Gulf Coast and South Carolina Upstate, both from Division II. Both the Big West Conference, which added UC Davis from the Division I independent ranks, and the Horizon League, which added Valparaiso from the Mid-Continent, added a single member. Three schools joined the Division I independent ranks. Le Moyne left the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference to become an independent, and both North Carolina Central and Presbyterian became independents after their transitions from Division II. ==Conference standings== {  valign=\\"top\\"  {  width=\\"100%\\" style=\\"font-size:90%; line-height:90%;\\"  align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"7\\" D8FFEB;\\"  America East Conference - ! !! colspan=\\"3\\"  Conf !! colspan=\\"3\\"  Overall - !

A widely circulated claim holds that a mosque was registered at this address in 1860, which would make the Al-Manar Centre the oldest mosque in the United Kingdom. This has, however, been shown to result from a transcription error in the Register of Religious Sites, making the Liverpool Muslim Institute, established in 1891, the first. In 2014, the mosque became the subject of media attention after it emerged that Nasser Muthana and Reyaad Khan, two young men who appeared in a propaganda video for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and Muthana's brother Aseel, also believed to be fighting in Syria for the same organisation, had worshipped at the mosque. The centre denied that it had played any part in their radicalisation. ==See also== *Islam in Wales ==References * Category:Mosques in Wales Category:1992 establishments in Wales Category:Cathays Category:Religious buildings and structures in Cardiff Category:Charities based in Wales Category:Sunni Islam in the United Kingdom Category:Salafi mosques in the United Kingdom ","title":"Al-Manar Centre"},{"id":"20490528","text":"Steve Hochstadt is a professor emeritus of history at Illinois College in Jacksonville, Illinois.

It should be reflecting the average before tax income of a country's citizens. Knowing a country's GNI per capita is a good first step toward understanding the country's economic strengths and needs, as well as the general standard of living enjoyed by the average citizen. A country's GNI per capita tends to be closely linked with other indicators that measure the social, economic, and environmental well-being of the country and its people. All data is in U.S. dollars.

On 9 September 1907, FuŒ≤ball-Club Germania 1904 and FuŒ≤ball-Club Allemannia 1905 united to form FuŒ≤ball- Vereinigung 1907 Neckarau. In 1921, FV in turn merged with the gymnastics clubs Turnverein 1884 Neckarau and Turnerbund Jahn Neckarau (which had formed its own football department in 1914), while playing in the Kreisliga Odenwald. The newly formed association was known as Verein f√ºr Leibes√ºbungen 1884 Neckarau. The following year Athletik-Sportverein Neckarau became part of the club, while earlier partner TV Jahn Neckarau became an independent club again in 1924.Gr√ºne, Hardy (2001). Vereinslexikon. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag ===Into the top flight=== The first appearance by VfL on the national stage came with their participation in the regional S√ºddeutschland qualifying round for the German championship in 1927. They again took part in qualification play in 1929 and 1932, but came away unsuccessful each time. Following the reorganization of German football into 16 top-flight divisions under the Third Reich in 1933, Neckarau became part of the Gauliga Baden (I).Gr√ºne, Hardy (1996). Vom Kronprinzen bis zur Bundesliga. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag They remained in first-division play until the end of World War II in 1945. In 1939, the team narrowly missed demotion. Despite being beaten 2:0 by SpVgg Sandhofen in relegation play, they avoided being sent down when league reorganization expanded their division allowing VfL to stay up in the Gauliga Baden-Staffel Nord. They rebounded and took the division title in 1941, but were quickly eliminated from the national playoffs after a poor showing in their qualification group. They also made their only appearance in national cup play that year when they took part in the opening round of the Tschammerpokal, predecessor to today's German Cup (DFB-Pokal), where they were eliminated 0:4 by FV Metz. From 1943 to 1945, VfL played as part of the combined wartime side Kriegspielgemeinschaft Neckarau alongside SpVgg Mannheim. ===Post war=== Following the conflict, the club was re-established as VfL 1884 Mannheim-Neckarau. The renewed association included the memberships of TV Jahn Neckarau and Arbeiter Turn- Sportverein Neckarau, a worker's club which had been disbanded in 1933 as politically undesirable under the Nazi regime. The footballers captured the title in the Landesliga Nordbaden (II) in 1946 and advanced to first-division play in the Oberliga S√ºd. They fared poorly in their next two campaigns and were sent down in 1948. The following season, a vice-championship in the Landesliga was followed by a failed promotion attempt. VfL captured the division in 1950 and then beat TSG Ulm 3:0 to return to the Oberliga S√ºd (I). They struggled through the 50s, lasting only two seasons in the Oberliga before slipping through the Landesliga and into lower level play. Fritz Balogh appeared for the national side in 1950 in their first international after World War II. The team resurfaced in the Amateurliga Nordbaden (III) in 1957‚Äì58, capturing a title there, but failing in their bid to win promotion to second-tier competition. They remained in the Amateurliga until 1964, capturing the title there again in 1962, before crashing to a 15th-place finish and falling to the Landesliga Rhein-Nord (IV). Neckarau again rebounded and advanced to the Regionalliga S√ºd (II) to play a single season in 1968‚Äì69. After a second-place finish in the Amateurliga Nordbaden the next year, the club took part in the national amateur championship and advanced as far as the semifinals where they were put out by SC J√ºlich (1:0, 1:3). The club played in the Amateurliga Nordbaden (III) through the 70s and 80s, becoming a fourth-division side after league restructuring in 1978. VfL slipped to lower-tier play in 1990 and is currently part of the Landesliga Rhein-Neckar (VII) after spending some time in the Kreisliga Mannheim (VIII), now under the name of VfL Kurpfalz Mannheim- Neckarau. ==Honours== The club's honours: ===League=== * Gauliga Baden (I) ** Champions: 1941 * Bezirksliga Rhein-Saar (I) ** Champions: 1929 * Bezirksliga Rhein (I) ** Champions: 1927 * Landesliga Nordbaden (II) ** Champions: 1946, 1950 * Landesliga Rhein-Nord (IV) ** Champions: 1965 * Amateurliga Nordbaden (III) ** Champions: 1958, 1968 * Verbandsliga Nordbaden (V) ** Champions: 1988 * Kreisliga Mannheim (VIII) ** Champions: 2011 ===Cup=== * North Baden Cup ** Winners: 1957, 1967 ==Recent seasons== The recent season-by-season performance of the club:Das deutsche Fu√üball-Archiv Historical German domestic league tablesFussball.de ‚Äì Ergebnisse Tables and results of all German football leagues {  - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#dfdfdf\\"  Season  Division  Tier  Position - align=\\"center\\"  2005‚Äì06  align=\\"left\\" Kreisliga Mannheim A1  rowspan=5 VII  1st - align=\\"center\\"  2005‚Äì06  align=\\"left\\" Kreisliga Mannheim  4th - align=\\"center\\"  2006‚Äì07  align=\\"left\\" Kreisliga Mannheim  7th - align=\\"center\\"  2007‚Äì08  align=\\"left\\" Kreisliga Mannheim  ddffdd\\" 2nd ‚Üë - align=\\"center\\"  2008‚Äì09  align=\\"left\\" Landesliga Rhein-Neckar  ffcccc\\" 15th ‚Üì - align=\\"center\\"  2009‚Äì10  align=\\"left\\" Kreisliga Mannheim  rowspan=2 VIII  8th - align=\\"center\\"  2010‚Äì11  align=\\"left\\" Kreisliga Mannheim  ddffdd\\" 1st ‚Üë - align=\\"center\\"  2011‚Äì12  align=\\"left\\" Landesliga Rhein-Neckar  rowspan=6 VII  6th - align=\\"center\\"  2012‚Äì13  align=\\"left\\" Landesliga Rhein-Neckar  8th - align=\\"center\\"  2013‚Äì14  align=\\"left\\" Landesliga Rhein-Neckar  10th - align=\\"center\\"  2014‚Äì15  align=\\"left\\" Landesliga Rhein-Neckar  7th - align=\\"center\\"  2015‚Äì16  align=\\"left\\" Landesliga Rhein-Neckar  9th - align=\\"center\\"  2016‚Äì17  align=\\"left\\" Landesliga Rhein-Neckar  } * With the introduction of the Regionalligas in 1994 and the 3.

They have released two studio albums under two monikers and been involved in several compilation projects. They subsequently changed their name to Mother God Moviestar in 1998 after a trademark dispute with Dr. Dre in which the court found that both could use the name. The band reformed as Aftermath in 2015. ==History== Aftermath was a Chicago-based thrash metal band during the 1980s and 1990s. Its demos landed them in metal magazines, including Kerrang!,Kerrang!, December, 1989 and January 1990 Metal Hammer,Metal Hammer, (Greece, January 1995) RIP Magazine,RIP, April 1995 Raw,Raw, September 1989 and Metal Forces.Metal Forces, Issue 57, June 1988, July 1988 Its Words that Echo Fear demo was selected as one of Kerrang! 's Top 10 demos of 1990.Kerrang!, January 6, 1990 The band's debut Eyes of Tomorrow has been released by multiple labels during the years and their demos continue to generate interest and fans around the world evidenced by the two reissues on Shadow Kingdom Records and Divebomb Records. Having reunited in 2015, the band played the Ragnarokkr Metal Apocalypse festival in Chicago in May and Headbanger's Open Air festival in Hamburg, Germany in July. Celebrating 30 years since their formation, the band is reissuing their Eyes of Tomorrow debut cd on Shadow Kingdom Records on September 4, 2015. The remastered version by Paul Logus (Pantera, Anthrax) includes an expanded booklet and four bonus tracks. In October, Divebomb Records will reissue Killing the Future along with five bonus tracks and expanded booklet. Once again remastered by Paul Logus . == Demos == Chicago based Aftermath, fronted by the Greece born Kyriakos \\"Charlie\\" Tsiolis, formed in October 1985 when Charlie and his schoolmate Steve Sacco (Guitar) got together. This early incarnation with Adam (Bass) and Nick Chiara (Drums) issued their first demo called 'Sentenced To Death' in 1986 featuring 'Sentenced to Death', 'Revenge', 'Shotgun' and 'The Aftermath'. In 1987, they unleashed their second demo entitled ‚ÄòKilling The Future‚Äô featuring the tracks ‚ÄòWhen Will You Die‚Äô, ‚ÄòGoing No Place‚Äô, ‚ÄòChaos‚Äô, ‚ÄòMeltdown‚Äô and ‚ÄòWar For Freedom‚Äô. The band pursued a mind blowing speed and technical brand of Thrash that soon set them apart from the pack. The tracks \\"War For Freedom\\" & \\"When Will You Die\\" were both featured on the British ‚ÄòMetal Forces‚Äô magazine compilation LP ‚ÄòDemolition: Scream Your Brains Out‚Äô in 1988 Metal Forces. The LP featured tracks from Leviathan (Chris Barnes(Six Feet Under) on Vocals), Hobbs' Angel Of Death, Anacrusis & Atrophy. The appearance on the Metal Forces' compilation further expanded the band's international appeal. By 1988, the musical direction was changing and Adam's raw and simple bass lines would soon be replaced with complex and technical bass parts handled at first by John Lovette. Ironically, John never played bass on any Aftermath recording and wasn't even a bass player. However, he wanted to join the band so badly, he came to the audition with a friend's bass he had just started to play. The speed and complex playing he displayed was something none of the members had ever seen before on bass. He landed the gig that day. When the band decided it was time to add a second guitarist, Lovette told his band mates of his desire to switch to guitar and for the first time he came clean, he was a guitar player pretending to be a bass player all along. His bass playing was surpassed by his guitar skills, the band found its second guitar player, but unfortunately, the search for a bass player was back on. Luckily, the search (for the time being, anyway) ended with Danny Vega. His warm and precise playing was the perfect complement to the guitar playing of Lovette and Sacco and worked amazingly well with Schmidt's powerful drumming. With Lovette handling most of the song writing duties, Aftermath was about to make an unbelievable musical change. By 1989, that change brought on by Lovette's writing and the band's musical tastes and stylings had slowed and matured as evidenced by the release of the underground classic demo ‚ÄòWords That Echo Fear‚Äô. == 1990s == As the new decade approached and their international underground success continued to increase, Aftermath was about to embark on the search for yet another bass player (Chris Waldron), label negotiations, label bankruptcy, the recording of their debut and a trademark battle. ==Eyes of Tomorrow saga== In 1990, based on the international success of the Words that Echo Fear demo, the metal label RoadRacer Records (a subsidiary of Roadrunner Records) approached the band for a demo deal, which resulted in a live four track demo featuring the songs ‚ÄòEyes of Tomorrow‚Äô, ‚ÄòAfraid Of Time‚Äô, ‚ÄòThe Act Of Unspoken Wisdom‚Äô and 'Reflecting Pictures\\". Negotiations eventually broke down and Aftermath signed to New York City‚Äôs Big Chief Records. The label's collapse halfway through the recording sessions led to a long delay in finishing the record. While the band struggled to pay the studio bill, the album the band started to record in 1990 would not see the light of day for four years. The experience left the band reeling and forced them to issue the album under their own steam with the help of their manager through Zoid Recordings in 1994. Four long years had passed since the initial recordings for the record \\"Eyes Of Tomorrow\\" and the scene had changed. The album was subsequently re-released on Thermometer Sound Surface / Zoid and released yet again four years later on Black Lotus Records in a remastered version. Area Death Productions remastered the record once again as part of their box set called 25 Years of Chaos released in 2011. In 2015, Shadow Kingdom Records reissued the record with bonus tracks as part of a 2-CD set with expanded artwork, new cover art treatment and remastered by Paul Logus. ==Trademark dispute== Aftermath the act, lost a notable court case Tsiolis v. Interscope. Records. Inc., 946 F.Supp. 1344, 1349 (N.D.III. 1996) with Dr. Dre over the ownership of the name. Dre reported made a conciliatory offer of some $50,000 for rights to use the name but would go ahead and use it regardless.NewCity, December, 1996 Fortunately for the band, this period of turmoil had built bridges with Interscope Records. After the name change to Mother God Moviestar, they signed to Interscope for the eponymous Electro- Metal debut of March 1998. The case has been studied in law schools around the nation related to the issue of trademark dilution. == Legal battle and Mother God Moviestar == In January 1997 the group, retaining a stable lineup but augmenting their sound with the addition of DJ Delta 9 and female vocalist Roxanne, retitled themselves Mother God Moviestar, opting to pursue an alternative rock direction. Aftermath has continued to receive critical acclaim as one of the major influences in the genre. The band is featured in Gary Sharpe-Young's A - Z of Thrash Metal. ==Discography== ;Demos *Sentenced To Death (1986) *Killing the Future (1987) *Words that Echo Fear (1989) ;Compilations *Metal Forces' Scream Your Brains Out ;Full-length *Eyes of Tomorrow (1994) Re-issued *mother god moviestar (Interscope) 1998 under the name mother god moviestar *There is Something Wrong (2019) ;2010 and 2011 releases *25 Years of Chaos - Box Set (Area Death Productions) (2010‚Äì11) *When Will You Die (1986‚Äì1989) Vinyl (F.O.A.D Records) (2011) ;2015 releases *Eyes of Tomorrow (Shadow Kingdom Records) September 4, 2015 Remastered by Paul Logus (Pantera.

He was the \\"son of Count de Landas Bourgogne de Rache and Adelaide M. de Gramont-Hamilton, and belonged to the noble family of De Berghes-Saint-Winoc.\\" He \\"lived most of his life in England.\\" \\"He claimed to have succeeded in 1907, to prince dukedom, of de Berghes, on letters approved by\\" King Leopold II of Belgium and Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, according to his obituary in the Philadelphia Evening Public Ledger. But his name was not found in Almanach de Gotha which began to list \\"Berghes-Saint-Winock\\" as an \\"extinct house\\" in 1908. Compare with Frederick Cunliffe-Owen, a \\"chronicler of nobility\\", \\"in one of his newspaper articles, said that if\\" Berghes' name \\"was his right one he was a prince; but he could not be a prince, because the line of succession to the title passed in 1907.\\" He said that he was raised as a Protestant. He was educated at Eton College and the universities of Cambridge, Paris and Brussels. He completed courses in law, theology and military tactics. He said that at Cambridge, he became a supporter of the high church and became interested in Anglo-Catholicism. He said that to avert this, his mother made him transfer to the Faculty of Protestant Theology at the University of Paris. According to The New York Times, he \\"described himself as\\" an \\"ex-staff officer of the British Army, with the rank of Captain.\\" According to his obituary, he \\"declared in statements after his arrival at Villanova that he had seen service under\\" Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener, both in Sudan and in Egypt. Cunliffe-Owen asserted that Berghes also claimed service under Kitchener in the Second Boer War. Berghes claimed, according to his obituary, that he attained \\"the rank of lieutenant colonel before leaving the army\\". Cunliffe-Owen \\"asserted that if\\" Berghes \\"was in the British Army he must have been under some other name,\\" because the \\"army lists,\\" Cunliffe-Owen \\"alleged, do not contain a name similar to his.\\" He said that later, he joined the Church of England and received orders there but the question of the validity of his orders bothered him. It was for this reason that he joined the Old Catholic Church. He joined the Old Catholic Church in 1910. According to Peter Anson, in Wandering Bishops, either Baroness Natalie Uxkull-Gyllenband or Olga Novikov introduced Berghes to Arnold Harris Mathew, a controversial figure who was consecrated in 1908 by Union of Utrecht (UU) bishops as a regionary bishop but ignored rules and seceded from the in 1910. According to Cunliffe-Owen, Berghes left England in 1912. But Mathew ordained Berghes in a private oratory in November, 1912, in Bedford Park, London, and consecrated him in June, 1913, as Mathew's regionary bishop of Scotland. Notably, months before Berghes' consecration, a London jury found that \\"the words were true in substance and in fact\\" that Mathew was, among other things, a \\"pseudo-bishop\\", and, months after Berghes' consecration, according to Peter-Ben Smit, in Old Catholic and Philippine Independent Ecclesiologies in History, \\"ties of the with Mathew were formally severed.\\" When, according to Anson, \\"they issued a formal statement that [...] Mathew had ceased to be an Old Catholic on December 29, 1910, and that after that date they recognized none of his episcopal actions.\\" He was, according to Anson, \\"an Austro-Hungarian subject\\" who was liable to capture and internment \\"as an enemy alien\\" for the duration of the war, so \\"with the connivance of the Foreign Office\\" Berghes left, two years later than Cunliffe-Owen asserted, in September, 1914, the same month \\"the Directorate of Prisoners of War had come into existence under the War Office\\" to implemented the internment policy of the British government. ==In the United States== He arrived in New York City either in 1912, according to Cunliffe-Owen, or in 1914, according to Anson. Regardless, he was in New York City by the beginning of 1915. At the invitation of Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States (PECUSA) bishop David H. Greer of the Episcopal Diocese of New York, but without Mathew's authorization, Berghes participated in the consecration of Hiram Richard Hulse as the Missionary Bishop of Cuba on . It was reported on a society page a few days later that Berghes \\"is to be assigned as rector\\" of a parish in New York City and that Greer \\"announce[d] that the appointment will be made.\\" After Hulses' consecration, newspapers questioned Berghes' true identity and so did bishops. Allegations about his background were printed in newspapers. Bishop Philip M. Rhinelander, of the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania, requested more information from Cunliffe-Owen about Berghes. Cunliffe-Owen wrote to Rhinelander that after Cunliffe-Owen had warned William T. Manning who warned Greer, Berghes \\"found Brooklyn and New York too hot for him and vanished.\\" In 1915 Berghes filed a lawsuit against Cunliffe-Owen, an editor of the New-York Tribune, for libel. Berghes alleged in the complaint that Cunliffe-Owen' statements, \\"as to the genuineness of the temporal and ecclesiastical titles\\" that he used, \\"have caused him to be rejected\\" in circles, \\"although\\", Berghes complained \\"that the article spoke sarcastically of him and intimated that he was masquerading under a pseudonym.\\" Cunliffe- Owen compared Berghes to another bishop \\"who fell into disrepute because of irregular practices in London\\", Andrew Charles McLaglen; Berghes correctly stated that Cunliffe-Owen had mistaken him for McLaglen. Cunliffe-Owen \\"wrote that if\\" Berghes was McLaglen then \\"he had been exposed several times\\" in London newspapers for \\"religious and philanthropic swindles.\\" But according to The New York Times, Cunliffe-Owen \\"did not say that\\" Berghes and \\"McLagen were the same. He merely, in his article and later in a private letter, showed points of similarity between the two.\\" Berghes \\"made the [...] claim of elevation to archbishop and metropolitan in 1916.\\" He began calling himself the Archbishop of the Old Roman Catholic Church of America. He moved to St. Dunstan's Abbey in Waukegan, Illinois, and consecrated William Henry Francis, the abbot, and Carmel Henry Carfora as bishops on consecutive days in October, 1916. Carfora was his auxiliary bishop. He consecrated Stanislaus Mickiewicz in 1917. Here \\"Mickiewicz\\" is \\"Mickevicius\\". William Wolkovich-Valkavicius called Mickiewicz, in Polish American Studies, a \\"major figure in the Lithuanian separatist movement.\\" Mickiewicz, a Lithuanian, emigrated from the Russian Empire, worked in a Chicago, Illinois, \\"meat market for a short time.\\" After he failed at three seminaries, Mickiewicz \\"turned to\\" Stephen Kaminski who ordained him in 1907. Mickiewicz, \\"apparently with no commitment to Kaminski,\\" according to Wolkovich-Valkavicius, \\"became a free-lance priest\\" in New England. He was involved along with Bishop Franciszek Hodur of the Polish National Catholic Church (PNCC) in a schism dividing the St Joseph's Lithuanian Catholic congregation of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Scranton where a dissident group gained possession of the church. A lawsuit was filed demanding the restitution of the church. The court rendered a judgment which permanently restrained Hodur and Mickiewicz and ordered restoration of the property to the . Mickiewicz was pastor of the independent Lithuanian parish in Scranton, Pennsylvania started by the dissidents. However, \\"because of his unsavory conduct,\\" Mickiewicz \\"was charged with breach of discipline and left of his own accord rather than face expulsion.\\" \\"Unimpeded,\\" Mickiewicz \\"sped off to Lawrence, Massachusetts, drawn by\\" another parish conflict in a Lithuanian community with a \\"high proportion of socialists and freethinkers.\\" \\"There he declared himself the 'Messenger of God', and Administrator of all independent Lithuanian parishes. By July 1916 he established a separatist church.\\" \\"To upgrade his status,\\" Mickiewicz \\"summoned a lay synod in June 1917, and arranged to be elected bishop by popular acclaim.\\" De Landas Berghas then consecrated him as a bishop. Mickiewicz \\"then persuaded\\" de Landas Berghas, according to Wolkovich-Valkavicius, \\"to set up a mini-seminary in Lawrence, teaching and ordaining a half dozen Lithuanians.\\" Mickiewicz \\"fell quickly,\\" according to Wolkovich-Valkavicius. \\"His continued misconduct brought public censure from his people. [...] Intimations of 'heresy, impurity, drunkenness and falsehood' led\\" de Landas Berghas, \\"as Metropolitan of the Old Roman Catholic Church of America, to banish\\" Mickiewicz in 1918, \\"stripping him perpetually of orders and jurisdiction, according to the\\" Lawrence The Evening Tribune \\"account. The decree of December 3 was also signed by the regionary bishop, [...] Carfora at New York City. Several sources credit\\" Mickiewicz's \\"successor, [Stasys] Sleinis, with having a hand in the expulsion.\\" Mickiewicz moved from Lawrence to Chicago where he failed to \\"compete with\\" a Lithuanian parish in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago. He later joined Francis who Berghes also consecrated. Smit wrote that after World War I, the \\"distanced itself more from the ' Mathew and those ordained and consecrated by him.\\" Berghes applied to minister in the . Bishop William Montgomery Brown, of the Episcopal Diocese of Arkansas, a Modernist and Communist later \\"known as the 'atheist bishop',\\" presented \\"the correspondence and request of \\" to the October 1919 General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America which referred the documents to a special committee consisting of the bishops who \\"confer with officials of the Eastern Orthodox Churches and the Old Catholics\\". The committee reported that they considered what was presented but were \\"not prepared to recommend any action\\". They reported, \\"the reception of a person applying to minister in\\" the \\"belongs to the jurisdiction of the several Bishops of the same.\\" So, the General Convention discharged the committee \\"from the further consideration of the subject.\\" Brown resigned later that year. Mathew died on December 19, 1919. On November 22, 1919, he abandoned Old Catholicism and took a solemn vow of abjuration at the hands of Patrick Joseph Hayes, Archbishop of New York, in St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York. He converted to the Catholic Church, \\"renounced his titles\\", and entered the Augustinian St. Thomas Monastery in Villanova, Pennsylvania as a novice where he \\"died during his probation,\\" several months later on . He was buried in the monastery's cemetery. He made \\"the claim,\\" according to his obituary, \\"that through his efforts the American branch of the Old Catholics number[ed] in 1920 about 120,000 in Canada and the United States.\\" After Mathew died in 1919, the declared in 1920 that Mathew's \\"consecration was obtained ' and that consequently it is null and void.\\" Consecrations derived from Mathew were not recognised by the . Smit wrote that, \\"the orders of ' in general, [...] and of all those consecrated by them, are not recognized, and all connections with these persons is formally denied\\" by the . ==Name and title variations== Berghes was known by a variety of names and titles throughout his life and after. *In 1915, his \\"full name and title\\" was reported as \\"the Rt.

The arrival of a new preacher (Samuel H. James) to the town results in many of Big Jim's customers leaving the juke joint in favor of attending church. Big Jim arranges for the preacher to be photographed in staged compromising situations with three attractive women. Aunt Caroline, Big Jim's adoptive mother, becomes aware of the scheme and tries to prevent Big Jim from carrying out his scheme to discredit the preacher. There is a physical struggle between Aunt Caroline and Big Jim, resulting in Aunt Caroline collapsing after being struck. Aunt Caroline dies from her injuries, but Big Jim escapes arrest by claiming an unknown burglar was the culprit. But following Aunt Caroline's funeral, Big Jim's conscience haunts him with visions of eternal damnation in Hell.

The Teardrops along with all their associated bands recorded there as well as a lot of other Manchester bands including Joy Division and A Certain Ratio.

O. The Medieval Foundations of England (London 1967) p. 291 Copies of the texts of the letters were written on sheets of parchment, which were stitched together into long rolls to form a roll for each year. ==Nature of contents== Copies of royal grants of land or money (further transcribed to the Exchequer) made up the earliest contents of the Close Rolls; but the latter soon came to contain much wider matter, exchequer- related material being hived off after 1226 in separate Liberate Rolls.Sayles, G. O. The Medieval Foundations of England (London 1967) p. 291 Indeed, in the early 13th century perhaps the bulk of executive action ran via instructions from Chancery to local sheriffs, and was recorded in the Rolls.Morris, W. A. The Medieval English Sheriff (Manchester 1968) p. 143 Over time, however, as new document series emerged, the scope of the Close Rolls narrowed; and after 1533 their contents consisted solely of copies of private deeds and awards of enclosure, and the like.Steinberg, S.

The school educates children aged 11 to 16 and has around 750 pupils. The current principal, Craig D'Cunha, took up the post in February 2015. In 2018, the academy received a 'good' Ofsted inspection rating. ==History== The school opened in September 1962 as a secondary modern school serving the recently established council estate of Chantry in southwest Ipswich. Originally, the school consisted of the two three-floored 'A' and 'G' blocks with a main school hall area. Following the growth of the estate, the school's roll grew rapidly into the 1970s, resulting in the extension of the site. The school remained a secondary modern school until the late 1970s when Suffolk became fully comprehensive and the school was renamed Chantry High School. In March 2012, the school announced its intentions to convert to academy status in collaboration with Suffolk New College. This conversion was finalised during the following academic year, when the school was renamed Suffolk New Academy. During the summer of 2014, the old 'G' block was demolished in preparation for the building work of a brand new school on the existing site. This building work took place throughout the 2014‚Äì15 academic year, and saw rise to the construction of a three-storey building plus sports hall. The old 'A' block was subsequently demolished in the summer of 2015, with the remaining old buildings due to follow suit. In early 2015, the school revealed that the Active Learning Trust would be taking over sponsorship from September 2015. This would coincide with the opening of the new school building and another name change. In May 2015, following a public consultation, the school announced it would be reverting to the Chantry name under the guise of Chantry Academy, which had received 66% of the public vote. Before Mr D‚ÄôChuna took charge of the high school, Ofsted (a company which judges schools to determine how efficient a school is) reported that the school was put into ‚Äòspecial measures‚Äô, as of 2018, the secondary school has shown an improvement as it has now been given a rated of ‚Äògood‚Äô by Ofsted. ==Sixth Form Centre== In 1981 the school opened a sixth form centre. Originally, it served Chantry, East Bergholt, Stoke, Copleston, Kesgrave, and numerous smaller schools, acting as an alternative to the already established Northgate Sixth Form centre. In the 1990s, due to the increase of Sixth Form Centres within Ipswich, Chantry Sixth Form Centre predominantly served just the Chantry and Stoke areas. It closed following the development of the One sixth form in September 2010. ==References * Chantry Academy website Category:Secondary schools in Suffolk Category:Academies in Suffolk Category:Schools in Ipswich Category:Educational institutions established in 1962 ","title":"Chantry Academy"},{"id":"20491077","text":"Freddie Thomason Burdette (September 15, 1936 ‚Äì June 1, 2010) was a right- handed pitcher in Major League Baseball for the Chicago Cubs. Burdette was signed by the Cubs on June 3, 1954 as an undrafted amateur free agent. He battled his way through the minor leagues before finally making his major- league debut at age 25, pitching in relief in both games of a doubleheader with the Cincinnati Reds at Crosley Field. He induced the first batter he ever faced, Leo C√°rdenas, to ground out to second baseman Ken Hubbs. He also retired Gordy Coleman on a groundout before being removed from the game. In the nightcap, Burdette pitched a full inning, allowing a hit but no runs. On September 10, he tallied his first big-league strikeout, fanning slugger Frank Howard. He also earned his first (and only) career save when he finished a 4‚Äì1 victory over Philadelphia on September 20. Burdette went on to finish the year with a 3.72 ERA in 9 innings over 8 games. The next year, he was a late-season call-up from the minors for the Cubs, appearing in 4 games as a reliever and posting a 3.86 ERA. Burdette saw his most extensive major-league action in 1964, making 18 appearances out of the bullpen after getting promoted to the big leagues in June. He earned his first major-league win (and only decision) on August 18 against the Phillies in a marathon 16-inning contest at Connie Mack Stadium. Burdette retired six of the seven Phillie batters he faced in the 14th and 15th innings before being removed for a pinch-hitter as the Cubs rallied for two runs in the top of the 16th. Ernie Broglio (famously acquired by the Cubs in exchange for legend Lou Brock) allowed a solo homer in the bottom of the 16th to Clay Dalrymple but held on to save Burdette's only career win. Burdette pitched in eight more games as a Cub in 1964, including his final appearance on October 2, 1964 against the San Francisco Giants. He hurled two-thirds of an inning, retiring opposing pitcher Bobby Bolin to end the final inning Burdett would pitch in the bigs. For his career, Burdette was 1‚Äì0 in 30 games (all in relief) with one save and a 3.41 ERA. ==Later life== Following his baseball career, Burdette worked for the United Parcel Service.

The railway operated several excursion trains ranging from a five course dinner train to sightseeing excursions throughout Lake and Orange Counties. The company operated through a lease agreement with the Florida Central Railroad, the owner of the tracks. Trains operated between the towns of Mount Dora, Tavares, Eustis, Lake Jem, and Orlando. Florida Rail Adventures no longer operates and has been divesting itself of equipment. == Trains  Orange Blossom Dinner Train === The Orange Blossom Dinner Train was a three-hour, 24-mile round trip ride. Trains departed from the Eustis depot and traveled to Lake Jem. A four course meal was prepared on board the train and featured a different menu every few months. Another added feature for the trip; for an additional cost, a passenger could eat dinner served in the railway's dome car. Trains were diesel powered and had enclosed, air-conditioned cars. === Magnolia Sun Lunch Train === The Magnolia Sun Lunch Train was a nine-mile, two-hour train ride that took passengers from Eustis to the Dora Canal and return. Trains were diesel powered and had enclosed, air-conditioned cars. === Mount Dora Meteor === The Mount Dora Meteor was day time excursion train that departed from the railway's Mount Dora depot. Narrated by the conductor, passengers embarked on a 1.5 hour, ten mile round trip excursion between the towns of Mount Dora and Tavares. Sights included: Lake Dora, Lake Gertrude, The Golden Triangle, and several orange groves. A unique feature of the trip was being turned around at the Tavares wye. Passengers could watch as the conductor and engineer maneuvered the train around the wye in preparation for the return trip to Mount Dora. Trains were diesel powered and had open window coaches. === Murder Mystery Express === New for the 2008 operating year was the Murder Mystery Express. It was a three-hour, 24-mile round trip ride departing from Eustis to Lake Jem and return. The Giggles and Bits Players presentation of Fat Louie's Pizza to Die For was the main play for the trip. The bungling, misguided misfits entertained passengers as they dined. At the end of the play, guests were asked to help solve the premeditated murder. It was originally envisioned that this train would be expanded to operate on several other nights, all with differently themed plays. The guests would guess the murderer and the main prize was a cruise. Trains were diesel powered and had enclosed air-conditioned cars. === Italian Star Dinner Train === The Italian Star Dinner Train was similar to railway's Magnolia Sun Lunch Train, however it featured an Italian themed menu. === Orlando Magic Express === The Orlando Magic Express took passengers to Orlando for select Orlando Magic basketball games. One of the railway's larger excursions, trains traveled from Eustis to Downtown Orlando. Generally trains took roughly two hours to reach downtown and dinner was served in the dining car. Once the train arrived in Orlando, the conductor escorted passengers two blocks to the Amway Arena for the game. === Rail Rambles === Taken from the popular excursion trains by the Atlantic Coast Line in the 1950s and 1960s, The Florida Rail Adventures had created its own Rail Ramble excursion trains. Trains departed Eustis for an all day excursion on the entire railroad, including a trip all the way into downtown Orlando. The Railway's dining car was taken along for the excursion and offered lunch throughout the trip. Generally, photo run-bys were conducted on the return portion of the trip. Trains were diesel powered and had both open window and enclosed, air-conditioned cars. === Special Excursions === Throughout the year the railway offered many special excursions. Santa's Winter Wonderland Express, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Pumpkin Patch Express, & Day Out With Thomas were some of the special excursions operated. == Equipment == Florida Rail Adventures has sold or auctioned many of its rail assets. == Tracks == The tracks that the Florida Rail Adventures trains traveled on were once part of three independent railroads that were built mostly in the 1880s. Portions of some of these lines have been abandoned and removed over the years due to the loss of their customer base or due to redundancy occurring after mergers that eventually combined all three of the original lines into one system. These lines once served a large citrus and agricultural industry but due to several devastating freezes in the 1980s and 1990s, these industries gradually moved further south. The following is a brief history of these three independent railroads and how they eventually became one. === Eustis to Tavares === The line from Eustis to Tavares was originally built as the St. Johns & Lake Eustis Railway Company (StJ&LE;). This company was chartered in 1879 and construction started at Astor on the St. Johns River. The line was built narrow gauge and its rails passed through Altoona, Umatilla and Ft. Mason before reaching Eustis, 27 miles, in 1880. Construction continued southward through Tavares, reaching Lane Park on Big Lake Harris, 7.5 miles, in 1882-83.Saint Johns River Historical Society, Inc. - The Railroad The line was then extended 15 miles from Ft. Mason, around the north and west sides of Lake Eustis to Leesburg in 1884. The line originally served as a land bridge for the river and lake steamboats that provided transportation into the interior of Florida. Passengers and freight could come down the St. Johns River on steamboats from Jacksonville and transfer to the railroad at Astor for ports on Lakes Eustis, Dora and Harris. They could then transfer back to a lake steamer to continue to points further south. The StJ&LE; was leased to the Florida Southern Railway Company, a narrow gauge system, from 1885 to 1889 and subleased to the Jacksonville, Tampa & Key West Railway Co. from 1889 to 1890. The lease was cancelled in 1890 and the StJ&LE; resumed operations until 1893. They went into bankruptcy in 1893 and were operated by a receiver until they were sold to the Plant System in 1896. Railroad tycoon Henry Plant reorganized it as the St. Johns & Lake Eustis Railroad Co. and immediately converted the tracks to standard gauge. It was operated as a part of his Plant System as the Savannah, Florida & Western Railroad Company until his death. His family, having no interest in his railroad empire, sold it to the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company (ACL) in 1902. The ACL operated the line until 1967 when they merged with the Seaboard Air Line to form the Seaboard Coast Line (SCL). Abandonments began in 1941 with the portion of the line from Astor to Altoona, 17.7 miles. The line from Tavares to Lane Park, 1.5 miles, followed in 1942. Then in 1956 the portion from Altoona to Umatilla, 3 miles, was abandoned. These abandonments were due to a loss of a customer base. Lastly, the line from Ft. Mason to Leesburg, 15 miles, was abandoned in 1967 due to being redundant after the merger to form the SCL. === Tavares to Mount Dora === The line from Tavares to Mt. Dora was chartered as the Sanford & Lake Eustis Railway Co. in 1885. Construction began in Sanford in 1885 and its rails passed through Sylvan Lake, Sorrento and Mt. Dora before reaching Tavares, 25.8 miles in 1887.Orlando Sentinel - Florida's Little Railroads That Could The line was constructed to gauge and was immediately leased to the Jacksonville, Tampa & Key West Railway Company (JT&KW;). The JT&KW; merged it into their Jacksonville to Sanford system in 1890 and operated it as their Sanford & Lake Eustis Division. The JT&KW; went into bankruptcy in 1893 and was operated by a receiver until 1899. The receiver leased the system to the Plant Investment Company (PICO) in 1899 and it was then operated as the Lake Eustis Division of the Savannah, Florida & Western Railroad Company (SF&W;). It was sold to PICO in 1900 and fully merged into Plant's SF&W; where it remained until his death. As stated earlier, his family had no interest in his railroad empire and sold it to the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company (ACL) in 1902. The ACL operated the line until 1967 when they merged with the Seaboard Air Line to form the Seaboard Coast Line (SCL). After the merger that formed the SCL, the line was redundant and was abandoned from Sylvan Lake, 6 miles west of Sanford, to Sorrento, 13 miles, in 1980. Then in 1983 the 6 miles from Sanford to Sylvan Lake was abandoned. === Tavares to Orlando === The line from Tavares to Orlando was charted as the Tavares, Orlando & Atlantic Railroad Company (TO&A;) in 1881. Construction began in Tavares in 1882 and the broad gauge line reached Orlando, 32 miles, via Lake Jem, Zellwood, Plymouth and Apopka in 1884. The TO&A; negotiated an agreement with the St. Johns & Lake Eustis (StJ&LE;) to share the right-of-way around the west side of Lake Dora for a distance of about one mile. This saved building another trestle and bridge over the Dora Canal. It also created an unusual four rail dual gauge arrangement with the TO&A; gauge rails on the outside and the StJ&LE; gauge rail in between. The TO&A; also had financial difficulties after failing to pay interest on bonds and was sold at a public auction to The Florida Central & Peninsular Railroad Company (TFC&P;) in 1891. TFC&P; was a fairly large system, reaching from Fernandina Beach to Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Ocala, Wildwood, Leesburg and Tavares. TFC&P; had financial difficulties as well and reorganized as Florida Central & Peninsular Railroad Company (FC&P;) (\\"The\\" omitted from name) in 1893. The Seaboard Air Line Railway bought controlling interest in the FC&P; in 1900 and fully merged it into their system in 1903. The SAL had financial difficulties and was reorganized as the Seaboard Air Line Railway Company in 1915 (\\"Company\\" added to name). The SAL again reorganized as the Seaboard Air Line Railroad Company (SAL) in 1945. In 1967 the SAL merged with the Atlantic Coast Line to form the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad (SCL). With the exception of a few farm spurs, no abandonments have occurred on the original TO&A; line and the entire original 32 miles are intact and fully operational today. === Recent History === The three original railroads went through a series of bankruptcies, sales, and mergers, which brought them under one banner in 1967 as part of the Seaboard Coast Line. In 1983 the SCL was merged into the Seaboard System. This corporation was a stepping stone used to merge the Chessie System with the SCL's Family Lines in 1986 to form the present day CSX Corporation. CSX, being an extremely large rail system, could not operate branch lines efficiently and provide the personalized service that customers required. Therefore, many of their branch lines were sold off as short line railroads in the '80s and '90s. In 1986 the Pinsly Railroad Company, owner of several short line railroads in other states, was selected by CSX to operate the branch as the Florida Central Railroad with their local base of operations located in the former SAL depot in Plymouth. The Florida Rail Adventures operated on Florida Central Railroad's tracks by agreement. Scheduled passenger service on the line from Wildwood to Orlando was terminated in 1954 by the SAL. The tracks from Leesburg to Tavares were abandoned in 1982 and from Wildwood to Leesburg between 2001 and 2008 due to loss of their customer base. After more than 125 years, this historic branch line continues to serve its many customers who depend on it for reliable, economical, efficient transportation to move their raw materials to their plants and to move their finished products to market. ==See also== *Tavares, Eustis & Gulf Railroad ==References== Category:Heritage railroads in Florida Category:Transportation in Lake County, Florida Category:Defunct companies based in Florida Category:2005 establishments in Florida Category:2009 disestablishments in Florida ","title":"Inland Lakes Railway"},{"id":"20491103","text":"Jean-Fran√ßois Richet (born 1966), is a French screenwriter, director, and producer.

In ancient Greece, the epinikion most often took the form of a choral lyric, commissioned for and performed at the celebration of an athletic victory in the Panhellenic Games and sometimes in honor of a victory in war.Thomas J. Mathiesen, \\"Epinikion and encomium,\\" in Apollo's lyre: Greek Music and Music Theory in Antiquity and the Middle Ages. University of Nebraska Press, 2000, pp. 135‚Äì141 online. Major poets in the genre are Simonides, Bacchylides, and Pindar. ==Origins== aulist plays music in the background of a boxing match (Attic vase, 510‚Äì500 BC) Since the poets most often call their victory songs hymnoi (), it has been conjectured that hymns for Herakles, honored as the founder of the Olympic Games, were the original model for the athletic epinikion. Victory odes are also associated with the Dioscuri; Pindar uses the term \\"Castor-song\\" (), and Polydeuces (Pollux), the mortal twin of Castor, was a boxer.Emmet Robbins, \\"Public Poetry,\\" in A Companion to the Greek Lyric Poets, edited by Douglas E. Gerber (Brill, 1997), p. 245. Although the best-known epinikia appear to have been composed for a chorus, they may have originally been performed by a soloist. Pindar says that a lyric by Archilochus was sung at Olympia, and a scholiast to the passage gives a quotation. The performance of these songs seems to have led in the 6th century BC to aristocratic commissions for more elaborate numbers.Robbins, \\"Public Poetry,\\" pp. 242 and 244. The earliest epinikia, surviving only in fragments, were composed by Simonides of Ceos in the 520s BC.Leslie Kurke, \\"The Strangeness of 'Song Culture': Archaic Greek Poetry,\\" in Literature in the Greek World (Oxford University Press, 2001), p. 64 online. Simonides was the first professional poet known to write odes in honor of victorious athletes at the games; in antiquity, he was also notorious for being the first poet to charge a fee for his services.Robbins, \\"Public Poetry,\\" pp. 244‚Äì246 online. The epinikia of Bacchylides were formerly considered lost and were known only from quotations in other authors, until the discovery in the late 19th century of a papyrus manuscript containing fifteen of his odes. Pindar's four surviving books of epinikia, called one of \\"the great monuments of Greek lyric,\\" correspond to each of the four major festivals of the Panhellenic Games: Olympian, Pythian, Isthmian, and Nemean. Many of Pindar's odes can be identified by event, champion, and year.Mathiesen, \\"Epinikion and encomium,\\" p. 136. ==Occasion and performance== A phorminx The epinikion was performed not at the games, but at the celebration surrounding the champion's return to his hometown or perhaps at the anniversary of his victory. The odes celebrate runners, pentathletes, wrestlers, boxers, and charioteers; Pindar usually narrates or alludes elaborately to a myth connected to the victor's family or birthplace. The Pindaric ode has a metrical structure rivaled in its complexity only by the chorus of Greek tragedy, and is usually composed in a triadic form comprising strophe, antistrophe, and epode. The odes were performed by a chorus that sang and danced to the musical accompaniment of the phorminx or aulos.Mathiesen, \\"Epinikion and encomium,\\" pp. 135‚Äì141. ==The epinikion and society== \\"The victory ode,\\" notes Mary Lefkowitz, \\"is a curious and somewhat paradoxical form of art.\\"Mary R. Lefkowitz, First-Person Fictions: Pindar's Poetic 'I' (Oxford University Press, 1991), p. 1 online. Simon Goldhill has described the epinikion as practiced by Pindar as \\"a performance hired to mark the place of an individual within his city.\\"Simon Goldhill, \\"Intimations of Immortality: Fame and Tradition from Homer to Pindar,\\" in The Poet's Voice: Essays on Poetics and Greek Literature (Cambridge University Press, 1991), p. 130 online. The epinikion praised the victorious athlete as an ideal representative of the community and of the aristocratic class, linking his achievements with those of local cult heroes. But the athlete was also admonished against hubris, \\"not to seek to become Zeus.\\"Kurke, \\"The Strangeness of 'Song Culture',\\" p. 64.

It began operation on November 22, 2008, and was granted a license on January 8, 2009. With a transmitter located just north of Benton Harbor, the station uses the same tower as WCXT. WSIS broadcasts the Smile FM programming. It officially retransmits the signal of WHYT, however, much of the programming comes from flagship station WLGH in Lansing. WSIS is owned by Smile FM. An application to construct the station was filed with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on May 12, 1998, for 25 kW with a directional signal from a 184' tower just south of St. Joseph. A Construction Permit was granted on November 15, 2005, however, in the 7 years between the filing of the application and granting of a construction permit the tower location was no longer available. A modification was filed with the FCC to move the station to the WCXT tower north of Benton Harbor. This was rejected and the construction permit was canceled on August 5, 2008, by the FCC on the grounds that the new coverage area did not include the southern portion of the original coverage area which was a violation of the 307(b)preference they had received. Superior Communications filed a request for reconsideration with a waiver of the 73.2002(c) rules. The waiver stated it was impossible to duplicate the original coverage area since land was no longer available for a tower near the 1998 proposed site. Furthermore, it said the new location would cover 87% of the original population, add 30,000 to the total population served, and provide a first non-commercial radio service to over 2,000 people. The FCC granted the modified construction permit on November 13, 2008, and the station filed for a license on November 25, 2008. ==Translators== In January 2018 translator W262AF began rebroadcasting WSIS to improve reception in the Kalamazoo area. {  - !

It was first mentioned in 1303. The present church was built in 1974, and replaced a building from 1914 that was damaged in the 1968 earthquake. According to tradition the settlement was originally built towards the west near the coast, at the locality Paliomantra. It was marked on the 1785 map of Choiseul-Gouffier at this old location, but Conze marked it at the present location in 1858. The move of the village must have taken place at the end of the 18th century, which coincides with an increase of pirate attacks. Also in the new location the villagers had to protect themselves against pirates, and built unique underground shelters known as moursa. Gradually, the village grew. In 1857, 73 men aged 18 to 60 paid 2,336 piastres to escape conscription. It had 35 families in 1863 and had 74 houses in 1874. Since 1918 Agia Sofia is part of the community of Fisini. Agia Sofia had 277 inhabitants in 1928, it had 191 in 1961 and only 55 in 2001. The public school, opened in 1919, was closed in 1972. East of the village the ruins of the locality Agiomarnos can be found. ===Paradeisi=== The hill Paradeisi (286 m elevation) dominates southeastern Lemnos. It is situated northwest of Agia Sofia, and southwest of Kaminia. On old maps it is referred to as \\"Neptune hill\\" (Colle di Nettune) (Porcacchi, 1572), Neptunius Collis (Ortelius, 1589 and Mercator, 1607 and 1630).

He went to Haifeng farm after staying at home for three and half years of self-education after graduating from middle school. He went to the countryside as part of the Chinese re-education program of the time, and was part of the first generation of Chinese students who attended college after 13 years of closure of higher education during the Cultural Revolution. In 1979, he went to study at the Art Department, Shanghai Normal College. Upon his graduation in 1983, he was assigned a teaching job at Shanghai No.6th Normal School in 1983. A year later he was expelled from the school, becoming one of few jobless independent artists at the time in China. Zhao left China and went to graduate school at the Academy of Art College in San Francisco in 1986. Dissatisfied with the program, he dropped out, and left San Francisco for New York in 1987. From 1988-1990, Zhao enrolled in the graduate program at the School of Visual Arts, where he received the MFA degree.

In 1996, he created his first earth art project for the Djerassi Foundation in California during a temporary artist's residency.

As a teenager he took guitar lessons from local singer-songwriter Iain MacDonald. MacDonald introduced clemo to the works of Nick Drake, Tim Buckley, Van Morrison, Neil Young and Bob Dylan and he began performing in local folk clubs. ==Developed style== Moving to London in 1982, influenced by the works of Robin Guthrie of The Cocteau Twins and Tom Verlaine of Television, Clemo moved into multitrack recording. Now living in Hackney, East London, he put together a short-lived experimental music band Box in the Sun, but left to explore his musical freedom. Inspired by the works of David Sylvian of Japan, the Cocteau Twins, late-period Talk Talk, Television and Brian Eno, he was also influenced by diverse engagement across artists from Debussy, Arvo P√§rt, David Toop, Gavin Bryars, Holger Czukay and Steve Reich to Patti Smith. This journey inspired Clemo's own non-traditional approach to piece development, through a multi-layered technique which results in a greatly textural output. With the aim of creating inspiring music which always sounds fresh to the listener, Clemo builds soundworlds from diverse sources including field recordings made in locations such as: the crowded streets of New Delhi; the dense insect soundscapes of the Malaysian rainforest; Sydney building sites; Icelandic mud pools; and glass and metal workshops. In the studio he builds complex and densely textured compositions, developing them through a process of composition and improvisation, with contributions from a diverse group of musicians. During the final stages he extensively reconfigures, interweaving instrumental, vocal and recorded material, disguising origin and cultural references. The result is a mix of musical genre, which crosses between jazz, rock, contemporary classical and electronica, described as \\"finely crafted shimmering matrices of sound\\" and creating something which is \\"mesmeric and completely addictive\\". ==Musical careerSound ‚Äì Inhale the Colours=== Philip Clemo live, 2017 Clemo's first two albums were collaborative works with violinist Ysanne Spevack, aka Mee. The pair shared the composition credits, but used Clemo's multi-layered approach to creation and composition. Sound ‚Äì Inhale the Colours was created in 1996/7 largely in Sydney, Australia, featuring contributions from an additional eleven musicians. Well reviewed by critics on release, it remained a question for them as to whether it was jazz, ambient electronica or World music. ===Soundzero=== A second collaborative album Soundzero was completed in 1999, but only released in March 2008.As stated in the Chain D.L.K. review Both albums featured, amongst others, Phil Slater on trumpet and Tarlochan (Bobby) Singh on tabla. On Soundzero, Jazz singer Cleveland Watkiss, often heavily processed, made a guest appearance; whilst the album was also the first appearance of a British rhythm section, consisting of: Mark Sanders (drums); John Edwards (double bass); and Pete Lockett (percussion). ===Ambiguous Dialogues=== Clemo's third album Ambiguous Dialogues, the first under his own name, was released in 2004 on Metier Jazz. Featuring 12 musicians, as well as the British rhythm section it involved contributions from Clive Bell (reeds), and Tom Chant (soprano saxophone and bass clarinet). Clemo toured the work post the album's release, which was well reviewed and received. During the same year, he became a judge for the first time at the British Composer Awards for the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors, which he has since undertaken again in 2005, 2006, 2010 and 2011. ===The Rooms=== In October 2008, Clemo released his fourth album The Rooms. A musical progression through different sound \\"rooms\\" or \\"spaces\\", it featured 22 musicians including: Clive Bell; Theo Travis (saxophone and flute); Simon Hopkins (electric guitar); B.J Cole (pedal steel); Henry Lowther (trumpet and flugelhorn); and a Prague string quartet. Clemo credited legendary sound engineer Phill Brown, who has worked with Jimi Hendrix and Bob Marley among others, for his invaluable contribution to the recording process of The Rooms. The album was critically acclaimed, and reviewed as floating somewhere between jazz, rock and soundtrack, with critics describing it as intelligent \\"fourth world\\" electro-jazz. ===Mesmer=== Up to this point, one of Clemo's key instruments of choice to compose with was the guitar. But having become quite bored with what he was playing on it, he moved for his next album to the piano. For a year he created improvisations, charting a deeply personal journey through significant life experiences and environments. These were then given to pianist Kevin Pollard to interpret and expand, with Clemo then adding additional guitar pieces to shape the compositions. With the basic structure laid out, he then invited 14 additional musicians ‚Äì one at a time ‚Äì to \\"blindly\\" add their response on top, including: Oren Marshall (tuba); B. J. Cole (pedal steel guitar); Byron Wallen (trumpet and flugelhorn); Emily Burridge (cello); with Thomas Bloch (Radiohead, Damon Albarn) contributing ethereal tones on three instruments (glass harmonica, crystal baschet and ondes martenot). Clemo then heavily edited and shaped their contributions. The album was the first on which Clemo added his own voice, using multi-layering to create harmonies. He finally added additional recorded sounds from places which have great significance to him, including: the river and woods at the end of his childhood garden; his first school; Aberdeen railway station; Redwood National Park in northern California; and Plum Village Zen Buddhist monastery in France. As with The Rooms, most of the sessions were recorded by Phill Brown, who Clemo sees as crucial in both building powerful creative environments, and capturing a high level of sonic detail in the sessions. The end result, Mesmer, was well reviewed by both the music and mainstream press, described as a form of contemporary chamber music with \\"improvisation, multi- level musical dialogue and sound design at its core.\\" ===Dream Maps=== With contributions from 21 musicians including Arve Henriksen (trumpet), Evi Vine (voice), Byron Wallen (trumpet, flugelhorn), Oren Marshall (tuba), Thomas Bloch (glass harmonica, Ondes Martenot), Emily Burridge and Peter Gregson (cellos), Dream Maps was released on 9 September 2016 with a live launch with an 8-piece band including Arve Henriksen and Evi Vine at Kings Place, London, UK on 14 September. The concert was described by Richard Williams on thebluemoment.com as \\"Artfully mixed together with recordings of heartbeats and water by the sound engineer Phill Brown, the music washed gently but insistently over the clearly beguiled near-capacity crowd in Kings Place‚Äôs Hall 2... this was Clemo‚Äôs first live gig in 10 years; its success should encourage him.\\" Dream Maps was well received by the media with Selwyn Harris in Jazzwise describing it as \\"Meditative, trance-like stillness‚Ä¶ symphonic ambience‚Ä¶ echoes of‚Ä¶ Brian Eno and David Sylvian. Miles‚Äô Sketches of Spain reimagined by Jon Hassell.\\" Grant Moon in Prog (magazine) said that ‚ÄúPhilip Clemo gets close to the edges on his extraordinary sixth album‚Ä¶ utterly transfixing‚Äù and George Farbey in All About Jazz said ‚ÄúMesmerising‚Ä¶ irresistible and idiosyncratic. Within a jazz context, could even be regarded as a new kind of third stream‚Äù **** Philip Clemo discussed the making of Dream Maps on the BBC Radio 3 programme Jazz Now on 24 October 2016. ==Film-making== Philip Clemo filming in Norway 2013 Having started out professionally as a production film editor, including working on the BBC's Panorama, since 1989 Clemo has made a series of short films which have been shown at festivals around the world. One of his early films was From The Morning On, a travelogue based on a day in the Indian sub-continent. He has since travelled extensively throughout South East Asia and Australasia, with both film camera and sound recording equipment. Having used video projections of his film work extensively in his live musical performances, he filmed his first major project, The Air Holds Still on My Breath in Iceland in summer 2008. Shown at Cannes Short Film Corner in 2009, the film, a series of abstract \\"mood paintings\\" mapping the \\"Seven Ages of Man\\", features music from The Rooms. It was shot using specialist camera technology to capture extreme slow motion details of geothermal activity and waterfalls, and from the air using a gyro- stabilised camera mounted on a helicopter. Shot using the same technical combination as The Air, Clemo made the short film Melt, which was shown at 2009 Reykjavik International Film Festival 2009 and 2010 London Short Film Festival. Since late 2013, Clemo has been working on The Breath Project , encompassing a feature film and art installation produced by perfectmotion and Animal Monday. Breath illustrates the dramas of human life through the metaphor of landscape, from isolation and turmoil to exhilaration and transformation. Moving through the seven phases of human life, through ageing human forms and across different terrains of the human body, we see comparisons with the environments of planet Earth. ==Live performance== Since 2016, Clemo has been performing with his Dream Maps Live band, working with a diverse group of musicians including Arve Henriksen (trumpet), Byron Wallen (trumpet, flugelhron), B. J. Cole (pedal steel), Evi Vine (voice), Simon Edwards (bass), Martyn Barker (drums, percussion), Emily Burridge (cello) and Steven Hill (guitar & keys). ==Discography== * Sound ‚Äì Inhale the Colours, 1997, with Mee (Ysanne Spevack) * soundzero, 1999 (but only released in 2008), with Ysanne Spevack * Ambiguous Dialogues, 2004 * The Rooms, 2008 * Mesmer, 2012 * Dream Maps, 2016 ==Filmography== * Box in the Sun, 1990 * From the Morning On, 1990 * Objects and Observations, 1993 * Thieves ‚Äì Unworthy promo, 1994 * An Altered Perspective (Journeys in the East), 1995 * Metal on Water, 1999 * Separated by Shadows (shown during 2005/6 UK tour), 2005 * The Air Holds Still on My Breath (Iceland Journey), 2009 * Melt, 2009 * Sigur R√≥s ‚Äì Fj√∂gur P√≠an√≥, 2012 * The Mesmer vignettes, 2012 * Return, 2013 * Wide-eyed, 2013 * Orchid, 2013 * The Memory of Objects: Ch√¢teau de Rochebonne, France, 2014 * Water in the Flow (with Evi Vine), 2016 * Shadow Seas (with Evi Vine), 2017 * Breath (Journeys Through the Landscapes of Life), 2018 * Lark, 2018 * Evi Vine: My Only Son, 2019 * Hayley Ross: Dernier Baiser, 2019 ==References *Official Website * Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:People from Aberdeenshire Category:British experimental filmmakers Category:British composers Category:Scottish composers Category:British record producers Category:British experimental musicians Category:British sound artists Category:British installation artists Category:British video artists Category:Scottish contemporary artists ","title":"Philip Clemo"},{"id":"20491248","text":"Diazonaphthoquinone (DNQ) is a diazo derivative of naphthoquinone. Upon exposure to light, DNQ converts to a derivative that is susceptible to etching. In this way, DNQ has become an important reagent in photoresist technology in the semiconductor industry. Diazonaphthoquinone sulfonic acid esters are components of common photoresist materials. Such photoresists are used in the manufacture of semiconductors.Chemical Information Review Document for Diazonaphthoquinone Derivatives Used in Photoresists, National Toxicology Program, January 2006Integrated Circuits: A Brief History In this application DNQs are mixed with Novolac resin, a type of phenolic polymer. The DNQ functions as a dissolution inhibitor. During the masking/patterning process, portions of the photoresist film are exposed to light while others remain unexposed. In the unexposed regions of the resist film, the DNQ acts as a dissolution inhibitor and the resist remains insoluble in the aqueous base developer. In the exposed regions, the DNQ forms a ketene, which, in turn, reacts with ambient water to form a base soluble indene carboxylic acid. The exposed regions of the photoresist film become soluble in aqueous base; thus allowing the formation of a relief image during development. ==Chemical reactions== Upon photolysis, DNQ undergoes a Wolff rearrangement to form a ketene. The ketene adds water to form indane-carboxylic acid. ==References== Category:Diazo compounds ","title":"Diazonaphthoquinone"},{"id":"20491250","text":"The perineal sponge is a spongy cushion of tissue and blood vessels found in the lower genital area of women.

She has also issued 58 singles, one of which, \\"The Wallflower (Dance with Me, Henry),\\" reached number 1 on the Rhythm and Blues Records chart in 1955. As a teenager in San Francisco, California in the early 1950s, James formed a singing trio, which attracted the attention of Johnny Otis, who helped her sign a recording contract with Modern Records in 1954. She recorded \\"The Wallflower (Dance with Me, Henry)\\", an answer song to the Midnighters's \\"Work with Me, Annie\\", with her vocal group, the Peaches, singing background vocals, which topped the R&B; charts for four weeks in 1955. The Peaches eventually left the label, and James recorded as a solo act. She had a second Top 10 hit, \\"Good Rockin' Daddy\\", in 1955. She recorded for Modern until the end of the decade, without much further success. After beginning to date Harvey Fuqua, a singer for the Moonglows, James signed with Argo Records, a subsidiary of Chess Records. Producer Leonard Chess believed James had crossover potential in the pop market and backed her material with orchestral arrangements. With this new style, many of James's songs became hits on both the R&B; and the pop charts, such as \\"All I Could Do Was Cry, \\"At Last,\\" and \\"Trust in Me.\\" She released her debut album, At Last!, in 1960. It was followed by The Second Time Around in 1961. In 1967, James recorded with a more soul-inflected style and had her first Top 10 hit in three years, \\"Tell Mama,\\" which was followed by an album of the same name. In the 1970s, her popularity declined on radio, but remained under Chess records, recording five albums for the label, departing from them with 1975's Etta Is Betta Than Evvah. After battling drug and alcohol addictions, James returned with her first studio album in nine years in 1989 titled, Seven Year Itch on Island Records. Her two albums in the early 90s for Island and later Elektra, varied in style from contemporary to Soul, but James eventually settled in on the Private Music label. Recording a total of ten albums for the label between 1997 and 2002, her albums included variations of contemporary blues to traditional Jazz, such as her 1997 tribute album to Billie Holiday titled, Mystery Lady: Songs of Billie Holiday. In 2004, she signed with RCA Victor and released Blues to the Bone that same year, followed by a Pop standards release, All the Way, in 2006. ==AlbumsStudio albums=== { style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !

Mayrisch established many non-governmental organisations and was President of the Luxembourg Red Cross. She married √âmile Mayrisch. ==Life== Saint-Hubert was the daughter of Xavier de Saint-Hubert, and sister of Jeanne de Saint-Hubert, who had married Xavier Brasseur the previous year (and would marry Brasseur's cousin, Robert Brasseur, in 1914).Mersch (1963), p. 471 She married the industrialist √âmile Mayrisch, who would become President of the steel giant Arbed, on 15 September 1894. Together, they lived in Dudelange. The first of many organisations that she set up was the 'League for the Defence of the Women's Interests' () in 1905.Mersch (1963), p. 471 Saint-Hubert offered the patronage to Hereditary Grand Duchess Marie-Adelaide, but she declined, as a Roman Catholic feminist organisation was due to be set up. The league's main purposes was to seek the establishment of public girls' schools, which gained momentum with the League's creation of the associated Association for the Creation of a School for Young Girls. This campaign achieved success in 1911 when the Chamber of Deputies unanimously voted to establish publicly funded girls' schools in Luxembourg City and Esch-sur- Alzette.Mersch (1963), p. 472 At the same time, Mayrisch persuaded a group of other prominent Luxembourgian ladies to establish the Association of Girl Guides. She was active in work for charitable organisations such as the Luxembourgish League against Tuberculosis, and the Luxembourgish Red Cross, as well as advocating for the professionalisation of social work. On the outbreak of the First World War, Saint-Hubert set up a hospital near Dudelange, for the aid of servicemen of either side. After the war, she played a key role in setting up the Luxembourgian League Against Tuberculosis, of which she was Vice-President. She and her husband √âmile were the main donors to the League and her other endeavours over the years.Mersch (1963), p. 472‚Äì3 She soon became involved in the Luxembourg Red Cross, being appointed a member of its administrative council in 1926, Vice-President after the death of √âmile in 1928, and President in 1933.Mersch (1963), p. 473 She and her husband moved to Colpach in 1920, and after the war they received many German and French intellectuals here under the name of Cercle de Colpach, such as Paul Claudel, Jean Gu√©henno, Jacques Rivi√®re, Karl Jaspers, Bernard Groethuysen, Andr√© Gide, Jean Schlumberger, Ernst Robert Curtius, Annette Kolb and Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi. They turned their old house in Dudelange into a home for children, the Fondation Kreuzberg. During World War II, she lived in Cabris in the south of France. == Art and literature == Aline Mayrisch had a great interest in arts and literature and saw herself as a mediator between the German and French cultural worlds. From 1898, she published articles on German painters and literary criticisms, amongst others on L'Immoraliste by Andr√© Gide, in the Belgian avant-gardist review L'Art moderne. She maintained friendships and correspondences with numerous writers and intellectuals, such as Andr√© Gide, Jean Schlumberger, Jacques Rivi√®re, Henri Michaux, Marie and Th√©o van Rysselberghe, Marie Delcourt, Alexis Curvers, Annette Kolb, Gertrude Eysoldt, Ernst Robert Curtius and Bernhard Groethuysen. In 1914, she accompanied Andr√© Gide and Henri Gh√©on to Turkey and in 1927, she travelled to the Gironde and the Limousin with Ernst Robert Curtius. In Colpach Castle, she arranged Franco-German encounters at which Andr√© Gide could rub meet Walter Rathenau and Ernst Robert Curtius. Aline Mayrisch also introduced Andr√© Gide to the texts of Rainer Maria Rilke, and in publishing an article on Rilke in the Nouvelle Revue Fran√ßaise, she helped find a French public for the German writer. It was in this same review that she published articles on the intellectual situation in Germany after the First World War, as well as her autobiographical travel account Paysages de la trenti√®me ann√©e, which, starting in the island sceneries of Corsica and Iceland, evoked the confrontation with emptiness, absurdity and nothingness. Her unfinished novel Andr√©e Reimenkampf has not been preserved for posterity. In collaboration with Marie Delcourt and Bernhard Groethuysen, Aline Mayrisch also translated the sermons of the medieval mystic Meister Eckhart, L'enfant qui s'accuse by Jean Schlumberger and Le mythe de Sisyphe. Essai sur l'absurde by Albert Camus. In the 1930s, Aline Mayrisch financially supported the exile publication Ma√ü und Wert, edited by Thomas Mann. The following works were dedicated to Aline Mayrisch: Das literarische Frankreich von Heute by Frantz Cl√©ment, Les Cahiers de la Petite Dame by Marie van Rysselberghe and La vie d'Euripide by Marie Delcourt. ==Legacy== The Lyc√©e Aline Mayrisch, open in 2001 in Luxembourg City, the city in which she was born, is named after her. ==FootnotesReferences== * Category:Luxembourgian philanthropists Category:Luxembourgian socialites Category:Luxembourgian feminists Category:1874 births Category:1947 deaths Category:People from Luxembourg City Category:Women's rights activists Category:19th-century Luxembourgian people Category:Catholic feminists ","title":"Aline Mayrisch de Saint-Hubert"},{"id":"20491373","text":"Annandale, Virginia. Ossian Hall was an 18th-century plantation house in Annandale, Fairfax County, Virginia. Ossian Hall was one of three large residences, along with Oak Hill, and Ravensworth, owned by the Fitzhugh family in Fairfax County. ==Location== Ossian Hall was located north of Braddock Road and east of the Capital Beltway (Interstate 495).http://virginia.hometownlocator.com/maps/feature- map,ftc,3,fid,1778890,n,ossian%20hall.cfm ==History== Ossian Hall was built on the Ravensworth land grant by Nicholas Fitzhugh, son of Henry Fitzhugh. In 1804, Dr. David Stuart, a commissioner for the Federal City, purchased Ossian Hall and relocated there with his wife, Eleanor Calvert Custis Stuart, and their children. Francis Asbury Dickins, a Washington attorney, used the home as a summer residence until the outbreak of the Civil War, when it became his year-round residence. All three of the Fitzhugh estates were protected by orders from both sides throughout the war. Joseph L. Bristow, an American politician from Kansas, purchased Ossian Hall in 1918 and died there on July 14, 1944. On September 3, 1959, Ossian Hall was burned as a training exercise for the Annandale Fire Department. ==Image gallery== File:Ossian Hall 161290pu.JPGRear elevation File:Ossian Hall 161291pu.JPGRear elevation File:Ossian Hall 161293pu.JPGFront elevation File:Ossian Hall 161294pu.JPGFront elevation File:Ossian Hall 161295pu.JPGFront entrance File:Ossian Hall 161296pu.JPGSide elevation File:Ossian Hall 161297pu.JPGSide elevation File:Ossian Hall 161298pu.JPGInterior staircase File:Ossian Hall 161299pu.JPGInterior paneling File:Ossian Hall 161300pu.JPGInterior mantelpiece ==See also== *Historic houses in Virginia ==References Category:Landmarks in Virginia Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Virginia Category:Colonial architecture in Virginia Category:Houses in Fairfax County, Virginia Category:Fitzhugh family residences Category:Custis family residences Category:Annandale, Virginia Category:Plantation houses in Virginia Category:Burned houses in the United States Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1959 Category:1959 disestablishments in Virginia ","title":"Ossian Hall"},{"id":"20491374","text":"Stratia or Stratie () was a city in ancient Arcadia.

Written by Brian Azzarello and illustrated by Lee Bermejo, it is based on characters from DC's Batman series, focusing primarily on the title character. It is a unique take on the Batman mythos, set outside regular continuity and narrated by one of the Joker's henchmen. The miniseries Batman: Damned is a stand-alone sequel to the graphic novel, with the miniseries incorporating certain details, settings, and designs that hint at the two stories sharing a connected narrative. ==Publication history== Azzarello and Bermejo had previously worked on a similar take on Superman's archenemy in Lex Luthor: Man of Steel, and Joker grew out of a discussion following completion of that project. DC Editor Dan DiDio approved the new project the following day.Exploring the Joker - Brian Azzarello Talks, Newsarama, September, 2008 The initial plan was to reflect this connection with a title sharing the same structure, Joker: The Dark Knight but it was felt to be too similar to the film The Dark Knight, and so the name was shortened. When the writer was asked if he preferred writing villains he said \\"I relate to them. [Laughs] I don't relate to the heroes. The Man, tryin' to keep you down!\\"CCI: Brian Azzarello Q&A;, Comic Book Resources, July 26, 2008 ==Plot== Jonny Frost, a low-level thug, is sent to Arkham Asylum to pick up the Joker. Joker immediately takes a liking to Frost, using him as a chauffeur. Frost drives the Joker to the lair of Killer Croc. The three go to a strip bar. With the help of Harley Quinn, the Joker kills the owner and asks the shocked audience if they are willing to help him take his city back. The next morning, the Joker robs a bank and coaxes the Penguin to invest the stolen money. The Joker embarks on a killing spree, murdering many thugs who stole his money, turf, and bizarre sense of reputation. Informed by the Penguin that Harvey Dent is evading a talk with him, an enraged Joker trashes a phone, kills one of his own henchmen, and then sets the Grin and Bare It on fire. The next day, Frost is detained by Dent, who warns Frost that the Joker will kill him. Subsequently, Frost is late to the Joker's meeting with the Riddler, a disabled weapons dealer. They exchange a briefcase, and the Joker leaves. Once on the road, the Joker's crew is shot at by off-duty cops hired by Dent, and Frost saves the Joker's life in the scuffle. The Joker embarks on a turf war against Dent, prompting him to meet with the Joker at the city zoo. Bringing the briefcase he received from the Riddler, the Joker says he has learned Dent has two wives, and threatens to use the contents of the briefcase as leverage against him. He then attacks Dent with shards of broken glass embedded in his fingertips. When Dent's men raise their guns, Harley shoots each one in the head. After helping Frost get his ex-wife Shelly back from Dent, the Joker rapes her in front of Frost, saying this makes them \\"even\\", since Frost \\"cheated\\" on the Joker by not revealing his own meeting with Dent. Later, Harvey paints a bat on a spotlight, and pleads with Batman to stop the Joker. When the Joker and Frost return to their apartment, they find the window shattered and flee to Croc's lair. However, Batman has already subdued Croc and his gang. In a final attempt to escape, Joker and Frost flee to a nearby bridge. While Joker is \\"screaming through tears\\", Frost inexplicably finds himself laughing, unable to stop. They find Batman in wait, and the Joker, being provoked by Batman's taunts, shoots Frost in the chin, leaving him with a Glasgow smile. The Joker and Batman fight as Frost climbs over the edge of the bridge and falls into the river. ==Reception== The graphic novel generally received positive reviews. IGN stated \\"Brian Azzarello and Lee Bermejo's Joker is a deeply disturbing and completely unnerving work, a literary achievement that takes its place right alongside Alan Moore's The Killing Joke as one of the few successful attempts to scratch beneath the surface of the Joker's impenetrable psyche.\\"Review. IGN AICN noted that \\"The story is compelling, especially the gut-wrenching showdown at the end of the book, and the art is mouth-wateringly good.\\" ==In other mediaFilm=== * In a 2016 interview, Brian Azzarello has mentioned that he hopes for his Joker graphic novel to someday receive an animated film adaptation. * Jonny Frost appears as one of Joker's henchmen in the 2016 film Suicide Squad, portrayed by Jim Parrack. Harley Quinn is also depicted as a nightclub stripper similar to what was showcased in the graphic novel. ===Video games=== *Joker's clothing in the 2013 game Batman: Arkham Origins is nearly identical to his graphic novel counterpart. ==ReferencesExternal linksInterviews=== *Bad Azz Mojo - Part 4, Broken Frontier, October 13, 2006 ===Reviews=== *Review, Comic Book Resources *Best Shots Extra: Joker, Newsarama *Graphic novel slugfest, Comics Bulletin Category:2008 graphic novels Category:2008 comics debuts Category:Batman graphic novels Category:Comics by Brian Azzarello Category:Crime comics Category:Superhero comics Graphic novel ","title":"Joker (graphic novel)"},{"id":"20491392","text":"Club Deportivo Soledad was a Spanish football team based in Palma, Majorca, in the autonomous community of Balearic Islands.

Olivier Falorni (Divers Gauche) succeeded him as an MP of the Charente-Maritime's 1st constituency.

He represents the islands of French Polynesia and is a member of the Union for a Popular Movement. == Biography == After attending school at the Brothers' School in Plo√´rmel where he obtained his baccalaureate degree in 1969, he began his professional career at the bottom of the scale at the Socr√©do bank, then went on to hold administrative posts before returning to school and obtaining a degree in law from the University of Bordeaux in 1979. In 1983, he was appointed Director of the Territorial Office for Health and Social Action (OTASS). That same year saw his entry into politics in the Tahoeraa huiraatira and his election to the municipal council of Pirae in the team of Gaston Flosse. In 1984, French Polynesia gained internal autonomy. First Polynesian president, Gaston Flosse named him a member of the government of French Polynesia by assigning a large ministry in charge of Labor, Employment, Vocational Training and Housing. After the territorial elections of 1986, he took the portfolio of Youth, Sports and Housing. In December 1987, following a reversal of the majority, Michel Buillard returned to the Assembly of French Polynesia, where he sat as an advisor in the opposition Tahoeraa Huiraatira ranks. In 1989, he founded the association Ia Ora Papeete, at the head of which he was fighting for the first time the mayor of Papeete. He fails, but at 38, he gets a very honorable score of 21.5% against an outgoing mayor, Jean Juventin, then at the height of its popularity. After the territorial elections of March 1991, the Tahoeraa Huiraatira returns to power. Gaston Flosse appointed him vice-president of the government and awarded him the Ministry of Health, Solidarity, Housing and Research. On June 24, 1995, Michel Buillard was elected mayor of Papeete after the victory of his list Ia Ora Papeete in the second round against the outgoing mayor Louise Carlson.

Michel Buillard has also advanced community amenities, green spaces, quality of housing, cultural and commercial animation, actions in favor of the youth and the elderly, the reception of tourists ... It is due to the construction, from 2009, of an ambitious network of collective sanitation cited as a model in the South Pacific by the Union which contributes to its financing.

These laws deemed it illegal for \\"any person, who is diseased, maimed, mutilated or deformed in any way, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, to expose himself or herself to public view.\\" Exceptions to public exposure were acceptable only if the people were subjects of demonstration, to illustrate the separation of disabled from nondisabled and their need for reformation. The Charity Organization Society suggested that the best charity relief would be to investigate and counsel the people needing assistance instead of provide them with material relief. This created conflict in people between their desire to be good Christians and good citizens when seeing people in need of assistance. It was suggested that the beggars imposed guilt upon people in this way. \\"Pauperism is a disease upon the community, a sore upon the body politic, and being a disease, it must be, as far as possible, removed, and the curative purpose must be behind all our thought and effort for the pauper class.\\" Similar to what Slocum said, other authors suggested that giving charity to beggars without knowing what was to be done with the funds, was as \\"culpable as one who fires a gun into a crowd\\". The term \\"ugly laws\\" was coined in the mid-1970s by detractors Marcia Pearce Burgdorf and Robert Burgdorf, Jr. ==History== In the United Kingdom, in 1729 punishment was recommended for people with physical disabilities, whether they were born with disabilities or acquired later in life, who appeared in public. Ugly laws in the United States arose in the late nineteenth century. During this period, urban spaces underwent an influx of new residents, which placed strain on the existing communities. The new residents were sometimes impoverished. This meant large numbers of people who were strangers to each other now occupied closer quarters than they had in small towns, where such local institutions as schools, families, and churches helped moderate social relations. As a reaction to this influx of people who were impoverished, ministers, charitable organizers, city planners, and city officials across the United States worked to create ugly laws for their community. The language of the unsightly beggar ordinances pertained to hiding the parts of the person that may appear disabled or diseased. This includes any movements that would indicate a disability or disease, like limping. The first American ordinance pertaining to preventing people with disabilities from appearing in public was one passed in 1867 in San Francisco, California. This ordinance had to do with the broader topic of begging. It is noted that people who were perhaps in need of money traveled to California to \\"strike it rich\\" during the California Gold Rush. When they did not find themselves wealthy, they remained in California. Letters and documents from the period just after the California Gold Rush note the large number of \\"insane\\" people wandering the streets. Helper (1948) even refers to the \\"insane\\" people as \\"pitible nuisance\\" and remarked that they were allowed in public with no one to care for them. New Orleans, Louisiana had a similar law police were strictly enforcing in 1883. A New Orleans newspaper reported on the City adopting a tough stance on begging as other cities in the United States had. Portland, Oregon enacted an ugly law in 1881. The Chicago ordinance of 1881 read as follows: > Any person who is diseased, maimed, mutilated, or in any way deformed, so as > to be an unsightly or disgusting object, or an improper person to be allowed > in or on the streets, highways, thoroughfares, or public places in the city, > shall not therein or thereon expose himself or herself to public view, under > the penalty of a fine of $1 for each offense (Chicago City Code 1881) The fine of $1 equates to more than $20 in 2018. In most cities, punishments for violating an ugly law ranged from incarceration to fines of up to $50 for each offense. In May 1881, the unsightly beggar ordinance went into effect in Chicago, Illinois. It was created by Chicago alderman James Peevey. Peevey is quoted in the Chicago Tribune from May 19, 1881 saying of the ordinance, \\"Its object is to abolish all street obstructions.\\" Ugly laws identified groups of people as disturbing the flow of public life and banned them from public spaces. Such people, deemed \\"unsightly\\" or \\"unseemly,\\" were usually impoverished and often beggars. Thus ugly laws were methods by which lawmakers attempted to remove the poor from sight. Laws similar to the one in Chicago followed in Denver, Colorado and Lincoln, Nebraska in 1889. At some time from 1881 to 1890 an ugly law was enacted in Omaha, Nebraska. Additionally, ugly laws were sparked by the Panic of 1893. These included Columbus, Ohio in 1894, and in 1891 for the entire state of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania's was different as it contained language applying to cognitive disability as well as physical disability. An attempt was made at introducing ugly laws in New York, but it failed in 1895. Initial drafts in New York were similar to those in Pennsylvania as to include cognitive disabilities. Reno, Nevada instituted an ordinance before 1905. Los Angeles, California attempted to pass an ordinance in 1913. In 1902, an ugly law similar to that of the United States was enacted in the City of Manila in the Philippines. This law was similar to those of the United States, being written in English and during a time when Manila was under American control, and included the common phrasing \\"no person who is diseased\\". This was one of the first ordinances to be written under American control. Other ordinances dealt with hygiene reform and considered unsightly beggars part of this indicative. The last ugly laws were repealed in 1974.Marcia Pearce Burgdorf and Robert Burgdorf, Jr., \\"A History of Unequal Treatment: The Qualifications of Handicapped Persons as a Suspect Class Under the Equal Protection Clause,\\" Santa Clara Lawyer 15:4 (1975) 855-910. Omaha, Nebraska repealed its ugly law in 1967, yet had an arrest of a person for violating the unsightly beggar ordinance documented in 1974. Columbus, Ohio withdrew its in 1972. Chicago was the last to repeal its ugly law in 1974. ==Enforcement== People charged under the ugly law were either charged a fine or held in jail until they could be sent to the poor house or work farm. The wording in the San Francisco ordinance indicates violators will be sent to the almshouse. This connects with the Victorian Era poor law policy. Historian Brad Byrom noted ugly laws have been unevenly and rarely enforced, being disregarded by police. The first recorded arrest pertaining to ugly laws was Martin Oates in San Francisco, California in July 1867. Oates was a former Union soldier during the American Civil War. The ugly laws did not restrict performances of people with disabilities for the purpose of entertainment or eliciting disgust, but rather restricted people with disabilities from mingling with the general public. Use of the ugly laws to control the use of public spaces by people with disabilities was still occurring after the signing of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Racism also played a role in the enforcement of ugly laws. In San Francisco, Chinese immigrants and their descendants were unlawfully quarantined to prevent spread of disease and epidemics. The last recorded arrest related to an ugly law was in 1974, in regard to an Omaha, Nebraska ordinance. In that instance, the man arrested was homeless and the officer arresting him did so under the guise of the ugly law as the man had visible scars and marks on his body. The judge, Walter Cropper, and assistant prosecutor, Richard Epstein, in this case noted there was no legal definition for ugly and criminal prosecution would demand proving someone is ugly. The end result was the city prosecutor, Gary Bucchino, did not file charges noting while the law was still active, just this person did not meet the definition. ==Criticism== Ugly laws prevented people with physical disabilities from going out in public at all. Stuart Murray () says \\"displays of the human condition affect Americans in such a way as it is the nature of Americans to conform\\". Jacobus tenBroek (1966) argued that the limitations imposed on a person with a disability had little to do with actual disability, but rather \\"society's imagined thoughts of disability difficulties and risks\\". In 1975, Marcia Pearce Burgdorf and Robert Burgdorf, Jr. wrote about the unsightly beggar ordinances in their newspaper article, \\"A History of Unequal Treatment: The Qualifications of Handicapped Persons as a 'Suspect Class' under the Equal Protection Clause\\". In this article, the term \\"ugly laws\\" was created and used, having been inspired by the newspaper article title regarding the Omaha arrest in 1974. It was an act of advocacy. John Belluso's play The Body of Bourne has a scene in which Randolph Bourne was confronted in Chicago due to an ugly law. While this is a fictional occurrence, the depiction of the law indicates the impact on disability history. In 1980, while on tour in Europe, performer with the San Francisco- based Lilith Women's Theatre, Victoria Ann Lewis, delivered a monologue about the difficulty of people with disabilities finding work due to the social idea that people with disabilities should hide or be in the circus. Lewis believed herself to be denied admission to a theater school in New York City due to her limp. She noted they tried to persuade her to take a position behind the scenes. She felt this was due to the ugly laws and that she would not be able to perform in some cities. ==Impact on legislation and policy== Some authors have argued for a connection to segregation, eugenics, institutionalization, and organized charity. The ugly laws had a great impact on what society considers rehabilitation. People with disabilities were not allowed to beg for food or money to support their needs as a person, but it was acceptable to display themselves in order to beg for a cure or salvation from their disability. A cure from their disability would mean being able to assimilate into able-bodied society. Relationships, reproductive rights and individual right to life were also impacted by the ugly laws and charitable philosophy during this period. Policy makers discussed preventing people with disabilities from marrying and having children. The policy makers suggested this was to prevent the children their union would produce from tainting society's heredity pool. Charity must \\"do what it can to check the spreading curse of race degeneration\\". People involved with charitable policy suggested that while euthanasia would be a release for the person struggling with their disabilities, it also went against the moral principles taught by religion. The repeal of ugly laws preceded the passing of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 where certain rights were granted to people with disabilities. Fredman (2011) comments: \\"Individuals with disabilities are a discrete and insular minority who have been faced with restrictions and limitations, subjected to a history of purposeful unequal treatment, and relegated to a position of political powerlessness in our society, based on characteristics that are beyond the control of such individuals and resulting from stereotypic assumptions not truly indicative of the individual ability of such individuals to participate in, and contribute to, society.\\" ==See also== * Ableism * Lookism ==References== Category:Disability in law Category:Discrimination Category:History of San Francisco Category:History of the United States Category:History of Chicago ","title":"Ugly law"},{"id":"20491564","text":"Michel Destot (born 2 September 1946) is a member of the National Assembly of France.

It is mentioned in Pausanias, who visited and described its temples, and who narrated the elaborate story of King Teuthis' dispute with Agamemnon and goddess Athena in Aulis, prior to the Greek fleet's departure for the Trojan War.The story goes as follows[Pausanias, Book VIII, 28 (4-6)] : During the Trojan war, the local Arcadians sent troops to Avlida to join the rest of the Greeks. Their leader, named Teuthis (or Ornytus, according to others), frustrated by the long waiting for favorable winds that would enable departure from Avlis, quarrelled with the commander- in-chief Agamemnon and was about to return his detachment of \\"Teuthides\\" back home. At this point, they say, Athene disguised as Melas, son of Ops, tried to block his return, but the furious Teuthis struck the thigh of the goddess with his spear and actually lead his men back to Arcadia. Upon his return to the homeland, they say Athene herself appeared to him in a vision having a wound in her thigh, and from then on a disease befell the city making it the only Arcadian district to produce no crops! Some time later, the people received instructions from the Dodona oracle on ceremonies meant to pacify the goddess, and they made s statue of Athene with a wound in her thigh. (Pausanias writes that he saw this statue, which had a purple bandage wrapped around the thigh.) == Introduction == According to Pausanias, Teuthis together with TheisoaTheisoa must not be confused with a city with the same name, located in the southwest, west of the river Alpheios in the Andritsaina area. and Methydrium, were three cities who originally \\"belonged\\" to Orchomenus but whose inhabitants decided to relocate and join many others in forming the Great City (Megalopolis), in 371 BCE in order to better protect themselves from the Spartans. Although labeled by some as a \\"Homeric\\" city, Teuthis is not explicitly mentioned in Homer. Thus the oldest and, practically, the only \\"original\\" information we have about its location can be found in Pausanias. Unfortunately, his description of the whereabouts of Teuthis is open to interpretation and, therefore, has caused a great deal of disagreement among the 19th century knowledgeable western travelers of Arcadia. == The Problem of Location == The following tabulation lists the names of the most important of such \\"œÄŒµœÅŒπŒ∑Œ≥Œ∑œÑŒ±ŒØ\\", almost all of which used Pausanias' book as a guide in their Arcadian travels. With regard to Teuthis, their (independent) educated guesses involve two locations: the Akova/Galatas area in the north (the medieval castle of which is situated in a place inhabited in antiquity and whose habitation has had to be continuous),Antoine Bon, \\"La Mor√©e franque. Recherches historiques, topographiques et arch√©ologiques sur la principaut√© d‚ÄôAcha√Øe\\", Paris, De Boccard 1969, p. 394) and the town of Dimitsana in the south (which is also built on older fortified ruins, clearly visible today): 1\\\\.

Hughes' mapWilliam Hughes, Map of the Peloponnese Peninsula, eng. G.E. Sherman, print. J. Bien, New York N.Y. 1867 also reflects Leake's ideas on the subject. Having practiced - at best - \\"surface archaeology\\", most of the distinguished travelers listed above were (understandably) careful when they wrote about the location of the city. They used words like \\"probably\\", \\"perhaps\\", \\"may\\", or the question mark next to its name (Teuthis?). Only Ross, Leake, and Levi took a definite stand on the issue (along with the \\"cartographers\\" Peytier, Kiessling, and Kiepert). Finally, Latterman was also firm about his choice, but he erroneously used Leake's name in the process. == A closer look at Pausanias' visit to Teuthis == Travelling on the road which joins Heraia with Megalopolis, Pausanias reached the village of Gortys, which used to be a city, and described the temple of Asclepius [Bk VIII, 28 (1)]. He then wrote about the river of the city, which has very cold water, especially in the summer. He explained that the southern part of it - which flows into the Alpheios - was called Gortynios, while the northern part was called Lousios (i.e. Wash, because new-born Zeus was bathed in it) [Bk VIII, 28 (2)]. The end of the next paragraph in Pausanias's \\"Arcadika\\" [Bk VIII, 28 (3)], contains the first significant information about the location problem: \\" ·ºúœáŒµŒπ Œº·Ω≤ŒΩ Œ¥·Ω¥ œÑ·Ω∞œÇ œÄŒ∑Œ≥·Ω∞œÇ ·ºêŒΩ ŒòŒµŒπœÉœå·æ≥ œÑ·øÜ ŒúŒµŒ∏œÖŒ¥œÅŒπŒµ·ø¶œÉŒπŒΩ ·ΩÅŒºœåœÅ·ø≥\\" \\"But its springs are in Theisoa, which borders on the Methydrienses\\" In other words, the Theisoa greater area, which borders the west part of Methydrio, extends all the way north-east of modern Langadia, where the actual springs of Gortynios/Lusios are found. Any map of the area shows that Theisoa - which is near the modern village of Karkalou - is located quite north of Gortys. Thus, it can be safely assumed that Pausanias was moving in a south-to-north direction, having started from Gortys and going toward Teuthis, since [Bk VIII, 28 (4)]: \\"œÑ·øá œáœéœÅ·æ≥ Œ¥·Ω≤ œÑ·øá ŒòŒµŒπœÉœå·æ≥ œÄœÅŒøœÉŒµœá·Ω¥œÇ Œ∫œéŒºŒ∑ Œ§Œµ·ø¶Œ∏ŒØœÇ ·ºêœÉœÑŒπ: œÄŒ¨ŒªŒ±Œπ Œ¥·Ω≤ ·º¶ŒΩ œÄœåŒªŒπœÉŒºŒ± ·º° Œ§Œµ·ø¶Œ∏ŒπœÇ.\\" \\"Bordering town to Theisoa is Teuthis, which was formerly a city.\\" That is, Teuthis, which is bordering Theisoa, was located somewhere north of Gortys. Pausanias, however, mentions Theisoa first, but does not indicate whether he visited there. And this, gets things complicated. Given the terrain of the greater area and the fact that Methydrium is the eastern neighbor of Theisoa, then Teuthis itself could be either the southern or the north-western neighbor. Thus, (keeping in mind that Pausanias is coming from the south) one must decide for which one of the two situations the phrase \\"Teuthis borders Theisoa\\" makes more sense. [Normally we are interested in what lies ahead of our destination, and not beyond it. Therefore, the preceding \\"bordering\\" statement could suggest that Teuthis lies beyond Theisoa, i.e. in its north- northwest.] == Conclusion == It is obvious that only systematic excavations can put an end to the doubts raised by the fact that no inscription naming Teuthis has been found in Dimitsana, the modern town which has \\"claimed\\" the name of the ancient city for its own ruins. As for contemporary arguments in support of such a claim, one can judge for himself reading the following opinions of esteemed personnel of the British and French \\"archaeology\\" schools in Athens, respectively: ¬∑ \\"Dhimitsana. (...). The site is generally identified with ancient TeuthisR. Howell, \\"A Survey of Eastern Arcadia in Prehistory\\", The Annual of the British School at Athens, Vol. 65 (1970) p. 100.\\" ¬∑ \\"Si l'on admet que Teuthis √©tait au Sud de Thisoa, pr√®s du Gortynios, l'attribution √†cette bourgade des vestiges antiques visibles dans le village de Dimitsana, au Sud-Ouest de KarkalouM.

They are considered to be Edoid based on linguistic grounds. They are actually Ijoid (they are of Ijaw root). This is because their oral history connect them with their Ijaw relatives. They primarily live in Ahoada west local government area of Rivers state, Nigeria. Although they consider themselves to be Ijaw, the Engenni speak an Edoid language. This is due to the influence of the old Benin kingdom on them. Alagoa (2003) said: ‚Äú---The penetration of the Niger-Delta by Edoid groups extends to the Epie-Atissa and Engenni of the central and Eastern Niger-Delta----The Epie, along with the Ogbia and other groups of the central and eastern Niger-Delta, are historically united with the Ijaw.‚Äù The other groups of the central and eastern Niger-Delta which Professor Ebiegberi Alagoa said that were historically united with the Ijaw, include the Engenni, as shown from his narrative above. The Engenni have close relations with neighbouring Ijaw tribes such as the Zarama and Epie-Atissa.Alagoa, Ebiegberi Joe (2005). A History of the Niger Delta, Port Harcourt: Onyoma Research Publications. Historically, it is claimed that Engenni migrated from the old Benin Empire about 1000 years ago. In the cause of migration they first settled in an Isoko community and later founded a settlement called Ewurebe. Though no longer in existence, history has it that the settlement was situated near the border between the present-day Biseni in Bayelsa State and Engenni. They later migrated and founded other settlements which include Okilogua, Okpankio, Nyenegile and Eliabi (Akinima) and later founded the present day Engennni communities and other outside Engenni kingdom. Some communities founded from Engenni migration include, Degema, Usokun, Obonoma and Zarama. Engenni historical presence is also felt at Kula, Bile and some communities in Abua, Ogbia, as well as some other communities in Bayelsa State. The Ijaws were the aboriginal people of ancient benin before the arrival of the ancestors of the present day Benins( Binis), according to the oral history of the Ijaw people. The Engenni clan is believed to have first settled in and around their present habitations over nine hundred years ago, as depicted by historical artifacts collected at Okilogua, Enusha, and the Ede-emu lakes at Ewurebe, Okilouga, Enusha, and Ikodi communities. Engenni kingdom is grouped among the Niger- Congo, Edoid people of Nigeria, belonging to the Kwa group of the Delta sub- Saharan Africa. They belong to the Guinean cluster and speak a primary language known originally as Ejiro. The Engenni people are among the very first settlers in the Niger Delta region and this is corroborated by some aspects of the early history, culture and environmental characteristics of the kingdom as documented in the works of historians and early Christian visitors to the early 1800s. Engenni Kingdom lies on the banks of the Engenni River (now known as part of the Orashi river). The Engenni River has significant tributaries like the Taylor creek and Kolo creek which are major gateways to other Niger Delta habitations like the Ijo clans, the Nembe, as well as the Ogbia and Kalabari kingdoms. The Engenni (Egene) language has metamorphosed into three major dialects namely Enuedua, Ogua, and Ejiro dialects. Geopolitically, Engenni forms part of the present-day Ahoada West Local Government Area of Rivers State, and host the local Government Headquarters at Akinima. The kingdom is ruled by one government recognized traditional ruler, the Okilom-Ibe of Engenni kingdom, who is the paramount ruler of the Kingdom. All five federating clans of the kingdom have a Group-head known as the Okilom-Opiri, while communities within the clans that make up the Engenni kingdom have traditional heads known as the Okilom-Akie. The earliest known documentation of Engenni language, culture, and phonetic sounds are those of American Baptist missionaries in the area, as well as occasional mention in the works of some missionaries on the Niger Delta region, as well as those generated by early European traders like the Lander Brothers, and the United African Company. Engenni Kingdom is rich in crude oil and natural gas, and exploration and exploitation of these minerals began since 1956. The Shell Petroleum Development Company (formerly Royal Dutch Shell) found petroleum in commercial quantities at the Adebawa wells of Joinkrama, and have since then been engaged in commercial oil and gas activities in the area. The Adebawa oil wells of Joinkrama ranks only second to Oloibiri, where oil was first found in commercial quantities in Nigeria. This huge contribution to the Nigerian economy not withstanding Engenni has very little to show as the kingdom has no government presence except for local primary and secondary schools. The only road linking the Ogua and Enuedua (Joinkrama) clans of Engenni is a Shell access road, and no other part of the kingdom is motorable up till date, in spite of the fact that here are several oil wells scattered along the community. The major prospecting oil companies in the area are Shell and Agip. Engenni is made up of five major clans known as Enuedua (Joinkrama), Ogua, Ejiro‚ÄîEde, Ejiro-Ekunu, and Ogbogolo Clans. The Engenni clans are made up of about 31 towns and villages which include Betterland, Edagberi, Odawu, Isua, Ususu, Ogu, Adele, Clinton town and other towns of the Enuedua (Joinkrama) clan, Akinima, Okilogua, Oshie, Akioniso, One-Man-Country, Eneda (Mbiama),Ishayi and Agbo which make up the Ogua Clan, the Ejiro-Ede clan made up of Akiogbologbo, Enusha, Okarki, Ipilopanyi, Okparaki, and other towns in the Ejiro-Ede clan, the Ejiro-Ekunu clan made up of Ikodi, Kunusha, Igovia, Udoda, and other towns and villages, while the last Egnenni clan of Ogbogolo is made up of Egbama, Opu-Ogbogolo, and Kala-Ogbogolo. The inclusion of Ogbogolo may not altogether be historically and linguistically correct as the Ogbogolo people speak what is purely regarded as \\"Ogbia\\". Ogbogolo is a distinct language in the Niger-Congo family as a Central Delta language of Nigeria. Oral tradition has it that the Ogbogolo people migrated from Kaskrama (present day Otuegwe) in Ogbia Local Government Area of Bayelsa State under their leader Egbo after whom their chief town Egboama is named. Engenni people are very friendly and hospitable, a fact that is evidenced in their whole- hearted acceptance of the early Christians and European traders who established churches, schools and hospitals in the area as early as the late 1800s. The people of Engenni kingdom are traditional farmers and fishermen, and crafts making skills like canoe and paddle making, black smithing, basket and trap making are also known vocations and occupations of the people of Engenni kingdom. Although the people were deeply engaged in traditional heathenism before the advent of Christianity in the mid 1800s, Engenni communities and people today are largely Christians and the towns and villages of Engenni are filled with churches of every denomination. Engenni people are very proud but respectful people, very much inclined to western education, and known to have the highest percentage educated population in Rivers State. The first primary school in Engenni was built in Okarki in the year 1903. ==Significant events== * 1900 - The First Baptist Church is established in Okarki by Rev.

The Land and People of Bayelsa State: Central Niger Delta, Port Harcourt: Onyoma Research Publications. They speak the Epie language. The Epie and Atissa remain two separate Nations. The Epie have villages that run from Igbogene to Amarata; namely, Igbogene, Yenegwe, Akenfa, Agudama Epie, Akenpai, Edepie, Okutukutu, Opolo, Biogbolo, Yenizue Gene, Kpansia, Yenizue Epie, Okaka, Ekeki, Azikoro and Amarata. The Atissa have villages that run from Onopa to Ikolo to Ogu to Agbura namely Onopa, Ovom, Yenagoa, Bebelebiri, Yenaka, Ikolo, Famgbe, Obogoro, Akaba, Ogu, Swali, and Agbura. The Epie language is recorded sometime in the 1970s to have had about 12000 speakers spread from Igbogene to Amarata, but within the last 30 years the numbers of living speakers have greatly reduced. Though there is no current record of the numbers of speakers, the Epie language is not spared from the global epidemic that has befallen most of the world's little languages. The forces that have contributed greatly to the decline in the numbers of speakers are not new. Urbanisation and westernisation are factors, but another major problem that has contributed to the decline is the absence of certain cultural norms that one would usually find in other Nigerian ethnic groups. For example, the traditional chiefs and elders of council are very young men and women, some of them in their 20s. These young people have lost touch of the basic cultural heritage and are hence not capable of transferring it to the younger generations. Many cultural aspects of the Epie-Atissa people have been lost, mainly due to the loss of traditional culture in favor of Western ideals. The Epie-Atissa kingdom has been the eye-base of business in Bayelsa state. The largest public local market, situated at Swali in the Atissa clan, has been very resourceful to the people of the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Akenfa, one of the most important cities in the kingdom, is approximately 4 km square, making it the third largest community in the kingdom by area. Akenfa is currently ruled by a locally elected chief, Saiyah, who has ruled the community for approximately 12 years. According to the traditions of the Epie-Atissa kingdom, a chief will only be elected if the active chief is dead and buried for three months. The people of Akenfa have deviated from formal tradition and made the kingship an elected position around 2000. A new chief is elected after every four years. The Akenfa community is known to have the largest youth population in the kingdom, and these youth are known to be the pillars of the community. The youth are led by a locally elected official known as the Youth-President. This Youth-President is formally responsible for the youth's welfare and he makes the decisions for the youth. Another role of the youth president is to represent the community in youth affairs, the currently elected youth president is Mr. Mandi. Another recognized leader of the community is the Community Development Committee chairman (CDC), which is also locally elected, the current CDC chairman is Mr. John O. Osomu. The major role of the CDC chairman is to be in charge of all developments coming to the community. The Yenagoa community in the Epie-Atissa clan is the capital of Bayelsa State, and the chief of the Yenagoa community is known as HRH M.A Clarkson Kikile Oguo V, Ebeni-Eken of Yenagoa. ==Significant events== * 23 July 2007: Two expatriates working for MTN Nigeria Limited in Akenfa-Epie, a village outside of Yenagoa, were abducted by gunmen.\\"Gunmen Kill Teacher, Kidnap Expatriates In Niger Delta\\", The Independent, 28 July 2007 and a kid was found in the Epie creek 2 days after the gunmen killed the teacher, and some students. * Early November 2013: the youths of Akenfa-Epie were attacked in the forest by the neighboring community; Agudama-Epie.

According to local oral traditions, the Kabo tribe built a barrier on the river in order to prevent European ships using the river to conduct slave raids. The Kabo cooperated with the nearby Kumbo tribe to divert the Forcados onto its current course. As a result of this diversion, however, the Kabo lost their commercial preeminence to the Mein, who dominated the banks of the lower Forcados River. The Kabo remained confined to the banks of the small Kabobolou Creek. Over time, the clan sought to expand its influence beyond this backwater. The result of this expansion effort was the establishment of the town of Patani.

Its last assignment was with the 7217th Air Division at Cigli Air Base, Turkey, where it was inactivated in 1970. From 1966 to 1970 the group controlled deployed fighter squadrons. During World War II, the unit was a North American B-25 Mitchell unit serving with Seventh Air Force in the Pacific. It was inactivated in January 1946 at Manila, Philippines. During the Okinawa Campaign, the group began the first sustained medium bombardment strikes against the main islands of Japan. It established its facilities and operated its aircraft under the most hazardous field conditions. Undeterred by either the constant rain during April and May or by heavy enemy artillery shelling and repeated day and night aerial bombing of the air strips, the unit succeeded in carrying out highly effective aerial operations against the enemy from Kyushu to the southernmost island of the Ryukyu Group, flying reconnaissance and search missions, escort missions, day and night bomber strikes. ==History== The 41st Bombardment Group was activated 15 January 1941 at March Field, California. Its components were the 46th, 47th, and 48th Bombardment Squadrons. Attached to the 19th Bombardment Group for training, the 41st received a cadre of 4 officers and 120 enlisted men from the parent organization. During February the Group received additional personnel, and four months after activation it received its first aircraft, one PT-17 for each squadron. In June, two B-18s were assigned to each squadron. Meanwhile, on 14 May the Group moved to Tucson, where it grew to a third of its authorized strength. It was not until after it moved to the Muroc Bombing and Gunnery Range, California, four days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, that the Group received a full complement of personnel and equipment. Within a month, a large increment of pilots had arrived from flying school and 45 A-29s had been assigned to the Group. ===Antisubmarine patrols=== On 26 February, the 41st moved to Hammer Field, Fresno, California. In addition to training its pilots and ground crews, the Group also assisted in patrolling the coastal waters for enemy submarines. In May, the 46th Bombardment Squadron moved to Alameda, California, where the pilots assisted the Navy in patrol duty. Later in the same year the 48th moved to Alameda and continued its patrol work. Meanwhile, the composition of the Group had changed. The 6th Reconnaissance Squadron (later redesignated the 396th Bombardment Squadron) was assigned during March 1942. Headquarters Squadron was disbanded in July 1942. During the following year, in March 1943, the 46th was reassigned, and in October the 820th took its place in the Group. Thus the Group consisted of the 47th, 48th, 396th, and 820th Bombardment Squadrons. By mid-1943 the military situation in the Pacific had changed considerably. The United States was no longer on the defensive. Units which had been employed to defend the west coast might now be diverted to the Pacific to press the attack against the enemy. A projected offensive against the Japanese in the Central Pacific required that the Seventh Air Force be augmented by one heavy and one medium bombardment group. In order to fill one those requirements, the Army Air Force decided to place the 41st under the jurisdiction of the Seventh Air Force. The 41st Bombardment Group moved from California to Hawaii during October 1943. At Oahu Hawaii, the men of the 41st were briefed on how to live in the tropics. Meanwhile, in the Central Pacific, the carrier fleets began the preliminary bombardment of the Gilbert Islands. On 20 November, the Marines charged ashore on the beaches of Tarawa, the most strategic of the enemy held islands in the Gilberts. After 72 hours of bitter fighting the island was secured and the United States forces had acquired a base from which it could launch an attach against the next island group, the Marshalls. ===Central Pacific=== The 41st moved from Hawaii and on 17 December arrived at Tarawa. Before the Group could mount its own offensive however, the rubble caused by the recent fighting had to be cleared away and the airstrips repaired. The uncomfortable climate, the temporary delay, and an outbreak of dengue fever and dysentery combined to make life miserable for the men of the 41st. Frequent Japanese nuisance raids added to the sense of helpless frustration. On 28 December, the 820th Squadron launched the Group's combat mission with an attack on the new enemy air facilities at Mili Atoll in the Marshall Islands. During the month of January 1944 the Group conducted 215 sorties against the Japanese positions in the Marshalls. Maloelap, Wotje, Mili, and Jaluit became familiar to the crews of the B-25s. Those islands contained air facilities from which the Japanese might interfere with the scheduled invasions of Kwajalein and Eniwetok set for February 1944. In low-level attacks, the medium bombers of the 41st effectively raked Japanese installations and shipping. The raids however, were made at a high cost for the unit. Enemy opposition, particularly over Maloelap, was stiff, and at times as many as 50 enemy fighters rose to challenge the Group's formations. Between 28 December and 12 February the Group lost 17 B-25s. During February, the offensive continued with the seizure of Kwajalein and Eniwetok atolls. The capture of Eniwetok gave the medium bombers a base of operations for attacks on the strategically important island of Ponape, located 400 miles west of Eniwetok in the eastern Caroline Islands. The Group concentrated on neutralizing the bypassed islands in the Marshalls, but flights were staged from Engebi Island in the Eniwetok Atoll to attack enemy shipping in the Carolines. In an attempt to lower its losses on the bombing raids, the Group switched from low level altitude to medium and high altitude approaches over the target areas. The change of tactics, plus the fact that the Japanese air forces were greatly diminishing, resulted in a significant decline the number of losses incurred by the 41st. In April, the Group initiated a series of shuttle runs. Proceeding from the base at Tarawa, the B-25s struck at Mili and Jaluit, landed and reloaded at Majuro Airfield, bombed Maloelap and Wotje, returned to Majuro, and bombed Mili and Jaluit on the way back to Tarawa. On each trip the B-25s struck 6 targets on 3 separate missions. The shuttle bombing made it possible for the 41st to push its combat total to 98 missions for the month of April. Upon completion of the Marshall invasions, United States forces had pushed to a point about midway between Pearl Harbor and Japan. By June, invasion forces were assembled the attack on the Mariana Islands, the next island group on the way to the Japanese homeland. On 15 June the Marines landed on Saipan and three weeks later the island was considered secure for American forces. Within another week, the Seventh Air Force moved the 48th Bombardment Squadron to Saipan to assist in softening up enemy defenses preparatory to the next invasions in the Marianas. For a week the 48th Squadron and other units bombarded Guam and Tinian. Then on 21 July, United States forces invaded Guam and three days later invaded Tinian. For the next three weeks, the 48th rendered close support to the ground forces by strafing and bombing enemy positions. On 19 August, the 48th Squadron returned to the Group, which was now located at Makin in the Gilbert Islands. Meanwhile, the remainder of the 41st Group continued the monotonous routine of neutralizing enemy bases in the Marshalls and raiding enemy targets in the eastern Carolines. ===Far East Air Forces=== By the Fall of 1944, the medium bombers of the 41st were no longer needed in the Central Pacific, so the Seventh Air Force withdrew the Group to Wheeler Field, Hawaii in October 1944. For seven months the Group remained in Hawaii, flying antisubmarine patrols and training missions. The crews practiced bombing, using a newer model B-25, and acquainted themselves with the capabilities of rockets, which had replaced the 75mm cannon of the older B-25s. New gunnery techniques were also employed during practice on tow targets, and gun cameras were used during maneuvers with local fighters. In 1945, the United States mounted a new offensive, this time against the islands on the periphery of the Japanese homeland. The United States launched the bitter battle at Iwo Jima in February 1945 and attacked Okinawa in April. In June 1945, while fighting still raged on Okinawa, the 41st Group moved from Hawaii to an airfield near Kadena. The B-25s hit Japanese air facilities nearby in an attempt to neutralize enemy islands and troop concentrations. During July, the Group flew 36 missions, dropping fragmentation and general-purpose bombs on enemy airfields, bridges, railroads, and shipping facilities. When the fighting subsided, the medium bombers struck at targets outside the Ryukyus. Chiran Airfield on Kyushu was hit by B-25s, and in a raid over the China mainland the Group bombed the enemy held Chang Wan Airfield near Shanghai. The 41st also raided enemy shipping in an attempt to tighten a blockade of the Japanese home islands. On 22 July, the unit and two other groups bombed an enemy convoy at the mouth of the Yangtze River in China. New tactics against Japanese shipping included an experiment with glide bombs against targets in Sasebo, Makurasaki, and Nagasaki harbors. The 41st conducted 11 more missions against targets on Kyushu during the first twelve days of August 1945. ===Inactivation=== The end of the war came in August, and the Group moved to Morotai. Two weeks later another move was made to Machinato Airfield on Okinawa, where the unit's activity consisted of routine training flights and maintenance checks. Demobilization began during September, and by October many of the unit's veterans had departed. The dismantling of the Group continued. During the month its planes were transferred to Clark Field in the Philippines. In November, only a skeleton force remained. The 47th and 48th Squadrons were reduced to a one and one status, and the 396th was converted into a service unit for Seventh Air Force units operating in the Machinato area. In December, the Group was transferred to the Philippines, where inactivation occurred on 27 January 1946. ===Control of deployed units=== The group was redesignated the 41st Tactical Group and activated At Cigli Air Base, Turkey in April 1966,Department of the Air Force Letter, AFOMO 552n, Subject: Activation of Certain Tactical Groups and Their Assigned Units, 14 March 1966 where it replaced the 7231st Combat Support Group controlling tactical fighter squadrons deploying to Cigli.

It airs a Southern gospel music format with some Christian programming, according to the station's own web site.http://bristolbroadcasting.com/huntingtonmkt.shtml ==HistoryEarly days=== This station, as WPLH, signed on for the first time on November 29, 1946, with a \\"grand opening\\" program broadcast live from the Hotel Prichard in Huntington. WPLH transmitted at 1450 kHz with a 250 watt non-directional signal. The Huntington Broadcasting Corporation, owned and operated by Flem J. Evans, advertised broadcasting, recording and transcription services as being available at the WPLH studios. The station offered a mix of live and recorded local programming, live hillbilly music from the Echo Valley Boys and other groups, plus national programming from the Mutual Network. The callsign was said to stand for \\"Work, Play, and Live in Huntington.\\" ===Move to 1470=== In 1952, control of Huntington Broadcasting Corp. passed to E.A. Marshall until he was succeeded by Charles Krause in 1956. In 1955 the station changed broadcast frequencies from 1450 kHz to 1470 kHz. Struggling financially, the station was sold to The Tierney Company in 1958. The new owners downsized the staff and moved the studio facilities to a smaller location. WPLH was sold again in 1960, this time to the Ohio River Broadcasting Corporation. The station's callsign was changed to WWHY, advertised as the \\"Fun Channel\\" and \\"Home of the Flyin' HY Guys.\\" The new image was for the new format of pop hits and rock and roll. In the late-1960s and early-1970s WWHY was a power in the Tri-State area. The next two decades would see the station's format change several times and in the 1970s the callsign changed to WKSD (for \\"Kan't Stop Dancing\\" or \\"Kool Sound of Disco\\"). ===1980s=== In March 1981, the license for this station was involuntarily transferred to Leo J. Meisel, interim trustee, after the station's owner fell into serious financial difficulties. The transfer was approved by the FCC on March 27, 1981, and the transaction was completed on April 22, 1981. This station was reassigned its former call letters WWHY by the Federal Communications Commission on July 9, 1981. In September 1985, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation filed to force Meisel to transfer the license to the FDIC. In March 1987, Meisel reached an agreement to instead donate the license for this station to the Marshall University Foundation, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on June 17, 1987, and the transaction was consummated on July 2, 1987. This transfer, arranged as part of a settlement agreement with the FDIC, caused the FDIC to drop its claim and the FCC to dismiss the transfer request. On July 10, 1987, the new owners had the station's call letters changed to WHRD to match the Marshall University sports nickname, the \\"Thundering Herd.\\" ===1990s=== In July 1991, the Marshall University Foundation, Inc., reached an agreement to sell this station to Southern Communications Corporation. The deal was approved by the FCC on August 27, 1991, and the transaction was consummated on October 23, 1991. In February 1995, Southern Communications Corporation signed a deal to sell this station to Simmons Broadcasting Company. The deal was approved by the FCC on April 11, 1995, and the transaction was consummated on May 20, 1995. In April 1997, control of station licensee Simmons Broadcasting Company was passed from David L. Simmons to W. Lee Simmons. This transfer was approved by the FCC on June 27, 1997. ===2000s=== In November 2000, Simmons Broadcasting Company (Lee Simmons, president) completed a deal to sell this station to Concord Media Group, Inc. (Mark W. Jorgenson, president/owner) for a reported $200,000. The deal was approved by the FCC on January 17, 2001, and the transaction was consummated on February 16, 2001. At the time of the sale, the station aired a sports radio format. In May 2003, Concord Media Group, Inc., agreed to sell this station to Mortenson Broadcasting through their Mortenson Broadcasting Company of West Virginia, LLC, holding company. The deal was approved by the FCC on November 12, 2003, and the transaction was consummated on January 30, 2004. The weekend of January 30, the station played TV show theme songs in a \\"Stunting effort\\" to attract listeners. On Monday February 2, the station debuted their short lived \\"Christian Talk format\\". On February 9, 2004, the new owners had the FCC change this station's callsign to WEMM to match its new FM sister station (which itself was changed from WEMM to WEMM-FM at the same time). From late February 2004 to September 2008, served as a simulcast partner to sister station WEMM-FM (107.9 FM). ===Move to 1200=== WNBL branding (2011) Based on applications filed in January 2004 and November 2005, the FCC granted this station a construction permit on October 25, 2007, to change broadcast frequencies from 1470 kHz to 1200 kHz, increase daytime signal power to 22,000 watts, change critical hours signal power to 8,000 watts, and decrease nighttime signal power to just 9 watts. The low nighttime power is required to protect the signal of clear channel AM WOAI in San Antonio, Texas, which also broadcasts at 1200 kHz. The station was assigned the WRWB call letters by the FCC on September 1, 2008. ===2010s=== The call sign was changed again to WNBL on November 1, 2010, to match the station's \\"Better Life Radio\\" branding. As WNBL, the station played music on weekdays with educational and inspirational programs on Saturday plus religious programs on Sunday. After construction and testing were completed in January 2011, the station received a new broadcast license for the new 1200 kHz frequency on February 8, 2011. The call sign was reverted to WEMM and the station was rebranded as \\"Shine 1200\\" on December 20, 2011. The new format is Gospel Music. On July 2, 2015, WEMM changed their call letters to WZPS and rebranded as \\"Spirit 1200\\". On January 3, 2017, WZPS changed their call letters to WYSN. ==References YSN Category:Southern Gospel radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1946 Category:1946 establishments in West Virginia YSN ","title":"WYSN"},{"id":"20491903","text":"The velocity of an object is the rate of change of its position with respect to a frame of reference, and is a function of time. Velocity is equivalent to a specification of an object's speed and direction of motion (e.g. to the north). Velocity is a fundamental concept in kinematics, the branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of bodies. Velocity is a physical vector quantity; both magnitude and direction are needed to define it. The scalar absolute value (magnitude) of velocity is called , being a coherent derived unit whose quantity is measured in the SI (metric system) as metres per second (m/s) or as the SI base unit of (m‚ãÖs‚àí1). For example, \\"5 metres per second\\" is a scalar, whereas \\"5 metres per second east\\" is a vector. If there is a change in speed, direction or both, then the object has a changing velocity and is said to be undergoing an acceleration. ==Constant velocity vs acceleration== To have a constant velocity, an object must have a constant speed in a constant direction. Constant direction constrains the object to motion in a straight path thus, a constant velocity means motion in a straight line at a constant speed. For example, a car moving at a constant 20 kilometres per hour in a circular path has a constant speed, but does not have a constant velocity because its direction changes. Hence, the car is considered to be undergoing an acceleration. ==Difference between speed and velocity== Kinematic quantities of a classical particle: mass m, position r, velocity v, acceleration a. Speed, the scalar magnitude of a velocity vector, denotes only how fast an object is moving. Earliest occurrence of the speed/velocity terminology. ==Equation of motionAverage velocity=== Velocity is defined as the rate of change of position with respect to time, which may also be referred to as the instantaneous velocity to emphasize the distinction from the average velocity. In some applications the \\"average velocity\\" of an object might be needed, that is to say, the constant velocity that would provide the same resultant displacement as a variable velocity in the same time interval, , over some time period . Average velocity can be calculated as: :\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\bar{v}} = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta\\\\boldsymbol{x}}{\\\\Delta\\\\mathit{t}} . The average velocity is always less than or equal to the average speed of an object. This can be seen by realizing that while distance is always strictly increasing, displacement can increase or decrease in magnitude as well as change direction. In terms of a displacement-time (x vs. t) graph, the instantaneous velocity (or, simply, velocity) can be thought of as the slope of the tangent line to the curve at any point, and the average velocity as the slope of the secant line between two points with t coordinates equal to the boundaries of the time period for the average velocity. The average velocity is the same as the velocity averaged over time ‚Äì that is to say, its time-weighted average, which may be calculated as the time integral of the velocity: :\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\bar{v}} = {1 \\\\over t_1 - t_0 } \\\\int_{t_0}^{t_1} \\\\boldsymbol{v}(t) \\\\ dt , where we may identify : \\\\Delta \\\\boldsymbol{x} = \\\\int_{t_0}^{t_1} \\\\boldsymbol{v}(t) \\\\ dt and : \\\\Delta t = t_1 - t_0 . ===Instantaneous velocity=== Example of a velocity vs. time graph, and the relationship between velocity v on the y-axis, acceleration a (the three green tangent lines represent the values for acceleration at different points along the curve) and displacement s (the yellow area under the curve.) If we consider as velocity and as the displacement (change in position) vector, then we can express the (instantaneous) velocity of a particle or object, at any particular time , as the derivative of the position with respect to time: :\\\\boldsymbol{v} = \\\\lim_{{\\\\Delta t}\\\\to 0} \\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\boldsymbol{x}}{\\\\Delta t} = \\\\frac{d\\\\boldsymbol{x}}{d\\\\mathit{t}} . From this derivative equation, in the one-dimensional case it can be seen that the area under a velocity vs. time ( vs. graph) is the displacement, . In calculus terms, the integral of the velocity function is the displacement function . In the figure, this corresponds to the yellow area under the curve labeled ( being an alternative notation for displacement). :\\\\boldsymbol{x} = \\\\int \\\\boldsymbol{v} \\\\ d\\\\mathit{t} . Since the derivative of the position with respect to time gives the change in position (in metres) divided by the change in time (in seconds), velocity is measured in metres per second (m/s). Although the concept of an instantaneous velocity might at first seem counter-intuitive, it may be thought of as the velocity that the object would continue to travel at if it stopped accelerating at that moment. ===Relationship to acceleration=== Although velocity is defined as the rate of change of position, it is often common to start with an expression for an object's acceleration. As seen by the three green tangent lines in the figure, an object's instantaneous acceleration at a point in time is the slope of the line tangent to the curve of a graph at that point. In other words, acceleration is defined as the derivative of velocity with respect to time: : \\\\boldsymbol{a} = \\\\frac{d\\\\boldsymbol{v}}{d\\\\mathit{t}} . From there, we can obtain an expression for velocity as the area under an acceleration vs. time graph. As above, this is done using the concept of the integral: :\\\\boldsymbol{v} = \\\\int \\\\boldsymbol{a} \\\\ d\\\\mathit{t} . Constant acceleration In the special case of constant acceleration, velocity can be studied using the suvat equations. By considering a as being equal to some arbitrary constant vector, it is trivial to show that :\\\\boldsymbol{v} = \\\\boldsymbol{u} + \\\\boldsymbol{a}t with as the velocity at time and as the velocity at time . By combining this equation with the suvat equation , it is possible to relate the displacement and the average velocity by :\\\\boldsymbol{x} = \\\\frac{(\\\\boldsymbol{u} + \\\\boldsymbol{v})}{2}\\\\mathit{t} = \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\bar{v}}\\\\mathit{t}. It is also possible to derive an expression for the velocity independent of time, known as the Torricelli equation, as follows: :v^{2} = \\\\boldsymbol{v}\\\\cdot\\\\boldsymbol{v} = (\\\\boldsymbol{u}+\\\\boldsymbol{a}t)\\\\cdot(\\\\boldsymbol{u}+\\\\boldsymbol{a}t)=u^{2}+2t(\\\\boldsymbol{a}\\\\cdot\\\\boldsymbol{u})+a^{2}t^{2} :(2\\\\boldsymbol{a})\\\\cdot\\\\boldsymbol{x} = (2\\\\boldsymbol{a})\\\\cdot(\\\\boldsymbol{u}t+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\boldsymbol{a}t^{2})=2t(\\\\boldsymbol{a}\\\\cdot\\\\boldsymbol{u})+a^{2}t^{2} = v^{2} - u^{2} :\\\\therefore v^{2} = u^{2} + 2(\\\\boldsymbol{a}\\\\cdot\\\\boldsymbol{x}) where etc. The above equations are valid for both Newtonian mechanics and special relativity. Where Newtonian mechanics and special relativity differ is in how different observers would describe the same situation. In particular, in Newtonian mechanics, all observers agree on the value of t and the transformation rules for position create a situation in which all non-accelerating observers would describe the acceleration of an object with the same values. Neither is true for special relativity. In other words, only relative velocity can be calculated. ===Quantities that are dependent on velocity=== The kinetic energy of a moving object is dependent on its velocity and is given by the equation :E_{\\\\text{k}} = \\\\tfrac{1}{2}mv^{2} ignoring special relativity, where Ek is the kinetic energy and m is the mass. Kinetic energy is a scalar quantity as it depends on the square of the velocity, however a related quantity, momentum, is a vector and defined by :\\\\boldsymbol{p}=m\\\\boldsymbol{v} In special relativity, the dimensionless Lorentz factor appears frequently, and is given by :\\\\gamma = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}} where Œ≥ is the Lorentz factor and c is the speed of light. Escape velocity is the minimum speed a ballistic object needs to escape from a massive body such as Earth. It represents the kinetic energy that, when added to the object's gravitational potential energy, (which is always negative) is equal to zero. The general formula for the escape velocity of an object at a distance r from the center of a planet with mass M is :v_{\\\\text{e}} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2GM}{r}} = \\\\sqrt{2gr}, where G is the Gravitational constant and g is the Gravitational acceleration. The escape velocity from Earth's surface is about 11 200 m/s, and is irrespective of the direction of the object. This makes \\"escape velocity\\" somewhat of a misnomer, as the more correct term would be \\"escape speed\\": any object attaining a velocity of that magnitude, irrespective of atmosphere, will leave the vicinity of the base body as long as it doesn't intersect with something in its path. ==Relative velocity== Relative velocity is a measurement of velocity between two objects as determined in a single coordinate system. Relative velocity is fundamental in both classical and modern physics, since many systems in physics deal with the relative motion of two or more particles. In Newtonian mechanics, the relative velocity is independent of the chosen inertial reference frame. This is not the case anymore with special relativity in which velocities depend on the choice of reference frame. If an object A is moving with velocity vector v and an object B with velocity vector w, then the velocity of object A relative to object B is defined as the difference of the two velocity vectors: :\\\\boldsymbol{v}_{A\\\\text{ relative to }B} = \\\\boldsymbol{v} - \\\\boldsymbol{w} Similarly, the relative velocity of object B moving with velocity w, relative to object A moving with velocity v is: :\\\\boldsymbol{v}_{B\\\\text{ relative to }A} = \\\\boldsymbol{w} - \\\\boldsymbol{v} Usually, the inertial frame chosen is that in which the latter of the two mentioned objects is in rest. ===Scalar velocities=== In the one-dimensional case,Basic principle the velocities are scalars and the equation is either: :\\\\, v_{rel} = v - (-w), if the two objects are moving in opposite directions, or: :\\\\, v_{rel} = v -(+w), if the two objects are moving in the same direction. ==Polar coordinates== In polar coordinates, a two-dimensional velocity is described by a radial velocity, defined as the component of velocity away from or toward the origin (also known as velocity made good), and an angular velocity, which is the rate of rotation about the origin (with positive quantities representing counter-clockwise rotation and negative quantities representing clockwise rotation, in a right-handed coordinate system). The radial and angular velocities can be derived from the Cartesian velocity and displacement vectors by decomposing the velocity vector into radial and transverse components. The transverse velocity is the component of velocity along a circle centered at the origin. :\\\\boldsymbol{v}=\\\\boldsymbol{v}_T+\\\\boldsymbol{v}_R where :\\\\boldsymbol{v}_T is the transverse velocity :\\\\boldsymbol{v}_R is the radial velocity. The magnitude of the radial velocity is the dot product of the velocity vector and the unit vector in the direction of the displacement. :v_R=\\\\frac{\\\\boldsymbol{v} \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{r}}{\\\\left\\\\boldsymbol{r}\\\\right} where :\\\\boldsymbol{r} is displacement. The magnitude of the transverse velocity is that of the cross product of the unit vector in the direction of the displacement and the velocity vector. It is also the product of the angular speed \\\\omega and the magnitude of the displacement. :v_T=\\\\frac{\\\\boldsymbol{r}\\\\times\\\\boldsymbol{v}}{\\\\boldsymbol{r}}=\\\\omega\\\\boldsymbol{r} such that :\\\\omega=\\\\frac{\\\\boldsymbol{r}\\\\times\\\\boldsymbol{v}}{\\\\boldsymbol{r}^2}. Angular momentum in scalar form is the mass times the distance to the origin times the transverse velocity, or equivalently, the mass times the distance squared times the angular speed. The sign convention for angular momentum is the same as that for angular velocity. :L=mrv_T=mr^2\\\\omega\\\\, where :m\\\\, is mass :r=\\\\\\\\boldsymbol{r}\\\\. The expression mr^2 is known as moment of inertia. If forces are in the radial direction only with an inverse square dependence, as in the case of a gravitational orbit, angular momentum is constant, and transverse speed is inversely proportional to the distance, angular speed is inversely proportional to the distance squared, and the rate at which area is swept out is constant. These relations are known as Kepler's laws of planetary motion. ==See alsoNotesReferences== * Robert Resnick and Jearl Walker, Fundamentals of Physics, Wiley; 7 Sub edition (June 16, 2004). . ==External links== *physicsabout.com, Speed and Velocity *Velocity and Acceleration *Introduction to Mechanisms (Carnegie Mellon University) Category:Motion (physics) Category:Kinematics Category:Temporal rates Category:SI derived units ","title":"Velocity"},{"id":"20491907","text":"Nicole Ameline (born 4 July 1952 in Saint-Vaast-en-Auge) is a French politician, lawyer, diplomat and women's rights advocate.

A powerful man from Calvados, he convinced her to invest in her native department. After administrative posts at Hornfleur then on the Conseil G√©n√©ral du Calvados, she entered politics as deputy to Michel d'Ornano on the National Assembly of France in 1988, and took over from him on his death in 1991. In 1993, with Yves Boisseau as deputy, she was elected with a large majority in the second round on the UDF ticket. She was opposed by a National Front candidate, and on the left by Corinne Lepage, who failed to qualify for the second round. In May 1995 with the victory of Jacques Chirac, she left her post in order to enter the Government of Alain Jupp√©. The same year, she headed the Hornfleur Majorit√© Pr√©sidentielle list for the municipality, but lost by 37 votes to an independent ecologist. She left the government in November with the other \\"Juppettes\\" and she easily regained her seat in December. Re-elected following the dissolution of 1997, she was the only member on the Calvados right. The following year, she joined the Regional Council of Lower Normandy, as Vice President, deputy to Ren√© Garrec, president of the region since 1986.

As ships became larger, their larger and heavier masts were no longer able to be handled in this way. A crane was needed, tall enough to lift the entire mast vertically and then lower it into the ship. By the 18th century, such sheers were a necessity in any large shipyard. As sheers are not required to move, they were often constructed as masonry towers, with wooden jib structures atop them. Few have survived intact, but some of the towers remain, having now lost their jibs. In the late 19th century, the increasing size and capacity of general harbour cranes began to overlap with the lofty but lightweight masting sheer and so their specialisation was no longer required. == See also == *Sheer hulk, a floating variant == References == Category:Shipyard cranes ","title":"Masting sheer"},{"id":"20491940","text":"Mitchel L Vogel (born January 17, 1956) is an American former child actor. Having begun his professional acting career at age ten, Vogel is widely known for his role as the red-headed orphan, Jamie Hunter-Cartwright on the NBC western series Bonanza, as well as for his feature film roles: as Tommy North in Yours, Mine and Ours and as Lucius McCaslin in The Reivers. Clockwise from top left: Christopher George, Ross Martin, and Mitch Vogel on TV's The Immortal ==BiographyEarly life and career=== Born in Alhambra, California, Vogel began his acting career at the age of ten, appearing in stage productions of Tom Sawyer, Heidi, Peter Pan and The Wizard of Oz. As his acting career progressed, he attended Heinz Kaiser Junior High School in Costa Mesa, California, from 1969 to 1970 and later attended Jordan Jr. High school in Burbank, California. ===Acting career=== Vogel made his feature film debut at the age of 12, appearing in the 1968 comedy Yours, Mine and Ours, as one of Lucille Ball's and Henry Fonda's brood. He rose to prominence the following year as Lucius McCaslin in the feature film The Reivers, which earned him a Golden Globe nomination as the Best Supporting Actor of 1969. Having established himself in feature films, Vogel briefly appeared on an episode of Bonanza broadcast on October 6, 1968, entitled \\"The Real People of Muddy Creek\\". Two years later he joined the Bonanza cast, co-starring as Jamie Hunter, an adolescent orphan taken in and eventually adopted by the Cartwrights during the last three seasons of the series. In addition to his role on Bonanza, Vogel also guest-starred on several other western television series of the time, including The Virginian, Here Come the Brides, Gunsmoke, and Dundee and the Culhane, as well as appearing in a recurring role as \\"Johnny Johnson\\" on the western frontier series Little House on the Prairie from 1974 to 1975, after which he had a starring role in the 10th episode of the Saturday morning live-action show, The Secrets of Isis.

It gives an upper bound on the resources required by the algorithm. In the case of running time, the worst-case time-complexity indicates the longest running time performed by an algorithm given any input of size n, and thus guarantees that the algorithm will finish in the indicated period of time. The order of growth (e.g. linear, logarithmic) of the worst-case complexity is commonly used to compare the efficiency of two algorithms. The worst-case complexity of an algorithm should be contrasted with its average-case complexity, which is an average measure of the amount of resources the algorithm uses on a random input. == Definition == Given a model of computation and an algorithm A that halts on each input x, the mapping tA:{0, 1}*‚ÜíN is called the time complexity of A if, for every x, A halts after exactly tA(x) steps. Since we usually are interested in the dependence of the time complexity on different input length, abusing terminology, the time complexity is sometimes referred to the mapping TA:N‚ÜíN, defined by TA(n):= maxx‚àà{0, 1}n{tA(x)}. Similar definitions can be given for space complexity, randomness complexity, etc. == Examples == Consider performing insertion sort on n numbers on a random access machine. The best-case for the algorithm is when the numbers are already sorted, which takes O(n) steps to perform the task. However, the input in the worst-case for the algorithm is when the numbers are reverse sorted and it takes O(n2) steps to sort them; therefore the worst-case time-complexity of insertion sort is of O(n2). == See also == * Analysis of algorithms * Big-O Notation == References == * Thomas H.

The security team commonly includes a Team Leader and two other guards. The team members have prior experience in a variety of organisations, including Royal Navy, British Army and British police. The company's interim deck watch team provides non-lethal ship security through known high risk piracy areas, using necessary equipment, including long range acoustic device (LRAD). APMSS provides early warning of a potential pirate attack. As of November 2008, APMSS has ten teams aboard ships in the MSPA region. Teams cost ¬£14,000 for three days. ==Notable incidents== On 14 November 2008, an APMSS team on an unidentified chemical tanker dealt with its first attack. The pirates were successfully deterred from boarding the ship. Two weeks later, on 28 November 2008, the chemical tanker was attacked by Somali pirates. According to APMSS, the security team fired water cannon at the pirates, zigzagged the vessel and used the LRAD, long enough for a distress signal to be made by the Biscaglia's captain; however, after fending off three or four attacks, the pirates overcame the measures, boarded the ship and continued to shoot at the security guards, leaving the security team no choice but to abandon the vessel. The team hid on the roof until a rescue helicopter came near, then jumped into the water for rescue by coalition forces.

He has been a member of the National Assembly of France. He was representing the 5th constituency of the Hauts-de-Seine department, and is a member of The Republicans. He is known as the mayor of Levallois-Perret, a wealthy suburb of Paris, since 1983, with his wife Isabelle his deputy. He is also a long time friend of ex-president, Nicolas Sarkozy. He is of Hungarian, Latvian and Ukrainian Jewish origin.. == Youth  Family === Patrick Balkany is the son of Gyula Balk√°ny, and Gis√®le Frucht.Balk√°ny is also the name of a place in Hungary.Who's Who in France, 2008 edition, p.183. His father was a Hungarian‚ÄìJewish immigrant who fled Hungary in 1937 to Belgium where, as soon as his country came under German occupation, he entered the resistance by specialising in forging papers. Gyula Balk√°ny was arrested in Paris in 1941, and sent to intern√© √† Drancy An Auschwitz survivor, Balkany senior returned to Neuilly after the war; he bought and sold equipment that was too heavy for Americans to ship home, and invested his earnings in a line of women's clothing and a chain of luxury ready-to-wear stores.. His mother is the daughter of a family of Latvian and Ukrainian Jewish tailors. === Education and early career === After studying at a Swiss international school, Balkany took over the family ready-to-wear business, R√©ty, founded by his father until 1975... He was the treasurer of an association of amateur filmmakers, the independent Cinema Team, founded by Jean-Fran√ßois Davy.Adrien Gombeaud, \\"Merci qui ? Merci Davy \\", Vanity Fair , may 2017, pages 116‚Äì123. He tried out as an actor between 1965 and 1967, holding several secondary roles in cinema and television. He appeared in Soleil noir (Black Sun) by Denys de La Patelli√®re and J'ai tu√© Raspoutine (I killed Rasputin) by Robert Hossein. Between 2001 and 2010, he occasionally played himself in television series, notably making an appearance in Commissaire Moulin.. In 1970, he was 22 years old and performed his military service at the √âlys√©e Palace, in Georges Pompidou's office, where he got in touch with the secretary general Michel Jobert, who would later be witness at his wedding.. === Personal life === In 1976, Balkany married Isabelle Smadja. Together they have two children, Alexandre (b. 1976) and Vanessa (b. 1980).... Balkany was accused of sexual harassment on several occasions: in 1996 by his ex-companion (who filed an official complaint), then in 2011 Marie-Claire Restoux, former judo champion and former substitute of Balkany at the National Assembly, also testified against him... ==Political career== Being close to Michel Jobert, Balkany was a founder member of RPR in December 1976, and was also member of its central committee. During the 1978 French legislative election, he was sent by Jacques Chirac to fight a seat in the first constituency of Yonne, where he obtained 10% of the vote, thus forcing the secretary general of the UDF, Jean-Pierre Soisson, to a second round ballot. === Levallois-Perret === After failing to take Auxerre, Balkany opened a surgery in Levallois-Perret. In 1981, after the dissolution of the National Assembly by Fran√ßois Mitterrand, he ran in the legislative elections where he was defeated by getting 46% of the votes against the Communist deputy mayor of Clichy, . A year later, during the cantonal elections in 1982, he won the seat of general councillor of the canton of South Levallois-Perret and became vice-president of the general council of the Hauts-de-Seine. In 1983, his list won the majority in the first round of municipal elections in Levallois-Perret with 51.1% of the vote. During his first two terms, he contributed to the radical re-shaping of Levallois-Perret, transforming the deliquescent industrial zones or wastelands (occupying nearly a quarter of the city's area) into residential and office districts. During the presidential campaign of 1995, he supported the candidacy of √âdouard Balladur, who was defeated by Jacques Chirac. In the following municipal elections, he lost to the Chiric-supporting Olivier de Chazeaux. In May 1996, Balkany was convicted (decision upheld on appeal on 30 January 1997) by the 9th chamber of the Nanterre Criminal Court, to 15 months suspended sentence, 200,000 francs fine and two years of ineligibility, for \\"misappropriation of public funds for personal gain\\".. Between 1985 and 1995, he had put three people on the city's payroll as municipal employees, while these individuals dealt only with his Levallois-Perret apartment and his second home near Giverny.. His wife Isabelle, vice-president of the general council of Hauts-de-Seine and city councilor in Levallois-Perret, was sentenced to the same penalty for misappropriation. On 28 July 1999, the Regional Auditor of Ile-de-France sentenced Patrick Balkany to reimburse the municipality of Levallois-Perret the amount of salaries of municipal employees subject to his conviction, in the amount of ‚Ç¨523,897.96. . On the failure of his appeal to the State Council on 27 July 2005, Balkany spreads the reimbursement to the city from 2000 to 2006. He also owed Levallois-Perret ‚Ç¨230,865.57, being the interest on the debt that the judges made run as of 31 May 1995, date of the dismissal by the mayor of the municipal agents. In February 2007, Balkany appealed to Thierry Breton, then Minister of the Economy, Finance and Industry, for the cancellation of this debt. On 12 February 2007, the Levallois-Perret municipal council (now with a majority of UMP) gave its consent to his request.. After Fran√ßois Baroin rejected this request in June 2011, Balkany settled ‚Ç¨63,684.43 and obtained from the Treasury a repayment schedule for the outstanding balance of ‚Ç¨123,000.. In 2003, he was sentenced in the criminal court of Nanterre to a fine of ‚Ç¨1,500 for intentionally and publicly libelling during a municipal council meeting Annie Mandois, a communist elected to the council, of having used public funds in the interest of a political party or for her personal interest. His accusations of her indoctrinating children while she was a teacher were overruled at trial.. This judgment was confirmed by the Court of Appeal of Versailles on 31 March 2004..

But Balkany and his wife always react by claiming that they are targeted. \\"Je me demande s'il n'y a pas une volont√© de nuire...\\", interview by Jean-Pierre Thiollet, France Soir, 2 July 2009 Balkany made international news on 17 July 2012, just days before the vote on a new national sexual harassment bill, when male lawmakers in the National Assembly including Balkany hooted and made catcalls as Housing Minister C√©cile Duflot, who was wearing a floral dress and speaking about an architecture project. \\"We were just admiring her,\\" Patrick Balkany, a conservative legislator, told Le Figaro. In September 2019, Balkany and his wife Isabelle were convicted of tax fraud. The Paris tribunal sentenced him to a 4 years jail sentence and ordered his immediate arrest. His wife, Isabelle, was condemned to a three-year sentence. In October 2019, he was condemned to five years' imprisonment in second instance and corruption charges were dropped. ==NotesReferences *Official blog Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:The Republicans (France) politicians Category:French Jews Category:Jewish French politicians Category:French people of Hungarian-Jewish descent Category:People of Latvian-Jewish descent Category:French people of Ukrainian-Jewish descent Category:People named in the Panama Papers Category:Deputies of the 12th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic Category:Deputies of the 13th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic Category:Deputies of the 14th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic Category:People from Neuilly-sur-Seine ","title":"Patrick Balkany"},{"id":"20492074","text":"St. Paul's Church is a historic Episcopal church in Lynchburg, Virginia, United States. ==History== Lynchburg's oldest Episcopal parish was established in 1822. A replacement building was constructed in 1852, which Vermont schoolteacher turned local businessman and vestryman Elijah Fletcher helped fund. By then, Fletcher had moved his principal residence back to Amherst, Virginia, and helped found Ascension Episcopal Church there, although he conducted business and owned property in both the village and city. After his death and the American Civil War, one of his daughters, Indiana Fletcher Williams, would marry Episcopal priest J. Henry Williams of New York, and after the death of their only child, Daisy, and (though her last will and testament) found Sweet Briar College (incorporated in 1901 and on whose board successive rectors of this parish sat). The current building was planned in 1888, cornerstone laid on May 26, 1891, first service held in the still- unfinished building the week before Christmas 1895. It is on a different lot from the 1852 building, which by then was considered too small. The architect, Day of Philadelphia, would later become known for his collegiate Gothic designs on the campuses of Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania, Yale University and Wellesley College. The belfry was added in 1912, pursuant to plans submitted by a local architectural firm, Lewis & Burnham, although not in the original Day plans. The same firm built a parish house at the same time. Although local tradition attributes the stained glass windows to Louis Tiffany, and they are of that school, no documentation supporting that attribution has yet been found. In the 1960s, the parish bought the adjacent Carter Glass house for use as a parish house, the previous parish house being too small. During remodeling in 1970s, the organ and choir were moved to the rear balcony and most chancel furniture removed. ==Architecture== The building is of Richardsonian Romanesque design and constructed of gray granite (quarried in southwest Virginia), and trimmed with brownstone. A belfry was added in . Connected to the main sanctuary is the parish house, built in 1912. and Accompanying photo It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

His career was seriously hampered by injury, and despite being picked to tour with England in 1989‚Äì90 he was forced into retirement shortly afterward. He was educated at Combermere School Barbados, Malvern College England, British Aerospace Flying College Scotland and The University of Westminster London.[MSc Air Transport Planning and Management] After a couple of seasons of Second XI cricket, and immediately after taking 11 wickets in one such game against Warwickshire II, Ellcock made his full Worcestershire debut in a County Championship match against future employers Middlesex at Worcester at the end of 1982, still only 17 years old. He took three lower-order wickets and scored 0 in his only innings. His next match was against Scotland in the Benson & Hedges Cup at Mannofield Park, the first List A game to be played at the Aberdeen venue. Ellcock took one wicket and did not bat. He played quite often in 1983, and ended the season with 25 first-class wickets at 37.24 and nine List A wickets at 17.88; the latter figure included 4/43 in a John Player Special League fixture against Kent, a career best that he would equal six years later for Middlesex. In the English winter of 1983‚Äì84 he played for his native Barbados, as he would do again (albeit very briefly) in 1984‚Äì85. In 1984 Ellcock picked up 29 first-class wickets, his highest in any one season, but his struggles with fitness meant that he would never again approach that figure for Worcestershire, and after three more seasons of little success he moved to Middlesex for the 1989 season. Although he did not play until June, he managed his most productive summer: 32 first-class wickets at under 20 runs apiece, and 16 wickets at 23 in the one-day game. He matched his List A best with 4/43 versus Nottinghamshire in July, and a week later recorded his only five-wicket haul when he claimed 5/35 against Yorkshire in the Championship. The England selectors were sufficiently impressed by Ellcock's form to call him up for the winter tour against West Indies. However, his tour had barely begun before it was over: he pulled up after just a few balls in the nets, and when he was diagnosed with a stress fracture of his back he was forced to go home without having played a single match on tour. Ellcock missed the entire 1990 season, but returned to play a few matches for Middlesex in 1991. Despite evidence of a possibility of improving, such as the six wickets he took against Somerset, he was unable to make a success of his comeback and retired in mid-season. He became a pilot and was the first black captain with Virgin Atlantic. His brother Dale Ellcock had a short career with Barbados. ==NotesReferences== * * Category:English cricketers Category:Middlesex cricketers Category:Worcestershire cricketers Category:Barbados cricketers Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:People educated at Malvern College Category:Barbadian cricketers Category:People from Saint Thomas, Barbados Category:Barbadian expatriates in the United Kingdom ","title":"Ricardo Ellcock"},{"id":"20492108","text":"Joly Garbi (, 1913 ‚Äì 9 December 2002) was a Greek actress.

Johar obtained at PhD in political science from Florida State University and worked as a professor at Kuwait University before being elected to the National Assembly in 1996. While political parties are technically illegal in Kuwait, Johar affiliates with the Shia deputies.Arab Times MP Profile ==Supports Citizenship for Bidun== On December 4, 2008, Johar, Musallam Al-Barrak, Marzouq AlŸÄHubaini, Ali AlŸÄDeqbasi, and Abdullah AlŸÄBarghash submitted a draft law calling for the granting of Kuwaiti citizenship to all bidun (stateless) residents in the country. The bill proposes that citizenship be granted to all bidun who were included in the 1965 census and who have no criminal record. The new draft law differs from previous bills as it does not impose any restrictions on the naturalization of bidun and does not set a ceiling for the number of bidun that can be granted citizenship. They also suggested that the families of individuals who have died in service to the country be naturalized. In addition, the lawmakers affirmed their belief that the families of POWs and the children of those who were martyred during the invasion be granted citizenship. The latest statistics reveal that more than 80,000 bidun currently reside in Kuwait. ==Opposes Changes to Textbooks== Amid rumors that the Kuwaiti government was going to change its textbooks to remove possible references to religion and extremism, Johar said, ‚ÄúI hope the government will not bow to external blackmail and threats... and be forced to delete important sections of Islamic education.\\" According to Jawhar, the decision to rewrite textbooks came despite findings by specialist committees that current editions contain no references calling for violence and fanaticism or encouraging struggle against other religions. The committees found that those books contained sizable portions focusing on tolerance, brotherhood, equality, passion, cooperation and respect for the rights of non-Muslims. ==Support for Women's Suffrage== Johar supported Kuwaiti women's right to vote, saying \\"By relating to Islam I can see -- and I also consulted a lot of experts in this regard -- that there is no contradiction between the women's vote and our Islamic values.\\" ==Grilling of Education Minister Nouriya Al-Sabeeh== Johar has an ongoing feud with Education Minister Nouriya Al-Sabeeh. In May 2008, Johar joined with Hussein Quwaian Al-Mutairi to accuse Al-Sabeeh of not cooperating with the Kuwaiti University teachers' union and to urge Prime Minister Nasser Mohammed Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah not to retain her in the upcoming cabinet formation.Kuwait Times on May 2008 Jawhar/Al-Sabeeh feud In October 2008, Johar submitted a parliamentary request to publicly question Al-Sabeeh about her plans to introduce electronic learning into the school curriculums.Kuwait Times on October 2008 Jawhar/Al-Sabeeh feud ==Mandatory Retirement Age for Teachers== On November 28, 2008, Johar joined MPs Abdullah Al-Roumi, Khaled AlŸÄSultan Bin Essa, Musallam Al-Barrak, and Marzouq AlŸÄHubaini Al-Azmi in formulating a bill to extend the mandatory retirement age for Kuwaiti teaching staff at Kuwait University from 65 to 70 years. They argued that Item 32 of Law no. 15/1979 has denied the country services of able and intelligent academicians by restricting retirement age of Kuwaitis to 65 years. They recommended that a clause be added to the law such that the retirement age can become 70 years and can further be extended to 75 years. ==References== Category:Members of the National Assembly of Kuwait Category:Living people Category:Kuwaiti Shia Muslims Category:Kuwait University faculty Category:Kuwait University alumni Category:Kuwaiti people of Iranian descent Category:1960 births Category:Florida State University alumni ","title":"Hassan Jawhar"},{"id":"20492348","text":"Pierre Cohen (born 20 March 1950 in Bizerte, Tunisia) is a member of the National Assembly of France.

The self is sometimes understood as a unified being essentially connected to consciousness, awareness, and agency. == Definitions of the self == Most philosophical definitions of self‚Äîper Descartes, Locke, Hume, and William James‚Äîare expressed in the first person.Gaynesford, M. de I: The Meaning of the First Person Term, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2006. A third person definition does not refer to specific mental qualia but instead strives for objectivity and operationalism. To another person, the self of one individual is exhibited in the conduct and discourse of that individual. Therefore, the intentions of another individual can only be inferred from something that emanates from that individual. The particular characteristics of the self determine its identity. == Concepts of self  Self in Eastern traditions === In spirituality, and especially nondual, mystical and eastern meditative traditions, the human being is often conceived as being in the illusion of individual existence, and separateness from other aspects of creation. This \\"sense of doership\\" or sense of individual existence is that part which believes it is the human being, and believes it must fight for itself in the world, is ultimately unaware and unconscious of its own true nature. The ego is often associated with mind and the sense of time, which compulsively thinks in order to be assured of its future existence, rather than simply knowing its own self and the present. The spiritual goal of many traditions involves the dissolving of the ego, in contrast to the essential Self,Cottingham, Jenny. From the self to the Self: an exploration of the process of Self-realisation in the context of Indian psychology. Auckland, New Zealand: Auckland University of Technology. 2015. allowing self-knowledge of one's own true nature to become experienced and enacted in the world. This is variously known as enlightenment, nirvana, presence, and the \\"here and now\\". === Self- knowledge === Both western and oriental civilizations have been occupied with self-knowledge and underscored its importance particularly citing the paradoxical combination of immediate availability and profound obscurity involved in its pursuit. For Socrates, the goal of philosophy was to \\"Know thyself\\". Lao Tzu, in his Tao Te Ching, says \\"Knowing others is wisdom. Knowing the self is enlightenment. Mastering others requires force. Mastering the self requires strength.\\" The case is the same for the seers of Upanishads, who maintained that the ultimate real knowledge involves an understanding of the essence of the self and the nature of God. Adi Shankaracharya, in his commentary on Bhagavad Gita says \\"Self-knowledge alone eradicates misery\\". \\"Self-knowledge alone is the means to the highest bliss.\\" Absolute perfection is the consummation of Self-knowledge.\\" A theory about self-knowledge describes the concept as the capacity to detect that the sensations, thoughts, mental states, and attitudes as one's own. It is linked to other concepts such as self-awareness and self-conception. The rationalist theory, which Immanuel Kant has inspired, also claims that our ability to achieve self-knowledge through rational reflection is partly derived from the fact that we view ourselves as rational agents. This school rejects that self-knowledge is merely derived from observation as it acknowledges the subject as authoritative on account of his ability as an agent to shape his own states. === Self as an activity === Aristotle, following Plato, defined the soul as the core essence of a living being, and while claiming that it did not exist apart from the body,De Anima 414a20ff he considered its so-called \\"intellect\\" part to be immortal and perpetual,\\"For whereas the sensitive faculty is not found apart from the body, the intellect is separate.\\" Aristotle, De Anima III, 4, 429b3De Anima III, 4 in contrast to its organism-dependent vegetative/nutritive and perceptual functions. In his theory of causes and of act and potency, Aristotle emphasizes beings in relation to their actual manifestation, and in turn the soul was also defined by its actual effects. For instance, if a knife had a soul, the act of cutting would be that soul, because 'cutting' is part of the essence of what it is to be a knife. More precisely, the soul is the \\"first activity\\" of a living body. This is a state, or a potential for actual, or 'second', activity. \\"The axe has an edge for cutting\\" was, for Aristotle, analogous to \\"humans have bodies for rational activity,\\" and the potential for rational activity thus constituted the essence of a human soul. He states: \\"Soul is an actuality or formulable essence of something that possesses a potentiality of being besouled\\",De Anima 414a27 and also \\"When mind is set free from its present conditions it appears as just what it is and nothing more: this alone is immortal and eternal\\".De Anima, III, 5, 430a22 Aristotle used his concept of the soul in many of his works; his main work on the subject is De Anima (On the Soul). Aristotle also believed that there were four sections of the soul: the calculative and scientific parts on the rational side used for making decisions, and the desiderative and vegetative parts on the irrational side responsible for identifying our needs. A division of the soul's functions and activities is also found in Plato's tripartite theory. The problem of one in many is also remembered by Aristotle, nonetheless: > If then the soul is of its very nature divisible, what holds it together? > Not the body, certainly: much rather the contrary seems to be true, that the > soul holds the body together; for when it departs, the body expires and > decomposes. If there is some other thing which makes it one, this other is > rather the soul. One would then have to ask, concerning this other, whether > it be one or of many parts. If it is one, why not call it the soul > straightway? But if it is divisible, reason again demands, what it is that > holds this together? And so on ad infinitum.De Anima I, 5 === Self independent of the senses === While he was imprisoned in a castle, Avicenna wrote his famous \\"Floating Man\\" thought experiment to demonstrate human self-awareness and the substantiality of the soul. His \\"Floating Man\\" thought experiment tells its readers to imagine themselves suspended in the air, isolated from all sensations, which includes no sensory contact with even their own bodies. He argues that, in this scenario, one would still have self- consciousness. He thus concludes that the idea of the self is not logically dependent on any physical thing, and that the soul should not be seen in relative terms, but as a primary given, a substance. This argument was later refined and simplified by Ren√© Descartes in epistemic terms when he stated: \\"I can abstract from the supposition of all external things, but not from the supposition of my own consciousness.\\"Seyyed Hossein Nasr and Oliver Leaman (1996), History of Islamic Philosophy, p. 315, Routledge, . === Bundle theory of self === David Hume pointed out that we tend to think that we are the same person we were five years ago. Though we have changed in many respects, the same person appears present as was present then. We might start thinking about which features can be changed without changing the underlying self. Hume, however, denies that there is a distinction between the various features of a person and the mysterious self that supposedly bears those features. When we start introspecting, \\"we are never intimately conscious of anything but a particular perception; man is a bundle or collection of different perceptions which succeed one another with an inconceivable rapidity and are in perpetual flux and movement\\". I, IV, vi > It is plain, that in the course of our thinking, and in the constant > revolution of our ideas, our imagination runs easily from one idea to any > other that resembles it, and that this quality alone is to the fancy a > sufficient bond and association. It is likewise evident that as the senses, > in changing their objects, are necessitated to change them regularly, and > take them as they lie contiguous to each other, the imagination must by long > custom acquire the same method of thinking, and run along the parts of space > and time in conceiving its objects.\\" 4.1, 2 On Hume's view, these perceptions do not belong to anything. Rather, Hume compares the soul to a commonwealth, which retains its identity not by virtue of some enduring core substance, but by being composed of many different, related, and yet constantly changing elements. The question of personal identity then becomes a matter of characterizing the loose cohesion of one's personal experience. (Note that in the Appendix to the Treatise, Hume said mysteriously that he was dissatisfied with his account of the self, yet he never returned to the issue.) The paradox of the Ship of Theseus can be used as an analogy of the self as a bundle of parts in flux.  Buddhism  Hume's position is similar to Indian Buddhists‚Äô theories and debates about the self, which generally considers a bundle theory to describe the mind phenomena grouped in aggregates (skandhas), such as sense-perceptions, intellective discrimination (sa·πÉj√±ƒÅ), emotions and volition. Since the beginning of Buddhist philosophy, several schools of interpretation assumed that a self cannot be identified with the transient aggregates, as they are non-self, but some traditions questioned further whether there can be an unchanging ground which defines a real and permanent individual identity, sustaining the impermanent phenomena; concepts such as Buddha-nature are found in the Mahayana lineage, and of an ultimate reality in dzogchen tradition, for instance in DolpopaSchaeffer, Kurtis R.; Kapstein, Matthew T.; Tuttle, Gray (2013-03-26). Sources of Tibetan Tradition. Columbia University Press. . p. 410 and Longchenpa.Germano, David Francis. Poetic thought, the intelligent Universe, and the mystery of self: The Tantric synthesis of rDzogs Chen in fourteenth century Tibet. Madison: The University of Wisconsin. 1992. Although Buddhists criticize the immutable ƒÅtman of Hinduism, some Buddhist schools problematized the notion of an individual personhood; even among early ones, such as the Pudgala view, it was approached implicitly in questions such as \\"who is the bearer of the bundle?\\", \\"what carries the aggregates?\\", \\"what transmigrates from one rebirth to another?\\" or \\"what is the subject of self- improvement and enlightenment?\\".Priestley, Leonard C. D. C. (1999) Pudgalavada Buddhism: The Reality of the Indeterminate Self. South Asian Studies Papers, 12, monograph 1. University of Toronto: Centre for South Asian Studies. ===The Buddha=== The Buddha in particular attacked all attempts to conceive of a fixed self, while stating that holding the view \\"I have no self\\" is also mistaken. This is an example of the middle way charted by the Buddha and the Madhyamaka school of Buddhism. That absence of a self definition is directed to avoid clinging to the \\"I\\", seek reality and attain detachment, and it is found in many passages of the oldest Buddha sutras, recorded in the Pali Canon, such as this: > \\"Bhikkhus, form is not-self. Were form self, then this form would not lead > to affliction, and one could have it of form: 'Let my form be thus, let my > form be not thus.' And since form is not-self, so it leads to affliction, > and none can have it of form: 'Let my form be thus, let my form be not > thus.'... Bhikkhus, feeling is not-self... Bhikkhus, perception is not- > self... Bhikkhus, determinations are not-self... Bhikkhus, consciousness > (vij√±ƒÅna) is not self.... is form permanent or impermanent?...\\"Anatta- > lakkhana Sutta (Pali Canon). Translation by √ëanamoli Thera (1993). === Self as a narrative center of gravity === Daniel Dennett has a deflationary theory of the \\"self\\". Selves are not physically detectable. Instead, they are a kind of convenient fiction, like a center of gravity, which is convenient as a way of solving physics problems, although they need not correspond to anything tangible ‚Äî the center of gravity of a hoop is a point in thin air. People constantly tell themselves stories to make sense of their world, and they feature in the stories as a character, and that convenient but fictional character is the self. === Self as an indispensable syntactic construct, not an entity === Aaron Sloman has proposed that words like \\"self\\", \\"selves\\", \\"herself\\", \\"itself\\", \\"themselves\\", \\"myself\\", etc. do not refer to a special type of entity, but provide powerful syntactical mechanisms for constructing utterances that repeatedly refer to the same thing without tedious and obscure repetition of names or other referring expressions. ==See also== * Atman (Buddhism) * Being and Time * Locke's assertion of consciousness as the basis of personal identity * Gnosis * Mirror stage *Open individualism * Other * Personal identity * Reflexive Self- Consciousness * Self (psychology) * Self (sociology) * Self (spirituality) * Self-realization * Self-Schema * Ship of Theseus * Subject (philosophy) ==NotesReferences== * * Carsten Korfmacher, 'Personal Identity', in \\"The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy\\" * Philosophical Category:Concepts in metaphysics ","title":"Philosophy of self"},{"id":"20492373","text":"Pierre Gosnat (August 20, 1948 ‚Äì January 25, 2015) was a French politician who was a member of the National Assembly of France.
