While it is suggested that initially the fortress was named after a nearby church of Saint Barnabas, however, Saint Barbara is the patron saint of artillerymen. The initial fortress was erected in 1331, after the Florentine Republic had defeated the forces of Castruccio Castracani, and reconsolidated their power over Pistoia. In 1531, under the designs of Nanni Unghero, the fortress was enlarged, but subsequently during the rule of the Grand Duke Cosimo I de' Medici the fortress was further enhanced, initially by Giovanni Battista Belluci, and subsequently by construction of a perimeter wall under the design of Bernardo Buontalenti. Similar fortress buildings by the Medici ruler took place throughout Tuscany, including the similarly named Fortezza di Santa Barbara in Siena in 1561‚Äì63. Unghero's fortress had been a simple moated quadrilateral, but Buontalenti linked the structure to the city wall. The fortress was only besieged in 1643, when the armies of the Pope Urban VIII Barberini unsuccessfully attacked the city. In the late 18th-century, Grand Duke Pietro Leopoldo I, relieved the fortress of its role in the city defences, changing the main functions to work as barracks. In subsequent decades it also served as a jail. In 1970, much-needed restoration work was begun.Comune of Pistoia, entry on fortress. The fortress chapel has some Baroque era frescoes.

He was a priest at the Honpa Hongwanji, and started their Young Men's Buddhist Association (YMBA). == Early life == Imamura was born in Togo village, Fukui prefecture, Japan on May 27, 1867. He entered the priesthood in 1876, when he was 10 years old. After studying in temple schools in Kyoto, he received a scholarship to study at Keio University in Tokyo. He graduated in 1893, then returned to Fukui to teach English. == Career == In 1899, Imamura moved to Hawaii to serve the Jodo Shinshu Buddhists there. He took over the Honpa Hongwanji when its first priest, Honi Satomi, returned to Japan. He married his wife Kiyoko in 1904, and they had a son named Kanmo, who also became a priest. Imamura established the Young Men's Buddhist Association as a Buddhist equivalent to the YMCA. Their activities included teaching English, helping new immigrants adjust to the local culture, and publishing a magazine called D≈çh≈ç. In 1902 Imamura opened the Fort Gakuen, a elementary school attached to the temple. He later opened the Hawaii Chugakko (middle school) in 1907. Both schools were Japanese language schools that student attended after the regular school day finished. He also advocated for plantation laborers and picture brides. Much of Imamura's career was spent showing the similarities between Buddhism and Christianity and Americanizing young Japanese immigrants through Buddhism. He wanted to make Buddhism more compatible with American life in Hawaii, and show it as a \\"universal\\" rather than \\"supernatural\\" religion. Unlike his Christian contemporary, Takie Okumura, Imamura's focus while Americanizing Japanese youth wasn't to encourage them to leave Japanese culture behind, but rather to carry its values with them as American citizens. In 1928, Imamura was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure for his work expanding the influence of Jodo Shinshu in Hawaii. Imamura died on December 22, 1932. == Further reading == * == References == Category:1867 births Category:1932 deaths Category:Japanese Buddhist missionaries Category:People from Fukui Prefecture ","title":"Yemyo Imamura"},{"id":"60313141","text":"Pedro Cavadas may refer to: *Pedro Cavadas (surgeon) (born 1965), Spanish surgeon *Pedro Cavadas (footballer) (born 1992), Portuguese footballer ","title":"Pedro Cavadas"},{"id":"60313164","text":"Salam Hashim () born in 1966 is an Iraqi coach and former footballer, he played as a defender.

He is a retired physicist with a doctoral degrees in physics from the University of Oxford and a master's degree in applied landscape archaeology also from University of Oxford. Meaden is influenced by the work of archaeologist Marija Gimbutas who wrote about the Goddess worshipping Neolithic and Bronze Age cultures of \\"Old Europe\\". ==Hieros Gamos== Meaden argues it was the power of a strong religious narrative that underlies the purpose of these megaliths. Drombeg stone circle is based on the cosmological fertility drama of the marriage of the sky God and earth Goddess known to the Classical Greeks much later as the hieros gamos. He states that the same principles also explain the placement of megaliths at Avebury and Stonehenge, although both sites are now damaged and incomplete. Fertility symbolism explains the religious elements behind the culture of the farming communities who were very dependent on the timely arrival of seasonal weather and the fertility of crops, livestock and women. In pre-literate times, Neolithic people expressed meaning through images and symbols displayed at stone circles. Meaden determined the core idea behind the building of Stonehenge and Avebury by spotting and interpreting key symbolism. A documentary filmed in 1998 for Channel 4 and the Discovery Channel detailed his hieros gamos concept. At Stonehenge on midsummer morning, a phallic shadow is cast from the \\"Heel\\" stone; this penetrates to the centre of the monument where its tip touches the \\"Goddess\\" stone. In his book, \\"Stonehenge, Avebury and Drombeg Stone Circle Deciphered\\", he wrote that most stone circles were planned as sunrise fertility monuments, and so need to be studied at sunrise. Meaden writes that the Neolithic calendar was based on the eight festival dates of traditional agriculture, corresponding roughly to the pagan Wheel of the Year. ==Drombeg Stone Circle== At Drombeg stone circle, photographs taken at sunrise on each of the eight festival occasions demonstrate that Drombeg's builders used solar archaeoastronomy when designing their circle. The summer solstice marks the occasion of the consummation of the classic Marriage of the Gods, uniting the Sky Father with the Earth Mother. This act of consummation between stones representing divinities was devised as an action spectacle for the Neolithic people. == Bibliography == *The Goddess of the Stones: Language of the Megaliths Hardcover (Souvenir Press, 1991) *Stonehenge: The Secret of the Solstice (Souvenir Press, 1997) *The Secret of the Avebury Stones (Souvenir Press, 1999) *Stonehenge, Avebury and Drombeg Stone Circles Deciphered: The archaeological decoding of the core symbolism and meanings planned into these ancient British and Irish monuments (LAP Lambert Academic Publishing, 2016) *A New Bible in Three Testaments: The Book of the Universe, Stars, Sun, Earth, Life and Humankind (New Generation Publishing, 2018) *The Old Stones: A Field Guide to the Megalithic Sites of Britain and Ireland (Watkins Publishing, 2018) Contributor ==Notes== ==External links== * Category:1935 births Category:Academics of the University of Oxford Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:British archaeologists Category:British physicists Category:British meteorologists Category:British atheists Category:Living people ","title":"Terence Meaden"},{"id":"60313257","text":"Akali Nidar Singh Nihang (Punjabi: ‡®®‡®ø‡®°‡®∞ ‡®∏‡®ø‡©∞‡®ò ‡®®‡®ø‡®π‡©∞‡®ó) (born 1967 in Wolverhampton) is a British scholar, martial artist and grandmaster (Gurdev) of the ancient Indian martial art of Shastar Vidya. == Career == Nidar Singh Nihang is the only teacher & last surviving master of Shastar vidiya and the ninth teacher of the Shastar Vidya Akhara - a martial arts school originally founded in 1661 by Baba Darbara Singh and has been training 70 hours a week for 30 years.

The colonies are found on rocks in waters 5 meters to 20 meters deep. Also can be found on moderately exposed rocky sites, usually with moderate tidal streams, attached to rocks. The colony is around 50mm broad and 15mm thick. ==Biology== Aplidium elegans colony is made up of a couple different parts. The zooid is the individual animal, and in a colony, there are multiple zooids. The colony has a test or tunica which is a thick layer secreted by the mantle, containing cellulose and protecting the animal. Every zooid has an oral siphon, which is an opening through which water is drawn into the ascidian to collect nutrients. Each individual also has a cloaca through which water is expelled. ==See also== * List of tunicates of Ireland ==References== Category:Enterogona Category:Animals described in 1872 ","title":"Aplidium elegans"},{"id":"60313447","text":"Schneider flow is an axisymmetric flow induced by a laminar or turbulent jet (with large jet Reynolds number or by a laminar plume (with large plume Grashof number), in which the fluid domain is bounded by a wall.

The solution is an extension of Taylor's potential flow solutionTaylor, G. (1958). Flow induced by jets. Journal of the Aerospace Sciences, 25(7), 464‚Äì465. to arbitrary Reynolds number. ==Mathematical description== For laminar or turbulent jets and for laminar plumes, the volumetric entertainment rate per unit axial length is constant as can be seen from the solution of Schlichting jet and Yih plume. Thus, the jet or plume can be considered as a link sink, as was first done by G. I. Taylor and this sink will be drive the fluid outside the jet or plume. Prior to Schneider, it was assumed that this outer fluid motion is also a large Reynolds number flow, hence the outer fluid motion is assumed to be a potential flow solution, which was solved by G. I. Taylor in 1958. For turbulent plume, the entrainment is not constant, nevertheless, the outer fluid is still governed by Taylors solution. Though Taylor's solution is still true for turbulent jet, for laminar jet or laminar plume, the effective Reynolds number for outer fluid is found to be of order unity since the entertainment by the sink in these cases is such that the flow is not inviscid. In this case, full Navier-Stokes equations has to be solved for the outer fluid motion and at the same time, since the fluid is bounded from the bottom by a solid wall, the solution has to satisfy the non-slip condition. Schneider obtained a self-similar solution for this outer fluid motion, which naturally reduced to Taylor's potential flow solution as the entrainment rate by the line sink is increased. Suppose a conical wall of semi-angle \\\\alpha with polar axis along the cone-axis and assume the vertex of the solid cone sits at the origin of the spherical coordinates (r,\\\\theta,\\\\phi) extending along the negative axis. Now, put the line sink along the positive side of the polar axis. Set this way, \\\\alpha=\\\\pi/2 represents the common case of flat wall with jet or plume emerging from the origin. The case \\\\alpha=\\\\pi corresponds to jet/plume issuing from a thin injector. The flow is axisymmetric with zero azimuthal motion, i.e., the velocity components are (v_r,v_\\\\theta,0). The usual technique to study the flow is to introduce the Stokes stream function \\\\psi such that :v_r = \\\\frac{1}{r^2\\\\sin\\\\theta}\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\psi}{\\\\partial\\\\theta}, \\\\quad v_\\\\theta = - \\\\frac{1}{r\\\\sin\\\\theta}\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\psi}{\\\\partial r}. Introducing \\\\xi =\\\\cos\\\\theta as the replacement for \\\\theta and introducing the self-similar form \\\\psi = K u r f(\\\\xi) into the axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations, we obtainCoenen, W., Rajamanickam, P., Weiss, A. D., S√°nchez, A. L., & Williams, F. A. (2019). Swirling flow induced by jets and plumes. Acta Mechanica, 230(6), 2221-2231. :K^{-1}[(1-\\\\xi^2)f' - 4\\\\xi f'] - ff - 3f'f = 0. where the constant K is such that the volumetric entrainment rate per unit axial length is equal to 2\\\\pi K u. For laminar jet, K=4 and for laminar plume, it depends on the Prandtl number Pr, for example with Pr=1, we have K=6 and with Pr=2, we have K=4. For turbulent jet, this constant is the order of the jet Reynolds number, which is a large number. The above equation can easily be reduced to a Riccati equation by integrating thrice, a procedure that is same as in the Landau‚ÄìSquire jet (main difference between Landau-Squire jet and the current problem are the boundary conditions). The boundary conditions on the conical wall \\\\xi=\\\\xi_w=\\\\cos\\\\alpha become :f(\\\\xi_w)=f'(\\\\xi_w)=0 and along the line sink \\\\xi=1, we have :f(1)=1, \\\\quad \\\\lim_{\\\\xi\\\\rightarrow 1} (1-\\\\xi)^{1/2} f\\\\rightarrow 0. The problem has been solved numerically from here. ===Taylor's potential flow=== For turbulent jet, K\\\\gg 1, the linear terms in the equation can be neglected everywhere except near a small boundary layer along the wall. Then neglecting the non-slip conditions at the wall, the solution is given by :f= \\\\frac{\\\\xi-\\\\xi_w}{1-\\\\xi_w}. ==Other considerations== The exact solution of the Navier-Stokes solutions was verified experimentally by Zauner in 1985Zauner, E. (1985). Visualization of the viscous flow induced by a round jet. Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 154, 111‚Äì119. Further analysisMitsotakis, K., Schneider, W., & Zauner, E. (1984). Second-order boundary-layer theory of laminar jet flows. Acta mechanica, 53(1-2), 115‚Äì123.Schneider, W. (1985). Decay of momentum flux in submerged jets. Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 154, 91‚Äì110. showed that the axial momentum flux decays slowly along the axis unlike the Schlichting jet solution and it is found that the Schneider flow becomes invalid when distance from the origin increases to a distance of the order exponential of square of the jet Reynolds number, thus the domain of validity of Schneider solution increases with increasing jet Reynolds number. ==Presence of swirl== The presence of swirling motion, i.e., v_\\\\phi eq 0 is shown not to influence the axial motion given by \\\\psi=K u r f(\\\\xi) provided K\\\\sim O(1). If K is very large, the presence of swirl completely alters the motion on the axial plane. For K\\\\sim O(1), the azimuthal solution can be solved in terms of the circulation 2\\\\pi \\\\Gamma, where \\\\Gamma=r\\\\sin\\\\theta v_\\\\phi. The solution can be described in terms of the self-similar solution of the second kind, \\\\Gamma=Ar^\\\\lambda \\\\Lambda(\\\\xi), where A is an unknown constant and \\\\lambda is an eigenvalue.

Within 12 hours of having won the seat, saddened by his grandfather's defeat from Tumkur constituency he announced his resignation. Following his decision, H. D. Deve Gowda advised him not to tender his resignation. September 30, 2019 Karnataka High Court issued a summons to him over an incomplete election affidavit. Petitioners of the summons accused him of allegedly filing a false and incomplete affidavit with his nomination papers during the Lok Sabha 2019 Indian general election in Karnataka.

Allis was born into a Cleveland family of modest means, and moved to New York in 1929 to begin a career in the field of interior design. In the mid-1940s she opened an antiques store in central Southport, Connecticut. At around the same time she began the restoration of the David Ogden House in Fairfield, ultimately turning it into a showcase for eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century American folk paintings and furniture. She became an influential guide to many important collectors, such as Stewart Gregory. Allis gained recognition in 1958 when she purchased the collection of folk art assembled by William J. and Marion Raymond Gunn of Newtonville, Massachusetts. Of the 630 pieces, many of them folk portraits, in the collection, around 150 were purchased by Stephen Clark for the New York State Historical Association; the remainder went to other institutions and private collectors.

It began forming in August, 1941 in the Siberian Military District. It joined the fighting front in December with the new 59th Army along the Volkhov River and it continued to serve in the fighting near Leningrad until early 1944. The dismal fighting on this front gave little opportunity for a unit to distinguish itself, and the division did not finally earn a battle honor until late January, 1944, during the Leningrad‚ÄìNovgorod Offensive. It continued to serve in the summer and autumn offensive through the Baltic States, becoming so reduced in strength that its remaining infantry was consolidated into a single understrength regiment which nevertheless won a battle honor in the liberation of Riga. The 374th ended the war in Latvia, helping to contain and reduce the German forces trapped in the Courland Pocket, and was disbanded shortly thereafter. ==Formation== Like the 372nd Rifle Division, the 374th began forming on August 10, 1941 in the Siberian Military District based on an RKO order of that dateWalter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 79 at Bogotol, Ilansky and Nazarovo, in the Krasnoyarsk Krai, based on the first wartime shtat (table of organization and equipment) for rifle divisions. Its order of battle was as follows: * 1242nd Rifle Regiment * 1244th Rifle Regiment * 1246th Rifle Regiment * 942nd Artillery RegimentCharles C. Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From June to December 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IX, Nafziger, 1996, p. 100 * 382nd Antitank Battalion (from late June, 1942) * 441st Reconnaissance Company * 659th Sapper Battalion * 830th Signal Battalion (later 490th Signal Company) * 464th Medical/Sanitation Battalion * 457th Chemical Protection (Anti-gas) Company * 494th Motor Transport Company * 233rd Field Bakery * 802nd Divisional Veterinary Hospital * 1427th (later 1442nd) Field Postal Station * 750th Field Office of the State Bank Col. Aleksei Dmitrievich Vitoshkin was not assigned to command of the division until September 18, and he would remain in command until July 4, 1942. In November the division was assigned to the 59th Reserve Army, and remained in there when it became the 59th Army. It moved by rail that month as far as Vologda from where it faced a march of about 700 km to reach the fighting front. The division and its Army joined Volkhov Front in December.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 100 ===Lyuban Offensive Operation=== The combat path of the 374th Rifle DivisionOn January 6, 1942, the Front began an offensive to break through the positions of German 18th Army on the west bank of the Volkhov, primarily with the 2nd Shock Army, and break the siege of Leningrad from the south. The operation got off to a slow start, and it was not until the night of January 23/24 that the Front commander, Army Gen. K. A. Meretskov, could convince himself that 2nd Shock had created enough of a breach to commit his exploitation force. However, the situation soon reverted to stalemate, which Meretskov hoped to break on January 28 in part by clearing the enemy from the western bank of the Volkhov to the Polist River line with the 53rd Rifle Brigade and one rifle regiment of the 374th.David M. Glantz, The Battle for Leningrad 1941 - 1944, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2002, pp. 158-59, 165. Glantz identifies the regiment as the 374th, which is clearly an error. By March 26 German forces had completed inner and outer encirclement lines along the Glushitsa and Polist Rivers and 2nd Shock Army, along with several formations of 59th Army were trapped. Early the next day Meretskov launched a desperate new assault which managed to carve out a tenuous gap 3 - 5 km wide near the village of Miasnoi Bor. This was by no means adequate, and in early April 59th Army, including the 374th, attacked in the area southwest of Spasskaia Polist, but gained little ground at the cost of heavy losses.Glantz, Battle for Leningrad, pp. 177-81 As of May 1 the division was with its Army in Leningrad Front as part of the Group of Forces of the Volkhov Direction, which a month later had become the Volkhov Group of Forces. By July 1 the 59th Army was back in Volkhov Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, pp. 80, 99, 120 Col. Yakov Stepanovich Yermakov took command of the division from Colonel Vitoshkin on July 5, but he was in turn succeeded five days later by Col. Dimitrii Ivanovich Barabanshchikov. ==Sinyavino and Mga Offensives== In August the 374th was transferred to the rebuilding 2nd Shock Army, still in Volkhov Front, but saw little action in the Sinyavino Offensive taking place at that time. In early October it was briefly part of the 4th Guards Rifle Corps of that Army, before being removed to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command for a much-needed rebuilding. On November 1 Colonel Barabanshchikov was succeeded in command by Col. Stefan Vladimirovich Kolomiets. The division was assigned to the 3rd Reserve Army, and did not return to Volkhov Front until January, 1943,Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 100 when it was assigned to Front reserves, before being reassigned to the 54th Army in February.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, pp. 33, 58 During March the 374th was transferred again, now to the 8th Army where it would remain for the rest of the year. The STAVKA was planning an ambitious offensive, Operation Polyarnaya Zvezda, but this was stymied in the south by the German reserves gained by their evacuation of the Demyansk Pocket. The northern component of the offensive, directed at the enemy communication hub of Mga, was ordered to proceed on March 19. After a 135-minute artillery preparation and three days of intense fighting, 8th Army's first echelon divisions, including the 374th, had penetrated 3 - 4 km on a 7 km front at the junction of the 1st and 223rd Infantry Divisions. At this point a mobile group consisting of the 191st Guards Rifle Regiment from 64th Guards Rifle Division and a battalion of tanks was committed to advance to Mga Station. In ongoing fighting until April 2 this last objective was not reached.Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2009, pp. 458-59 On July 14, after a three-day gap, Colonel Kolomiets was replaced in command by Col. Vasilii Konstantinovich Semibratov, but a few weeks later Col. Viktor Yakovlevich Popov was given command. The fifth Sinyavino Offensive began on July 22 with 8th Army again attacking east of Mga, this time on an attack front of 13.6 km in the Voronovo region and aiming to link up with 67th Army at or near Mga while detaching two rifle divisions and a tank brigade to strike at Sinyavino from the south. In order to penetrate the strong German defenses the Army commander, Lt. Gen. F. N. Starikov, organized his forces into two shock groups, each of two echelons. The 374th was in the second echelon of the second group, along with the 165th Rifle Division and 122nd Tank Brigade ready to exploit the offensive, which was preceded by six days of artillery fire on the enemy positions, which were held by 5th Mountain Division. Despite the careful preparations the attack stalled after capturing the forward German trenches. Late in the month Starikov released the 165th and 379th Rifle Divisions from second echelon but this did not improve the situation as German reserves were arriving just as 5th Mountain was falling apart.Glantz, Battle for Leningrad, pp. 306, 309, 311-12 On August 9 Soviet reconnaissance detected what they thought was a weak point in the German defenses around a small bridgehead on the east bank of the Naziia River, held by the much-weakened 5th Mountain. Early on August 11 Starikov committed the 374th and 256th Rifle Divisions with two Guards tank regiments in support of the divisions already fighting in the area. Although the reinforced shock group almost enveloped the defending Germans and the 256th finally took the Poreche strongpoint, the attack once again stalled. Repeated attacks and counterattacks severely wore down both the attacking and defending forces. A German source states that the 374th had committed two rifle regiments to the battle and that by August 16, 12 to 14 Red Army infantry battalions were reported as \\"decimated\\". At 1440 hours on August 22 the STAVKA finally permitted the Leningrad and Volkhov Fronts to go over to the defensive. The sixth and final Sinyavino Offensive began on September 15. This time the 67th Army's 30th Guards Rifle Corps finally seized the Sinyavino Heights, but the supporting attacks by 8th Army achieved very little during three days of heavy fighting. The 374th was not part of the Army's shock groups in this attack. Following this battle the fighting south of Leningrad abated for the rest of the year.Glantz, Battle for Leningrad, pp. 312-18 On October 25 Colonel Popov handed his command to Col. Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Volkov. In December the division became part of the 119th Rifle Corps, still in 8th Army.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 9 ==Leningrad-Novgorod Offensive== The offensive that finally drove Army Group North from the Leningrad region began on January 14, 1944. During the first stages the forces of Volkhov Front found the going extremely tough and 8th Army in particular, with only about 13,000 troops, made almost no progress at all. Meanwhile 54th Army on the left flank had only managed to advance 3 - 5 km by January 20. However, that night the German XXVIII Army Corps began to withdraw, and over the next four days the 54th's right flank advanced 20 km towards Lyuban, but encountered heavier resistance as it approached the Rollbahn Line. In response the 119th Corps was reinforced and transferred to 54th Army, and the reinforced Army reached the railroad southeast of Lyuban by the morning of January 26. The Spanish Blue Legion was sent back to Luga and the 121st Infantry Division was ordered to abandon Lyuban.Glantz, Battle for Leningrad, pp. 359-60 On January 28 the division was honored for this victory: By February 1 the 119th Corps was moved to Front reserves and the 374th was transferred to the 115th Rifle Corps, still in 54th Army.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 37 The Corps advanced 75 km in nine days and liberated Oredezh on February 8 with attacks from the north and west. This helped to lead to the liberation of Luga on the 12th; on the following day Volkhov Front was disbanded and the 54th Army was moved to Leningrad Front. As the pursuit continued the Corps was briefly under command of 67th Army before being withdrawn to Front reserve on February 24. A few days later 8th Army took Strugi Krasnye,Glantz, Battle for Leningrad, pp. 385, 388, 393-94 and the 115th Corps was shifted to that Army.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 66 8th Army was soon deflected northwestward to take part in the complex fighting around the city of Narva. On March 25 Colonel Volkov transferred his command to Col. Boris Alekseevich Gorodetskii. Until July the division would be shuffled between the 8th and 59th Armies in Leningrad Front, as well as several rifle corps.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 100 ==Baltic Offensive== By the beginning of July the 374th was in the 124th Rifle Corps of 8th Army.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 186 By the middle of the month the division was in the vicinity of Porkhov,The Gamers, Inc., Baltic Gap, Multi-Man Publishing, Inc., Millersville, MD, 2009, p. 18 from where it advanced to the south and then west, bypassing the remaining German defenses in the Ostrov - Pskov area and entering the so-called \\"Baltic Gap\\". As of August 1 it was back in 54th Army as part of 7th Rifle Corps, all of which was in 3rd Baltic Front,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 216 and had reached the area of Abrene on the border with Latvia. Over the next six weeks the rate of advance slowed considerably and by mid-September the 54th had only reached as far as Gulbene.The Gamers, Baltic Gap, pp. 22, 29 At the start of the Riga Offensive the 374th was in the vicinity of Sigulda. By this time it was reduced to a total of just 1,800 officers and men.https://pamyat- naroda.ru/documents/view/?id=451335974, site page 76. In Russian. Retrieved Mar. 31, 2019 In order to retain at least some combat effectiveness all the remaining infantry was assigned to the 1244th Rifle Regiment, bringing it to about 60 percent of authorized strength. Despite this the division played a leading role in the liberation of Riga and was recognized: ==Battle of Courland== After the battle for Riga the 3rd Baltic Front was disbanded and 54th Army was removed to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command, so the 374th was assigned to the 1st Shock Army in 2nd Baltic Front, where it returned to the 119th Rifle Corps. It would remain under those Corps and Army commands for the duration, moving to the Courland Group of Forces with them in March, 1945.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 100 On January 15 Col. Dmitrii Ivanovich Pavlov took command from Colonel Gorodetskii and would hold it for the duration.

A classical tragedy, it is loosely based on the true story of a 16th-century nobleman who, after being presumed killed in battle, returns to Portugal under Spanish rule, to the consternation of his wife who has since remarried. Frei Lu√≠s de Sousa is considered Almeida Garrett's dramatic masterpiece and the archetype of Portuguese Romantic theatre. Jos√©-Augusto Fran√ßa has called Frei Lu√≠s de Sousa \\"the masterpiece of 19th-century Portuguese theatre\\", and Jo√£o Gaspar Sim√µes notes that it is \\"easily the foremost document of national theatre.\\" It has been adapted into the English language as The Pilgrim. ==Plot summary== The play is set in Portugal under Spanish dominion, many years after the disastrous Battle of Ksar el-Kebir that cost Portugal its independence. The body of the Portuguese king, Sebastian of Portugal, was never recovered, nor was that of nobleman Dom Jo√£o de Portugal, of the important House of Vimioso. Madalena de Vilhena, Dom Jo√£o de Portugal's widow, has since married Manuel de Sousa Coutinho, a chivalrous knight of the Order of Malta. The two lead a virtuous and happy existence, along with their frail young daughter, Maria de Noronha, perturbed only by the silent reproach of a loyal servant, Telmo Pais, the only one who still believes that his former master shall return. Madalena has grown anguished the possibility of Dom Jo√£o's return would mean her second marriage is bigamous, void, and that her daughter Maria is illegitimate. Dom Jo√£o de Portugal (1863), by Miguel √Çngelo Lupi (Chiado Museum) They live in Manuel de Sousa Coutinho's elegant palace in Almada, and receive word that the Spanish governors have decided to move their quarters to the residence to escape the plague that was devastating Lisbon: in a fit of patriotism, appalled by this arbitrary resolution, Manuel de Sousa Coutinho sets fire to his own house. While they escape, Madalena watches as a portrait of Manuel is consumed by the flames. They are now forced to live in Dom Jo√£o de Portugal's uninhibited palace. The gallery of the old palace is dominated by a portrait of Dom Jo√£o besides that of King Sebastian ‚Äî which Madalena interprets as a grave omen. While Maria and Manuel de Sousa Coutinho are away, Madalena is being settled by her brother-in-law, Frei Jorge, when they receive the visit of an old pilgrim from the Holy Land: he tells them that he was kept in captivity for many years and that Dom Jo√£o is still alive. When asked who he is, the pilgrim points at Dom Jo√£o's portrait and replies \\"Nobody.\\" Deathly ashamed, Madalena and Manuel de Sousa decide that the only solution was for them to go their separate ways and each join a convent. Telmo Pais tells Dom Jo√£o about the frail young Maria de Noronha, and the old nobleman regrets his presence is causing the family such distress and is covering the woman he loved in dishonour: he bids Telmo to go and tell them all that the pilgrim was a fraud, but it is too late ‚Äî the play concludes as Manuel de Sousa (now, Brother Lu√≠s de Sousa) and Madalena take their take solemn vows to live cloistered monastic lives, and the orphaned Maria de Noronha interrupts the ceremony with an emotional and feverish speech about how the social mores have torn their family apart before she succumbs to consumption. ==History== According to a scribble at the end of the play's manuscript, Almeida Garrett finished it \\"in the morning of 8 April 1843, in bed, in this house in rua do Alecrim\\". He presented it to the Royal Conservatory of Lisbon in a conference held on 6 May 1843, declaiming it in full by himself, along with an important address (Mem√≥ria ao Conservat√≥rio Real), a theorizing text, with reflections on literature and theatre and on the pedagogic mission of the artist ‚Äî in it, he famously notes that Frei Lu√≠s de Sousa has all the hallmarks of a tragedy, however, he prefers to call it a drama because it does not follow the formal structure of a tragedy. Garrett's Mem√≥ria is sometimes compared to the preface of Victor Hugo's 1827 play Cromwell, now considered the manifesto of the Romanticism, in terms of importance as a declaration of aesthetic intentions of the incipient Romantic movement in Portugal. The final scene of Frei Lu√≠s de Sousa in a 1908 performance, Pr√≠ncipe Real Theatre The favourable impressions of his peers at the Conservatory led Garrett to present the play to the public. The play was first performed before an audience on 4 July 1843, in the private Quinta do Pinheiro Theatre in Lisbon; Almeida Garrett himself played the part of Telmo Pais. The first public showing, in the Salitre Theatre in the summer of 1847, was of a severely censured version, especially the end of Act I, considered a \\"diplomatic complication\\" with Spain: a contemporary article published in the Revista Universal Lisbonense described it as having turned \\"the most exemplary and admirable of our dramas into a shapeless monster\\". The full play only premiered in the National Theatre in 1850. Edgar Prestage translated the play as Brother Luiz de Sousa, published 1909. In the 1990s, Nicholas Round made an adaptation for the stage titled The Pilgrim. ==References== ===Notes=== Category:1843 plays Category:Plays set in Portugal Category:Plays set in the 16th century ","title":"Frei Lu√≠s de Sousa"},{"id":"60314116","text":"Steve Ashby (1904‚Äì1980) was an American folk artist. The son of an emancipated slave, Ashby was born in Delaplane, Virginia, one of twelve children. He received little formal schooling, and remained illiterate for his entire life. He spent most of his life in Delaplane except for a short time as a waiter at a hotel in nearby Marshall; for the bulk of that time he worked the farm where his father and previous generations of his family had been enslaved. Late in his twenties, he married an older woman, Eliza King, who was a cook at a boarding school for girls, and they moved into an abandoned one-room schoolhouse. They had no children, but adopted a boy. Throughout his life Ashby was interested in sculpture, making mostly small wooden pieces before his wife's death in 1960. It was after that date, and his retirement from farming, that he began to create his \\"fixing-ups\\", as he called them, larger figure sculptures that he used to decorate his house and yard. Made largely from pieces of timber and lumber, they were augmented with paint, pieces of old clothing, magazine cut-outs, and other found objects. Lively and expressionistic, they are often quite erotic; some of his kinetic pieces depict explicitly sexual activity. His first piece was a depiction of his deceased wife, completely dressed in her clothing. The narratives hinted at by Ashby's pieces are ambiguous, but contain undertones of the racial tensions prominent in American society during the period as well as images suggested by popular culture such as Blaxploitation films. Others are inspired by the agricultural activities prevalent in the area surrounding Delaplane. A single sculpture made out of concrete is also known. Ashby began to gain recognition for his art late in life. Eight pieces by Ashby are in the collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, while three are held at the American Folk Art Museum. Other work is owned by Vassar College. ==References== Category:1904 births Category:1980 deaths Category:People from Fauquier County, Virginia Category:Sculptors from Virginia Category:American male sculptors Category:20th-century American sculptors Category:20th-century male artists Category:Farmers from Virginia Category:African-American sculptors Category:African-American farmers ","title":"Steve Ashby"},{"id":"60314143","text":"Jacquavius Dennard Smith (born May 1, 2000), professionally known as 9lokkNine (formerly GlokkNine), is an American rapper.

Bielinis was a son of Jurgis Bielinis, one of the best known Lithuanian book smugglers. Bielinis attended a gymnasium in Riga, but was expelled for his social-democratic activities. He joined the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania and along with Steponas Kairys was one of its leaders until his death. Bielinis was an active participant in the Russian Revolution of 1905 delivering some 30 public anti- Tsarist speeches across Lithuania. He was arrested by the police together with other members of the Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party in November 1907 and was sentenced to four years of hard labor and then exile to the Irkutsk Oblast. After the February Revolution, he moved to Petrograd and returned to Lithuania in summer 1918. Bielinis was elected to the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania in April 1920, Second Seimas in May 1923, and the Third Seimas in May 1926. A member of the opposition to the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, he was one of the most active speakers during the parliamentary sessions. After the coup d'√©tat of December 1926, Bielinis withdrew from more active political life working as a finance director at the and board member of several cooperatives. During the German occupation of Lithuania, Bielinis was a member of the resistance and organized the Supreme Committee for the Liberation of Lithuania (VLIK). In 1944, as many other Lithuanian intellectuals, he retreated west ahead of the advancing Red Army and moved to the United States in 1949. He was an active member of various anti-Soviet Lithuanian organizations. Four volumes of his memoirs were published in 1958‚Äì2012. ==Biography== ===Russian Empire=== Bielinis was born in in Bir≈æai District, then part of the Russian Empire, to a family of Jurgis Bielinis, one of the best known Lithuanian book smugglers during the Lithuanian press ban. From about 1890, his father was searched by the police and did not live at home. In 1892, his father took him to Gar≈°viai where the Gar≈°viai Book Smuggling Society was based in hopes of teaching him same basic reading and writing. He had some other private tutors in Panevƒó≈æys and Sidabravas before enrolling into a realschule in Mitau (Jelgava) in fall 1894. After taking entrance exams, he was admitted to the in fall 1895. Bielinis helped his father with book smuggling; for example, he helped to bind Lithuanian prayer books in Riga. In 1902, he met Jonas Bili≈´nas who gave him some social- democratic literature. He later met and Kazimieras Venclauskis who encouraged him to join social-democratic causes. He organized a secret Lithuanian student society, which included Sofija Kymantaitƒó-ƒåiurlionienƒó and as members. He contributed articles to Darbinink≈≥ balsas, ≈™kininkas, Naujienos and represented Riga at the 1903 conference of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania in Vilnius. For social-democratic activities, he was expelled from the school. Together with others, he hectographed 160 copies of a booklet with revolutionary songs in 1904. Bielinis was an active participant in the Russian Revolution of 1905. He gave the first public anti-Tsarist speeches in Kupi≈°kis on 10 March, Skapi≈°kis on 18 April, and Kurkliai on 23 April. He was arrested and beaten by the police, but his friends managed to free him and he continued to organize protest rallies and delivering public speeches. In total, he organized about 30 such events. Bielinis also organized social-democratic groups as well as smuggling and distribution of social-democratic publications. The Tsarist police started as many as 20 cases for his revolutionary activities but he evaded capture. In 1906, he even planned an armed attack on a police station in Ukmergƒó to free imprisoned . He briefly lived in Vilnius before moving back to Riga. He helped with the publication of Naujoji gadynƒó (The New Era) and contributed articles to other Lithuanian periodicals, including Skardas, ≈Ωarija, Vilniaus ≈æinios, Lietuvos ≈´kininkas, using as many as 40 different pen names to confuse the police. He also translated and published two brochures about Fasci Siciliani and permanent army and police by . In Riga, Bielinis joined the Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party and was arrested together with 15 other party members on 18 November 1907. After a year, he was sentenced to four years of hard labor. In 1912, he was exiled to in the Kachugsky District, Irkutsk Oblast. He obtained a fake passport with the help of Felicija Bortkeviƒçienƒó, escaped from Manzurka, and worked as a bookkeeper in Khor in the Khabarovsk Krai. ===Independent Lithuania=== Bielinis in 1918 After the February Revolution, the Russian Provisional Government announced an amnesty to political prisoners and Bielinis arrived to Petrograd in summer 1917 where he rejoined the activities of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania. He briefly worked at the Lithuanian section of the People's Commissariat for Nationalities. He returned to Lithuania in summer 1918 and started organizing local administration in ≈†iauliai. He continued to work at the administration keeping its finances as the city changed hands during the Lithuanian‚ÄìSoviet War and organized partisan groups to fight the West Russian Volunteer Army. Bielinis helped reestablishing the Social Democratic Party in Lithuania and was named as one of the five board members in its registration with the Lithuanian government. The party faced pressure both from the illegal and more radical Communist Party of Lithuania and the Lithuanian government which treated it with suspicion. Bielinis was among 13 social democrats elected the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania in the April 1920 elections. His election profile stated his profession as bookkeeper. Bielinis was an active member of the Constituent Assembly and a member of the parliamentary commissions on local self- governments, finance and budget, and education. He spoke frequently against the new Constitution of Lithuania and particularly its provisions for the President of Lithuania. He believed that a president posed danger to democracy and could lead to absolutism and monarchism. As a member of the opposition to the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, he spoke frequently against various proposals, e.g. against mandatory religious education in schools, provision of salaries to members of the clergy, or taxation of cooperatives, and presented several interpellations. He was not elected to the First Seimas in October 1922. He then traveled to United States from December 1922 to May 1923 visiting various communities of Lithuanian Americans, delivering speeches, and collecting donations for various social democratic causes in Lithuania. He was reelected to the Second Seimas in May 1923 and the Third Seimas in May 1926. Bielinis was one of the most active speakers during the parliamentary sessions. He spoke 247 times during 130 sessions out of 246 total sessions of the Second Seimas. He most frequently spoke about the state budget and other financial matters. Bielinis and other social democrats protested the coup d'√©tat of December 1926 that brought President Antanas Smetona to power. In addition to parliamentary work, Bielinis and Steponas Kairys were the most prominent leaders of the Lithuanian social democrats. Bielinis was periodically reelected to the central committee of the Social Democratic Party, becoming its chairman in 1923 and 1925. From March 1921 to January 1923, he was also editor-in-chief of the social democratic newspaper Socialdemokratas (Socialdemocrat). After the dismissal of the Third Seimas in March 1927, political activities of the opposition parties were restricted until all parties except for the ruling Lithuanian Nationalist Union were banned in 1936. Bielinis and Kairys attended the 4th congress of the Labour and Socialist International in Vienna in 1931, but more active political work in Lithuania was difficult. They both were briefly arrested in April 1929 when police searched the headquarters of the Social Democratic Party and found copies of the illegal Pirmyn (Forward) newspaper published by the pleƒçkaitininkai. On 1 January 1928, Bielinis became chief of accounting at the . He also became director of the craft section at the Chamber encouraging traditional crafts such as weaving, knitting, ceramics. Bielinis organized a cooperative Marginiai (Assortment) to sell craft production and was its chairman. In 1921, he co-founded a cooperative book publishing company Kult≈´ra (Culture) in ≈†iauliai. He was a board member of other cooperatives, including a bank and an insurance company. He was elected chairman of the Health Insurance Fund in Kaunas (these insurance funds were one of the few avenues for social democrats to participate in public life). Bielinis also collected materials for the history of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania and wrote four volumes of memoirs. He managed to publish two of them about the Lithuanian press ban and the Russian Revolution of 1905 in 1958 and 1959. The third volume on World War I was published posthumously in 1971. The manuscript for the period between the revolution and World War I remained in Lithuania and was published by his nephew in 2012. ===Occupied Lithuania and United States=== Bielinis in 1930s During World War II, Bielinis was a member of the Lithuanian resistance. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Lithuanian social democrats reestablished their political organization, now known as the New Lithuania (). It was chaired by Steponas Kairys with Bielinis acting as vice-chairman. In May 1942, New Lithuania published a proclamation which denounced both Soviet and German occupations. It was followed by a proclamation that urged Lithuanians to conserve their resources and not to join the German war effort. Various Lithuanian groups understood the need for a unified organization. In 1942, two such umbrella organizations were created ‚Äì the Catholic-minded National Council, chaired by Juozas Ambrazeviƒçius, and the atheist Supreme Committee of Lithuanians. Bielinis became responsible for the finances of the Supreme Committee. In November 1943, the two organizations merged into the Supreme Committee for the Liberation of Lithuania (VLIK), chaired by Kairys. Bielinis continued to be responsible for the finances of the merged organization. In April‚ÄìMay 1944, the Gestapo discovered VLIK and arrested a total of 27 VLIK members and supporters. Kairys went into hiding while Bielinis attempted to organize the \\"small\\" VLIK, which met six times in May‚ÄìJune 1944. Bielinis decided to transfer VLIK to Germany where Rapolas Skipitis, Vaclovas Sidzikauskas, and Mykolas Krupaviƒçius resided. In July, the small VLIK retreated to Suvalkija and published several proclamations urging Lithuanians to defend Lithuania's independence from the advancing Red Army, i.e. to organize the partisan warfare against the Soviet Union. Bielinis, as many other Lithuanian intellectuals, retreated west and in August 1944 arrived to Berlin. He joined VLIK and once again became responsible for its finances. He headed VLIK's finance committee which grew to become the Lithuanian National Foundation. Bielinis and others organized the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania in exile ‚Äì they held a congress in September 1949 in Prien am Chiemsee, Germany, and sent out many declarations and memorandums to political leaders in Europe and United States concerning Lithuania's occupation, mass deportations, and other Soviet repressions He was also a member of the special commission organizing the Lithuanian World Community and preparing the Lithuanian Charter in 1949.. Bielinis moved to the United States in September 1949 and joined the cultural life of Lithuanian Americans, including the ‚Äì he established the federation's Book Fund in 1953. In 1951, he was one of the founders of the Lithuanian-American Community and a member of the Committee for a Free Lithuania, which was related to the National Committee for a Free Europe and later joined the Assembly of Captive European Nations. When VLIK moved to the United States in 1955, Bielinis rejoined its activities and was briefly its acting chairman from 3 October to 29 November 1964. In November 1964, he was elected to the seven-person board of VLIK. He also contributed articles social-democratic Lithuanian press, including newspapers Keleivis (Traveler), Naujienos (News), magazines Darbas (Work) and Darbinink≈≥ balsas (Voice of Workers). In 1963, he published Teroro ir vergijos imperija soviet≈≥ Rusija (Soviet Russia, the Empire of Terror and Slavery) in which he calculated Lithuania's demographic losses of about 1 million people during World War II and post-war Soviet terror, described the Soviet Gulag system, and presented examples of living conditions of camps in Vorkuta and elsewhere. Bielinis died in 1965 in New York. On 30 May 1966, ashes of Bielinis and Steponas Kairys were buried at the Lithuanian National Cemetery in Chicago where a monument by architect was erected in 1979. Their urns were reburied at the Petra≈°i≈´nai Cemetery in Kaunas on 18 July 1996. ==References== Category:1883 births Category:1965 deaths Category:Social Democratic Party of Lithuania politicians Category:Members of the Seimas Category:Prisoners and detainees of Russia Category:Lithuanian emigrants to the United States Category:Lithuanian anti- communists ","title":"Kipras Bielinis"},{"id":"60314200","text":"Morro Peak is a small mountain summit located in Jasper National Park in Alberta, Canada.

At the age of four he suffered an injury to his spinal cord, and he spent the rest of his life in a wheelchair, retaining only the use of his hands and toes; nevertheless, he was able to paint at least seven watercolor portraits of his grandmother, Martha Atkins Barns, as well as a piece depicting three children and a dog adrift on an ice floe. All of the portraits share similar characteristics. Each depicts the subject in profile, wearing oval eyeglasses, a black long-sleeved dress, a shawl, and a white cap with black bow. She is either walking or sitting in a chair; often she is seen smoking a pipe or reading a Bible. Usually she is posed on top of some kind of mound. The purpose of the portraits is unknown; at least one was found inserted into a copy of her biography, Memoir of Mrs. Martha Barnes, as a frontispiece; the book was written by John Cookson, pastor of Middletown's First Baptist Church, and published in 1834. It has been posited that some may have been made as gifts for family members as well. Two of the portraits of Martha Barnes are currently owned by the Fenimore Art Museum.

Dunlap (September 2, 1898 ‚Äì July 7, 1977) was a librarian, bibliographer, and educator. Her research illuminated the scholarship of African Americans and the experience of African Americans in higher education, especially the groundbreaking publication of the Index to Selected Negro Publications Received in the Hallie Q. Brown Library. Her work as a founding member of the first African American library association, as well as within the American Library Association, championed the civil rights of black librarians in the United States. ==Early life and education== Mollie Ernestine Dunlap was born September 2, 1898 in Paducah, Kentucky, where she grew up. Dunlap studied English and elementary education at Wilberforce University, and received a bachelor's degree from Ohio State University in 1928. After receiving a Rosenwald Fund scholarship, she went on to study librarianship at the University of Michigan, earning a second bachelor's degree in 1931 and a Master of Library Science degree in 1932. From 1918 to 1923, Dunlap was an instructor at Wilberforce University. ==Work in libraries== Dunlap received an offer to become a librarian at the Winston-Salem Teachers College in 1925 and worked there until 1934. In 1934, she returned to Wilberforce as university librarian. At the 1947 founding of Central State College, Dunlap became the library director and guided the construction of the Hallie Q. Brown Memorial Library. She created and organized the African American collection there, becoming the university archivist in 1968. ==Service to the library community== Dunlap was a founding member and the first vice president of the North Carolina Negro Library Association, founded at Shaw University in April 1934; the organization was the first African American library association. The 1936 annual conference of the American Library Association was held in Richmond, Virginia, and caused an uproar among African American attendees when they were not permitted to reserve rooms at the conference hotel or attend meetings where meals were served. When ALA's response was merely to defend the organization against claims of wrongdoing, Dunlap was one of the voices calling for ALA to strive for \\"true principles of democracy\\". She served as a member of the Special Committee on Racial Discrimination, and helped draft the 1936 \\"resolution that led the ALA to take a radical stance on the equal treatment of black librarians.\\" ==Scholarship== Dunlap's research included the first study focused on the reading habits of black college students. She encouraged librarians to dedicate themselves \\"to providing libraries which are an unfailing source of pleasure and inspiration, as well as information.\\" In 1935, she published a study of \\"Special Collections of Negro Literature in the United States\\". Dunlap was assistant editor of the Negro College Quarterly from 1944 to 1947, where she published several bibliographical studies. Coauthored with Anne O'H. Williamson, her study \\"Institutions of Higher Learning among Negroes in the United States of America: a Compendium\\" was published in 1947, providing data that allowed for comparative analysis of those institutions. Dunlap continued her scholarship while working at Central State University, becoming one of the founding members of the Journal of Human Relations. As her role as a founding member of the Wilberforce, Ohio branch of the American Association of University Women, Dunlap wrote Despite Discrimination: Some Aspects of Negro Life in the United States in 1949. Her most significant work, the Index to Selected Negro Publications Received in the Hallie Q. Brown Library is an \\"indispensable reference tool\\" for those studying the African American experience. ==Legacy== Dunlap received the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the University of Michigan in 1976.

He attended St. Peter's Preparatory School in Jersey City, the University of Paris, Saint Peter's College in Jersey City, and Institut d'etudes politiques de Paris. During the Vietnam War, Hynes served a 30-month stint as an Army intelligence officer achieving the rank of First Lieutenant. While in Vietnam, he sought the Democratic nomination for a seat in the General Assembly from District 13-E, a narrow district that snaked through east-central Bergen County. After leaving the military, he began studying law at Fordham Law School. Whilst a student there, he narrowly won the November 1971 Assembly election by 57 votes. For the 1973 elections, redistricting in the state brought 40 legislative districts to the map, Hynes's home was placed in the new 38th district. One of the new boroughs in the district, Oradell, had an ordinance prohibiting political canvassing without registering by mail to the local police. Hynes challenged this ordinance on First Amendment grounds. After a series of varying rulings from state courts, his case was eventually heard by the Supreme Court of the United States (Hynes v. Mayor and Council of Oradell) where the court decided in a 7‚Äì1 vote that the ordinance was unconstitutional. In the election itself, Hynes was reelected alongside his Democratic running mate Paul Contillo who both defeated incumbent Republican Assemblyman Charles E. Reid and Ralph W. Chandless, Jr. In 1974, Hynes sought election to the U.S. House of Representatives from the 7th district. Hynes lost the Democratic primary to eventual general election winner Andrew Maguire. He did not seek a third term to the Assembly in 1975 and settled on pursuing a private law practice (after being admitted to the bar in 1974). In March 1978, Hynes was appointed by Governor Brendan Byrne to the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. In 1994, Hynes was the Democratic nominee for Bergen County Executive but lost to incumbent Republican Pat Schuber. From 2003 to 2010, Hynes was the executive director of the Bergen County Improvement Authority however just after retiring, investigations revealed missing receipts for reimbursements by Hynes. ==References== Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:People from Maywood, New Jersey Category:People from Teaneck, New Jersey Category:People from Upper Saddle River, New Jersey Category:American army personnel of the Vietnam War Category:Members of the New Jersey General Assembly Category:New Jersey Democrats Category:New Jersey lawyers Category:University of Paris alumni Category:St. Peter's Preparatory School alumni Category:Saint Peter's University Category:Fordham University School of Law alumni ","title":"Edward H.

Garcia is currently the public defender for the Los Angeles County Public Defender's office, the largest public defender's office in the United States. Garcia is Los Angeles County's eleventh Public Defender and LA County's first Latino Public Defender. Garcia has served as an adjunct professor at California Western School of Law and on the faculty at the Shechmeister Death Penalty College at Santa Clara University. == Early life & education == Garcia was born in Los Angeles and spent time in both the Mexico City and Los Angeles areas as a child. Both of his parents were born and raised in Mexico. Garcia graduated from Santa Monica High School. After high school, Garcia enrolled at the University of California, Santa Cruz, becoming the first person in his family to go to college. He graduated summa cum laude from the University of California Santa Cruz. He went on to attend UC Berkeley School of Law. == Legal career == === San Diego County Public Defender's Office === After law school, he started working in the San Diego County Public Defender's office in 1995. During his time in San Diego, Garcia worked for the alternate public defender's office and the multiple conflicts/major cases section. Garcia handled several high profile cases while in the San Diego County Public Defender's Office. He represented Nathaniel Gann who was accused of conspiring with his sister to kill her stepfather. Gann was ultimately convicted of murder and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. Garcia represented Jorge Rojas Lopez an alleged member of Los Palillos, a group operating within the Tijuana Cartel. In the case, the district attorney was seeking the death penalty. During the guilt phase, Rojas was convicted of several murders and kidnappings while the jury was deadlocked on several other murder counts against Rojas. During the penalty phase, the jury deadlocked on whether to impose the death penalty. After the hung jury, he ultimately pleaded guilty to unresolved counts in exchange for avoiding the death penalty. The trial lasted nearly fifteen months, making it the longest criminal jury trial in the history of San Diego County. === American Civil Liberties Union === From 2004 to 2006, Garcia served as the Criminal Justice Director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, where he was responsible for monitoring the consent decree with the Los Angeles Police Department as well as conditions within the L.A. County jails. === Los Angeles County Public Defender === In 2018, Garcia was selected by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to be the Public Defender for Los Angeles County. Since his appointment, Garcia has successfully advocated for the board of supervisors to end the use of pepper spray on kids in juvenile halls and probation camps. When California Governor Gavin Newsom imposed a moratorium on the death penalty, Garcia supported the move. He wrote: ‚ÄúThe governor‚Äôs decision brings California closer to ending the death penalty, a deeply flawed and racially biased system that fails to improve public safety.‚Äù == Awards == * Trial Lawyer of the Year by the San Diego Criminal Defense Bar Association (2015) * Dale Melvin Ray Memorial Award for Excellence in the Representation of the Indigent by San Diego County‚Äôs Department of the Alternate Public Defender == References == Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Criminal defense lawyers Category:Public defenders Category:UC Berkeley School of Law alumni Category:People from Los Angeles Category:Lawyers from Los Angeles Category:Activists for Hispanic and Latino American civil rights Category:Hispanic and Latino American politicians Category:University of California, Santa Cruz alumni Category:Living people ","title":"Ricardo Garc√≠a (attorney)"},{"id":"60314850","text":"The Carter House, in Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana near Hammond, Louisiana, was built around 1925.

In Greek mythology, Sarpedon ( or ; ), was a son of Zeus, who fought on the side of Troy in the Trojan War. Although in the Iliad, he was the son of Zeus and Laodamia, the daughter of Bellerophon, in the later standard tradition, he was the son of Zeus and Europa, and the brother of Minos and Rhadamanthus, while in other accounts the Sarpedon who fought at Troy was the grandson of the Sarpedon who was the brother of Minos.Hard, pp. 349-350. ==Cult== There was a temple of Sarpedon in Xanthos, in Lycia, perhaps associated with a supposed burial site there.Janko, p. 372; Rose, s.v. Sarpedon, p. 952; Smith, s.v. Sarpedon 2; Appian, The Civil Wars 4.10.78. There was also a temple and oracle of Apollo Sarpedonios and Artemis Sarpedonia at Seleuceia in Cilicia.Janko, p. 372; Renberg, p. 530; Strabo, 14.5.19; Diodorus Siculus, 32.10.2. According to Tertullian there was a shrine and oracle of Sarpedon in the Troad, although Tertuliian might have been confusing this for the oracle in Cilicia.Renberg, p. 530. There is evidence to suggest that Sarpedon was the subject of pre- Homeric non-Greek worship.Janko, p. 372; Rose, s.v. Sarpedon, p. 952. ==Mythology== ===Genealogy=== There were three separate traditions concerning the genealogy of Sarpedon the brother of Minos, and Sarpedon the Trojan War hero. In Homer's Iliad, Zeus had two sons by Europa, Minos and Rhadamanthus.Gantz, pp. 210, 211Iliad, 14.321-322 14. While Sarpedon, a Trojan ally from Lycia, was the son of Zeus and Laodamia, the daughter of Bellerophon and the Lycian princess Philonoe, with no apparent connection to Crete.Hard, p. 349; Gantz, pp. 211, 316; Homer, Iliad, 2.876-877, 6.191-199. However, in the standard classical tradition Sarpedon was instead the Cretan son of Zeus and Europa, and the brother of Minos. According to scholia to Iliad book 12, citing Hesiod and Bacchylides, Europa bore Zeus three sons on Crete, Minos, Sarpedon, and Rhadamanthus.Gantz, p. 210; Hesiod fr. 89 Most = Schol. D in Hom. Il. 12.397 = Hesiod fr. 140 Merkelbach-West = Bacchylides fr. 10 Snell- Machler. A fragment of the Hesiodic Catalogue of Women (preserved on a papyrus with many holes), mentions Europa's children by Zeus, and while only the name Rhadamanthus is preserved, there is sufficient room for the names Minos and Sarpedon, and the rest of the fragment appears to involve Sarpedon's exploits at Troy.Gantz, p. 210; Hesiod fr. 90 Most = P. Oxy. 1358 fr. 1 col. I; 6‚Äì13: P. Reinach 77 = Hesiod fr. 141 Merkelbach-West. A fragment of Aeschylus' Carians also has Sarpedon as the third son, after Minos and Rhadamanthus, of Zeus and Europa.Sommerstiein, pp. 110-111; Gantz, pp. 210-211; Aeschylus fr. 99. In the fragment, Sarpedon is off fighting at Troy, while Europa waits anxiously for word of his fate. This same geneaology appears in the Euripidean Rhesus.Euripides (?), Rhesus 29. See also Herodotus, 1.173.1-3. Having a Trojan War hero also be the brother of Minos, involves a genealogical difficulty, since Minos lived three generations before the Trojan War. In some accounts, Zeus granted his son Sarpedon the gift of long life. Such a gift is already suggested by the Hesiodic Catalogue fragment, and Apollodorus, perhaps drawing on the Catalogue, says that Zeus allowed his (and Europa's) son Sarpedon to live for three generations.Hard, p. 350; Apollodorus, 3.1.1-2. However, by other accounts, the Sarpedon who was the brother of Minos, and the Sarpedon who fought at Troy were different. Diodorus Siculus says that, according to Cretan myth, the Sarpedon who was the son of Zeus and Europa, and the brother with the brother of Minos and Rhadamanthus, had a son Euandrus who married De√Ødameia, the daughter of Bellerophon, and by her was the father of the Sarpedon who fought at Troy.Hard, p. 350; Diodorus Siculus, 5.78.1, 5.79.3. In Dictys Cretensis, Sarpedon is the son Xanthus and Laodamia,Dictys Cretensis, 2.11, p. 42. while in the Clementine Recognitions he is the son of Zeus and Hippodamia.Clementine Recognitions 10.21. ===Brother of Minos=== Sarpedon and his brothers Minos and Rhadamanthus, were adopted by the Cretan king Asterion or Asterius.Hard, p. 337. According to the scholia to Iliad book 12 (mentioned above) when Zeus brought Europa to Crete, he gave her as wife to Asterion, the king of Crete,Gantz, p. 210; Hesiod fr. 89 Most = Schol. D in Hom. Il. 12.397 = Hesiod fr. 140 Merkelbach-West. while the mythographers Diodorus Siculus and Apollodorus tells us that Europa married Asterius, who adopted her three sons Minos, Sarpedon and Rhadamanthus.Diodorus Siculus, 4.60.2-3; Apollodorus, 3.1.1-2. When they grew up, Sarpedon and Minos fought, Minos won, and Sarpedon was forced to flee his native Crete for Asia Minor, eventually ending up in Lycia.Hard, pp. 337, 350; Herodotus, 1.173.1-3; Diodorus Siculus, 5.79.3; Strabo, 12.8.5, 14.3.10; Apollodorus, 3.1.2; Pausanias, 7.3.7. As Herodotus tells us, Sarpedon and Minos fought for the Cretan throne, and Minos prevailed, driving out Sarpedon and his supporters (called the Termilae), who fled to a place controlled by the Milyans (then called the Solymi), that would later be called Lycia, after Lycus, the son of Pandion II, the legendary king of Athens.Hard, p. 350; Herodotus, 1.173.2. Compare with Strabo, 12.8.5. However, in another version of the story reported by Apollodorus, Minos fought Sarpedon over the love of the boy Miletus (or Atymnius, the son of Zeus and Cassiopeia). Again Minos was victorious, and Sarpedon fled (along with Miletus), this time to join Europa's brother Cilix, who was at war with the Lycians.Hard, p. 350; Apollodorus, 3.1.2. Cilix won the war, and Sarpedon became king of the Lycians. According to the fourth- century BC historian Ephorus, this Sarpedon was said to be the founder of the Carian city of Miletus (although in other accounts the boy Miletus is credited as founder).Unwin, p. 66; Grimal, s.v. Sarpedon 2, p. 412; Strabo, 12.8.5; 14.1.6 (= Ephorus FGrH 70 F 127). For Miletus as founder see, for example, Apollodorus, 3.1.2. As mentioned above, in the standard tradition, this Sarpedon was a leader of a Lycian contingent which fought alongside the Trojans in the Trojan War. Although according to Diodorus Siculus, this Sarpedon instead had a son Euandrus who was the father of the Sarpedon who fought at Troy.Hard, p. 350; Diodorus Siculus, 5.78.1, 5.79.3. ===Trojan War=== Sarpedon fought on the side of the Trojans, with his cousin Glaucus, during the Trojan War,Homer, Iliad, 2. 876 becoming one of Troy's greatest allies and heroes.The death of Sarpedon, depicted on the obverse of Euphronios krater also called the Sarpedon krater, c.515 BCE. He scolded Hector in the Iliad (Book 5, lines 471‚Äì492) claiming that he left all the hard fighting to the allies of Troy and not to the Trojans themselves, and made a point of saying that the Lycians had no reason to fight the Greeks, or no real reason to hate them, but because he was a faithful ally to Troy he would do so and fight his best anyway.5\\\\. 479-492 When the Trojans attacked the wall newly built by the Greeks, Sarpedon led his men (who also included Glaucus and Asteropaios) to the forefront of the battle and caused Ajax and Teucer to shift their attention from Hector's attack to that of Sarpedon's forces. He personally held up the battlements and was the first to enter the Greek encampment. This attack allowed Hector to break through the Greek wall. It was during this action that Sarpedon delivered a noblesse oblige speech to Glaucus,12.310-28 stating that they had been the most honoured kings, therefore they must now fight the most to repay that honour and prove themselves and repay their loyal subjects. While he was preparing to plunge into battle, he told Glaucus that together they would go on to glory: if they were successful, the glory would be their own; if not, the glory of whoever stopped them would be the greater. The death of Sarpedon, depicted in Lycian attire, at the hands of Patroclus. Red-figure hydria from Heraclea, c.400 BCE. ===Death=== Sarpedon carried away by Sleep and Death, by Henry Fuseli, 1803. When Patroclus entered the battle in the armour of Achilles, Sarpedon met him in combat. Zeus debated with himself whether to spare his son's life even though he was fated to die by the hand of Patroclus. He would have done so had Hera not reminded him that other gods' sons were fighting and dying and other gods' sons were fated to die as well. If Zeus should spare his son from his fate, another god might do the same; therefore Zeus let Sarpedon die while fighting Patroclus, but not before killing the only mortal horse of Achilles. During their fight, Zeus sent a shower of bloody raindrops over the Trojans' heads expressing the grief for the impending death of his son.16\\\\. 419-461 When Sarpedon fell, mortally wounded, he called on Glaucus to rescue his body and arms. Patroclus withdrew the spear he had embedded in Sarpedon, and as it left Sarpedon's body his spirit went with it.16\\\\. 477-505 A violent struggle ensued over the body of the fallen king. The Greeks succeeded in gaining his armour (which was later given as a prize in the funeral games for Patroclus), but Zeus had Phoebus Apollo rescue the corpse. Apollo took the corpse and cleaned it, then delivered it to Sleep (Hypnos) and Death (Thanatos), who took it back to Lycia for funeral honours.16\\\\. 667-684; see also Virgil, Aeneid, 1. 100 See: Iliad books: II, IV, XII, XVI. An asteroid is named after the Trojan hero, 2223 Sarpedon. ==References== ===Bibliography=== * Apollodorus, Apollodorus, The Library, with an English Translation by Sir James George Frazer, F.B.A., F.R.S. in 2 Volumes.

This has prompted tensions between Morocco and Syria, which has already gone declined since 1960s. Syria's close tie with Iran also gives impetus for the tensions, a fact which contributed to Syria's support to Polisario and Western Saharans against Morocco. Syria remains firmly on Western Sahara's tie, and has officially recognized SADR. ==Syrian Civil War== The Syrian Civil War has created divisions between two groups. The exiled Syrian opposition, backed by anti-Assad allies including Morocco, had been instrumental on voicing in favor to Morocco's integrity. Meanwhile, the Syrian Government led by Bashar al-Assad maintained its support for Polisario and Western Saharan cause. Algeria was thought to have sent its Polisario fighters to fight in Syria on behalf of Assad's request. And with the going end of the Syrian Civil War, and Assad's prevail, the relations would be expected to bear more fruits as Assad has remained firmly recognized to Western Saharan cause. ==References== Category:Bilateral relations of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic Category:Bilateral relations of Syria ","title":"Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic‚ÄìSyria relations"},{"id":"60314903","text":"Fabian Guerra (born May 18, 1995) is an American football wide receiver who is a free agent. He played college football at Fairmont State. Professionally, he was a member of the Carolina Cobras of the National Arena League (NAL) before joining the Memphis Express of the Alliance of American Football (AAF). He was also a member of the Columbus Destroyers of the Arena Football League (AFL) and the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League (CFL). ==Early life== The son of Fabian Guerra Sr. and Diana Benito, Guerra attended Christopher Columbus High School in Miami, where he played football and was on the track team. ==College career== Upon graduating high school, Fairmont State University offered Guerra an opportunity to play college football for the Fighting Falcons; FSU was the only school to make an offer. In his freshman year in 2013, he appeared in ten games (starting seven), during which he recorded 32 catches for 315 yards and two touchdowns. During his sophomore year, he had 63 receptions for 822 yards and five touchdowns; the receptions were the fourth-most in school history. In the season opener against Notre Dame College, he caught 13 passes for 247 yards and a touchdown, with the first two categories leading all receivers across the NCAA's divisions that week. During a 45‚Äì21 defeat to Concord, Guerra garnered media attention with a one-handed catch over two Concord defenders, a play that Fairmont State head coach Jason Woodman called \\"possibly the best he had ever seen\\"; the feat appeared on ESPN's SportsCenter program as one of the weekend's top ten plays. He was subsequently named first-team All-MEC, and was also a member of Beyond Sports Network's third-team All-Atlantic Region. In 2015, he had 62 catches, 819 yards (eighth most in FSU history), and six scores, including four games in which he recorded at least 100 receiving yards. Guerra was named second- team All-MEC for his season. Guerra's senior campaign saw the Fighting Falcons open the 2016 season 7‚Äì0, their best start since 1967, during which he set the school's all-time receptions record. Against Concord, he recorded three receiving touchdowns, his first game with multiple scores, in a Fairmont State 28‚Äì0 win; it was the Falcons' first win against the Mountain Lions since 2008. He was a member of the 2016 All-MEC Second Team. He ended his college career with 233 total catches, 2,805 receiving yards, and 20 touchdowns. The receptions were a Fairmont State record, while the yards and touchdowns ranked second and third in school history, respectively. ==Professional career== Unable to sign with a National Football League or Canadian Football League team, Guerra caught the attention of Billy Back, head coach of the National Arena League's Carolina Cobras, who noticed him on Twitter and remembered his catch against Concord. Guerra signed with the team in December 2017 ahead of the 2018 season. That year, he made 70 catches for 818 receiving yards and 16 touchdowns as the Cobras won the league championship. In October 2018, Guerra re-signed with the Cobras. However, on December 12, he announced his intention to join the Memphis Express of the Alliance of American Football on December 12. He eventually made the Express' final roster for the 2019 AAF season, becoming one of two Memphis players who attended an NCAA Division II school along with fellow receiver Reece Horn. In his first game, Guerra had just one reception for 11 yards in a shutout loss to the Birmingham Iron. He was released on March 8, and signed with the Columbus Destroyers of the Arena Football League (AFL) on March 11. He was re-signed by the Express on March 26, and subsequently placed on the league suspension list by the Destroyers. After the AAF suspended football operations, Guerra was activated from the league suspension list by the Destroyers on April 6, 2019. He was placed on the league suspension list again on April 8, and he signed a contract with the Carolina Cobras of the NAL on April 9. He was activated from the AFL league suspension list again on April 18, placed on the list again on April 25, and activated again on April 29. He was placed on the league suspension list again on July 18. Following the 2019 AFL season, Guerra was named co-Rookie of the Year on August 6, 2019. The AFL folded on November 27, 2019. Guerra signed a two-year contract with the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League on December 4, 2019. After the CFL canceled the 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Guerra chose to opt-out of his contract with the Alouettes on August 26, 2020. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Living people Category:1995 births Category:Sportspeople from Miami Category:American football wide receivers Category:Fairmont State Fighting Falcons football players Category:Carolina Cobras (NAL) players Category:Columbus Destroyers players Category:Memphis Express (American football) players Category:Montreal Alouettes players ","title":"Fabian Guerra"},{"id":"60314906","text":"The Yewell House, at 630 Clay St. in Owensboro, Kentucky, was built in 1894.

Balancing the bay window is a one-story wood porch with simple columns and spindles. This porch provides access to the main entrance to the residence. This porch is also topped by metal cresting. An interesting wall texture is created by brick corbelling that runs across the front, side and rear of the house creating a double-arched window on the second floor.

During these years, he had the patronage of the wood merchant, Laurent-Louis Borniche (1801-1883), who was also an avid art collector and creator of the Pavillon de l'Arsenal art museum. Geoffroy's career culminated with a gold medal at the Exposition Universelle (1900). In 1882, he received a major commission from the Ministry of National Education. In addition to paintings, he provided guidance on how images could be used in the classroom. He was named an Officer of Public Instruction two years later. In 1887, he was named a Chevalier in the Legion of Honor.Listing @ the Base L√©onore. Another commission for five murals was received in 1893, occasioning trips to Brittany and Algeria to gather material. He came to be a painter of children because, at the beginning of his career, he shared an apartment with two teachers, Louis and Julie Girard, above their private school. Years later, when they opened a boarding school, he took inspiration for his works there.

A number of locals were used as extras and for minor roles. Isaac's clearing was filmed in R√∏vassdalen, and other parts were filmed at Tver√•nes in Mo i Rana, and Hemnesberget and Korgen. A couple of Sami were also hired from the neighboring Swedish municipality of T√§rna. ==Rediscovery== For many years, the film was presumed lost. It then reappeared in several places. An American professor owned shortened edition, and it is believed that this 60-minute film was the version that was screened in the United States in 1928. A longer version surfaced in the Netherlands. These two copies were combined to create the version that was screened in 2009 during Hamsun Days. ==Cast== *Amund Rydland: Isak *Karen Poulsen: Inger (credited as Karen Thalbitzer) *Ragna Wettergreen: Oline *Gunnar Sommerfeldt: Geissler, the bailiff *Inge Sommerfeldt: Barbro *Almar Bj√∏rnefjell: Elesius, a young farmer *Sigurd Berg Bruland: Brede Olsen, a farmboy *Siljusson av Terna: Os-Anders *Sivert Eliassen.

La Constituci√≥n de 1949. Antecedentes y proyecciones. San Jos√©, Costa Rica: Editorial Costa Rica. ==History== After the Independence of Central America the Towns' Legates Junta (Junta de Legados de los Pueblos) took over temporary control of the then Province of Costa Rica. The Junta governed Costa Rica between November 12 and December 1, 1821 and was the first autonomous government body of the newly independent Costa Rica. It had its headquarters in Cartago and was presided over by the presbyter Nicol√°s Carrillo y Aguirre, exercising power temporarily in Costa Rica in all branches; Executive, Legislative, Judicial, Electoral and Constituent. On October 31, 1821, the Cartago City Council, which was the de facto capital of the country, invited the different populations of the Costa Rican to send legacies to the city to decide the destiny of the young nation. The Junta decides to separate Costa Rica from the Diputaci√≥n de Costa Rica y Nicaragua and draws up the Interim Fundamental Social Pact, better known as Pact of Concord, considered the country's first constitution. After this a Higher Governmental Junta is created whose president would rotate in each of the four constituent cities of Costa Rica; San Jos√©, Cartago, Heredia and Alajuela and would change president every three months. The discussion between the imperialists desiring to annex the country to the First Mexican Empire of Agust√≠n de Iturbide and that were majority in Cartago and Heredia and the republicans that wished full independence and that predominated in San Jos√© and Alajuela, took to the end of this system of government and the outbreak of the Ochomogo War. ==Enactment== On October 31, 1821, the City Council of Cartago invited those of the other populations of the Partido of Costa Rica to send to that city legates with broad powers, in order to decide the way forward to the declaration of absolute independence of Spain formulated on October 11 by the Provincial Delegation of the Province of Nicaragua and Costa Rica. On November 12 the Junta met in Cartago, presided by the Presbyter Nicol√°s Carrillo y Aguirre, and as the beginning of its sessions coincided with the resignation presented by the Subaltern Political Chief Juan Manuel de Ca√±as-Trujillo, the Junta assumed the Government of Costa Rica in all its branches. A few days later it was agreed to appoint a seven-member commission to draft a \\"Provisional Government Plan\\" that would serve as a \\"node of agreement\\" among all the represented populations. The Legates Junta assumed the character of a constituent assembly , although it did not use such a denomination. The Pact of Concord was signed in the City of Cartago. The drafting commission, in which there were representatives of different ideological tendencies, took as a basis of their work a project sent from Guatemala by the Costa Rican doctor Pablo de Alvarado y Bonilla, supporter of a liberal regime and determined adversary of the annexation to the established Mexican Empire by Don Agust√≠n de Iturbide. On December 1, 1821, the corresponding project was submitted to the Junta of Legates, which was discussed, reformed and approved on that same date, with the name of Interim Fundamental Social Pact or Covenant of Concord. The document came into force on a provisional basis, waiting to be sanctioned by a new assembly of bequests in January 1822. ==Content== In its original version, the constitutional text of 1821 had 58 articles, distributed in seven chapters. * Chapter I referred to the Province and expressed that Costa Rica was in absolute freedom and exclusive possession of its rights, that it would be dependent or confederate of another American State to which it agreed to adhere and that it recognized and respected civil liberty, property and other natural and legitimate rights of every person and of any people or nation. * Chapter II was about Religion and indicated that that of the Province was and always would be Catholic, to the exclusion of any other faith, although it indicated that if a foreigner of another creed arrived in Costa Rica for reasons of commerce or transit, it would not be bothered, unless if tried to proselytize. * Chapter III referred to citizens. In reaction to the racism of the Constitution of 1812, citizenship was attributed to all free natural men of the province or residents in it with five years of residence. The suspension or loss of citizens' rights would be governed by the provisions of the Charter of C√°diz. * Chapter IV dealt with the Government, which was entrusted to a provisional Governing Junta, made up of seven elected members. This system would last until Costa Rica decided to which State would adhere. * Chapter V regulated the election of the members of the government, which had to be carried out through the system of indirect universal suffrage in four grades used for the election of Deputies in the Constitution of 1812. It was also arranged that the party electors would discuss the Pact for eventual modify it and sanction it, and that its determination would be a fundamental interim law of the Province. * Chapter VI referred to the governing body, which was called the Superior Governing Junta of Costa Rica and had to reside three months a year in each of the four major towns of the province. * Chapter VII dealt with the restrictions of the Government, and indicated how to hold the Junta and its members accountable through a residence court. == Provisions and validity== When the Pact of Concord came into force provisionally on December 1, 1821, the sessions of the Junta were concluded and an interim Governmental Junta was inaugurated, presided over by the Presbyter Pedro Jos√© de Alvarado y Baeza. This Junta remained in office until January 6, 1822, the date that the Electors Junta met in Cartago, invested with constituent power and chaired by Rafael Barroeta y Castilla. In accordance with the provisions of several transitory articles of the Pact, the Voters' Junta discussed its text and on January 10 it decided to approve it with some reforms, the most significant of which was to constitutionally consecrate the conditional annexation of Costa Rica to the First Mexican Empire, by providing that Deputies would be sent to the Constituent Congress of Mexico and the Constitution issued would be accepted. However, it was also indicated that the Pact would continue to be observed while the Constitution of the Empire was under discussion, and that Costa Rica would accept the authorities and Constitution of the Empire once settled and after the Costa Rican delegation's demands were heard. The reformed Pact was sanctioned and in full force the same January 10, 1822. However, the town of Heredia, which was in favor of the unconditional annexation to the Mexican Empire, refused to accept it. As the authorities of Le√≥n, Nicaragua had agreed to the union with Mexico from October 11, 1821, Heredia decided to re-settle themselves under the jurisdiction of those and to separate from Costa Rica. As a consequence of the Heredian segregation, the three-month term established in the Pact for the Government to remain in each of the four major towns of the province was extended for one month to the benefit of Cartago, San Jos√© and Alajuela. ==References== Category:Constitutions of Costa Rica ","title":"Pact of Concord"},{"id":"60315145","text":"Karaagash () is a rural locality (a settlement) in Akhmatovsky Selsoviet, Narimanovsky District, Astrakhan Oblast, Russia.

McCourt is a former member of the Minnesota Governor's Council on Developmental Disabilities and the State Advisory Council on Mental Health, where he served as the chair of the State Subcommittee on Children's Mental Health. == Political activism == In 2015, McCourt founded the South Metro Chapter of the Minnesota Young Republicans Organization, which encompassed the southwestern suburbs of Minneapolis. McCourt served as the chapter's first Chairman. While running for City Council in Waconia, Minnesota, in 2016, McCourt faced criticism from his opponent in the local media for recently being released from the court ordered guardianship of his father, Craig McCourt. The story was picked up by the Minnesota Star Tribune, which resulted in McCourt being dubbed a trailblazer for the disabled. McCourt lost the City Council race to incumbent Charles Erickson, 1,462 to 1,121. Following his failed bid for Waconia City Council, McCourt was invited to New York City to address the United Nations in recognition of World Autism Awareness day. McCourt spoke on autonomy and the right to self-determination. After his return from New York City, Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton appointed McCourt to serve on the Minnesota Council on Developmental Disabilities. McCourt's appointment to the Council received supportive comments from David Durenberger, who served as the United States Senator from Minnesota from 1978 to 1995. McCourt's priorities on the Council include fostering self advocacy and probate law reform. In 2018, McCourt endorsed Dave Hutchinson for Hennepin County Sheriff. Later that year, McCourt publicly backed Judy Moe for the City of Richfield's third ward City Council seat. == Disability advocacy == McCourt has been a vocal advocate for improving access to services in rural Minnesota and strengthening parity laws. McCourt has also been an proponent for increasing access to public transit systems and increasing funding for autism research. In October 2017, McCourt was tackled by officers from the Chaska Police Department, while experiencing a personal crisis. After the incident, McCourt was critical of the department's policies on responding to individuals with autism and mental health diagnoses. In response to McCourt's criticism, the Chaska Police Department blocked him from their official social media pages. McCourt subsequently filed suit in United States District Court alleging that the Twitter ban violated the First Amendment. In May 2019, the Federal District Court ordered the City of Chaska to unblock McCourt on Twitter. McCourt was one of the keynote speakers at the 2018 Disability Day rally at the Minnesota State Capitol. He spoke on the importance of having self advocates engaged in the political process. In September 2018, McCourt filed suit against Carver County, the City of Chanhassen and the City of Norwood Young America alleging that their websites failed to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and violated the American with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. In 2019 in response to a report from the Center for Disease Control regarding rising prevalence rates of autism, Minnesota State Senator Jim Abeler created a legislative work group called the Minnesota Autism Council. McCourt was critical of Abeler's decision to appoint leaders of the anti-vaccine movement to the Council. McCourt has continued to be a vocal critic of the anti-vaccine movement and the Vaccine Safety Council of Minnesota. == Personal life == McCourt enjoys philosophy and classical logic.

This Congress confirmed Ram√≠rez as General Commander in Arms, imposed the seat of government in San Jos√© and promulgated the Second Political Statute of the Province that it officiated as a Constitution.

It is a spin-off of the original Vid Grid, which was released on the same year, and is it also the second entry in the franchise of the same name. In the game, the main objective of the players is to resolve and finish a jigsaw puzzle on time before the video clip that is being played on the background ends. Produced by series creator Norman Beil, Kid Vid Grid is mainly themed after cartoons and prominently features characters from animated series by Hanna-Barbera such as Huckleberry Hound and Snagglepuss unlike the original Vid Grid, which had a heavy emphasis on rock music combining multiple genres and subgenres. == Gameplay == Gameplay screenshot. : For further information about the gameplay, see: Gameplay of Vid Grid As with the original game, Kid Vid Grid is a tile-matching FMV puzzle game where the main objective of the players is to correctly reassemble the cartoon short on time before the video clip ends across five levels in total, each one featuring nine puzzles to be solved and they increase in both complexity and difficulty as players progress further, while an extra puzzle is unlocked after reaching the fourth level. Another source of difficulty are the videos themselves, as most of them feature various types of distractions within. Like the original title, scoring is based upon the level of complexity from puzzles and how long it took players to resolve said puzzles. During gameplay, the players have a variety of options to choose from such as solve or reset the puzzle, among other options. Unlike the original, however, the video clips last much longer and the first level consist of arranging 2x2 puzzles instead of 3x3 puzzles. After completing the puzzle, a small video clip is played as an award for the players. == Development and release == Kid Vid Grid was a joint effort between Geffen Records head of new media Norman Beil, who was also involved as producer of the original Vid Grid, and Jasmine Multimedia Publishing. The game launched in 1994 and it was an expansion of the original's concept but delving into children's shows instead of music videos. It was showcased to attendees of Winter Consumer Electronics Show in 1995. A conversion of Kid Vid Grid was developed and completed by High Voltage Software for the Atari Jaguar CD, but it went unreleased for unknown reasons. === List of shorts === All of the cartoon shorts featured in Kid Vid Grid are mainly from those created by Hanna-Barbera. The game also includes short clips from others shows as a reward to players for completing the puzzle in time: * 2 Stupid Dogs * Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines * Dino and Cavemouse * The Huckleberry Hound Show * Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinks * Snagglepuss == Legacy == In 1997, three years after its release, the game's trademark was abandoned. == References == Category:1994 video games Category:Cancelled Atari Jaguar games Category:Full motion video based games Category:High Voltage Software games Category:Interactive movie video games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Tile-matching video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video game spin- offs Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games ","title":"Kid Vid Grid"},{"id":"60315300","text":"Sinomonas tropicus is a Gram-positive bacterium from the genus of Sinomonas which has been isolated from the rhizosphere of a mangrove from Pramuka Island in Indonesia. ==References== Category:Actinomycetales Category:Bacteria described in 2015 ","title":"Serinibacter tropicus"},{"id":"60315310","text":"Rui Ramos may refer to: *Rui Ramos (athlete) (born 1930), Portuguese athlete *Rui Ramos (footballer) (born 1995), Portuguese footballer ","title":"Rui Ramos"},{"id":"60315315","text":"Heguri-uji no Iratsume (Âπ≥Áæ§Ê∞èÂ•≥ÈÉé) was a Japanese waka poet of the Nara period. == Poetry == Poems 3931‚Äì3942 of the Man'y≈çsh≈´ are attributed to her.

The Fundamental Law of the Free State of Costa Rica, sometimes called the Political Constitution of 1825, was issued on January 25, 1825 by the Constituent Congress of the State of Costa Rica and during a time the country was a formal member of the Federal Republic of Central America.Aguilar B., Aguilar √ìscar (1974). La Constituci√≥n de 1949. Antecedentes y proyecciones. San Jos√©, Costa Rica: Editorial Costa Rica. It would function until it was abrogated by Braulio Carrillo Colina who in 1838 takes power in a dictatorial manner and issues on March 8, 1841 the Decree of Basis and Guarantees that will operate as a de facto constitution until the arrival of Francisco Moraz√°n in 1844 who overthrew Carrillo and was temporarily restored. ==History== Costa Rica was one of the most disciplined member states of the Central American Federal Republic, following the mandates of the federal government, conducting the corresponding elections to elect federal offices, sending soldiers to swell the federal army and paying taxes. After the Bases were issued of Federal Constitution on the part of the National Constituent Assembly of Central America, instructions were given to the member countries to call local congresses and establish their state constitutions. This was done and the Fundamental Law of the State emanated from it. Braulio Carrillo, who had been Head of State resented the inaction of the Federal Republic before the annexation of Bocas del Toro in 1836 by Colombia and who had emerged victorious during the 1835 Costa Rican civil war that pitted the cities of San Jose, Alajuela, Heredia and Cartago, was candidate for re-election against the federalist candidate Manuel Aguilar Chac√≥n in the elections of 1837, Aguilar being a convinced supporter of the Federal Republic. Aguilar wins, but Carrillo makes a coup with the help of the Army, taking power just before the Central American Federation dissolves itself. ==Constituent Congress of the State of Costa Rica== The Constituent Congress of the State of Costa Rica of 1824-25 was the first Constituent Assembly convened in Costa Rica and author of the Fundamental Law of the Free State of Costa Rica. It was convened as part of the United Provinces of Central America newly independent from Spain. On May 5, 1824, the National Constituent Assembly of Central America issued the mandate to the member states to convene constituent congresses to establish their state constitutions. Previously, said Assembly had issued the Bases of Federal Constitution in 1823 and then the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Central America in 1824 and now it was up to the State of Costa Rica to designate its internal constitution as well as the laws necessary for the proper functioning of the young State, so that in addition to the Constituent prerogatives was given Legislative Branch powers. Naturally the Constitution should be federal and based on the foundations of the Central American Constitution, that is, could not contradict it. It consisted of ten members, its president was Nazario Toledo, his secretary Rafael Ram√≠rez and his assistant secretary Gordiano Paniagua. Juan Mora Fern√°ndez was Provisional Supreme Chief in this period, but he was not part of the Congress. The Congress also defined the country's flag and coat of arms. This Constitution was in force until it was repealed by Braulio Carrillo when he assumed power authoritatively in 1838. ==Content== It prescribed the third-grade vote (based on the C√°diz Constitution) in which male citizens elected second-degree electors in parochial elections, parishes elected other first-degree by department, and finally elected the authorities policies.Obreg√≥n Lor√≠a, Rafael (1966). El Poder Legislativo en Costa Rica. San Jos√©, Costa Rica: Asamblea Legislativa. It created the Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches, as well as a fourth branch, called the Conservative Branch, which exercised state control, something similar to the current Comptroller. It abolished the fueros to the military and the Church and drafted the rights of the citizen. It appointed the official name of Free State of Costa Rica and demanded that in order to be Head or Deputy Chief of State it would be required to be a Costa Rican by birth, a lay person, thirty years-old and owner of a property not less than one thousand pesos or an annual income of two hundred or be a professional of some science. It also prescribed a period of four years with consecutive reelection once. The Legislative Branch was unicameral and by popular election, called Congress, among its powers apart from that of legislating, it includes being the guardian of the Constitution, decreeing loans, commute sentences and pardon, receive the resignations of the members of the Supreme Powers and fix the territorial limits. ==References== Category:Constitutions of Costa Rica ","title":"Fundamental Law of the State of Costa Rica"},{"id":"60315358","text":"Rafael Albuquerque may refer to: *Rafael Albuquerque (artist) (born 1981), Brazilian comic artist *Rafael Albuquerque (footballer) (born 1992), Portuguese footballer == See also == *Rafael Alburquerque (born 1940), 38th Vice President of the Dominican Republic ","title":"Rafael Albuquerque"},{"id":"60315361","text":"Michael Derek Waterfield (born 1941) is a British biochemist and cancer biologist. ==Honours and awards== He was elected to the Royal Society in 1991, and awarded its Buchanan Medal in 2002 \\"for his exceptional skill in protein biochemistry which have transformed our understanding of signal transduction, and the subversion of cellular signalling pathways in cancer\\". ==References== Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Living people Category:1941 births ","title":"Michael Waterfield"},{"id":"60315381","text":"Tolumonas lignilytica is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming and mesophilic bacterium from the genus of Tolumonas which has been isolated from tropical rainforest soil. ==References== Category:Aeromonadales Category:Bacteria described in 2015 ","title":"Tolumonas lignilytica"},{"id":"60315405","text":"Chhong Bunnath (born 28 November 1998) is a Cambodian footballer who plays for Angkor Tiger in the Cambodian League and the Cambodia U-23. ==Club career== Bunnath made his senior debut in Cambodia League in 2018 For Soltilo Angkor. ==International career== Bunnath made his senior debut in 2020 AFC U-23 Championship qualification against Australia national under-23 soccer team on 22 March 2019. ==External links== * Chhong Bunnath at NationalFootballTeams Category:Living people Category:Cambodia international footballers Category:1998 births Category:Cambodian footballers Category:People from Siem Reap Province Category:Association football central defenders ","title":"Chhong Bunnath"},{"id":"60315422","text":"Self-portrait with Cap (1917) Market day in Torroella Francesc Gimeno i Arasa (4 February 1858, Tortosa - 22 November 1927, Barcelona) was a Catalan painter and graphic artist; best known for his landscapes, city scenes and self- portraits.Biography @ the Gran Enciclop√®dia Catalana ==Biography== After completing his primary education, in 1880, he moved to Barcelona, where he worked as a decorative painter in the studios of Manuel Marqu√©s (born c. 1840). At the same time, he and a few friends operated a small art academy.

In 1887, he moved to Torroella de Montgr√≠ and, two years later, settled on the Costa Brava, where he painted maritime scenes. In 1888, he received honorable mention at the Exposici√≥n Universal de Barcelona. Upon returning to Barcelona the following year, he shut himself up in an old decorator's studio and, for unknown reasons, refused to participate in the artistic community there. It was not until 1915 that, strongly urged by his friends, he held a small private exhibition at the . It was then that he reestablished contact with a childhood friend, Doctor , who became his patron. After that, he spent long periods at the Doctor's home in Sabadell, painting for a small group of local customers. He participated in a few exhibitions; notably in 1917 in Barcelona and 1920 in Begur. He created approximately 200 self-portraits, which bear little stylistic resemblance to his other works. He had a rough temperament, few friends and, despite some success, was usually mired in poverty.

The Political Constitution of Costa Rica of 1859 was issued on December 27.1 It was in force until November 1, 1868 and also, partially, from August to October of 1870.. The pronouncement of August 14, 1859 proclaimed Jos√© Mar√≠a Montealegre Fern√°ndez as Provisional President of the Republic. On the 23rd of that same month, Montealegre called for elections for a Constituent Assembly, which opened its sessions on October 16, 1859, under the presidency of former President Jos√© Mar√≠a Castro Madriz. On October 18, a commission to draft the Constitution, which proposed to take as a model the Constitution of 1844, despite the little happy experience lived with it. The Assembly devoted long hours to review the articles of 1844, but the work soon stalled and on November 8 it was decided to appoint another commission, which drafted a new project. This second commission worked diligently and on November 21 presented to the consideration of the constituent body the fruit of his labors, which was a sober and balanced document, inspired by democratic and liberal ideas and which sought to correct the many defects of form and substance of the 1848 Constitution. The Assembly discussed it with relative speed. Finally, on December 26, the Assembly approved the new Political Constitution, which was signed by President Montealegre the following day and published without delay. ==Content== The Political Constitution of 1859 consisted of 142 articles distributed in eleven titles. *Title I dealt with the Republic, declared that sovereignty resided in the nation and indicated the limits of Costa Rica. In this text it was established for the first time that the boundary with Nicaragua was defined by the Ca√±as-Jerez Treaty of 1858. *Title II dealt with the government, indicated its characteristics and enunciated the tripartite division of powers. *Title III referred to the Religion and said that the Catholic was that of the Republic, that it was protected by the Government and that it did not contribute with its revenues to the expenses of another worship. *Title IV referred to national and individual guarantees. The so-called national guarantees were certain principles and substantial foundations of the action of public power, such as the principles of constitutional supremacy, reserve of law in tax matters and subordination of military force to civil power. The individual guarantees were civil and political rights, which were listed in detail and breadth. The habeas corpus guarantee was established for the first time. *Title V contained the regulation of nationality and citizenship. *Title VI referred to suffrage, which was exercised through an indirect system in two degrees, the second of which was censitario. * Title VII regulated the Legislative Branch, which was bicameral. The Congress was divided into two Chambers, one of Senators and another of Representatives, which were renewed in halves every two years. Representatives were elected on a numerical basis and Senators were made up of two members from each province. The chambers had initiative and reciprocal sanction in the formation of the law, and the bills approved by both passed to the Executive, who could sanction or veto them. In the latter case, the project could be resealed by two thirds of votes of the cameras. In addition, these met as Congress to make certain specific decisions, such as declaring the result of the presidential elections, approving international treaties, suspending by three quarters of votes the constitutional order and appointing the Magistrates and two Appointed to the Presidency. These, elected annually, were intended to replace the President of the Republic in his temporary or absolute absences. * Title VIII was about the Executive Power. The Head of the Nation would be the President of the Republic, was elected for a period of three years, without the possibility of successive reelection. The President had the right of veto and retained the power to appoint and dismiss freely the Secretaries of State and the other employees of the Executive, but on the whole their powers were much lower than in the Reformed Constitution of 1848. To exercise the right of grace and to make diplomatic and consular appointments, the President required the agreement of the Council of State, which consisted of the Secretaries, and in addition to these functions discussed, deliberated and issued an opinion on the matters submitted by the chief executive. * Title IX referred to the Judiciary and regulated various aspects of the administration of justice. The Supreme Court of Justice would be formed by a Regent, five Magistrates and a Prosecutor, who should have the title of lawyer and were elected every four years by the Legislative Branch. * Title X was about the municipal regime. The country was divided into provinces, cantons and districts. In each province there would be a Governor appointed by the Executive branch, and in its capital a Municipality. * Title XII referred to the observance of the Constitution, the constitutional oath and the amendments to the fundamental Charter. At the beginning of its ordinary sessions, the Legislative branch had to examine whether the Constitution had been exactly observed and provide what was convenient to enforce the responsibility of the offenders.4 Every public official should swear to observe the Constitution and the laws. It was absolutely forbidden to reform the Constitution during its first four years of validity. After that term, in any of the chambers could be submitted a draft partial revision of the Constitution, signed by at least a third of the members present, and then had to be approved by two thirds of votes in each of the Chambers and by the absolute majority of the Congress. The project then went to the Executive, who after having heard the Council of State, presented it with its annual message to the Congress at the next ordinary meeting of the latter. The Congress then had to approve again the modification by two thirds of votes. For the general reform of the Constitution it was necessary to convene a Constituent Assembly, after the respective project followed the procedures of partial reform. ==General view== The Constitution of 1859 worked satisfactorily for several years, which contributed to the prohibition of the successive re-election of the President and the appropriate balance that was established between the Legislative and Executive branches, without the extremism of some previous texts, it was still considered one of the best Constitutions that had ruled in Costa Rica, and the Constituent Assembly of 1880 took it as a model for its work. ==References== Category:Constitutions of Costa Rica ","title":"Costa Rican Constitution of 1859"},{"id":"60315597","text":"Sin Sophanat (born 20 April 1997) is a Cambodian footballer who plays for Visakha in the Cambodian League. ==Club career== Sin Sophanat made his senior debut in Cambodia League on 16 March 2019 Vs Soltilo Angkor. ==International career== Sin Sophanat made his debut in 2020 AFC U-23 Championship qualification against Australia national under-23 soccer team on 22 March 2019. == External links == *Sin Sophanat at NationalFootballTeams Category:Living people Category:1997 births Category:Cambodian footballers Category:Cambodia international footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Sportspeople from Phnom Penh Category:Competitors at the 2019 Southeast Asian Games ","title":"Sin Sophanat"},{"id":"60315606","text":"Cellvibrio fibrivorans is a bacterium from the genus of Cellvibrio which has been isolated from soil from a Botanic garden in Ghent in Belgium. ==References== Category:Pseudomonadales Category:Bacteria described in 2003 ","title":"Cellvibrio fibrivorans"},{"id":"60315609","text":"Mirny () is a rural locality (a settlement) in Solyansky Selsoviet, Narimanovsky District, Astrakhan Oblast, Russia.

He established in 1791 in London the Vocal Concerts, a series of subscription concerts. ==Life== He was born in Westminster, son of Charles Knyvett and his wife Jane n√©e Jordan; he was descended from the family of Knyvet or Knyvett of Fundenhall, Norfolk. He was educated at Westminster School, and was a chorister at Westminster Abbey, under Benjamin Cooke. He was appointed in 1770 joint organist, with William Smethergell, of All Hallows-by- the-Tower. Possessing a fine alto voice, he was one of the chief singers at the Handel Commemoration of 1784, and he was appointed Gentleman of the Chapel Royal in 1786. In 1789, in partnership with Samuel Harrison, he directed a series of oratorio performances at Covent Garden. In 1791, again in partnership with Harrison, and with the additional assistance of his brother William, he established at Willis's Rooms the Vocal Concerts, which were successfully carried on for three years. He was appointed in 1796 organist of the Chapel Royal. In 1801, with the co-operation of his brother William, his son Charles, Thomas Greatorex and James Bartleman, he revived the Vocal Concerts at the Hanover Square Rooms, but in the following year he withdrew from the management. In 1808 he resigned his post of Gentleman of the Chapel Royal, and was succeeded by his son Charles. Knyvett was a member of the Royal Society of Musicians from 1778. He was for many years secretary to the Noblemen and Gentlemen's Catch Club, whose meetings were held at the Thatched House Tavern, St James's Street, and he was a frequent visitor at the meetings of the Madrigal Society. For one season he replaced Joah Bates as conductor at the Concerts of Antient Music. Knyvett died in Blandford Street, Pall Mall, on 19 January 1822. William Thomas Parke, in Musical Memoirs (ii, 236) wrote that he considered Knyvett \\"one of the best singers of glees\\", and \\"perhaps the best catch singer in England\\". ==Publications== He published in 1815 Six Airs harmonised for three and four voices; and also edited, in 1800, A Collection of favourite Glees, Catches, and Rounds presented by the Candidates for the Premiums given by the Prince of Wales in the year 1800. ==Personal life== He married in 1772 Rose Alleway, and they had three sons: Charles (1773‚Äì1852), a musician, from 1802 organist of St George's Hanover Square Church; William, a singer and composer; and Henry (1774‚Äì1843), who became an army officer. ==References== Attribution * ==External links== * Category:1752 births Category:1822 deaths Category:People educated at Westminster School, London Category:Gentlemen of the Chapel Royal Category:18th-century keyboardists Category:19th-century organists Category:18th-century English singers Category:19th-century English singers Category:19th-century male singers ","title":"Charles Knyvett"},{"id":"60315769","text":"Alfred J.

Main Magnetic Focus Ion Source (MaMFIS) is a compact ion source with extremely high electron current density. The device is designed for production of ions of arbitrary elements in any charge states, in particular, of highly charged ions of heavy elements. == Operation == Atomic ions are produced and confined in the local ion traps formed in crossovers of a rippled electron beam propagating in a drift tube. The electron beam is focused by a thick magnetic lens. In a sharp crossover, the electron current density can reach values, which significantly exceed that for the Brillouin focusing of laminar flow of electrons.Brillouin L., A theorem of Larmor and its importance for electrons in magnetic fields, Physical Review, 67, p. 260 (1945) DOI: 10.1103/PhysRev.67.260 The extraction of ions from the ion source can be realized in both axial and radial directions. Without the ion extraction, the MaMFIS is called the Main Magnetic Focus Ion Trap (MaMFIT) and serves as a source of characteristic radiation. The devices operate at room temperature due to the use of permanent magnets and standard vacuum techniques. == Applications == The MaMFIS can be employed as a tool for fundamental investigations in microplasma physics, surface physics, and atomic physics (e.g., for spectroscopy measurements, study of parity nonconservation in highly charged ions and search for variation of fundamental constants), as well as for technological applications (e.g., in single ion implantation and ion-beam lithography). An application of such ion sources is the charge breeding of short-lived radioactive isotopes. The deep ionization of electron shells allows one to eliminate the conversion decay channels, so that the life-time of nucleus can be increased by many orders of magnitude. In this case, the use of mass spectrometry become feasible. The extremely high electron current density realized in the MaMFIS results in very short ionization times and efficient production of highly charged ions of heavy elements. == References == Category:Ion source ","title":"Main Magnetic Focus Ion Source"},{"id":"60316074","text":"\\"Fire & Forgive\\" is a song by the German power metal group Powerwolf.

Carpenter was a native of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and was the eighth of eleven children of farmer Wayne M. Carpenter and his wife, Elizabeth R. Burkholder Carpenter; he was the fourth of seven boys, and was born on Cedar Hill Farm near Brownstown. He attended a one-room school and worked on the family farm with his siblings. In the spring of 1902 the Carpenters moved to Virginia, where Wayne had acquired 340 acres near Waverly for farming; he would later build a sawmill as well. On May 19, 1915, Miles Carpenter married Mary Elizabeth Stahl, of Carbon County, Pennsylvania, with whom he had a son. Around 1912 Miles, with financial assistance from his father, purchased a vacant factory which he soon began to operate as a lumber mill, producing finished wood for local builders. He operated a sawmill and made and sold ice, and for several years with a partner ran an open-air theater for the showing of films. From time to time he would tinker with pieces of wood, and in 1941, during a slow period of business, began whittling. His wife was greatly pleased by his first carving, a polar bear, and she encouraged him to carve more animals; the post-war building boom left him little time for further carving, but in the mid-1950s he closed his mill, suffering from the aftereffects of a number of accidents while operating machinery. Carpenter had resumed carving by the 1960s, when he began creating figures as a means of drawing attention to his roadside business. His wife died on November 5, 1966; he created the majority of his work after that date. His carvings became more ambitious, including life-size figures of people and animals as well as \\"root monsters\\", which he created from the roots of trees that he had found. He set these sculptures in the back of his pickup truck, which he parked by his stand, and which he drove around Waverly. Of particular note was a sculpture of a woman called \\"Lena Wood\\", who sat in the passenger seat. In creating his artwork Carpenter favored chisels, files, hatchets, pocketknives, and saws to manipulate the wood. Besides animal and human figures he produced works which commented on current events; he also depicted such celebrities as Elvis Presley and Charlie Chaplin. His work was discovered by students from Virginia Commonwealth University in 1972, and he began to receive attention from collectors of folk art, among them Herbert Waide Hemphill, Jr. He held one-man shows at Virginia Commonwealth University in 1974 and 1985 and in 1980 at the Yorktown Visitors Center; centennial retrospectives followed, at the Hand Workshop Art Center, in Richmond, and Radford University in 1989 and 1990, respectively. The artist was invited to the White House in 1981, and in 1982 published an autobiography, Cutting the Mustard. That same year the National Endowment for the Arts offered him a fellowship. Carpenter died in a hospital in Petersburg, Virginia and was buried in Waverly Cemetery. His home became the Miles B. Carpenter Museum, which was established in 1986; the museum complex also contains the First Peanut Museum. It displays the largest collection of Carpenter's work anywhere in the world, as well as his tools and other items related to his career. Seven sculptures by Carpenter are owned by the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Three works are in the collection of the American Folk Art Museum. Four pieces are held by the Milwaukee Art Museum.http://collection.mam.org/artist.php?id=892 Three sculptures, including the original carved watermelon he had made as a trade sign, are in the collection of the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum. ==References== Category:1889 births Category:1985 deaths Category:American male sculptors Category:20th-century American sculptors Category:20th-century male artists Category:20th-century American businesspeople Category:People from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania Category:Sculptors from Pennsylvania Category:Businesspeople from Pennsylvania Category:People from Waverly, Virginia Category:Sculptors from Virginia Category:Businesspeople from Virginia Category:Folk artists ","title":"Miles B.

The house was built in the 1830s as a private home and was purchased by Henry Smyser in the mid 19th century. Smyser-Bair House was owned by the Smyser-Bair family from the mid 19th century to 1979. The house was acquired by the Historical Society of York in 1979. It is part of the York Historical Walking Tour. ==History== Smyser-Bair House was constructed during the third decade of the 19th century and was purchased by Dr. Henry Smyser in the mid 1850s. Henry Smyser was a surgeon of German descent who used the house as his private home and office. Smyser was born in York Borough, on 8 December 1825, to Eliza and Michael Smyser. He attended University of Pennsylvania where he graduated in 1847. John Gibson, an American historian, stated in 1886 that Smyser was a representative of the first families of York County, Pennsylvania. Smyser was one of the original Forty-niners and has spent two years in California. He joined the Rocky Mountains migration and went on an expedition during the California Gold Rush where he stuck it rich. In 1855, Smyser signed up as a Surgeon Major in Russia during the Crimean War. For his service during wartime, Smyser was invited to Catherine Palace in Tsarskoye Selo, Russia by Alexander I of Russia. Smyser was one of the few Americans to set foot in Catherine Palace's Amber Room. There, he was presented with two medals by the Tsar. A year after Smyser's meeting at Amber Room, he purchased Smyser-Bair House. In 1860, Smyser married Emma Reiman, daughter of John Reiman. They had two children: Ella Nora and John Reiman Smyser. In 1862, Henry Smyser was enlisted in the War of the Rebellion, known today as the Civil War. Smyser was posted at a makeshift tent hospital in Penn Park, down the street from Smyser-Bair House, where he treated injured soldiers from the Battle of Gettysburg. During those times, Robert E. Lee, the commander of the Confederate States Army, visited Smyser- Bair House as a guest of Henry Smyser. Charles Dickens, an English writer, also visited Smyser-Bair House to meet Henry Smyser in the late 1860s. Portrait of Robert C. Bair Smyser's son, John Reiman Smyser, moved to Philadelphia where he became a pharmacist and his daughter, Ella, married Robert C. Bair, a lawyer and son of a local judge. Smyser-Bair House was passed on to Ella and Robert C. Bair after the death of Emma and Henry Smyser. Bair was involved in politics and served as the Director of Historical Society of York County. He also taught Sunday school at the Lutheran church near Smyser-Bair House. Ella and Robert Bair had one child, Smyser Henry Bair. Smyser Henry Bair, married Alma Quickel, a school teacher. The couple moved into Smyser-Bair House to live with Ella Bair after the death of Robert Bair. Smyser Henry Bair became the President of a local gas company. He replaced steam heating system of the house with natural gas heating system. The old steam heating system remains as a relic in the basement of Smyser-Bair House today. Smyser and Alma Bair had no children and Alma Bair was the last member of Smyser-Bair family to live in the Smyser-Bair House. Alma Bair lived in the house till her death in 1979. After Alma Bair's death, the house was left to the York's Historical Society. Smyser-Bair House remained under the possession of Historical Society until the King family purchased the house in the 1980s. Tom, Nancy, Bob and Hilda King restored the house to its original appearance during the Victorian era and opened the house for public as the Smyser-Bair House Bed and Breakfast. Between the 1980s and 2000s, Smyser-Bair House operated as a bed and breakfast. Smyser-Bair House was purchased by Pam Hartle of the Hartle family in the early 2000s and became their private residence until Nataliya and Eric D. Goodman purchased the house in 2007. The Goodman family owned and operated the Smyser-Bair House as The Historic York Inn/Smyser-Bair House from 2007 to 2019. The current owners, Colonel (Retired) Gary A. Robinson II and his wife Yeon Kyung Chung, continue to run the home as an extended stay inn as the York Inn (Smyser - Bair House Bed & Breakfast). The house has been featured on the HGTV series, If Walls Could Talk in the years 2007 and 2008. It has also been a subject of a dissertation at the University of Pennsylvania. In 2005, Smyser-Bair House was opened up for the victims of Hurricane Katrina. In 2008, Hillary Clinton visited the house during her Presidential Campaign.

The character is depicted as an evil deity, who created the weapon known as All- Black the Necrosword and the alien races known as the Klyntar and Exolons. The character would go on to play a more important role in the Marvel Universe. ==Publication history== The character was first introduced in Venom #3 (Aug 2018), giving a nod to a nameless being appearing in Thor: God of Thunder #6. The character would be mentioned in various issues of Web of Venom, Guardians of the Galaxy and \\"War of the Realms\\". After that, Knull was revealed to be the antagonist in Donny Cates‚Äô Silver Surfer: Black #1. ==Fictional character biography== Knull is a primordial deity, created when the First Firmament was shattered into pieces and forced to flee in terror, and was originally content to drift through the endless void of space created by the shattered pieces, until the Celestials arrived and began creating the 7th iteration of the Marvel Universe. Awakened by the \\"Light of the Creation\\" and outraged by his kingdom of darkness being despoiled, Knull retaliated by creating All-Black the Necrosword and killing one of the Celestials. Seeing this, the other Celestials banished Knull and the severed head deeper into the Void. He then used the head to forge the symbiote and combined it with the cosmic energies of the head, which would eventually become Knowhere. In doing so, he unintentionally gave the symbiote its weaknesses to sonic attacks and fire. He created a symbiote armor and, with All-Black, started killing the other deities, until he crash landed on an unnamed planet where Gorr took All-Black and incapacitated Knull.Thor God of Thunder #6. Marvel Comics. Knull eventually reawakened and discovered he could bond his living abyss to \\"lesser creatures\\" and control their new form as vessels. He created an army of symbiotes with himself in the center of the hive mind and uses them to spread over the universe, establishing the Symbiote Imperium and killing the light and creation in the process. He continued killing Gods, while also enslaving others whom he spared with the use of his abyss. At some point, he was approached by the time displaced Silver Surfer, who had been weakened after the Surfer had created a little star in order to free a world from Knull's control. After a brief fight, Knull was able to bond a symbiote to the Surfer, but the latter was saved by Ego, the Living Planet.Silver Surfer: Black #1-2. Marvel Comics When Knull reached the Surfer, he tried to defeat him and re- infect the Surfer with his abyss, but the Surfer, who had gathered the energy of the cosmos, creates a star which was enough to defeat Knull.Silver Surfer: Black #5. Marvel Comics. When one dragon-like symbiote composite arrived on medieval Earth to claim the planet as part of the Symbiote Imperium, Thor arrived in aid of the Viking villagers and defeated the dragon, which the villagers called \\"Grendel\\", causing the connection between Knull and the symbiote hivemind to break. The symbiotes that were scattered over the universe, now free from Knull's control, began bonding to benevolent hosts and learning about the Light. The Symbiotes rebelled against their god and trapped him inside an artificial planet formed of thousands of symbiotes, which they called Klyntar ‚Äî \\"cage\\" in their language.Venom Vol. 4 #4. Marvel Comics. After thousands of years, S.H.I.E.L.D. discovered the body of the Grendel and bound the pieces of the dragon to soldiers in order to create Super-Soldiers to fight in the Vietnam War. The procedure was dubbed the Sym-Soldier program. This reawakened Knull, allowing him to take control of the Sym-soldiers who went rogue before being captured by Nick Fury and Logan, except one piece, named Rex, which escaped Knull's control.Web of Venom Ve'nam #1. Marvel Comics. Years later, Eddie Brock (Venom) unknowingly freed the dragon and, after a battle against Eddie and Spider-Man, the dragon began searching for Rex in order to free Knull.Venom Vol. 4 #1-3. Marvel Comics. However, Venom merged with Rex and eventually trapped the Grendel in a blast furnace, incinerating it and Rex both.Venom Vol. 4 #5-6. Marvel Comics. Afterward, the Maker and Project Oversight retrieve the Grendel's codex from the furnace.Venom Vol. 4 #7. Marvel Comics. In Carnage Born, after Scorn formed a cult worshiping Knull, they stole the codices of Grendel and Cletus' damaged body and, after implanting the codices inside Cletus, the Carnage symbiote's codex is absorbed by Grendel, causing Grendel to become god-like. After the contact with Knull, Cletus decided to free Knull by collecting every codex of every host who had at some point bonded to symbiotes in order to overload the symbiote hive mind and scatter the Klyntar.Web of Venom Carnage Born #1. Marvel Comics. It's also revealed that Knull had created the Exolons‚Äîparasites that attach to a host while feeding on their soul. Zak-Del, whose body houses Exolon, plans to find Knull in order for the latter to remove the parasite from him.Guardians of Galaxy Vol 5 #3. Marvel Comics. After Cletus reunited with Doppelganger and Shriek, they reformed the cult dedicated in worshiping Knull and returned to Doverton, Colorado, where they got the codices from the citizens and animals who were infected by Carnage during Carnage USA.Web of Venom Cult of Carnage #1. Marvel Comics. During \\"Absolute Carnage\\", as Carnage grew stronger, so did the connection between Knull and the symbiotes, as witnessed when Phage, Agony, Lasher, Riot and Scream also became corrupt.Absolute Carnage: Separation Anxiety #1. Marvel ComicsAbsolute Carnage: Scream #1. Marvel Comics Knull was finally reawakened after Dark Carnage tricked Eddie into killing him after claiming the remaining codices. Knull promptly destroyed Klyntar and, manifesting a suit of draconic armor and coalescing its constituent symbiotes into a fleet of symbiote-dragons, resumes his campaign against the light all the while journeying to EarthAbsolute Carnage #5, using his living abyss to claim entire planets to his causeIncoming #1, while haunting Eddie Brock with pointed nightmaresVenom #21 and briefly imposed his influence over Dylan Brock to ensure that he would pledge allegiance to the Symbiote Imperium.Venom #22Web of Venom: The Good Son #1 ==Powers and abilities== Knull is a primordial deity, having super strength, agility, immortality and healing factor. He possesses Supreme Umbrakinesis, as he can manifest darkness to create weapons and creatures, whom he calls the \\"Living Abyss\\", which he can control and also augment their power which allowed Venom to unlock new abilities and also allowed one of Knull's dragon to be unaffected by the symbiotes' classic weaknesses and to be as fast as the Silver Surfer. He also possesses limited shapeshifting ability, including the ability to turn his human-like mouth into fanged jaws with an elongated tongue ‚Äî this feature was passed on to the symbiotes. He's also an expert combatant, utilizing All-Black to kill Celestials and other gods, while wearing an armor made from symbiote with a red dragon and spiral emblem, which was based on Spiral of Carcosa from the True Detective.

He appears in the promo \\"The Secret Story of Venom\\", where Venom explains to his latest host about the symbiotes' origins as the Klyntar, living weapons used by Knull to wage a crusade against the Celestials, the first four being the Symbiote Sisters: All-Black, Scream, Scorn, and Mania. Despite their victories, Knull eventually abandoned the Sisters, no longer deeming them useful. In rage, the Sisters eventually found themselves crash-landing on a world, and replicated into several spawn to bond with the inhabitants in a bid for a harmonic purpose in life. However, the wisest of these people alone understood the danger the symbiotes posed, and rejected them, killing All-Black. Scream, Scorn, and Mania would use All-Black's remains to give birth to Venom, making him their prophet and champion, sending him across the universe from planet to planet to make it easier for them to enslave. == Reception == In his early appearance, the character was received well, with Comic Book Resources drawing comparison with two other Marvel Villains: Morlun and Dracula. Bleeding Cool stated about the history that \\"It‚Äôs an engaging new story, and it redefines the symbiotes for the Marvel Universe.\\" He was ranked at the number one in IGN's list of Marvel's Most Powerful Symbiotes. The character received special attention in Sweden and Norway due to the word \\"knull\\" being the noun form of \\"fuck\\" (referring to copulation) in Swedish and Norwegian. However, CBR later on criticized the character's design as being unoriginal and similar to most other villains, and not matching his nature, saying that the character would have been better if he would have been more similar to his creation. ==ReferencesKnull at Villains Wiki * Knull at Comic Vine * Knull at Comic Book Database * Knull: Everything You Need to Know About Marvel's Symbiote God at CBR Category:Comics characters introduced in 2018 Category:Characters created by Jason Aaron Category:Male characters in comics Category:Extraterrestrial supervillains Category:Fictional dictators Category:Fictional mass murderers Category:Fictional characters with slowed ageing Category:Fictional characters with immortality Category:Fictional characters who can manipulate darkness or shadows Category:Fictional warlords Category:Marvel Comics aliens Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength Category:Marvel Comics characters who have mental powers Category:Marvel Comics characters with accelerated healing Category:Marvel Comics deities Category:Marvel Comics Elder Gods Category:Marvel Comics supervillains Category:Venom (Marvel Comics) Category:Fictional male deities ","title":"Knull (character)"},{"id":"60316332","text":"The 1983‚Äì84 Idaho Vandals men's basketball team represented the University of Idaho during the 1983‚Äì84 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.

It is mostly of interest for the study of infinite groups. Special cases of groups with finiteness properties are finitely generated and finitely presented groups. == Topological finiteness properties == Given an integer n ‚â• 1, a group \\\\Gamma is said to be of type Fn if there exists an aspherical CW-complex whose fundamental group is isomorphic to \\\\Gamma (a classifying space for \\\\Gamma) and whose n-skeleton is finite. A group is said to be of type F‚àû if it is of type Fn for every n. It is of type F if there exists a finite aspherical CW-complex of which it is the fundamental group. For small values of n these conditions have more classical interpretations: * a group is of type F1 if and only if it is finitely generated (the Cayley graph is the finite 1-skeleton of a classifying space); * a group is of type F2 if and only if it is finitely presented (using the Cayley complex instead of the Cayley graph). It is known that for every n ‚â• 1 there are groups of type Fn which are not of type Fn+1. Finite groups are of type F‚àû but not of type F. Thompson's group F is an example of a torsion-free group which is of type F‚àû but not of type F. A reformulation of the Fn property is that a group has it if and only if it acts properly discontinuously, freely and cocompactly on a CW-complex whose homotopy groups \\\\pi_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\pi_n vanish. Another finiteness property can be formulated by replacing homotopy with homology: a group is said to be of type FHn if it acts as above on a CW-complex whose n first homology groups vanish. == Algebraic finiteness properties == Let \\\\Gamma be a group and \\\\mathbb Z\\\\Gamma its group ring. The group \\\\Gamma is said to be of type FPn if there exists a resolution of the trivial \\\\mathbb Z\\\\Gamma-module \\\\mathbb Z such that the n first terms are finitely generated projective \\\\mathbb Z\\\\Gamma-modules. The types FP‚àû and FP are defined in the obvious way. The same statement with projective modules replaced by free modules defines the classes FLn for n ‚â• 1, FL‚àû and FL. It is also possible to define classes FPn(R) and FLn(R) for any commutative ring R, by replacing the group ring \\\\mathbb Z\\\\Gamma by R\\\\Gamma in the definitions above. Either of the conditions Fn or FHn imply FPn and FLn (over any commutative ring). A group is of type FP1 if and only if it is finitely generated, but for any n ‚â• 2 there exists groups which are of type FPn but not Fn. == Group cohomology == If a group is of type FPn then its cohomology groups H^i(\\\\Gamma) are finitely generated for 0 \\\\le i \\\\le n. If it is of type FP then it is of finite cohomological dimension. Thus finiteness properties play an important role in the cohomology theory of groups. == Examples == === Finite groups === A finite group G acts freely on the unit sphere in \\\\mathbb R^{\\\\mathbb N}, preserving a CW-complex structure with finitely many cells in each dimension. Since this unit sphere is contractible, every finite group is of type F‚àû. A non-trivial finite group is never of type F because it has infinite cohomological dimension. This also implies that a group with a non- trivial torsion subgroup is never of type F. === Nilpotent groups === If \\\\Gamma is a torsion-free, finitely generated nilpotent group then it is of type F. === Geometric conditions for finiteness properties === Negatively curved groups (hyperbolic or CAT(0) groups) are always of type F‚àû. Such a group is of type F if and only if it is torsion-free. As an example, cocompact S-arithmetic groups in algebraic groups over number fields are of type F‚àû. The Borel-Serre compactification shows that this is also the case for non- cocompact arithmetic groups. Arithmetic groups over function fields have very different finiteness properties: if \\\\Gamma is an arithmetic group in a simple algebraic group of rank r over a global function field (such as \\\\mathbb F_q(t)) then it is of type Fr but not of type Fr+1. == Notes == == References == * * Category:Group theory Category:Homological algebra Category:Geometric group theory ","title":"Finiteness properties of groups"},{"id":"60316353","text":"Roger Mostyn (born 31 August 1953) is a Welsh former professional footballer who played as a forward.

It is historical fiction set in mid-20th century England. == Background == The novel is loosely based on the life story of the author's grandmother - Miss Hargreaves. Malik had been told that her grandmother died young, and knew nothing of her until well into adulthood. What her mother eventually told her was that Rene Hargreaves did not die, but rather left her husband and three children in Manchester, sometime around the beginning of World War II. She became a Land Girl, and worked for a woman farmer. The two women became close, and continued living together the rest of their lives. Though Malik's mother never saw Rene again, she knew that she had been tried for the murder of her lodger in the early 1960s. Malik began investigating this woman she never knew of, and was both tantalized and disturbed by what she found. Rene Hargreaves had badly breached the gender rules of her time. She rejected her life as a wife and as a mother, and traded her old life for a much harder existence. Malik was convinced that her life companion Elsie Boston was the key, but reliable information was hard to come by. Notes from the murder investigation and court testimony gave some insight to their life and daily routines, and other personal characteristics, such as manner of speech. As much as she discovered details in her research, Malik felt that she was getting no closer to figuring out \\"the two Renes\\" - the one who was a city girl who married and had children, and the one who led a subsistence-level life with another woman, far from sight. That was when she decided to write a novel about her life, and fill in the gaps herself. == Plot summary == One day in 1940 Rene Hargreaves walks out on her family and the city of Manchester, to take a position as a Land Girl at the remote Starlight farm. There she lives and works for farmer Elsie Boston, a sole smallholder in Berkshire, thought of by the locals as irredeemably strange or ‚Äòunked‚Äô. Elsie's family is all gone, and she is trying to hold on to the farm herself. At first Elsie and Rene are unsure of one another - strangers from different worlds. But over time they each come to depend on the other. When Elsie is forced off the farm, the two stay together, becoming itinerant workers on various farms, where their only condition is that they have a private place to live together. Twenty years later, they are living in Cornwall, in a remote cottage. Elsie takes care of the home and grows vegetables, while Rene goes far abroad to find farm work. Rene learns of the death of Bertha, the only person from her past with whom she remained in touch. She and Elsie take in Bertha‚Äôs ageing, alcoholic husband who sets about disrupting their life. When Ernest finally dies it might almost seem a cause for celebration but then the police arrive. Rene is accused of killing him, and stands trial. Elsie, still naive and shy though no longer young, is required to stand on her own for the first time, in a strange city, and she is unable to believe she might lose Rene, who is ultimately convicted. == Reception == The novel was included in the \\"We Love\\" section of the Sunday Telegraphs Stella magazine. The Sunday Times review called it \\"an unflamboyantly effective tale... this is a surprisingly moving account of hidden lives forced out of the shadows.\\" It was a Red, Prima and Good Housekeeping magazines, April selection. It was shortlisted for the Walter Scott Prize, whose judges said it is: \\"Quietly beautiful and brilliant. This is no bucolic idyll but an unfolding of a plot that constantly twists and turns and surprises.

The Palembang pitis was a currency issued by the Palembang Sultanate from the year 1659 under the reign of Sultan Abdulrrahman Khaifatul Mukminin Sayidul Imam until the sultanate was dissolved by the Dutch in 1823 and the territory was fully integrated into the Dutch East Indies. Official issues had to be approved by the sultan of Palembang, Most pitis had an inscription like al Sultan fi balad Palembang sanat [date] (the sultan of Palembang year [date]) written in Malay but none actually featured the name of the ruling sultan meaning that pitis coins can only be dated using the Islamic calendar (which began in 622 AD with Mohammad‚Äôs Hijra using \\"AH\\" [\\"Anno Hegirae\\"/\\"After Hijra\\"] dates). However in many cases the production was outsourced to the local Chinese population, who did not use Arabic script but Traditional Chinese characters and also used Chinese production technology to manufacture pitis coins. Generally speaking most Palembang pitis were made from tin alloyed with lead (except for a single bronze issue), the pitis coins of Palembang could be divided into two categories based on the fact if they were holed or not, the holed ones were known as pitis teboh and the coins without a hole were known as pitis buntu (or pitis bountou). The pitis teboh were strung together like Chinese cash coins which had already been circulating in the archipelago while the non- holed coins were packaged in leaves to form a box known as a kupat. The value of the pitis was based on both the Spanish dollar and the VOC duiten. The pitis teboh were strung together in strings of 500 coins on rotan and a string was referred to as a chuchub, while the pitis buntu were packaged per 250 coins in a kupat. During the colonial era a kupat was worth 20 duiten or Spanish dollar while a chuchub was worth 40 duiten or Spanish dollar.De Munten van Nederlandsch Indi√´ by Netscher and Van der Chijs (in Dutch). The value of the units of the pitis was also dependent on the actual size of the coins, with the standard size of the pitis teboh being around fifteen millimeters. However as most pitis coins were either in a box of leaves or strung together very tightly most traders couldn't see the coins and their value was very much dependent on an act of trust. This explains why some unofficially produced pitis coins were very crude (and even why some were actually made without features), this is as small low value coins within strings or boxes of leaves would not have been examined too carefully by those handling them. == Manufacture == The pitis teboh were cast in the same way as Chinese cash coins being molten into \\"coin trees\\"and then the individual pitis teboh coins were broken off the trunks. Because of this it is quite common today to find a remnant of the original stem that attached the pitis teboh coin to the trunk. The quality of these pitis coins of often high while those of inferior qualities aren‚Äôt that hard to find. It seems the degree of care employed in the manufacture of pitis teboh coins varied greatly. (There are often \\"wood- grain\\"-like striations found on them, which is probably due to deteriorated moulds and may also be due to incomplete flans). Many pitis coins, too, were \\"unofficial\\" (illegally cast by counterfeiters), with their quality even more problematic than the government made ones. H.C. Millies talks of pitis coins being produced privately with the permission of the sultan, but also mentions hands being cut off for unauthorized enterprise. == See also == * Brunei pitis == References == == Sources == * Recherches sur les monnaies des indig√®nes de l'archipel Indien et de la p√®ninsule Malaie by Henricus Christiaan Millies, 1871 (in French).

Symbolic language in art may be used figuratively, to reference ideas and \\"convey concepts in terms of images\\", as when images and positioning of objects such as flowers or animals are used to signify cultural concepts. . Symbolic language in art may be used more literally, as in floriography, where arrangements of flowers are decoded with the help of special dictionaries, enabling communication of secret, unspoken information as a form of cryptography. Similarly, in religious iconography, symbolic languages may be developed to communicate between believers in a hostile environment, with progressive teachings providing increasing access to hidden meanings in the images. ==See also== *Icon *Ineffability *Petroglyph *Saint symbolism *Semiotics *Symbolic language (other) *Symbolism (arts) *Yerkish lexigrams ==References== ==External links== *Bach's Symbolic Language - JSTOR *Beyond Words: The Symbolic Logic of Plants - Delaware Art Museum *In Defense of Symbolic Aesthetics - JSTOR *The Language of Flowers - Philadelphia Museum of Art *Saints, Signs, and Symbols: The Symbolic Language of Christian Art *The Symbolical Language of Ancient Art and Mythology: An Inquiry - Cornell University Category:Iconography Category:Language Category:Visual arts ","title":"Symbolic language (art)"},{"id":"60316933","text":"The French Congo worm lizard (Cynisca bifrontalis) is a worm lizard species in the family Amphisbaenidae.

It aired in the United States on Fox on November 17, 2019. The writer was Brian Kelley, director was Timothy Bailey. ==Plot== While Marge picks up Bart from a sleepover at the Van Houten house, Luann invites the Simpson family to their annual trip to Costa Rica. Marge hurries home to propose the trip and the family quickly accepts. Lisa overhears Homer and Marge as they discuss how expensive the trip will get and quickly becomes worried at the cost herself. At the airport, the Simpsons meet with the Van Houten family, the Hibbert family, Chalmers and his daughter Shauna, and Patty and her new girlfriend Evelyn, to go on the vacation. Though Homer tries to be nice to Evelyn for Patty's sake, Evelyn openly disparages him after what she heard about him from Patty. After arriving in Costa Rica, Lisa gets more worried by the expenses of the journey. Meanwhile Kirk keeps track of all expenses upfront and will split the checks at the end. At dinner at the Van Houten vacation home, Homer and Evelyn quickly discover they have a lot in common. The next morning, Homer and Evelyn stay at the beach while the rest of the guests shop. However, the group come back to find the two drunk and sunburned, having let in monkeys who have trashed the entire place. Marge is furious at Homer, and makes him promise to behave for the rest of the trip so she can get the perfect photo of them of their vacation. Homer and Marge snap the perfect photo of their vacation at a waterfall, but the wave from Evelyn splashing knocks the phone into the water. At dinner, Patty blames a depressed Marge for making Homer reduce her girlfriend to his level. Marge points out how Evelyn ruined everything for her and is a bad influence on Homer because she acts just like him, telling Patty she is \\"dating a Homer\\". Patty is horrified and abruptly breaks up with Evelyn that night. Bart finds Lisa upset and she reveals to him her financial concerns, so Bart suggests they show their parents the expenses in Kirk's book. They sneak into the master bedroom to look for the evidence. Underneath the bed they find what Lisa believes to be rare priceless artifacts. Lisa tries to expose the stones the Van Houtens are selling back home to pay for their vacation every year at dinner, but Kirk tells her off, pointing out that they are just salt and pepper holders: they were meant to be a gift for the families. The next morning, the Simpsons decide to leave the trip and are quickly given their bill by Kirk. In revenge for Kirk charging them extra for ruining the trip, the family sneak back into the bedroom to take the salt and pepper holders but inadvertently discover a painting of the explorer Kirkedemious Van Houten, who built the house the Van Houtens own, and confront the Van Houtens for making people pay for the trip with their own money while they get the house for free. In the middle of the commotion, Marge has a heart to heart with Patty, apologizing for causing her break-up with Evelyn. She tells Patty that while Homer hates her, Evelyn loves her more than anything else in the world. Patty then agrees to reconcile with Evelyn. Kirk bitterly refunds the families their money back so they can live the vacation like they intended to. Homer wants to go back to the waterfall to retake the perfect photo of him and Marge, but she convinces him that their vacation is not about being perfect, it is about living in the moment, just as a reconciled Patty and Evelyn kiss on the zipline. ==Reception== Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave this episode three stars out of five. Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave this episode a B+, stating \\"'Livin La Pura Vida' is one of the better recent excursions, though, credited writer Brian Kelley steering the family‚Äôs group vacation to the Van Houten‚Äôs favorite getaway spot in Costa Rica around the sub-genre‚Äôs worst pitfalls, while managing to tell a coherent story from beginning to end.

This episode introduced Grey Griffin as Sherri and Terri and Martin Prince following the death of Russi Taylor on July 26, 2019. ==Plot== At Springfield Elementary, the children perform dramatic scenes that they wrote themselves, based on TV shows and YouTube videos. Near the end, Lisa performs a scene based on her family, starring herself along with Database (as Bart), Ralph (as Homer), Sam (as Marge), and Kearney (as Maggie). This makes her family feel uncomfortable on how people see them from outside; in particular Marge for being perceived as boring. To change these perceptions, Marge tries to do a funny sermon at the First Church of Springfield, but fails. Going back home, a lighting hits a tree making the trunk fall on top of the car. The next day, Homer starts chopping down the trunk but soon goes to sleep on his hammock, so Marge starts chopping it herself. Patty invites her lumberjill friend Paula to watch her doing the job; Paula proceeds to coach Marge and invites her to become a lumberjill in the woods. Marge eventually takes up timbersports, and takes part in a team with Paula in the Springfield Timbersports Pro-am, which they win against other men. At this moment, Patty tells Homer that Paula is a lesbian; making Homer fear that Paula will try to steal Marge away from him. Paula eventually asks Marge to become her partner by training for a month in Portland, Oregon and she accepts, amplifying Homer's concerns. One month later, Homer and the kids go to Portland to bring her back, but find her getting acquainted in the house with Paula and unsure of coming back the next day after the competition, the Grizzly Timbersports Northwest Championship. They win and Paula tells Homer that she is not romantically interested in Marge; she has a wife who is a ribbon dancer in the Olympics and they have a child of their own. She also assures Homer that she and Marge are just good friends and that Marge is welcome to come back to train with her anytime. Grateful, Homer offers his sperm to her if she decides to have another kid, to which she promises to think about it. She then coaches Homer to offer to give Marge a ride home to Springfield. In the final scene, Homer buys Maggie a toy chainsaw so she could develop an interest in lumberjacking in the future. However, she gets scared by it as soon as she tries it. ==Reception== Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode 2 and a half out of 5 stars. Dennis Perkins of The A.V.

It was established in 1914 in the birthplace of the Low German poet Klaus Groth (1819-1899). After the city of Heide purchased the dilapidated house, it was renovated while striving to preserve the original look of the gable house that was built in 1796 by Groth‚Äôs grandfather. Amongst other things, the room Klaus Groth was born in was reconstructed. A drawing by painter Otto Speckter from 1853 served as orientation. Citizens of Heide donated furniture and books to re-equip the interior. Despite being devoted to the life and work of Klaus Groth, the museum also gives an insight into the everyday-life of a miller‚Äôs household in the 19th century, a trade Groth‚Äôs family pursued for many decades in their house after Groth's grandfather, Claus Reimer Groth, married the daughter of miller Klaus Klehn in 1790. Especially on L√ºttenheid ‚Äì meaning ‚Äúsmall Heide‚Äù ‚Äì, which was the artisan district of Heide, living and working were closely linked. The furnished rooms as well as mill equipment presented in the attic exemplify this. Furthermore, an extensive stock of original papers stemming from Groth‚Äôs belongings is also part of the museum‚Äôs collection. In addition, this includes personal items, paintings as well as photos. A small part of these documents can be seen in the permanent exhibition. Most of the extensive library that accumulated over the years ‚Äì only a small part has been in Groth‚Äôs possession, the rest has been added after the museum opened in 1914 ‚Äì has been relocated into the national library in Kiel where the books are professionally conserved.

On Friday night, 13 January 2017, she went out with friends to H√∫rra, a club in the city centre; she left alone three hours after them, at about 5.00 the following morning. Surveillance video showed her walking along Laugavegur, the main shopping street, and eating a falafel pita; until a red Kia Rio stopped in front of Number 31. After her friend and co-worker at Hagkaup called her parents and it became apparent she had not returned home or contacted them, first her mother and then the police appealed for help finding her; the search over the next week was the largest manhunt in Iceland, 800 people volunteering. Her mobile phone was traced to Hafnarfj√∂r√∞ur, and her Doc Martens were found near the harbour there. ==Discovery of the body and murder investigation== The investigation was led by Detective Gr√≠mur Gr√≠msson, the brother of the writer Vigd√≠s Gr√≠msd√≥ttir and subsequently Iceland's representative to Europol. The car, which was traced after also being seen on surveillance video at Hafnafj√∂r√∞ur harbour, had been hired by a crew member of the Greenlandic trawler Polar Nanoq; with the assistance of the captain, the Icelandic special forces intercepted the ship at sea and arrested two of the crew on suspicion of her murder. Birna's blood was found in the car, and her driving licence was found on the ship. On 22 January her body was found washed up near the Selvogsviti lighthouse on the coast of the Reykjanes peninsula, more than 40 km (26 miles) away from where she disappeared. She was naked and the autopsy established her cause of death as drowning, but bruising also indicated she had been strangled and hit in the face. There was no evidence she had been sexually assaulted. ==Trial, appeal and sentencing== Thomas M√∏ller Olsen, the Polar Nanoq crew member who had hired the car and who was then 25, was charged with the murder of Birna Brj√°nsd√≥ttir on 30 March and in September was found guilty in the Reykjanes District Court. By the start of the trial, his DNA had been identified on the laces of one of Birna's boots and his fingerprints on the driving licence; film had also been found of him buying cleaning products and cleaning the interior of the car. His shipmate who had been arrested at the same time, Nikolaj Olsen, was a witness against him, having been seen on surveillance video leaving the car in a very drunk state and returning to the ship several hours before M√∏ller Olsen, who in court sought to portray him as the murderer. After appeal, M√∏ller Olsen's conviction was affirmed by the High Court in November 2018, and his sentence of 19 years in prison for the murder and for drug smuggling, in addition to an assessment of 29 million kr√≥nur ($) in costs and compensation, went into force. of hashish had been found in his cabin. The High Court declined a request for a further appeal in February 2019. ==Reactions== Murder is rare in Iceland, and women had felt safe asking for and accepting rides from strangers; Birna's disappearance and the news that she had been murdered caused widespread shock. Crime writer Yrsa Sigur√∞ard√≥ttir said: \\"In the past we have only witnessed murders like this in works of fiction.\\" \\"√âg er Birna\\" (I am Birna) trended on social media. Some news outlets broke with tradition and published the suspects' names and photographs. After the discovery of her body, people lit candles and held vigils for her in both Iceland and Greenland, and a memorial in Reykjav√≠k the following weekend had 8,000 participants. 2,000 people, including the president and prime minister, attended her funeral at Hallgr√≠mskirkja. The number of surveillance cameras in Reykjav√≠k increased, and a women-only version of the informal Facebook-based ride service Skutlarar was established. After the discovery of her body, Polar Nanoq donated 1.6 million kr√≥nur ($) to those who had searched for her, and in March 2018, a wreath from the crew was laid on her grave to commemorate the first anniversary of her death. ==References== Category:People murdered in Iceland Category:2017 crimes in Iceland Category:2017 murders in Europe Category:Female murder victims Category:Violence against women in Europe ","title":"Murder of Birna Brj√°nsd√≥ttir"},{"id":"60317498","text":"Jang Yong-jun (Hangul: Ïû•Ïö©Ï§Ä, born May 30, 2000), better known by his stage name No:el (Hangul: ÎÖ∏Ïóò), is a South Korean rapper.

In the area of civil rights, Helme has campaigned against the passing of the Cohabitation Act in Estonia, which entitled same-sex couples to register as civil partners. He later campaigned to repeal the act. He has been a vocal critic of the rights of the Russian-speaking minority to speak Russian in the Estonian educational system, and opposed the addition of a Russian-language song to the Estonian Song Festival.

The program relied on federal and state funding to remove commercial and housing properties that were not in use and had unlivable conditions. The plan was for 40,000 properties to be taken down to allow for property values to rise and have land for new homes and office space to be built in the city. Poverty and crime continue to impact the city, and the demolition program was created in hopes to improve conditions for the people living in the urban areas of Detroit. As of April 2019, the program is in effect with plans to continue for eight more years. ==History== By the time Detroit filed for bankruptcy in the summer of 2013, the city had been experiencing urban blight for decades. A multitude of factors, including racial unrest, a struggling automotive industry, and white flight had deprived the city of a tax base, leading to deficits and a failure of the municipal system. Further compounding Detroit‚Äôs problems was the fact that despite large decreases in population, its area remained unchanged, stretching thin municipal services. High rates of housing vacancies in turn lead to large tracts of urban space marked by deteriorating buildings and associated with high poverty and crime rates. The resulting phenomenon of urban shrinkage and vacant lots only serve to perpetuate the unemployment and poverty plaguing the Detroit inner city. In response to the issues of ‚Äúurban blight,‚Äù Detroit has accelerated demolition projects with faster, less cumbersome guidelines, demolishing 3,739 vacant buildings in 2014. ==Detroit Demolition Program Mission== The Detroit Demolition Project was founded in 2014 to remove blight from the city‚Äôs urban properties with the goals of minimizing adverse environmental and health risks, safely salvaging or disposing unused material, and leaving sites in suitable condition for redevelopment. Working in conjunction with EPA Region 5, demolitions are conducted in compliance with local regulations for asbestos removal, backfill contamination, dust control, and deconstruction. Many of the demolitions are the funded by the Hardest Hit Fund, which account for 2/3 of the recorded demolitions to this point.City of Detroit. (2019) Detroit Demolitions (April 5, 2019) [Demolitions Data Lens visualization from governmental open data]. Retrieved from https://data.detroitmi.gov/Government/Demolitions-Data-Lens/xhif-khyv The HHF is a federally funded program established in 2010 to aid states affected by the 2007 mortgage crisis. A July 2015 report published by Dynamo Metrics, a government collaborated property analytics aggregator stated the average cost of an individual HHF demolition as $14,855. ==Program Effects== ===Results=== The first home demolitions in Detroit occurred in January 2014, and as of April 2019, the program is still in effect. In this time over 17,000 properties have been torn down.‚ÄúDetroit Demolition Program.‚Äù City of Detroit, detroitmi.gov/departments/detroit-building-authority/detroit-demolition- program#Become-Demolition-Contractor. Another 2,800 demolitions have already been contracted and will occur within the next 12 months. The city hopes to reach 40,000 demolitions over the next eight years. The city of Detroit is split into seven council districts. The Detroit Demolition Program targeted all of these districts. Each region had between 1,500-3,000 demolitions.Detroit Demolition Program Interactive Map, https://data.detroitmi.gov/Government/Demolitions-Data-Lens/xhif-khyv These demolitions were contracted to numerous companies with $90 million going to businesses that started up in Detroit. Most of these funds come from a Hardest Hit Funding program that is federally funded. The government website for the program provides evidence that there have been increases in property values due to the demolitions. The study for this was conducted by The Skillman Foundation, Rock Ventures, and Dynamo Metrics in October 2015, 21 months after the demolitions began. In this time span, homes in nearby areas (within 500 ft of demolitions) showed increases in property values by an estimated 4.2%.‚ÄúImpact of Demo on Property Values.‚Äù City of Detroit, detroitmi.gov/departments/detroit-building-authority/detroit-demolition- program/impact-demo-property-values. When demolitions were incorporated into other blight-elimination strategies, including nuisance-abatement lawsuits, auctions, and sales of side lots to neighbors, these regions saw a 13.8% increase in home valuation. As of March 2018, 3,000 previously vacant homes have been sold, resulting in an influx of members within the community.Afana, Dana. ‚ÄúDetroit Aims to Fix, Demolish or Board up 22,000 Abandoned Homes by End of 2019.‚Äù Mlive.com, Mlive.com, 7 Mar. 2018, www.mlive.com/news/detroit/2018/03/detroit_expects_to_fix_demolis.html. A Wayne State University study on the effects of Detroit demolitions on crime rates found that the 9,398 demolitions conducted by the city between 2010 and 2014 were associated with statistically significant decreases in rates of total crime, violent crime, and property crime. On the other hand, while a decrease in drug crime was also observed, the study could not attribute the decrease to the demolitions due to a weaker statistical relationship. ===Controversies=== In February 2019, federal authorities decided to expand an investigation looking into the environmental negligence of the demolition program. Some research had shown that the dirt used to fill areas that were demolished was contaminated.‚ÄúLeDuff: In Detroit, Is Dirt Money in Disguise?‚Äù Deadline Detroit, www.deadlinedetroit.com/articles/20459/leduff_in_detroit_is_dirt_money_in_disguise. Potential lead contamination is being investigated as well, as some areas in the city have seen spikes in lead levels. The demolition program has made no official statement regarding these issues. Prior to this investigation, a grand jury found the program guilty for accepting bribes for contracting work, and the program was forced to return $6.4 million in funding in 2017.Snell, Robert, and Christine Ferretti. ‚ÄúGrand Jury Focusing on Detroit's Demolition Program.‚Äù Detroit News, DetroitNews, 14 June 2017, www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2017/06/13/detroit- demolition-program-grand-jury/102816406/. ==See also== Decline of Detroit, details the factors contributing to the economic downfall of Detroit. ==References== Category:Government of Detroit Category:2014 establishments in Michigan Category:Demolition Category:Redevelopment projects in the United States ","title":"Detroit Demolition Program"},{"id":"60318045","text":"Robert Frederick Hedelund (born March 23, 1961) is a lieutenant general in the United States Marine Corps who serves as the commander of United States Marine Corps Forces Command, replacing LtGen Mark A.

During the course of representing Dekraii, Sanders uncovered that prosecutors from the Orange County District Attorney's Office and law enforcement agencies used jailhouse informants to build their cases against defendants, but they would withhold that evidence from defense attorneys. He learned that informants received reduced sentences or cash for getting other defendants to reveal incriminating evidence. After Sanders uncovered the secret practice, the Orange County District Attorney's Office was removed from the case following a ruling by Judge Thomas Goethals that the office had violated Dekraai's rights by improperly withholding evidence from the defense. Goethals assigned California Attorney General Kamala Harris to take over the prosecution. Harris's office announced its intention to appeal the decision, which was ultimately denied.\\"O.C. salon murder case stalls as D.A. office's removal is appealed\\", Los Angeles Times, March 21, 2015.

Her doctoral dissertation on the history and concept of Berlin Dadaism at the FU Berlin was accepted in 1984. In 1990, she received a German Research Foundation grant to investigate the relationship between tradition and modernism in the example of the New Objectivity movement. Then, in 1992, she presented her habilitation project on the concept of montage to the History Department at the FU Berlin and received the Venia legendi for Modern Art History. She first applied her research results on Classical Modernism in her work as co-curator at the international exhibitions and the catalogs Tendenzen der zwanziger Jahre. Dada in Europa ‚Äì Dokumente und Werke (15th European Art Exhibition, Berlin 1977) (Tendencies of the 1920s.

After these exhibitions, she advanced her research and, at the same time, continued bringing up her daughters (born in 1969 and 1973). Bergius gained teaching experience in 1980 with a 9-year teaching appointment in the Architecture Department at the Technical University Dortmund; from 1987 to 1989 at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf; and in 1990 through her participation in the Radio College Modern Art. After her habilitation, she taught from 1992 to 1994 as a Professor for Art History at the University of Applied Sciences M√ºnster. From 1994 to 2007, she held a Professorship for the History of Art, Design, and Architecture at the Burg Giebichenstein University of Art and DesignVita Prof. Dr. phil. habil. Hanne Bergius, burg-halle.de Her teaching concentrated on the interdependencies among the arts and on aesthetic transfer processes ‚Äì for example, between Europe and Asia ‚Äì to make students aware of the scope for interpretations between forms, functions, and levels of meaning in their international cultural and social-historical contexts. The point was both gaining theoretical knowledge and a path to designing and acting. == Research == Bergius' research emphases lie in 19th- and 20th-century Modern art. In numerous scholarly publications since 1975, she has investigated how innovative processes of design and reception develop in their socio-cultural contexts and how they become prevalent against traditional certainties. The international Dada movement, especially Berlin's Dadaism, is one of her primary research areas.Hanne Bergius, Dada\`s reception since the late 1950s Bergius' monograph Das Lachen Dadas (Dada's laughter), published in 1989, is about the experimental concepts of the grotesque in the Berlin Club Dada and the various projects and performances of the new type of artist, the Da-Dandy, who, in the intersection of current events, calls simultaneously for a radical revision of the arts and for bitingly satirical social criticism. In Montage und Metamechanik (2000) Bergius analyzes Dada's products ‚Äì the avant-garde process of collages, assemblages, and above all photomontages and their polar field of tension with the works of the metamechanical-abstract phase, which she interprets in terms of Friedrich Nietzsche's complex influence on the Dada concept. With the expanded American publication Dada triumphs. Dada Berlin 1917-1923 (2003), as well as with essays and documentations in Dada: The Coordinates of cultural Politics (1996) and Dada and the Press (2004) she took part in Crisis and the Arts. The History of Dada, edited by Stephen C. Forster (University of Iowa). Beyond that, in 1997, Bergius participated in the international symposium Nietzsche and An Architecture of Our Minds with a paper on the deconstructive architectures of Johannes Baader and Kurt Schwitters and headed a section titled Nietzsche as prophet of Modernism, organized by The Getty Research Institute for The History of Arts and the Humanities. She also devoted studies to such artists as Jefim Golyscheff, George Grosz, Raoul Hausmann, John Heartfield, Wieland Herzfelde, Hannah H√∂ch, Richard Huelsenbeck, Walter Mehring, Rudolf Schlichter, Erwin Blumenfeld, Paul Citroen, Otto Dix, and Max Ernst, comprehensively reconstructing their contributions to the First International Dada Fair (1920). In 1976, feminist art historiography drew her attention to Gender Studies work on Hannah H√∂ch and other Dadaists. She has been credited with producing the first feminist reading of the work of Hannah H√∂ch and producing \\"the most exhaustive identification\\" of Cut with the Kitchen Knife Dada. In particular, in 2011, Bergius investigated the early Paris work phase of the filmmaker and artist Ulrike Ottinger and, in 2013 at the exhibition Weltbilder (World images), she demonstrated the proximity of Ottinger's ethno- and mythopoetic pictorial concept to Aby Warburg's cultural-scientific research on the transformations of pictorial memory. Bergius‚Äô interest concentrated also on investigations of concepts of montage that developed in the reception of Dada and Surrealism since the 1960s in the areas of Fluxus, Lettrism, the Situationist International, Pop Art, and today‚Äôs pictorial production. == Select publications == === Monographs === * Das Lachen Dadas.

It is about two brothers falling in love with the same woman. The original scenario of the film was written by Marie Epstein, the director's sister.Review, synopsis and link to watch the film: ==Plot== Jerome and Jean de Ners are praying in front of the tomb of their parents. Jean is an idle young man passionately in love with a singer, Mary Winter. Jerome, a famous doctor, takes cares of him and worries about his outbursts. One night, after receiving a phone call from Marie, the woman he loves, Jean suddenly disappears without warning his brother. He drives to the south of France to live with his great love in a luxury villa. He buys a photo camera and wants to take a photo of her but she first refuses. One evening, they meet Harry Gold, a famous dancer, and she enjoys dancing with him. The following day, she finally let Jean take a picture of her. Jean is very happy, but the following morning, he finds she's gone away. The gardener says he has seen her leaving with Harry. Jean wants to go after them but he is delayed by a flat tyre. While Mary and Harry enjoy their love story while going on with their respective dancer and singer careers, Jean is desperate. Looking at the camera still containing Mary's unprocessed photo, he realises he will never see her again and shoots himself. At the same moment, his portrait hanging in J√©r√¥me's house falls from the wall and he understands something terrible has happened to him. One day Mary faints during one of her shows. Jerome, who was attending the performance gives her first aid. Discovering that she is Jean's brother, she tries successfully to seduce him. Jerome is informed that a trunk with Jean's belongings has been found in a villa on the French Riviera which is being transformed into a hotel. He travels by train to the south of France to recover it and Mary, breaking her dancing commitments follows him. They stay in the villa now turned into a hotel. Jerome finds the letter left by Jean where he explains that he killed himself for the love of a cruel woman. Mary still hopes that he will not discover that she is the cruel woman but Jerome then finds the camera with the film still in it. When he processes the film and recognises her, she understand their love is impossible and runs away and faints on the beach. J√©r√¥me brings her back to life and while she resumes her singing career, she seems to enjoy only charity Christmas parties and hospital parties. The enigmatic title of the film refers to the size in centimetres of the photograph taken by Jean. ==Cast== Nino Constantini, Suzy Pierson and Ren√© Fert√© * Edmond Van Da√´le as J√©r√¥me de Ners * Nino Constantini as Jean de Ners * Ren√© Fert√© as Harry Gold * Suzy Pierson as Marie Mortelle/Mary Winters ==Production and distribution== The film was shot during the autumn of 1926.

August 2018 for Windows and Xbox One, four days later for PlayStation 4, and on 29 May 2019 for Nintendo Switch. == Gameplay == A construction sandbox focusing on vehicular combat, the game offers a variety of blocks with different functions that can be combined in various ways using attach points on each, with the control block - a cab - always serving as a centrepoint. Wheel blocks in contact with ground enable driving, while wing blocks generate lift for flying and other blocks provide additional functions to the tech they are attached to. Beside vehicles, the game enables construction of static bases anchored to the ground that are mainly used for storage and crafting. Blocks can be crafted using resources gathered from the environment and a system of resource silos, conveyors and automatic factories (all blocks themselves). Several modes are available: * campaign: a loose storyline in which the player is an interplanetary prospector tasked to gather resources for famished Earth. The player starts with a cab and a handful of blocks on a procedurally generated map, fighting rival prospectors and taking their blocks, unlocking licenses of various factions which enable them to acquire higher-level blocks. In this mode, resources and blocks can be sold for the in-game currency \\"Block Bucks\\" and spent for purchasing new blocks. * creative: unlimited blocks and optional enemies, for building and testing constructions without having to acquire resources * sumo: tech vs. tech battles in an arena * gauntlet: obstacle courses * R&D; test lab: similar to creative mode, but with added experimental blocks that aren't yet included in the official release. For separate purchase as downloadable content. == Development == The developers worked the concept into a playable demo in 2014 and presented it at indie games shows such as Rezzed, as well as actively promoted it through Steam, IndieDB, Twitch and other web platforms. A successful Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign followed after which an open beta was released as early access on the Steam platform. After a protracted development period, the version 1.0 was officially released in August 2018. Despite being released, the game remains in active development, and several major new features are planned. == Reception == Reviewers compared the gameplay to playing with Lego bricks, which they considered exciting and invoking of childhood memories. User interface, controls and the game AI, on the other hand, were less commended. The reviewer for AbsoluteXbox was particularly critical of unintuitive camera controls, clumsy driving performance and frustrating combat in the Xbox version. == References == == External links == * * Official wiki Category:2018 video games Category:Construction and management simulation games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Open world video games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games ","title":"TerraTech"},{"id":"60318299","text":"is a Japanese professional sumo wrestler from Setouchi, Kagoshima. He debuted in sumo wrestling in July 2011 and made his makuuchi debut in July 2018. His highest rank has been maegashira 2. He wrestles for Tatsunami stable. Unusually for a top-class sumo wrestler, he uses his given name as his shikona. ==Background== Meisei was born in Setouchi, a town on Amami ≈åshima, one of the Ryukyu Islands. He began sumo at the age of five and was strongly encouraged by his father and other family members. When his elementary school closed their sumo programme he joined a sumo club in a neighboring town and in sixth grade he won the All-Japan Primary School Sumo Tournament. He moved to the Kamogawa Junior High School and competed in national championships but failed to win any further championships. Although he considered attending High School he took his father's advice and left education at the age of 15 to pursue a career in professional sumo.„Éô„Éº„Çπ„Éú„Éº„É´„Éª„Éû„Ç¨„Ç∏„É≥Á§æÂàä „ÄéÁõ∏Êí≤„Äè 2016Âπ¥8ÊúàÂè∑ÔºàÂêçÂè§Â±ãÂ†¥ÊâÄÁ∑èÊ±∫ÁÆóÂè∑Ôºâ 83È†ÅÂπ≥Êàê19Âπ¥„ÅÆË©¶ÂêàË®òÈå≤„ÉªÁµêÊûú ÂÖ¨ÁõäË≤°Âõ£Ê≥ï‰∫∫ Êó•Êú¨Áõ∏Êí≤ÈÄ£Áõü„Éô„Éº„Çπ„Éú„Éº„É´„Éª„Éû„Ç¨„Ç∏„É≥Á§æÂàä „ÄéÁõ∏Êí≤„Äè 2014Âπ¥8ÊúàÂè∑ÔºàÂêçÂè§Â±ãÂ†¥ÊâÄÁ∑èÊ±∫ÁÆóÂè∑Ôºâ 91È†Å ==Career== ===Early career=== In 2011 Meisei joined the Tatsunami stable, bringing him under the tutelage of the former komusubi Asahiyutaka. Unlike most new wrestlers who begin their careers under their family names he took his given name as his shikona surname. Shortly before his sixteenth birthday he began his professional career in July 2011 and recorded four wins in seven bouts in the jonokuchi division to secure promotion to jonidan. A 5-2 result in November saw him promoted to the fourth sandanme division but in January 2012 he won only two matches and returned to jonidan after posting his first make-koshi (losing record). He returned to sandanme after a 6-1 record in March 2012 and a run of kachi-koshi (winning records) saw him promoted to makushita (third division) in January 2013. After moving up and down between sandanme and makushita several times he established himself in the higher division and began a steady climb through the ranks. In September 2016 a 4-3 result at the rank of makushita 3 saw him promoted to the second juryo division for the first time. He returned to makushita after recording a 5-10 record in November but was promoted back to juryo after two consecutive kachi- koshi. A series of solid results saw him rise to the top of the second division and in May 2018 a 10-5 record at juryo saw him promoted to the makuuchi division. ===Makuuchi career=== In his first tournament in the top division Meisei was assigned the rank of maegashira 16. His kesho-mawashi, which featured the sun rising from the sea was embroidered by Miyuki Tanaka whose previous clients had included Chiyonofuji. He recorded six wins including victories over Hokutofuji and Chiyomaru but was relegated back to juryo. Nine wins at juryo 2 saw him return to the top division in November 2018 when he posted a 9-6 record including wins over Chiyomaru and Onosho. In January he reached a score of 6-7 after 13 days but reached his kachi-koshi by beating Yoshikaze and Onosho in his last two bouts. Competing a career high of maegashira 11 in March 2019 he won nine of his fourteen bouts highlighted by an uwatedashinage win over the former ≈çzeki Kotoshogiku on day 13. In the following tournament, at another career high rank of maegashira 7 he lost his first three bouts but won ten of his remaining twelve matches including a victory over Tochinoshin. He reached his highest ranking to date of maegashira 2 in November 2019. On December 28 during training at his stable he injured his left upper arm muscle. He still entered the January 2020 tournament but withdrew on Day 8 with only one win. He failed to make kachi-kochi in March 2020 at the rank of maegashira 17, and secured his demotion to Juryo. In July 2020, he won the Juryo Championship following six-man playoff, ensuring his return to Makuuchi. ==Fighting style== Meisei has shown a preference for yotsu techniques which involve grasping his opponent's mawashi or belt and favors the hidari-yotsu, or left-hand inside grip. His most common kimarite or winning move is yorikiri, the force-out. ==Career record== ==See also== *Glossary of sumo terms *List of active sumo wrestlers ==References== Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese sumo wrestlers Category:Sumo people from Kagoshima Prefecture ","title":"Meisei Chikara"},{"id":"60318316","text":"Suddenly Last Summer is a play written by Tennessee Williams which premiered in 1958.

Her work has involved creating immersive performances in many different sites, ranging from the great hall at the British Museum to an old church in Beirut once used as a military base during the civil war. Her exhibition, Gardens Speak, considered the Syrian uprising against the Assad regime. It presented the reconstructed oral histories of 10 men and women who died between 2011 and 2013, and were buried not in public cemeteries, but in the back gardens of ordinary homes. It led to an accompanying book, published by Tadween in 2016. El Khoury is the co-founder of the Dictaphone Group, with architect and urban planner Abir Saksouk. In 2018, a survey of her work entitled \\"ear-whispered by Tania El Khoury\\" took place in the city of Philadelphia, USA, organized by Bryn Mawr College and supported by Pew Center for the Arts and Heritage. She completed a PhD at Royal Holloway, University of London, focusing on interactive live art after the Arab uprisings, supervised by Professor Harriet Hawkins and supported by a scholarship from the Arts and Humanities Research Council.

MacGregor co-founded the National Women's History Project in 1980 with several other women including Mary Ruthsdotter in order to promote awareness about women's history throughout the United States. Over the last three decades, the NWHP has hosted countless events and historic projects to celebrate women's history. They successfully lobbied Congress to pass a joint resolution recognizing women's history month in 1987. Numerous scholars and historians have worked with the NWHP including historian Robert P. J. Cooney Jr. He is a frequent contributor to NWHP projects and his work is currently cited on the California Secretary of State page. The NWHP had a major push toward the inclusion of women's history at the K-12 level. MacGregor has been quoted as saying, \\"The validation has been the most surprising and overwhelming success of Women‚Äôs History Month. It first started at K-12, we had no idea how much effect it would have on the community and government.‚Äù In her 1999 article, \\"Living the Legacy of the Women's Rights Movement\\" published in The Public Historian, she wrote extensively about the widespread interest the NWHP has seen from students and teachers. MacGregor has noted the National Park Service has done extensive work to promote the history of the women's rights movement.

The National Women's History Alliance is the only national clearing house coordinating projects, speakers and curriculum about women's history. The NWHA regularly hosts events to promote the field of women's history and publishes a yearly list of honorees related to the field of women's history. Their theme for 2019 is \\"Visionary Women\\" Champions of Peace & Nonviolence\\". Leasa Graves works closely with MacGregor and currently serves as the Assistant Director. The organization is currently coordinating a state wide effort in California to plan a wide variety of projects celebrating the centennial of the 19th amendment. Numerous projects are in the works including recognizing suffragists buried in California. Committee members of the NWHA recently visited Cypress Lawn Cemetery in San Bruno, California where Phoebe Hearst and Gertrude Atherton are buried to put markers on their grave sites noting their work as suffragists. MacGregor frequently speaks to organizations such as the American Association of University Women about a wide range of topics related to women's history. Molly Murphy MacGregor is often called upon to share her opinions regarding the portrayal of women in the media. In 2009 when interviewed about the new biopic about Amelia Earhart, Murphy MacGregor was quoted as saying, ‚Äú\\"You cannot underestimate the power of a role model or knowing that someone else did it...female role models are extremely important.\\" == Personal life == MacGregor is a former educator with a background in teaching social studies, English and women's history.

In 1972, Bannister was a president of a photographic equipment manufacturing company, and at a manufacturers' conference, he handed out thousands of Chiquita banana stickers.

Encouraged by the positive response, Bannister created the International Banana Club and was designated as the \\"Top Banana\\". He started receiving banana-related items in the mail, but began to run out of room for all of them. The International Banana Club and Museum subsequently began to operate in Altadena in a rented building. The Banana Club would eventually grow to 35,000 members in 17 different countries. Donating a banana-related item to the museum would enable one to join the Banana Club, with a nickname and ability to earn \\"banana merit points\\", and obtain a degree in \\"Bananistry\\". President Ronald Reagan was a member of the club. In 2005, Bannister relocated the museum to a rent-free city-owned space in Hesperia. However, in 2010, the Hesperia Recreation and Park District wanted the museum to move out to make room for a new exhibit. Bannister placed the entire collection on eBay for $45,000. Eventually he had to lower the price to $7,500. In 2010, Fred Garbutt bought the collection for an undisclosed amount, moving it to Mecca and becoming the new curator; it was reported that Bannister had agreed to a purchase price below $7,500. ==Description== In 1999, the museum won a Guinness World Record as the largest museum devoted to a single fruit. At the time, it held a collection of 17,000 items. The collection includes \\"banana phones, clocks, coloring books, toys, record players, costumes, golf clubs, stuffed animals, and ... ceiling fans\\". Kitschy items include a \\"banana couch, banana soda, gold-plated banana, banana boogie board, and banana ears\\". The museum houses the only petrified banana in the world, which came from the closet of a girl in Kentucky. The museum is family-friendly, despite a history of people sending in lewd objects. There is also a Banana Bar that serves banana-related food and drinks. ==References== ==External links== *Home page Category:Bananas Category:Museums in Riverside County, California Category:Museums established in 1976 Category:1976 establishments in California ","title":"International Banana Museum"},{"id":"60318521","text":"Mud Creek is a stream in the U.S. state of Georgia.

The show served as the year-end finale for CMLL before Arena M√©xico, CMLL's main venue, closed down for the winter for renovations and to host Circo Atayde . The shows replaced the regular Super Viernes (\\"Super Friday\\") shows held by CMLL since the mid-1930s. This was the fifth third that CMLL used the name \\"Jucio Final\\" for their year-end show, a name they would use on a regular basis going forward, originally for their year even events but later on held at other points in the year. The main event of the show was a Luchas de Apuestas, or bet match, which is considered a higher profile match type than a championship match in Lucha Libre. For the 1992 Juicio Final main event both Pierroth Jr. and El Supremo \\"bet\\" their mask on the outcome of the match. Pierroth Jr. defeated El Supremo two falls to one, forcing El Supremo to remove his mask and reveal his real name, Salvador Cuevas Ram√≠rez, as per the Lucha de Apuestas stipulation. In the third match of the night, Javier Cruz and Kato Kung Lee both put their hair on the line for the match. Cruz won and Kato Kung Lee was forced to have all his hair shaved off. The show included three additional matches for a total of five matches in total. ==Production== ===Background=== For decades Arena M√©xico, the main venue of the Mexican professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), would close down in early December and remain closed into either January or February to allow for renovations as well as letting Circo Atayde occupy the space over the holidays. As a result, CMLL usually held a \\"end of the year\\" supercard show on the first or second Friday of December in lieu of their normal Super Viernes show. 1955 was the first year where CMLL used the name \\"El Juicio Final\\" (\\"The Final Judgement\\") for their year-end supershow. Until 2000 the Jucio Final name was always used for the year end show, but since 2000 has at times been used for shows outside of December. It is no longer an annually recurring show, but instead held intermittently sometimes several years apart and not always in the same month of the year either. All Juicio Final shows have been held in Arena M√©xico in Mexico City, Mexico which is CMLL's main venue, its \\"home\\". ===Storylines=== The 1992 Juicio Final show featured five professional wrestling matches scripted by CMLL with some wrestlers involved in scripted feuds. The wrestlers portray either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that play the part of the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they perform. ==Results== ==References== Category:1992 in Mexican sports Category:1992 in professional wrestling Category:CMLL Juicio Final ","title":"Juicio Final (1992)"},{"id":"60318602","text":"Kurt Imhof (* 1914; ‚Ä† unknown) was a Swiss footballer who played for FC Basel.

She currently works as an author, designer and environmentalist, and published her first book The Garden Awakening in 2016. Her career as a landscape designer and latter accomplishments inspired the biographical drama Dare to Be Wild (2016). == Early life == Reynolds was raised on a farm in Wexford, Ireland with her parents and five siblings, of which she is the youngest. Her father, S√©an Reynolds, worked as a soil scientist and farmer, while her mother, Teresa, worked as a full-time teacher. In her personal anecdotes, Reynolds claims to have developed her fascination with nature at a young age, often referencing a childhood memory in which she became lost on the family farm and felt the plants around her \\"leaning towards me [‚Ä¶] fighting for my attention. They wanted me to know that they were part of my family.\\" Reynolds studied landscape design at University College Dublin, graduating with a degree in Landscape Horticulture to pursue a career in landscape design. == Career and achievements == === 2002 Chelsea Flower Show === Reynolds design entry for the 2002 Chelsea Flower Show was delivered to RHS officials wrapped in mint leaves. An excerpt from the text reads; \\"People travel the world over to visit untouched places of natural beauty, yet modern gardens pay little heed to the simplicity and beauty of these environments.\\" All contestants were required to provide evidence of a ‚Ç§150,000 sponsorship to fund their garden. While Reynolds provided the paperwork and proof of sponsorship, she later confessed; \\"It was very carefully worded so no actual amount was mentioned; [my sponsors] gave me a pound, so it wasn‚Äôt a complete fib.\\" She later secured sufficient sponsorship to construct her garden. To complete the construction of her garden, Reynolds enlisted the help of Christy Collard and others from Irish gardening business Future Forests. Her design, titled ‚ÄòTearmann s√≠ ‚Äì A Celtic Sanctuary‚Äô, was awarded a gold medal and gained public acclaim nationwide. The installation featured a moon-gate archway, leading down a path to four stone Druid thrones surrounding a fire-bowl placed over a pond. The garden was engulfed by traditional stone dry-walls and supported over 500 native Irish plants, such as hawthorns. Reynolds installation was famously visited by Prince Charles, a regular participant of the Chelsea Flower Show, who talked with Reynolds as they toured her garden. === Landscape design === Reynolds designs often feature: * Spiralling stone walls in the style of the Fibonacci sequence. * Unkempt native flowers and wildlife, often referred to as forest gardening. * Stone sculptures in the style of traditional Celtic constructions; obelisks, Druid throne. * The shapes and patterns of nature. ==== Kew Gardens ==== The Palm House in the Royal Kew Gardens. Following her success at the 2002 Chelsea Flower Show, Reynolds was approached by the British government to design a garden for the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew. Reynolds stated the design was inspired by W. B. Yeats poem \\"The Stolen Child\\". It featured a large stone sculpture of a sleeping faerie. ==== Delta Sensory Gardens: Stolen Child Garden ==== The Lughnasa Autumn Garden in Brigit's Garden. Reynolds was commissioned to design a garden at the Delta Sensory Gardens, within the Delta Centre in Carlow, Ireland. The garden mimics that at the Royal Kew, as it also features a stone faerie covered in moss, surrounded by a variety of native Irish fauna. The garden also features some topiary sculpture by Irish gardener Martin Monks. ==== Brigit's Garden: Gairdin Bhride ==== Brigit's Garden is located in Galway, Ireland. The garden was designed by Mary Reynolds under the commission of its founder Jenny Beale. Beale requested the design feature four central gardens, each inspired by the seasonal Celtic festivals of Samhain, Imbolc, Bealtaine, and Lughnasa. Each garden features a sculpture created by local artists, as commissioned by Beale. A limestone wall windes through the whole garden, with the Lughnasa garden featuring circles of limestone obelisks. ==== New Ross Library Park ==== A transcription of an Irish Ogham inscription. The New Ross Library Park is located in Wexford, Ireland. The park is inspired by Irish mythology and historical writings. It features a Clog M√≥r Amphitheatre and a sundial designed by Eamonn Hore and Liam O‚ÄôNeill the sculptor. The trees planted at the park correlate with the Ogham alphabet that is displayed on a stone walkway. ==== Other projects and commissions ==== * Cornwall Seaside Garden at the Camel Quarry House in Cornwall, England: designed a terraced spiralled stone-wall. *Celtic Gardens at the Monart Destination Spa in Wexford, Ireland: features stone bridges and a terraced waterfall. *The Convent Gardens and The Tree Of Life Garden at the D√≠seart Visitor Centre in Kerry, Ireland. *The 'Buncloch' or Foundation Stone garden at Farmleigh House, in Castlenock, Ireland: features a small garden commemorating the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of 1916. *Rooftop penthouse gardens in Dublin, Ireland: features fully irrigated garden terraces filled with assorted plants and trees. == Publications == Environmental Activist Jane Goodall === The Garden Awakening: Designs to Nurture the Land and Ourselves (2016) === Reynolds first publication is an instructional memoir in which she promotes sustainable horticultural practice through \\"forest gardening\\", while also detailing her spiritual connection to the Irish landscape through the terms and symbols of Celtic paganism. In her text Reynolds covers the practice of permaculture and natural farming, foraging, keeping poultry, composting, and beekeeping. The book features illustrations by artist Ruth Evans, alongside drawings and architectural sketches by Reynolds, and a foreword by US author Larry Korn. The publication was publicly endorsed by fellow activist and anthropologist Jane Goodall, who stated the book helped guide readers to be \\"in tune with nature\\" and give their gardens a \\"sense of home\\". Other notable figures who shared their support of Reynold's writing include Sir Tim Smit, Co-Founder of the Eden Project; and James Alexander-Sinclair, judge and council member of the Royal Horticultural Society. == Views and activism == === Celtic paganism === In both her writings and interviews, Reynolds often refers to her Celtic heritage in regards to the magic and energies found in nature. In an interview with the Irish Examiner, Reynolds stated she is not religious, but found her faith in nature. She also makes use of traditional Celtic symbols and folklore in her landscape designs; such as Druid thrones, obelisks and her sleeping faerie sculpture at the Delta Sensory Garden. In April 2019 on the Cultivating Place podcast Reynolds made many statements in regards to her experiences in nature, calling her garden \\"a universal post box that you can send your wishes and intentions out from\\", and comparing the process of gardening to \\"knitting or weaving a magic spell\\" which can allow \\"the land to become healed\\". Reynolds also makes use of traditional Celtic terminology in her writings and designs, such as those featured at Brigit's Garden. === Environmentalism === Reynolds is an active figure in the Irish Environmentalism community, acknowledged for her efforts in promoting sustainable living through publicly available interviews and workshops. In 2017 she worked as a course instructor at the Irish National Heritage Park in Wexford, her efforts focussing on restoring or \\"healing\\" the land to its natural, wild state. ==== WeAreTheArk.org ==== We Are The Ark was founded by Reynolds in 2018 with the aim of creating international environmental activism in regards to rewilding land by returning gardens to nature in order to increase biodiversity. She was spurred to start the trend when observing local fauna leaving a site being used for development. Her website directs participants to build a natural haven in which native plants and fauna is allowed to flourish in a self- sustaining environment. == In media == Reynolds has appeared in the following online podcasts and tele-seminar; * Cultivating Place: Episode 166: Daring To Be Wild - We ARE The Ark - With Irish Plantswoman, Mary Reynolds; from 26 April 2019. * The Irish Times R√≥isin Meets: Mary Reynolds, award-winning gardener; from May 2016. *Organisation of Nature Evolutionaries: Remembering Our Roles as Guardians of Our Land; from 20 January 2019. *Thin Places Travel Podcast: Episode 10: Awaken the Land with Mary Reynolds; from 21 April 2018. *Urban Farm: Episode 341: Mary Reynolds on Care of Earth, Food and Nature; from 3 April 2018. *Farm On Podcast: Episode 20: Rebuilding Shattered Hearts with Mary Reynolds; from November 2017. *Unclassified Woman: Episode 53: The Garden Awakening with Mary Reynolds; from November 2017. *Being Boss: Episode 120: Nurture Your Land (And Yourself) With Mary Reynolds; from 18 April 2017. *Japan Times: Mary Reynolds Say Gardeners Should Take a Walk on the Wild Side *Smithsonian Magazine: The Unlikely, Charming Designer Who is Changing the Face of Gardening *Publisher's Weekly: Non Fiction Book Review of the Garden Awakening: Designs To Nurture Our Land and Ourselves *Architectural Digest Spain: Top 10 Landscapers *RTE Radio 1 Marian Finucane Interview about Dare To Be Wild *Land 8 - Landscape Architects Network: 7 Female Landscape Architects You Need To Know About *The Irish Times: How To 'Rewild' Your Garden For The Good Of The Planet In November 2016 Reynolds held a seminar at the TEDxWexford conference. Her presentation was titled \\"The Garden Awakening\\" a featured processes of garden design and planning as further detailed in her publication, released earlier that same year. Reynolds landscape design at Brigit's Garden was featured in the MoMoWo Exhibit, a programme co-funded by the Creative Europe Programme of the European Union which highlights the achievements of 'European women in architecture and design'. === Dare to be Wild === The feature-length film premiered in March 2015 at the Jamerson International Film Festival in Dublin. It features actors Emma Greenwell and Tom Hughes. The film is a biographical drama of Reynolds‚Äô life leading up to and through the 2002 Chelsea Flower Show, and features scenes and sets that were recreated from photos, including a full physical re-installation of Reynolds‚Äô award-winning Celtic Sanctuary. It is directed by environmentalist Vivienne De Courcy, who was inspired to create the film after she and Reynolds became friends following a garden design commission. ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤Dare to Be Wild‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ was shown in ninety UK cinemas, with screenings in fifteen South Korean theatres and 638 internationally. It has since been made available on Netflix in North America. == Personal life == Reynolds lives as a single parent on a 5-acre property in her hometown Wexford, with her two children. She publicly acknowledges a former relationship with Christy Collard, a green build architect who assisted Reynolds in creating her award-winning Celtic Sanctuary. Reynolds was eager for his assistance in her design, and so followed Collard to his reforestation project in Ethiopia, resulting in a brief romance that was depicted in the biopic Dare to be Wild. == References == == External links == *Mary Reynolds Blog - run by Claire Leadbitter Category:Alumni of University College Dublin Category:People from Wexford, County Wexford Category:Irish gardeners Category:Irish garden writers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ","title":"Mary Reynolds (landscape designer)"},{"id":"60318645","text":"R√∫ben Rodrigues may refer to: *R√∫ben Rodrigues (footballer, born 1987), Portuguese footballer who plays as a forward *R√∫ben Rodrigues (footballer, born 1996), Portuguese footballer who plays as a forward ","title":"R√∫ben Rodrigues"},{"id":"60318661","text":"Musicogenic seizure, also known as music-induced seizure, is a rare type of seizure, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 10,000,000 individuals, that arises from disorganized or abnormal brain electrical activity when a person hears or is exposed to a specific type of sound or musical stimuli. There are challenges when diagnosing a music-induced seizure due to the broad scope of triggers, and time delay between a stimulus and seizure. In addition, the causes of musicogenic seizures are not well-established as solely limited cases and research have been discovered and conducted respectively. Nevertheless, the current understanding of the mechanism behind musicogenic seizure is that music triggers the part of the brain that is responsible for evoking an emotion associated with that music. Dysfunction in this system leads to an abnormal release of dopamine, eventually inducing seizure. Currently, there are diverse intervention strategies that patients can choose from depending on their situations. They can have surgery to remove the region of the brain that generates a seizure. Behavioral therapy is also available; patients are trained to gain emotional control to reduce the frequency of seizure. Medications like carbamazepine and phenytoin (medication for general seizure) also suggest effectiveness to mitigate music-induced seizures. ==Signs & symptoms== While the signs and symptoms of musicogenic seizures are similar to that of other focal seizures, one unique distinction is the variation in the time interval between the stimulus and seizure among different patients. Unlike most focal seizures, the duration between the triggering musical stimulus and seizure varies among patients; some patients encounter the seizure imminently after the trigger, while some experience a wide time gap between the stimulus and seizure. During this latent prolonged time lapse, the symptoms experienced are autonomic responses. Patients may encounter changes in respiratory rate, blood pressure, and heart rate such as tachycardia, leading them to feel distressed and agitated. Furthermore, hallucinations are often experienced when encountering a seizure triggered by a musical stimulus. For example, musical release hallucinations and synesthetic experiences are the most common hallucinations associated with music-induced seizures. Musical auditory hallucinations may also develop due to epilepsy in the temporal lobe, which is found to be affected in 75% cases of musicogenic seizures. ==Causes== Musicogenic seizures are generally defined as a focal seizure, as the lateral and mesial temporal, and orbitofrontal areas of the brain are affected. Musicogenic seizures have complex stimuli due to the broad scope of possibilities of triggers. A wide spectrum of triggers has been noted to stimulate musicogenic seizures and musicogenic epilepsy as the type of music and method of perceiving music varies from one patient to another. It has been reported that 17% of music-evoked seizures are induced solely by music, while 53% are induced by miscellaneous musical stimuli. Examples of musical triggers not only include listening to noise, sound, volume, pure words, genre, singer, song, and anthem, but also playing, thinking and dreaming of music. Among these triggers, most patients tend to be triggered by a specific tune, song or singer. Musical characteristics such as cadence, frequency, and timbre are possible reasoning behind the musical stimuli. Hence, this proposes that a particular rhythmic activity or pattern induces a seizure. ==Mechanism== electroencephalogram (EEG) of the mesial temporal lobe of a patient in seizure. alt= Although the understanding of the exact causes of musicogenic seizures is currently not fully known, a commonly understood mechanism is that this epilepsy is associated with emotional responses to music rather than the music itself. Specifically, music creates an emotional response that is activated by the limbic areas. This emotional effect of the music then triggers the increase of dopamine in the different parts of the brain, eventually leading to hyperexcitation, which is an abnormal excitation of neurons, and generation of seizures in those areas when there is a dysfunction in this system. This notion is supported by many functional imaging studies like fMRI, PET scan, and clinical studies which suggested that patients of the musicogenic seizure often express emotional feelings before the onset of the seizure. Fig.1 A diagram that shows the process involved in the auditory sensory relay from air vibrations from music to the primary auditory cortex ===Emotional associations of music=== The general relationship of the association between emotion and music is that after the auditory sensory relay of the musical information to the primary auditory cortex (shown in figure 1), the hippocampal connection in the brain encodes the association of positive/negative emotions with certain music in the memory. Given this memory, when a person receives musical information from the environment, the hippocampus relays the emotional information related to that music to the mesolimbic system, which regulates the association of emotion and dopamine release. These connections between the hippocampus, mesolimbic system, and auditory cortex provide a possible mechanism of music-induced seizure by helping the brain to relate music to emotion and dopamine release. Dysfunction in this sensory relay network leads to an abnormal release of dopamine, eventually inducing hyperexcitability of neurons and seizure when certain music is heard. Moreover, scientists discovered that there are other parts of the brain like basolateral amygdala involved in this connection between music, emotion, and seizure. Hence, this suggests that the mechanism behind musicogenic seizure still remains obscure and more research is required to fully understand it. ==Diagnosis== The diagnoses of music-induced seizures are complicated as the nature of stimulus is relatively unique in the ambit of seizure triggers. The usual diagnosis of seizures is routinely carried out through electroencephalography (EEG), physical examination and a review of patient history. However, an EEG may not be appropriate to diagnose and test a person with music-evoked seizures since EEG is used to test photosensitive epilepsy, a form of epilepsy where seizures are stimulated by light. While an EEG typically tests varied frequencies of a light stimulus, musicogenic seizures are stimulated differently by music. Moreover, there may be a time period delay between the music or sound stimulus received and seizure triggered. The time gap between the stimulus and the response heightens the challenge of diagnoses. Recent hypotheses recommended testing routine electroencephalography (REEG) or amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (AEEG) to test music-evoked seizures. However, further obstacles arise in deducing the type of sound, song, and style of music which affects the patients suffering from musicogenic seizures. There is a large range of possible sounds that may trigger musicogenic seizures, such as church bells, a song associated with nostalgia, dissonant sounds, and classical music. ==Treatment == Illustration of deep brain stimulation Once the patient is diagnosed with the disease, there are diverse interventions that patients can choose from including surgical, behavioral, and medicinal treatments. ===Surgery=== Surgical intervention is suitable for patients with refractory epilepsy. Specifically, the patients undergo partial resectioning of the part of the brain that generates a seizure. This region is identified by imaging techniques like EEG. For patients who are not suitable to undergo a resectioning treatment, deep brain stimulation and vagus nerve stimulation may be effective alternatives; however, results suggest that it is often difficult for both deep brain and vagus nerve stimulation to completely stop seizures. ===Behavioral therapy=== Behavioral or psychotherapeutic interventions may be effective in treating musicogenic epilepsy. These therapies work by helping patients gain emotional control and thereby reducing the frequency of seizure. In fact, many patients often assert that their seizures are stopped after this behavioral therapy. left ===Medicine=== Many pharmacological interventions have shown positive results. Often carbamazepine, phenytoin, and lamotrigine, commonly used for general epilepsy treatment, are prescribed to patients with music-induced seizure. In some patients, these medications show better results when combined with oxcarbazepine, sodium valproate, or levetiracetam, which are also other medications for general epilepsy treatment. ==Epidemiology== Globally, epilepsy and seizures are among the most severe of the common neurological disorders . Active epilepsy, defined as people who have continuing seizures or require treatment, can be found in 4-10 individuals per 1000 worldwide. A higher prevalence has been reported in low- income and middle-income countries at 7 to 15 cases of active epilepsy per 1000 individuals. Musicogenic epilepsy is a rare subtype of these, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 10,000,000 individuals. The actual prevalence is perceived to be greater than reported. Due to the limited number of reported cases, insufficient research has been conducted on musicogenic seizures and musicogenic epilepsy. It has been suggested that the disorder has a higher tendency to affect females, while the average age of onset is 28. Nonetheless, the age of presentation is usually at 39, therefore suggesting an underestimated prevalence. Moreover, the underestimated prevalence of musicogenic seizures could also be due to challenges in diagnosis such as deducing music as a seizure trigger. == References == Category:Seizure types ","title":"Musicogenic seizure"},{"id":"60318670","text":"Manuel Rodrigues may refer to: *Manuel Rodrigues (footballer, born 1905) (1905-deceased), Portuguese footballer who played as a forward *Manuel C.

After 70 years of bringing logs from nearby forests to local sawmills, the former railroad right of way was converted to the OC&E; Woods Line State Trail. ==Early history== In 1919, Robert E. Strahorn, a free-lance railroad builder and promoter, formed the OC&E; by first acquiring an existing line, the Klamath Falls Municipal Railway, which ran between that city and Dairy. He planned to connect the OC&E; to the Southern Pacific Railroad at Klamath Falls, the Oregon Trunk Line at Bend, the Union Pacific at Crane, and the Nevada‚ÄìCalifornia‚ÄìOregon Railway at Lakeview. After establishing these connections, he hoped to sell the OC&E; to one of the major railways. Using operating revenues provided by twelve different logging companies along the route, by 1923 the line had been extended from Dairy to milepost 39 at Sprague River where a 1.63% westbound grade with two temporary switchbacks was built over Bly Mountain until money was available to bore a tunnel. The tunnel was never built, so operations continued through the summit switchback and a second switchback to the east. Strahorn sold the OC&E; to Southern Pacific in 1925. Construction of the OC&E; reached Bly in 1927. Southern Pacific sold a half-interest in the line to the Great Northern Railway in 1928. Southern Pacific and Great Northern alternated operating the OC&E; for five-year periods. Trains pulled 8,000 carloads of logs annually using class O 2-8-2s and class F 2-8-0s during Great Northern management and class AC-1, AC-2 and AC-3 2-8-8-2s during Southern Pacific management. Both companies later used EMD SD9s and GP9s. ==Logging branch lines== A number of branch lines were built by logging companies to bring logs to the OC&E; main line. Shaw-Bertram Lumber Company operated Shay locomotives from 1926 into the 1930s over of grades as steep as 5% connecting with OC&E; just below the west switchback. Between 1922 and 1948 Ewauna Box Company operated a line northwest from Sprague River and an line east from Bly. From 1929 to 1934 Pelican Bay Lumber operated a line southeast from Bly. Until 1943 Crater Lake Lumber operated a line southeast from Sprague River. The largest and longest lasting connection was the Weyerhaeuser Woods Line extending north from Sycan to a place called 500 Transfer with branches serving logging camps 6, 9, and 15. Weyerhauser used two 2-8-2s and five 2-6-6-2s until steam was replaced by two Baldwin DS-4-4-750s and two Baldwin S-8s in 1950. ==Weyerhaeuser ownership== Log carloads increased to 18,000 annually as housing construction increased in the 1960s. Weyerhaeuser upgraded the mill at Bly and purchased the OC&E; in 1975. Weyerhaeuser used three GP9s on the Woods Line and MK Rail rebuilt locomotives on the OC&E; main line pulling a fleet of 329 log cars in addition to the cars carrying mill products for interchange with other railroads. Annual car loadings peaked at 35,000 in the late 1970s including 4,000 loads of lumber and wood chips from the mill at Bly. Car loadings dropped to less than half that number in the early 1980s, and when local forests had been completely harvested Weyerhaeuser ceased operations on 1 May 1990. The line's right of way was railbanked in 1992 to the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department, which converted it and the right of way of the Woods Line into the OC&E; Woods Line State Trail. == See also == * Rail trail ==References== Category:Transportation in Klamath County, Oregon Category:1919 establishments in Oregon Category:Railways with Zig Zags ","title":"Oregon, California and Eastern Railway"},{"id":"60318749","text":"Kikas may refer to: *Kikas Gomes (born 1980), Angolan basketball player *Kikas (Angolan footballer) (born 1981), Angolan footballer *Kikas (footballer, born 1991), Portuguese footballer who plays as a midfielder *Frederico Morais (born 1992), Portuguese surfer also known as Kikas *Kikas (footballer, born 1998), Portuguese footballer who plays as a forward ==See also== * Don Kikas (born 1974), Angolan singer * Kika (disambiguation) ","title":"Kikas"},{"id":"60318766","text":"The 1986‚Äì87 Idaho Vandals men's basketball team represented the University of Idaho during the 1986‚Äì87 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.

He has been married to Vedika Tripathi, a physics tuition teacher from Lucknow, for three years at the time of the story. Chintu is happy in Kanpur, but he is harassed by his controlling parents for not planning a child, and by Vedika who wants to move to a big city. He often seeks advice from his PWD colleague and childhood friend Fahim Rizvi. Bored in his day-to- day life, Chintu suddenly finds comfort in Tapasya Singh, a young wannabe fashion designer from Delhi he met at his office, who is related to his boss and briefly came to select a plot for starting her fashion business. From the day Tapasya compliments him about his smile, Chintu finds himself drawn towards Tapasya and decides to enjoy his life. At a hotel pool, he lies to her that Vedika is having an affair with a certain Rakesh Yadav, who is actually a student of her class besotten with her. Fahim is peeved when he comes to know of the matter, and laments that, in trying to save Chintu repeatedly from various situations, he will himself fall into serious trouble. One day, Chintu is having lunch with Tapasya in his office, when Vedika calls him to tells him that she is arriving with her own lunch. With Fahim's help, Chintu successfully wards off Tapasya in time. On another day, Chintu takes Tapasya out for lunch to a mall, but when he hears that Vedika is shopping at the same mall for her cousin Kanupriya's wedding, he takes Tapasya to another mall for lunch followed by a bowling session, only for Vedika to catch the two together from afar. She keeps the secret of his infidelity to herself. Seeing him lying to her of throwing her off the scent, Vedika leaves home early to attend Kanupriya's wedding. There she discovers her ex-boyfriend Doga, a local bad boy whom she had left for Chintu, and the two resolve to leave the country. Meanwhile Chintu goes to Tapasya's home in Delhi and meets her friends. They go to a nightclub and party; upon returning home, she seduces a drunken Chintu and is ready to kiss him, but Chintu is held by his conscience. Chintu realises he has wronged Vedika, but it is too late, as when she returns, she tells him that she is leaving him and knows of his infidelity. He gets mad at Fahim when he reveals that his ex-girlfriend Neha had cheated on him with Fahim, and ditched him without a reason. A distraught Chintu and Fahim visit Vedika's parents but they give them her letter, wherein she states that she is eloping with Doga, whom she truly loves. At Doga's travel agency, the two are roughed up by Doga's henchmen, but the police lets them go. When he visits Tapasya at her home and warns her that she cannot take Vedika's place in his life, she asks him why he chooses to remain unhappy when she is there for him. In a drunken rage he smashes Doga's shop and is arrested, but Fahim pays for his bail. One morning, Rakesh Yadav, a flirt and Vedika's student, who has come with Fahim, finds a morose and depressed Chintu at his home and informs him that Vedika is leaving for Canada for good. The three rush to the Lucknow airport, with Chintu's family and the police in hot pursuit. At the airport, Chintu finds Vedika, Tapasya and Doga. He tries to stop them, but Tapasya spares him, saying that she will not get physical with him because he did not while in Delhi. He finds out that it is Doga who is going to Canada and that this was Doga's plan to make him realise Vedika's worth. Vedika forgives him and they reconcile. Eventually another girl, Neha Khanna, enters his office; he initially falls for her but restrains himself and refers her to another department. As she goes out the door, he calls out her name while she calls him a 'weirdo' to herself. == Cast == *Kartik Aaryan as Abhinav \\"Chintu\\" Tyagi *Bhumi Pednekar as Vedika Tyagi (n√©e Tripathi) *Ananya Panday as Tapasya Singh *Aparshakti Khurana as Fahim Abdul Rizvi: Chintu's friend *Manu Rishi as Inspector Mukhtar Singh *Rajesh Sharma as Prem Tripathi,Vedika's father *K.

This was also the first yoga book to be illustrated with photographs. He travelled India with the bodybuilder K. V. Iyer, helping to popularise the new blend of hatha yoga and physical culture. ==Life== Seetharaman Sundaram was born in Mathurai, Tamil Nadu in a Brahmin family. He trained as a lawyer and worked in law throughout his career. He ran the Yogic School of Physical Culture (also called the Sri Sundara Yoga Shala) in Bangalore in the 1930s, and travelled around India with the bodybuilder K. V. Iyer doing lecture/demonstrations, Iyer on muscles, Sundaram on yoga. His legal colleagues did not know that he was revered as a yoga guru; in 1949, a retired high court judge was astonished to see Sundaram being seen off at Madras's Central Railway Station by a crowd of wealthy and powerful people, prostrating before the garlanded figure of the man he knew as a lawyer. ==Yogic Physical Culture== In 1928 he published Yogic Physical Culture, describing a modernised hatha yoga reworked as a combination of gymnastics, bodybuilding, and hygiene, illustrated with photographs. It explicitly references contemporary Western physical culture as well as traditional Indian philosophy; and it goes along with Indian nationalism by stating that the \\"sons of India\\" will need to combine yoga asanas with bodybuilding to \\"obtain super-strength to make their Mother [India] an equal sister among Nations!\\" The language of the book, with phrases like \\"Physical Culture Religion\\", also echoes the bodybuilder Eugen Sandow's idea of making the body holy through physical fitness. In Sundaram's view, argues the yoga scholar Mark Singleton, the \\"tinge of religion\\" (Sundaram's phrase) makes yoga different from and superior to the purely material Western forms of exercise. The book describes just 13 asanas: the eleven covered by Kuvalayananda in his 1926 book, plus Trikonasana and Padahastasana. Sundaram stated that these provided a complete workout for \\"an average man of health\\". Kuvalayananda also included in his selection from hatha yoga's techniques one bandha, one mudra, one kriya, and two pranayama exercises. The format, essentially a field guide with the name of each item, a description in text, and a photograph, was adopted by all later yoga manuals including Light on Yoga. It introduces a procedural innovation, too, creating stages in the adoption of each asana, something entirely missing from medieval texts like the Hatha Yoga Pradipika. The photographs are all of Sundaram himself, presented not as a new system like that of Sandow and the other bodybuilders like Bernarr Macfadden (whom Sundaram references), but as of Sundaram's way of practising an age-old system. The effect was to demystify the asanas: they turned from difficult, strange, even repulsive spiritual practices into mere exercises. In Elliott Goldberg's view, Sundaram's detailed instructions moved the practice of asanas from what had \\"in all likelihood\\" been perfunctory and haphazard towards the precision of modern yoga, in which close attention is paid to the tensions in individual muscles. This approach, Goldberg argues, led to executing the asanas slowly and under control, observing one's body and making necessary adjustments accordingly to achieve correct alignment. All of this facilitated total absorption in the task of performing each asana properly, which in turn allowed the practitioner to go beyond pain or pleasure to the absolute. ==Legacy== Dr. Asana Andiappan, founder of the Sundara Yoga and Natural Living Trust and the monthly Asana International Yoga Journal, studied yoga under Sundaram as a child. ==Works== * 1928 Yogic Physical Culture or the Secret of Happiness.

They were commissioned in 1591 by the Lord High Admiral, Howard of Effingham, who had commanded the Royal Navy against the Armada.Phillis Rogers, 'The Armada tapestries in the House of Lords', RSA Journal Vol. 136, No. 5386 (September 1988), p. 731. The Queen's Surveyor of Buildings, Robert Adams, had been instructed by Effingham shortly after the battle to make charts of the engagements between the English and Spanish navies. The Dutch painter Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom used these as his guide for the design of the tapestries and they were made in the Delft workshops of Fran√ßois Spierincx. In 1595 Effingham paid ¬£1,582 for the completed tapestries and in 1612 he sold them to James I for ¬£1,628-8-0.Rogers, p. 732. In 1649, after the execution of Charles I, Parliament ordered inventories of the goods belonging to Charles to be drawn up in preparation for their sale. The tapestries were listed at the Royal Wardrobe in the Tower of London and were valued at ¬£2,113-10-0. However, the Council of State decided to retain the tapestries for Oliver Cromwell's use in Whitehall. In 1651 they were hung in the recently abolished House of Lords, which was used for the meetings of the committee of Parliament. They remained there until destroyed in the Burning of Parliament of 1834. In 1739 John Pine made engravings of the tapestries based on the drawings of Clement Lempri√®re.Rogers, p. 733. The tapestries can be seen in John Singleton Copley's painting The Death of the Earl of Chatham.Karen Hearn, '\\"Elizabeth I and the Spanish Armada\\": A Painting and Its Afterlife', Transactions of the Royal Historical Society Vol. 14 (2004), p. 134. ==Gallery== File:The Tapestry Hangings of the House of Lords Representing the Several Engagements Between the English and Spanish Fleets...

Motagua. ==Career== ===Motagua=== A product of Motagua's youth academy, Romero made his league debut for the club on 15 January 2017, coming on as a 78th-minute substitute for Kevin L√≥pez in a 3-1 home victory over Honduras Progreso. He was included on the bench in a grand total of five matches during the 2016‚Äì17 season, with just one more of those resulting in an appearance. That was a five-minute stint having replaced Marco Tulio Vega in a 2-0 victory over Marath√≥n on February 12. During the 2017‚Äì18 season, Romero made just one first-team league appearance, which was also his first start for the club in the league. He tallied 53 minutes in a 1-0 away victory over Juticalpa on 14 February 2018, being replaced by Erick Andino. ===Colorado Springs Switchbacks=== In March 2019, Romero was loaned to Colorado Springs Switchbacks of the USL Championship ahead of the 2019 season. Romero missed the first two matches of the 2019 season as his loan move wasn't completed in time, so he made his debut for the club on 23 March 2019 in a 1-0 victory over San Antonio. He made a near-instant impact, scoring the match's lone goal in the 86th minute with a long-range effort just four minutes after coming on in place of Mike Seth. Romero made another substitute appearance the next week against Phoenix Rising before being awarded a start against Orange County on April 6, his first for the club. He registered 67 minutes before being replaced by Kwasi Donsu. He made three more appearances for the club, one start and two subs, before leaving for the U-20 World Cup. Romero's first appearance back from the U-20 World Cup was a ten-minute substitute appearance on 13 July 2019 in a 1-0 home victory over Tulsa. Two days later, Romero was included in the Colorado Rapids squad for a 3-0 friendly defeat against Arsenal, coming on in the 78th minute for Kofi Opare. Throughout the remainder of his loan, Romero made three more starts, against Real Monarchs on August 2, Austin Bold on September 7, and New Mexico United the week after. Romero scored his second and final goal of the loan in that start against Austin Bold, in the 41st minute of a 1-1 draw. ===Real de Minas=== In January 2020, Romero was loaned out to Honduran club Real de Minas. He made his league debut for the club on 8 February 2020, coming on as a late substitute for Christian Persie in a 1-1 draw with Vida. ===International=== Romero was included in the Honduras squad for the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup. He made a substitute appearance in the opening match of the group stage, coming on as a 66th minute substitute for Luis Palma in a 5-0 defeat to New Zealand. He started the second match, a 2-0 defeat to Uruguay, but wasn't involved in the final group match, the 12-0 defeat to Norway. ==References== ==External links== *Cesar Miguel Romero at USL Championship Category:1999 births Category:Living people Category:F.C.

By 1801, the family had moved to Dijon. He moved at a young age to Germany to work at a commercial house, but returned to France after going bankrupt. There he worked as a peddler and bookkeeper in Saint-√âtienne, while serving as head of the Jewish community of nearby Lyon. Cr√©hange moved to Paris in the 1830s. A supporter of the French Revolution of 1848, he published \\"La Marseillaise du travail\\", in which he provided new words to La Marseillaise to celebrate the cause of the proletariat, and a pamphlet purporting to show how the Tanakh prescribes a republic as the optimal form of government. At the same time, he became the spokesman for the Parisian Orthodox community in a series of disputes with the Consistoire central, which he saw as representing the interests of the Jewish elite. In 1848 he organized the Club d√©mocratique des fid√®les, which promoted republicanism and civic responsibility, and started a weekly periodical, La V√©rit√©, in which he defended the rights of the Orthodox. He ardently lobbied for the introduction of universal male suffrance in consistorial elections. Cr√©hange also advocated against the heavy taxes imposed by the Consistoire on meat sold by butchers that it authorized as kosher, the sale of seats and aliyot in the synagogue, the costly dues for burial rites and plots, and the ban on private prayer assemblies. Cr√©hange was one of the ten founders of the Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle, of which he served as vice-president in 1863‚Äì1864, and would later become secretary of the Comit√© de Bienfaisance Isra√©lite and the Consistoire central. ==Publications== Cr√©hange translated and edited a number of liturgical volumes during the Second Empire. In 1846, Cr√©hange published in two volumes a French translation of the Tseno Ureno under the title La Semaine Isra√©lite, ou le Tze√©na Our√©na Moderne, Entretiens de Josu√© Hadass avec sa Famille sur les Saintes Eƒáritures. He also published a translation into French of the Hagaddah (1847); a book of prayers of the French Jews entitled Tefillat 'Adat Yeshurun (1850); Min·∏•ah ·∏§adashah, prayers of the Sephardic Jews (1855); an illustrated translation of Tehillim (1858); festival prayers for the use of Franco-Spanish and Franco- Portuguese Jews (6 vols., 1861‚Äì63); and from 1850 to 1872 an almanac, Annuaire Parisien. He edited two periodicals: La paix, revue religieuse, morale et litt√©raire (1846) and Annuaire parisien du culte isra√©lite (1851‚Äì71). ==References== Category:1791 births Category:1872 deaths Category:Bookkeepers Category:French Orthodox Jews Category:Print editors Category:Translators from Hebrew Category:Translators from Yiddish ","title":"Alexandre Cr√©hange"},{"id":"60318929","text":"Karl Bielser (1903‚Äì?) was a Swiss footballer who played for FC Basel. He played mainly in the position of forward, later as a defender. ==Club career== Between the years 1916 and 1936 Bielser played a total of 461 games for Basel, scoring a total of 86 goals. 268 of these games were in the Swiss Nationalliga, 23 were in the 1 Liga (second highest tier) and 32 were in the Swiss Cup. The other 136 were friendly games. He scored 43 goals in the domestic league, twelve in the Swiss Cup and the other 30 were scored during the test games. A well-documented curiosity was that at the end of Basel's 1929‚Äì30 season, the team set off on a Scandinavian football tour, including a visit to Germany. Six games were played in Norway, but the first was played in Leipzig. The team travelled with 15 players, their trainer Kert√©sz and two functionaries. The journey started with a train ride on 2 June 1930 at quarter past seven in the morning from Basel and they arrived in Leipzig at half passed eight that evening. The game against VfB Leipzig was played the next evening. The following one and a half days were spent travelling by train, train, ship, train and train again to Drammen in Norway. Only a few hours after their arrival, the team played a game against a joint team Mj√∏ndalen IF / SBK Drafn. The next day was a train journey to Porsgrunn and two matches in 24 hours. Following that they travelled per bus and then by ship in a 48-hour journey to Bergen for a match against SK Brann. Another ship voyage, this time to Stavanger, two games against Viking FK, then a ship voyage back to Bergen. Finally, the tour ended with three train journeys in three days, Bergen/Oslo/Berlin/Basel, arriving at home on 20 June. The result of this tour was seven games, four wins, one draw, two defeats and approximately 160 hours of travelling. Bielser was member of this tour. He played in all seven games and scored four goals. Bielser was a member of the Basel team that won the Swiss Cup in the 1932‚Äì33 season. The final was played in the Hardturm stadium against Grasshopper Club. Basel won 4‚Äì3 and achieved the club's first ever national title. ==International career== Bielser played a total of eight games for the Swiss national team.

A native either of Lempster, New Hampshire, or of Westchester, New York, Honeywell was born without hands or forearms, and had only three toes on one foot. One of her advertisements claimed she stood only three feet tall. She was known for her silhouettes, paper cutouts, needlework, and penmanship. Honeywell became a public performer around the United States, displaying her talents. During one such display, recorded by diarist William Bentley, she threaded a needle and embroidered with her toes and mouth; balanced scissors with her mouth and arm stump to make paper cutouts; and wrote a letter with her toes. Besides silhouettes, another of her specialties was a cutout with a handwritten version of the Lord's Prayer at its center. Many of her public appearances are documented in newspaper advertisements and other similar documents.

The arches of the nave rested on columns, while the outer walls were reinforced by pilasters. To the east, the chevet was composed of two rectangular apses framing a semicircular central apse. The two rectangular apses connected to the lateral aisles, and the south room was also open to the central apse, serving as a martyrium.

Geers Winford was the eldest son of Timothy Geers of Bridge Sollers and his wife Mercy Winford, daughter of Henry Winford of Glasshampton, Worcestershire. He was admitted at Lincolns Inn on 23 June 1719 and called to the bar in 1722. Geers was returned as a Tory Member of Parliament for Hereford on a compromise at the 1727 British general election. He voted consistently with the Opposition and spoke occasionally. On 4 February1730 he moved unsuccessfully for a vote of thanks to Dr. Samuel Croxall for his sermon preached at St. Margaret's, Westminster on the anniversary of the beheading of Charles I. This was based on the text ‚Äòtake the wicked from before the King and His throne shall be established as righteousness‚Äô and intended as an allusion to Walpole. Geers married Sarah Lutwyche, third daughter of Thomas Lutwyche of Lutwyche Hall, Shropshire in April 1731 and, on his marriage, his uncle, Sir Thomas Cookes Winford, 2nd Baronet MP, gave him the estate of Glasshampton and Geers adopted the name of Winford. His uncle died without issue 19 January 1743, and the baronetcy became extinct. Geers did not stand at the 1734 British general election, but was returned in a contest for Hereford at the 1741 British general election, with his cousin, Edward Hopton. In about 1745 he became Town clerk of Worcester, retaining the post for the rest of his life. At the 1747 British general election he was returned in a contest for Worcester but was unseated on petition on 11 February 1748. .

Incluye un PDF con el texto de la ley y su an√°lisis jur√≠dico It replaced the 1933 Law on Vagrants and Criminals (la ley de vagos y maleantes) which sought to punish and exclude \\"antisocial\\" members of society, such as beggars, vandals, drug traffickers, pornographers, prostitutes, pimps and illegal immigrants. Although the jurisdiction of the Law of Vagrants and Criminals was officially extended in 1954 to include homosexuals as ‚Äúantisocial‚Äù members of society, the law never targeted them specifically. The Law of Danger and Social Rehabilitation went a step further than the Law of Vagrants and Criminals, specifically criminalizing homosexuality and establishing a spectrum of punishments for citizens caught engaged in homosexual acts. The law was passed in 1970, just a year after the Stonewall Uprising in New York City, whose legacy set into motion a series of gay rights movements around the world. == Punishments and Prosecution == Under the Law on Social Danger and Rehabilitation, official punishments for homosexuality included internment in rehabilitation establishments for periods lasting between six months and five years, exclusion from visiting certain public spaces or from living in specific neighborhoods, and possible prison time. The regime justified these conditions by framing homosexuality as a disease and popularizing a discourse centered on the \\"inherent perversion\\" of homosexuals, who were painted as a threat to society, and particularly to young people. The law perpetuated a widespread fear of public scandal and political persecution throughout the queer community of Spain. It is speculated that Spanish poet Federico Garc√≠a Lorca was assassinated for a double crime of being homosexual and having radical beliefs that contradicted those of Franco's regime. == Post-Francoist Spain == Even after Franco's death, Spanish legislation often did not work in favor of the rights of the queer community. The 1975 general pardon and the 1977 amnesty law did not extend to those citizens who had been punished under the Law of Social Danger and Rehabilitation. Along with the ratification of a new democratic constitution in Spain on November 6, 1978, the Law of Social Danger was overturned, as Judge Miguel Lop√©z Mu√±iz argued that it was a \\"product of the Franquista regime,\\" but many homosexual prisoners were not released until a year later, in 1979. In January 1979, several articles of the law were repealed, among them one referring to \\"acts of homosexuality,‚Äù and ultimately the law's full repeal was achieved in 1989.Loewenberg, Samuel\\"Spain's Dark Past, Bright Future: Antonio Ruiz Was Imprisoned for Being Gay under a Brutal Spanish Regime.

He was mayor of Queenborough several times. Evans was returned as Member of Parliament for Queenborough on his own interest with government support at a by-election on 27 January 1729. He was returned again unopposed in 1734 and 1741 and in a contest in 1747. He was also able to secure the return of other government nominees and Pelham commended his ability to settle the interest in Whig hands. However, in 1750 there was a dispute with some of the townsmen on non-resident freemen and Pelham, referring to Evans as a strange fellow, saw him as likely to lose the seat for the Whigs. After Pelham's death, Newcastle persuaded Evans to withdraw at the 1754 British general election although occasionally taking his advice on local patronage. Evans was married and died on 22 November 1762, leaving a son and two daughters.

Construction began in 1647 under the direction of Ant√≥nio Lu√≠s de Meneses and was completed in 1659. ==History== The fort was designed in a polygonal, Mannerist style. It was built during the Portuguese Restoration War (1640-68) on the instructions of King D. Jo√£o IV, with the purpose of reinforcing the defence of the Tagus estuary already being provided by the nearby Fort of S√£o Juli√£o da Barra and the Fort of S√£o Louren√ßo do Bugio, situated in the estuary, and thereby controlling access to the capital Lisbon. By 1735 it was reportedly in a bad condition, with the main door needing to be replaced. Further work was deemed urgently required in 1751. It was garrisoned during the Spanish‚ÄìPortuguese War (1762-63), being armed with seven working cannon. The Fort of Santo Amaro was decommissioned in 1768 but by the end of the 18th century it again had a garrison, of six gunners with six cannon. Early in the 19th century it was manned by 20 soldiers who were military invalids. The fort was abandoned in 1833 during the Portuguese Civil War (1828-1834). By 1896 it was occupied only by a soldier with his family. During World War II, five families were living in the fort in 1945. Twenty-seven adults and several children were found to be there in 1947. This number amounted to about fifty individuals in 1950, when eviction proceedings were begun. In the late 1950s considerable conservation and improvement work was undertaken and in 1961 and 1962 the fort was used as summer residence of the Minister of the Army. After the Carnation Revolution (1974), which saw the overthrow of the Estado Novo dictatorship, Santo Amaro was used as a place for political meetings. For security reasons an external wall was built, giving a misleading idea of its design from outside. In the 1980s it was used as holiday colony for children of public servants. In December 2010 the government authorized the fort‚Äôs sale. ==References== * Santo Amaro Category:Buildings and structures in Oeiras, Portugal ","title":"Fort of Santo Amaro do Areeiro"},{"id":"60319415","text":"Bioz is a search engine for life science experimentation. ==History== Bioz was founded by Karin Lachmi and Daniel Levitt.

It used to be known as Searlesia dira and Buccinum dirum before being transferred to the genus Lirabuccinum. ==Taxonomy and nomenclature== The dire whelk was first described by Lovell Augustus Reeve in 1846 as Buccinum dirum. In the early 20th century, William Healey Dall would come to the conclusion that the species belong to a genus up until then known only from the Atlantic fossil record, Searlesia. This remained the status quo for most of the century, with more living species from both the Atlantic and Pacific added to Searlesia until 1991, when Geerat J. Vermeij split the Pacific species into a separate genus Lirabuccinum with B. dirum as its type. ==Description== L. dirum is a medium-sized, elongated whelk with a strong heavy shell, growing to a length of . There are four or five whorls separated by shallow grooves, and several rounded axial ribs, mainly on the spire. The first whorl of the shell (and the second whorl in young individuals) is sculptured with many narrow, evenly-spaced spiral ridges, which are also visible on the inside of the outer margin of the aperture. The aperture is an elongated oval-shape and can be closed with a horny operculum. There is a short siphonal canal to accommodate the siphon, and a polished columella with no folds. This snail is usually grey or brownish-grey, but is occasionally orangish. ==Distribution and habitat== This whelk is found in shallow waters in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Its range extends from the Chirikof Island in Alaska to Monterey Bay in central California. It is particularly common in British Columbia, Washington state and Oregon, but uncommon in California. It is found intertidally on rocky shores and in the shallow subtidal zone, and is found down to about on the Cobb Seamount. As well as occurring on rocks, it is sometimes found on gravel or mud close to the foot of rocks in bays. ==Ecology== L. dirum is a predator and scavenger. It feeds on winkles, limpets, mussels, barnacles, chitons, worms and other invertebrates. It seems to specialise on dead or injured prey, and does not seem able to drill into intact shells in the way that many whelks do. When living intertidally it is subject to variations in salinity, and is particularly tolerant of low salinities. In fact it seeks out low salinity environments where other less tolerant organisms are stressed. It also consumes carrion, and extends its proboscis to feed on tubeworms inside their tubes or to share the prey being digested by the everted stomach of the ochre sea star. ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Buccinidae Category:Molluscs of the Pacific Ocean Category:Gastropods described in 1846 Category:Taxa named by Lovell Augustus Reeve ","title":"Lirabuccinum dirum"},{"id":"60319462","text":"The following units of the British Armed Forces participated in the Battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815.

In August 2019, he was hospitalized and nearly lost his life after apparently suffering an overdose at a party. ==Artistry== Polo G was originally known for his Chicago drill sound, but eventually transitioned to a more melodic style. He has been noted for his \\"vivid and explicit storytelling\\"; his lyrics often involve tough subjects, including racism and mental health. He also regularly pays homage to his hometown, and, as noted by Ayana Rashed of Respect, \\"he is also quick to acknowledge the common injustice and frequent police brutality he and so many others face on the daily\\". He has stated that American rapper Lil Wayne and hip-hop icon Tupac Shakur are his biggest influences. He also grew up listening to Gucci Mane, as well as Chicago rappers Lil Durk, G Herbo and Chief Keef. ==Record label== In September 2020, Polo G announced the creation of his own record label, ODA, in partnership with Columbia Records. ODA stands for Only Dreamers Achieve Records, originating from Polo G's belief that \\"in our communities we are told what we can't be. I want to send the message that we control our futures and encourage artists to dream big\\". Polo G handles the label's daily operation, while searching for and developing new talent. He stated his motivation for creating the label: \\"Since I was a kid, I've always wanted a place where I could be creative and where I could work with other talented artists, to help the world see their talent. I'm happy to see this come to life\\". The first artist signed to ODA is Scorey, an artist from Syracuse, New York. == Discography == === Studio albums === { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Album details ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"8\\" Peak chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Certifications - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" US ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" US R&B;/HH ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" US Rap ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" AUS ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" CAN ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" NLD ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" NZ ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" UK - ! scope=\\"row\\" Die a Legend  * Released: June 7, 2019 * Label: Columbia * Format: Digital download, streaming  6  2  1  ‚Äî  8  83  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  *RIAA: Platinum * MC: Gold - ! scope=\\"row\\" The Goat  * Released: May 15, 2020 * Label: Columbia * Format: Digital download, streaming  2  2  2  10  2  11  20  6  *RIAA: Gold -  colspan=\\"11\\" style=\\"font- size:90%\\" \\"‚Äî\\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory. } ===Singles=== ====As lead artist==== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" +List of singles as lead artist, with selected chart positions and certifications shown ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Year ! colspan=\\"8\\" scope=\\"col\\" Peak chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Certifications ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Album - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" US ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" US R&B;/HH ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" US Rap ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" AUS ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" CAN ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" IRE ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" NZ Hot ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" UK - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Hollywood\\"  2018  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî   - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Finer Things\\"  rowspan=\\"6\\"  2019  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  *RIAA: Platinum * MC: Gold  rowspan=\\"5\\"  Die a Legend - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Battle Cry\\"  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  * RIAA: Gold - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Pop Out\\"  11  7  5  82  12  61  ‚Äî  41  * RIAA: 5√ó Platinum * ARIA: Gold * MC: 4√ó Platinum - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Deep Wounds\\"  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  * RIAA: Gold - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Pop Out Again\\"  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Heartless\\"  ‚Äî ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  * RIAA: Platinum  The Goat - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"First Place\\"  rowspan=\\"6\\" 2020  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî   - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Go Stupid\\"  60  29  20  ‚Äî  28  97  16  ‚Äî  * RIAA: Platinum * MC: Gold  rowspan=\\"4\\"  The Goat - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"DND\\"  84  37  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  33  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\"\\"Wishing for a Hero\\" ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  ‚Äî  29  ‚Äî  - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Martin & Gina\\"  61  22  22  ‚Äî  56  48  23  76  * RIAA: Gold - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Epidemic\\"  47  17  16  ‚Äî  41  46  8  54   -  colspan=\\"12\\" style=\\"font-size:90%\\" \\"‚Äî\\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory. } ====As featured artist==== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !

The forest occupies moorland north of the east- west Morpeth to Elsdon road, west of the B6342, extending north to the Simonside Hills; it measures some north-to-south and at its widest is east-to- west. The forest was established over the course of the 20th century by the Forestry Commission, which gradually purchased freehold or leasehold interest in farmland; at the start of the Commission's involvement, only of the current site was forested, with the remaining lands being utilised for sheep and cattle grazing. The initial impetus for its establishment was an offer made in 1929 by Sir Charles Trevelyan, 3rd Baronet to sell Harwood Farm to the Commission at less than market rate. Trevelyan had inherited Wallington Hall and estate on the death of his father, the 2nd Baronet, in August 1928, and wished to see the estate forested; and although he determined on large-scale planting on other, retained, parts of the estate, he determined that it was reasonable to make arrangements with the Commission to expedite his plan by transferring to it. The farm forms the trapezoid southernmost section of the forest. The next major acquisition was in 1950, when the Cragside estate of William John Montagu Watson-Armstrong, 2nd Baron Armstrong, leased to the commission, followed in 1951 by another , to form the Simonside section of the forest. This section is enclosed by the Simonside Hills, Simonside and Tosson Hill constraining the forest to a narrow neck-section, with additional forest to the north of Simonside. In the same year, 1951, the County Borough of Tyneside leased Chartners, a farm to the south of the Simonside section, which covered the high watershed of Fontburn Reservoir, to the Commission. Subsequent additions to the forest include Redpath farm, which joined the previously isolated Harwood farm area to Chartners and the Simonside section. ==References== ==External links== *Harwood Forest Plan, Forestry Commission Category:Forests and woodlands of Northumberland ","title":"Harwood Forest"},{"id":"60319732","text":"The 'St. Stanislaus Kostka Mission is a historic church building in Rathdrum, Idaho.

He spread his ministry, sailing her from 1827 to 1836 under a flag of a white dove on a blue background while subsidising his efforts by trading between the islands. John Williams around the time he built the Messenger of Peace Williams had earlier purchased Endeavour in 1821, meaning to supply missionaries in the islands \\"with the necessities of civilized life, including clothing, flour, tea, and sugar\\" and fund the operation by trade. However the LMS objected to such a strategy and had him sell the ship by 1827. Williams' presence in the South Seas, Tahiti, and Rarotonga spanned 1817 to 1839. He arrived in Rarotonga in 1827 and learnt of other islands in the vicinity where the inhabitants practised paganism. (He described them as \\"heathens\\".) To reach them, he built Messenger of Peace from local materials in fifteen weeks and then set sail for the Society Islands. ==Construction of the ship== The ship, a 70-ton fore-and- aft schooner in length, was built from a local mahogany called tamanu (Calophyllum inophyllum). The wood was not ideal for ship construction, and her masts were neither straight nor smooth. Also on hand was some scrapped ship's main cable, which he converted into iron bolting, using a stone anvil and charcoal instead of coal. They made the rudder fastenings from a piece of a pickaxe, a cooper's adze, and a large hoe. Ropes were made of fibres from hibiscus trees. He made her sails from matting. It took fifteen weeks to build, using no proper tools and no special knowledge in shipbuilding. What little knowledge he had had come from 1816 in Eimeo, the Society Islands, when he had found an incomplete ship used by earlier missionaries, which he repaired and made seaworthy, whereupon he christened her Haweis. This small but useful vessel was later given to a local chieftain as a matter of diplomacy. Williams had some help from fellow missionary Aaron Buzacott, and a reduced local workforce of former cannibals, as the majority of islanders were busy building housing elsewhere on the island. Over time some of this crude equipment was replaced by gifts from passing naval officers. ==Voyages== Once the ship was complete, and using verbal directions given to him (as was the custom) by the locals, he set sail and visited Aitutaki, Manuae, Mauke, Atiu, and Mangaia before returning to Rarotonga. A second voyage was taken to islands in the west. He returned in February 1828 and then removed his family to Raiatea. In mid 1830, the ship visited Samoa, where they were well received by the \\"heathens\\". ==Hurricane damage and repairs== The ship was repaired twice in Rarotonga on returns from the Friendly Islands. The first time, during 1832, Rarotonga had been hit by a particularly powerful hurricane, which greatly damaged the island's housing and pushed the ship onto the island, knocking branches off trees some off the ground. She came to rest in a hole she had made for herself. As Williams said later, \\"She had sustained no injury whatever\\". 2000 natives hauled her out and put her back into the sea. This delayed Williams' plans to visit Samoa for some months as all the parts of the ship, the store, masts, rigging, blocks, pitch, and copper were strewn over a wide area and had to be collected for the repair. They set sail on 11 October. The voyage was to last fifteen weeks, four of which were spent in the Samoan group. Then on her return journey to Rarotonga she sprung a leak from the Friendly Islands. The ship was half full of water, nearly deep in her hold. Strenuous efforts at baling her out over several days kept her afloat for landing at Vavau for repair. However the leak could not be found, and she made for another island in the group, where she sought help from two ships at anchor. With the help of their crews, Messenger of Peace was hove down, and the leak discovered‚Äîan augur hole missing its bolt had been filled with mud and stones from the hurricane earlier on Rarotonga. A stone had wedged itself sufficiently to have kept the hull from leaking for six months and several thousand miles on the sea. She returned to Rarotonga for extensive repairs in January 1833. This last experience, coupled with a need for the Williams family to return to England, convinced Williams that, despite several arduous voyages over six years, she was not fit for purpose and in need of replacement, so she was sent to Tahiti and sold in 1836. ==Legacy== The story of the Messenger of Peace had made Williams famous. On his return to England he set about raising funds for the purchase of a replacement. In 1838 the London Missionary Society purchased the brig Camden, of 192 or 194 tons (bm), built in 1809 at Falmouth as a Falmouth packet.Lloyd's Register (LR), (1820), \\"Falmouth Packets\\".LR (1838), Seq.‚ÑñC57. Camden sailed from London on 11 April 1838 and returned the Williams and eight other missionary families for duty in Africa, India, the Pacific Islands, and China, before returning to Williams for permanent station. Over the years seven LMS ships named John Williams carried on the work from 1844 to the last, John Williams VII, which was decommissioned in 1968. ==Gallery== File:The Messenger of Peace with sails made of matting (cropped).jpgMessenger of Peace with sails made of matting File:The Messenger of the Peace off the Samoas Page 87.jpgMessenger of Peace off the Samoas with new sails File:The Messenger of Peace leaving Aitutaki.

Soon after the publication, in October, he returned to his native Nizhny Novgorod. Instrumental in the publication was Alexander Kalyuzny, a leftist radical, who first encouraged his young friend to put to paper the story the latter had been relating to him verbally, and later handed the manuscript to his journalist friend Tsvetnitsky, who furthered it to the Kavkaz editors.

Noticing his guest's interest in his daughter Nonka's singing, Makar warns him against falling victim to female charms and relates a story of a strong, handsome and fearless man Loiko Zobar and Radda, the latter's beauty matched only by her fierce sense of independence. Radda, well aware of her power over Loiko, orders him to kneel before her, in the presence of other men. His spirits crushed, he promises to do so the next day. Which he does, but only after putting his knife through the heart of his beloved one, to be promptly killed by Danilo, Radda's father. The story ends with the narrator having a vision: bleeding Radda walking through the skies, and Loiko behind, never able to catch up with her. ==Adaptations== In 1976 the Emil Loteanu film Gypsies Are Found Near Heaven came out, based upon \\"Makar Chudra\\", although fragments of \\"Old Izergil\\", another early story by Gorky, were incorporated into the plotline too. ==References== ==External links== * –ú–∞–∫–∞—Ä –ß—É–¥—Ä–∞, the original Russian text Category:Works originally published in Russian newspapers Category:1892 short stories Category:Maxim Gorky ","title":"Makar Chudra"},{"id":"60319789","text":"Georg Utz (born 22 August 1935) is a German wrestler.

The Political Constitution of Costa Rica of 1871 has been the longest duration Constitution in the history of the country, as except for brief periods, it was in force between 1871 and 1949. Influenced by the Liberals, the Constitution of 1871 was quite pioneering for the time and, among other things, abolished the death penalty, decreed the freedom of religion, strengthened education and separated the three branches of the Republic. ==History== In 1870 the provisional Costa Rican president Bruno Carranza Ram√≠rez called a Constituent Assembly shortly before resigning his post, which was assumed by General Tom√°s Guardia. This Assembly temporarily maintained the 1859 Constitution, however, Guardia dissolved that Assembly on October 10, 1870.

Soon the tensions between Guardia and the Carrancistas became obvious, so Guardia annulled the Assembly and called new elections using a different Electoral Law. While for the elections of 1870 Carranza used a law of its creation issued on June 20, 18701 that established as requirements to be able to vote be over 25 years, own a property valued at at least one thousand pesos or an annual income of five hundred and priests, soldiers and judicial officials were banned from voting. Guardia modified the law to call these elections establishing -among other things- the elimination of economic requirements and allowed members of the clergy, the judiciary and the military to vote and be elected deputies, likewise the requirements they were older than 25 years old, able to read and write and be a resident of the province where they voted. This National Constituent Convention successfully drafted the Constitution of 1871 that has been the longest lasting in the country. Except for a very short time Guardia would remain in power as a dictator until his death in 1882, during which time only calls for municipal elections, and two unsuccessful attempts to convene new constituents in 1876 and 1880 would be canceled. before being finalized by Guardia mainly for fear that they would be used by the opposition. ==References== Category:Constitutions of Costa Rica ","title":"Costa Rican Constitution of 1871"},{"id":"60319804","text":"Roger Karrer is a Swiss professional ice hockey defenceman who is currently playing with Gen√®ve-Servette HC of the National League (NL).

The tower was used as a hunting lodge in the 15th and 16th centuries, and despite a renovation in the 1650s, it fell into disrepair in the 18th century. The tower is now part of the Bolton Estate and is listed as a medieval fortified tower. Along with other buildings on the Bolton Estate, it is a focal point and many people visit the tower. It is also a way marker on the Lady Anne's Way long distance path. ==History== The tower is located equidistant between Bolton Bridge on the A59 road to the south, and the village of Burnsall to the north ( each way). A lodge of sorts had been located in the Forest of Barden since early Plantagenet times, but it was rebuilt in stone 1485-1490 by Henry Clifford, who was also known as the Lord Shepherd.This was a legend borne out by the supposition that as a boy, Clifford was at risk from his father's enemies and so was raised in shepherd's houses in and around Craven and Wharfedale. Modern scholars have cast doubt on this tale, although it is generally agreed that he was disinherited from his father's titles and estates after John Clifford was killed before the Battle of Towton. Henry Clifford was awarded the estates back after King Richard was killed in 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth. Clifford chose the area around Barden as his main residence over his castle at Skipton. Barden Tower was one of six forest lodges which were in the possession of the Clifford family between the 14th and 17th centuries. Besides Barden, the Cliffords had lodges at Drebley, Gamsworth, Howgill and Laund. The sixth lodge at a site known as Ungaine, has not yet been identified.Speight lays claim to Ungaine (Ungayne) being directly east of the Priory at Bolton on the left bank of the river. The tower became the focal point for the hamlets and farmhouses in the area; because there was no nuclear village to gather to, the tower became a de facto village centre. The tower, along with the chapel next to it and Skipton Castle, were renovated and rebuilt by Lady Anne Clifford in the 1650s. The tower had been \\"de-roofed\\" during the Civil War; the roof was believed to have been made of thatch (a request from the 15th century states a claim for \\"soddes for the towre toppe\\"). It was in the 16th and 17th centuries that the outbuildings of a farmhouse and chapel were built next to the tower. The priesthouse has been tentatively dated to 1513, and was reputedly built by Henry Clifford for his private chaplain when the Clifford household were in residence at the tower. After Lady Anne's death in 1676, the estates and Barden Tower were taken over by the Earls of Cork and fell into disrepair in the 18th century. The tower has been in a ruinous state for over 200 years. During the Jacobite rising of 1745, a band of militia were garrisoned at the tower to defend the area against the Scots army, should they so be needed. 150 men with pikes, staffs, halberts and drums were recorded as being present at the tower. Whilst the Jacobite Army did go through Yorkshire, there is no record of Barden Tower being involved in any skirmishes. The second roof was made out of lead, and it was de-roofed again 1800, but the buildings were still the focal point for those who lived around it, which had become easier since the opening of Barden Bridge in 1659. There was a school and a chapel at the site, which were both used well into the 20th century (the chapel was last used in the 1960s for Anglican worship). Baptisms and burials were not permitted to take place at the chapel next to the tower, but marriages were conducted there. In 1881, a steam ship was named Barden Tower on the River Tyne in Northumberland. She sank in the English Channel in 1893. All three historical buildings on the site were grade I listed in 1954. The Priesthouse part of the buildings was converted in 2016 into a restaurant and wedding venue. The whole area around the tower, the land underneath the buildings and the tower, are listed together collectively as an ancient monument. It is a popular location for tourists and visitors, and is well signposted from the walks in the area, particularly those along the River Wharfe. ==Gallery== File:Barden Tower rear - geograph.org.uk - 188601.jpgBarden Tower rear File:Barden Tower from Barden Scale - geograph.org.uk - 1157687.jpgBarden Tower from Barden Scale File:Barden Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1651276.jpgBarden Tower File:Barden Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1651297.jpgBarden Tower File:Peter DeWint - Barden Tower, Yorkshire - Google Art Project.jpgPeter DeWint - Barden Tower, Yorkshire ==Notes== ==References== ===Sources=== * * ==External links== *Image of the tower on Historic England Category:Tower houses in the United Kingdom Category:Grade I listed buildings in North Yorkshire Category:Tourist attractions in North Yorkshire Category:Castles in North Yorkshire Category:Ruins in North Yorkshire Category:Towers in North Yorkshire Category:Grade I listed castles Category:Grade I listed towers Category:16th-century establishments in England Category:Wharfedale ","title":"Barden Tower"},{"id":"60319847","text":"Aleksandr Osipovich (; ; born 22 March 1977) is a Belarusian former professional footballer.

It was promulgated by then dictator Federico Tinoco Granados after the coup d'√©tat that overthrew Alfredo Gonz√°lez Flores in 1917. It was drafted by the ex- presidents Bernardo Soto Alfaro, Rafael Iglesias Castro, Ascensi√≥n Esquivel Ibarra, Cleto Gonz√°lez V√≠quez and Carlos Dur√°n Cart√≠n. The presidents Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Rodr√≠guez Zeled√≥n and Ricardo Jim√©nez Oreamuno were invited to participate in the process as others of their status, but they refused to do so with various excuses. This constitution has been considered by some scholars as very progressive, partly because of the status of its authors, besides contemplating an itinerary to return to democracy with elections starting in 1922. However, it had an ephemeral existence since Tinoco was overthrown by opposition forces shortly after the murder of his brother. The discredit that ended his regime also affected the reputation of the constitution, which was discarded by the one that had previously lived since 1871. ==History== The elections for constituent deputies of 1917 of Costa Rica were held on April 1 of that year at the same time as the presidential elections convened by the de facto president Federico Alberto Tinoco Granados. These elections were held in order to legitimize the regime that was imposed after the coup d'√©tat on January 27 of that same year. As was common in Costa Rica, a Constituent Assembly was convened by the coup leaders after the overthrow of a government, as happened with most constitutions, including the one still in force in 1949. The convocation was made according to the current electoral law and established that the number of deputies would be equal to that of the Parliament (42) and their election by province would also be the same. Tinoco was a unique candidate without rivals, postulated by the Peliquista Party that gravitated around him. Naturally this party also swept the elections, obtaining 40 of the 42 deputies, the other two being Otilio Ulate Blanco and Otto Cort√©s Fern√°ndez (son of future president Le√≥n Cort√©s Castro), elected by the Tinoquista Party. ==Content== The Constitution of 1917 established a bicameral parliament with a Congress of Deputies in which each province elected deputies proportionally to its population and a Senate with three senators by province. It also established a series of civil rights and the State duty of protecting the working class. ==References== Category:Constitutions of Costa Rica ","title":"Costa Rican Constitution of 1917"},{"id":"60319900","text":"350px La Tirana is a 1794 oil on canvas portrait by Francisco de Goya.

The Wilderness Society has designated the area as a ‚ÄúMountain Treasure‚Äù. Popular with hunters and anglers, the area has a National Recreation Trail that offers outstanding views of streams and waterfalls. The area is part of the Barbours Creek-Shawvers Run Cluster. ==Location and access== The area is located in the Appalachian Mountains of Southwestern Virginia, about 8 miles southeast of Covington, Virginia. It is bounded by Va 615 on the southeast and Va 621 on the northeast. Trails into the area include:, *Hoop Hole National Recreation Trail; Forest Trail 5001; 9.0 miles; difficult; blue-blazed; hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking *Iron Ore Trail, Forest Trail 5004; 2.4 miles; moderate; yellow blazed hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking A 1.1 mile section of The Potts Jeep Road, unimproved FDR 5036, is on the western edge of the area. The state of Virginia has designated Va 615 on the southeast as a Virginia Byway. The Roaring Run Trail and Roaring Run Recreation Area are on the northeastern corner of the area. Boundary of the Hoop Hole wildland as identified by the Wilderness SocietyThe boundary of the wildland, as determined by the Wilderness Society, is shown in the adjacent map. The map shows one-third of the area in the James River Ranger District of the George Washington National Forest and the two-thirds in the New Castle Ranger District of the Jefferson National Forest. Additional roads and trails are given on National Geographic Maps 788 (Covington, Alleghany Highlands). A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wild land's coordinates in the upper right of this page. Beyond maintained trails, old logging roads can be used to explore the area. The Appalachian Mountains were extensively timbered in the early twentieth century leaving logging roads that are becoming overgrown but still passable. Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The Hoop Hole wildarea is covered by USGS topographic map Strom. ==Natural history== The area is within the Ridge and Valley Subsection of the Northern Ridge and Valley Section in the Central Appalachian Broadleaf Coniferous Forest-Meadow Province. Yellow poplar, northern red oak, white oak, basswood, cucumber tree, white ash, eastern hemlock and red maple are found in colluvial drainages, toeslopes and along flood plains of small to medium-sized streams. White oak, northern red oak, and hickory dominate on the north and west, while chestnut oak, scarlet oak and yellow pine are found on ridgetops and midslopes on the south and east. Unusual flora and fauna found in the area include a globally rare shrub, the pirate bush; and an invertebrate the orangefin madtom. Featured species include bear, deer and grouse. There are stands of pure table mountain pine, mostly on southeast to southwest facing ridges and slopes with dry, well-drained soils; and there are areas of mixed oak and table mountain pine. Table mountain pine requires fire to regenerate because it has serotinous cones that need heat to open and disperse its seeds. Management of these areas require prescribed burns in order to maintain the forest in its present condition. Old growth trees 140 years old or older are in the George Washington National Forest section of the area. There have been numerous convictions for poaching in the area. ==Topography== The area is distinguished by ridges that trend northeast/southwest. The ridges, composed of sandstone or shale, have parallel drainages flowing into broad limestone valleys. Rich Patch, Pine and Deisher Mountains are typical with small steep sideslope drainages. The highest elevation is 3728 feet along the crest of Rich Patch Mountain while the lowest elevation of about 3000 feet is at Crawford Branch on the east. Silurian-aged sandstone underlays about 75 percent of the area, with the remaining area underlain by Brallier and Martinsburg shale. The area includes the headwaters of Hipes Branch, Stony Run, Wolf Branch, Crawford Branch, and Deisher Branch. ==Roaring Run Recreation Area== Located at the northeastern corner of the wild area, the Roaring Run Branch Recreation Area is a trailhead for the Iron Ore trail, as well as several trails leading along Roaring Run with views of Roaring Run Falls. The Roaring Run Wildflower Trail leads to a scenic waterfall where Roaring Run drops 35 feet over rock ledges. The moist environment along the trail and its orientation toward the sun create a habitat for the most diverse collection of wildflowers in the New Castle Ranger District. Among the flowers found here are the showy orchis, the crested dwarf iris, jack-in-the pulpit, bloodroot, black-eyed susan, trout lily and many varieties of trillium. The spring and summer season bring woodland birds including the wood thrush, ovenbird, white-eyed vireo, pine warblers, worm-eating warblers, blue-gray gnatcatchers, and white-breasted nuthatches. Roaring Run FurnaceThe remains of the Roaring Run Furnace are across the creek from the picnic area. In the early 1800s, the furnace was used to fire sandstone and quartzite containing iron ore from the mountain. When heated to 2600 degrees, molten iron flowed from the rock into trenches of sand. The iron then cooled and was formed into ingots to produce iron products such as stoves and skillets. Colorful marble- sized stones, a product of the slag formed during the heating of the rock, similar to the volcanic glass obsidian, can be found on the grounds about the furnace. ==Forest Service management== The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine the potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. Hoop Hole was inventoried in the roadless area review, and therefore protected from possible road construction and timber sales. The Hoop Hole Trail was used as a firebreak in the 50-acre Roaring Run fire in 2010. Since then, the trail has been restored. The forest service classifies areas under their management by a recreational opportunity setting that informs visitors of the diverse range of opportunities available in the forest. The area is classified as a ‚ÄúSpecial Area‚Äù with unique prescriptions. ==Cultural history== In a 1998 survey of five acres, three inventoried collier pits were found dating back to the latter 1800s. ==See also== Barbours Creek- Shawvers Run Cluster ==References== ==Further reading== * Stephenson, Steven L., A Natural History of the Central Appalachians, 2013, West Virginia University Press, West Virginia, . * Davis, Donald Edward, Where There Are Mountains, An Environmental History of the Southern Appalachians, 2000, University of Georgia Press, Athens, Georgia. . ==External links== * George Washington and Jefferson National Forest * Wilderness Society * Roaring Run Wildflower Trail Category:George Washington and Jefferson National Forests Category:Southwest Virginia Category:Protected areas of the Appalachians Category:Mountains of Virginia ","title":"Hoop hole"},{"id":"60319936","text":"Bailu () is a town under the administration of Guannan County, Jiangsu, China. , it has 24 villages under its administration. == References == Category:Township-level divisions of Jiangsu Category:Guannan County ","title":"Bailu, Jiangsu"},{"id":"60319948","text":"John Beaton (August 9, 1875 ‚Äì June 1945) was a gold miner and businessman whose discovery of gold in Flat, Alaska, began the Iditarod Gold Rush. == Gold mining == In 1908, Beaton began prospecting near Iditarod, Alaska, with his partner William A. Dikeman. Following an unavailing summer, they left the camp and drove a steam launch as far up the Iditarod River as they could manage. They beached the boat and built a cabin about south of Iditarod. On Christmas Day 1908, Beaton, Dikeman, and John's brother Murdock struck gold near the head of Otter Creek. By the summer of 1909, news of the find had spread, and other prospectors began to claim the remaining ground around Otter Creek, and founded a nearby camp named Flat. By the spring of 1910, the boomtown had a population of over 2,000. Otter Creek was eventually found to contain the widest paystreak ever mined in Alaska, and the area became the third-largest Alaskan placer mining site, after Fairbanks and Nome. Around 1937, Beaton sold his claims at Otter Creek, and began dredging on Ganes Creek in the Innoko District until World War II. == Personal life == John Beaton was born on August 9, 1875, to a Scottish Roman Catholic family in Judique, Nova Scotia, Canada. Beaton's grandfather, Angus Beaton, had immigrated to Pictou, Nova Scotia from the Isle of Skye in 1801. Beaton left Nova Scotia in 1899 for the Klondike, but found that the Klondike Gold Rush had largely ended. He arrived in Alaska in 1900, and his travels between then and 1908 are uncertain. Not long after the gold discovery at Flat, Beaton returned home to marry Florence MacLennan, a woman from Inverness County, but quickly brought her back to live at the mining camp. In 1918, Florence and two of their children died while passengers of the SS Princess Sophia, which sunk en route to Seattle. In 1924, Beaton married Mae, another woman from Nova Scotia. In 1936, Beaton and his family moved to Anchorage. In June 1945, Beaton and two other miners drowned in the Ganes Creek river after driving off of a bridge, apparently because the driver had a heart attack. Beaton is buried in Anchorage Memorial Park. In 2008, Alaska governor Sarah Palin honored his 1908 co-discovery of gold by naming an \\"Iditarod Gold Discovery Day\\". == References == Category:1875 births Category:1945 deaths Category:People from Inverness County, Nova Scotia Category:Gold mining in Alaska Category:Businesspeople from Nova Scotia Category:Canadian Roman Catholics Category:Road incident deaths in Alaska Category:Deaths by drowning Category:Canadian people of Scottish descent ","title":"John Beaton (miner)"},{"id":"60319951","text":"General elections were held in Mozambique on 15 October 2019.Mozambique sets October 2019 for general elections News24, 11 April 2018 The elections were marked by assassinations and significant intimidation of prominent leaders of opposition parties and election observers.

Raja was an artist who explored the intersections between art, craft, and technology, and the gaps that open up as information travels and is represented through images. He participated in numerous international solo exhibitions and was a lecturer at the Yale School of Art. == Early life and education == Kanisha Raja was born in 1970 in Calcutta, India. Raja was the son of influential textile designers. In a 2005 interview Raja explains how his parents \\"built something that‚Äôs lasted 45 years...it was the first model for me of how to be and live as an artist in the world.\\" Raja moved to the United States in 1987 to pursue his studies, living in Massachusetts and Texas before settling in New York with his wife and partner, designer Juli Raja. Kanishka Raja received his BA from Hampshire College and his MFA from The Meadows School of the Arts, Southern Methodist University in Dallas In 1995. During the summer of 2000, he attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, in Maine. == Art == Kanishka Raja was an artist whose practice explored the intersection of representation, craft, and technology, and the gaps that occur in the transmission of information. Raja created paintings, drawings, murals, sculptures, installations, and public art that moved between abstraction and representation, architecture and ornament, formalist strategies and narrative, and reconfigured different styles, iconographies, and histories into complex webs of postmodern critique. Raja viewed his artistic practice as parallel to the craftspeople who worked with their hands every day. Although, he considered the signs, symbols, and motifs of his cultural heritage as influencing his work. He was aware of the aversion to color and ornament in Western art and aesthetics, and the dangers of cultural stereotypes in the art world. Moving between abstraction and representation, Raja made work about in-between spaces and from between cultures. He engaged with both Western art history and non-Western culture on his own terms as a contemporary American painter. Between 2000 and 2010, Raja‚Äôs paintings and installations reconfigured architectural spaces, signifiers and art historical conventions. In 2017, several of his paintings, fusing elements from landscape painting with weaving textures and patterns, were featured in the group exhibition ‚ÄúLucid Dreams and Distant Visions: South Asian Art in the Diaspora,‚Äù at New York City‚Äôs Asia Society Museum. Raja also had a solo exhibition the same year titled ‚ÄúPostWest, v.2a: Ornament and Translation,‚Äù at the Barbara Walters Gallery, at Sarah Lawrence College. Raja‚Äôs paintings often have multimedia elements that are woven, scanned, printed, and embroidered. Raja described his work as addressing ‚Äúthe visual politics of neutral and contested territories, and reflect the multivalent, multilayered hybridity of post colonial urban spaces.‚Äù Kanishka Raja exhibited widely in the US, Europe and India and his work was included in solo and group exhibitions at the ICA Boston, ICA Philadelphia and the Rose Art Museum, Brandeis University among others. He has had solo projects at the Armory Fair, 2012 and at Greenberg Van Doren Gallery, NY. == Awards == He was the winner of the 2004 ICA Artist Prize awarded by the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, and was a recipient of a 2011 Painters and Sculptors Grant from the Joan Mitchell Foundation. Raja has been a Fellow at the Civitella Ranieri Center in Umbertide, Italy and was awarded residencies at the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council and the International Studio & Curatorial Program in New York. His work has been reviewed in Artforum, The New York Times, The New Yorker, Art In America, Art Asia Pacific, Tema Celeste, Asian Art Newspaper and The Boston Globe among others. == References == == External links == * www.kanishkaraja.com Category:1970 births Category:American artists Category:Hampshire College alumni Category:Southern Methodist University alumni Category:American people of Indian descent Category:South Asian American culture Category:2018 deaths ","title":"Kanishka Raja"},{"id":"60320135","text":"Bailu Township () is a township under the administration of Ganxian District, Ganzhou, Jiangxi, China. , it has 13 villages under its administration. == References == Category:Township-level divisions of Jiangxi Category:Ganzhou ","title":"Bailu Township, Ganzhou"},{"id":"60320153","text":"Bailu Township () is a township under the administration of Chongren County, Jiangxi, China. , it has 8 villages under its administration. == References == Category:Township-level divisions of Jiangxi Category:Chongren County ","title":"Bailu Township, Chongren County"},{"id":"60320168","text":"The 2006 Missouri Valley Conference Men's Basketball Tournament was played from March 2-5, 2006 at the Savvis Center in St. Louis, Missouri at the conclusion of the 2005‚Äì06 NCAA Division I men's basketball regular season.

It was released on Microsoft Windows on May 22, 2018, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 on August 13, 2019, and Nintendo Switch on June 11, 2020. ==Development== Ancestors Legacy was announced as being in development phase on May 10, 2017. Following the announcement, the company launched its first trailer of the game on July 31 which depicted over a 100 battles in a historically-accurate armaments. The game had entered into an open beta phase on February 5, 2018. The game's single player preview beta build was released during Gamescom on September 3, 2017. Initially both version supposed to come out on the same day (May 22), but then on August 22, 2018, at Gamescom 2018, it was announced by the 1C Company that the Xbox One version is soon to come out. ==Gameplay== The player has a choice to play the campaign scenario or multiplayer game in which they can choose to play one of the four civilizations: Vikings, Anglo-Saxons, Teutons, or Slavs (Saracens with the Saladin's Conquest DLC). The game features a day/night cycle which changes the way factions play. ===Single player=== The game has a campaign or two for every nation. The Anglo-Saxon campaign has the likes of Edward the Confessor, William the Conqueror and Earl of Huntingdon. For the Vikings campaign the game is set in 793 and is divided in two parts. The first part is set during the raid of Lindisfarne's monastery which was the fundamental beginning of Viking Age and serves as a tutorial. Once the tutorial is completed the other campaigns become available. The second part is set in 892 and is dedicated to Rurik, a Varangian chieftain during the Ladoga campaign. The Slavs and Teutons have a campaign each. During the campaigns, the AI is a better player as it is able to replace losses and send large armies to your base. ===Multi player=== The multiplayer aspect of the game provides Domination and Annihilation choices during which a player can have as many as 10 squads. Multiplayer battles can take place on 15 maps prepared for 2, 4 or 6 players (1v1, 2v2 or 3v3). ==Updates== In September 2018, Destructive Creations had added a second Slav campaign where the player can lead Boles≈Çaw I the Brave of Poland and his son Mieszko II.

The campaign, which is made out of five story missions, is divided in two parts. The first part will tell the story of Herkus Monte and his rebellion against the Teutonic Order during the Great Prussian Uprising. The second part of the campaign is dedicated to the Commander of the Teutonic Order Konrad von Thierberg and the siege of rebel bastion, the Lidzbark (Lautenburg) Castle. All of the new content is set in the 13th century. In May 2019, Destructive Creations have released a paid DLC titled Ancestors Legacy: Saladin's Conquest. The DLC contains a new nation of Saracens and mainly a brand new campaign, but this time Ancestors Legacy leaves the European soil and tells a completely different story from the perspective of Saladin, the first sultan of Egypt and Syria. It contains five new missions, 3 new multiplayer maps and new achievements. On May 12, 2020, Polish studio Destructive Creations announced on May 12, 2020, that the game will be released for Nintendo Switch on June 11, 2020. ==Reception== IGN had said that despite some historical inaccuracies and some tactical issues, the game was traditional in the RTS form.

Daingwun Mingyi did not have any biological children, but he adopted Khin Khin Gyi. Her grandfather was Khanpat Mingyi, a minister of Khanpat.

After the introduction, Thibaw sought to wed Daing Khin Khin, and kept Supayalat uninformed during her second pregnancy. After Supayalat gave birth to their second child in August 1881, Thibaw Min informed her of his intention to wed Daing Khin Khin, which threw Supayalat into a fit of rage.

Many varieties exist, with differing designs as well as differing compositions, including billon (standard), aluminum, copper, cupronickel, nickel silver, nickel, silver, and white metal. ==History== In the late-1840s, the price of copper had risen to the point that large cents cost more than one cent to produce. In response to a bill drafted in 1849 by Congressman Sam F. Vinton to reduce the size of the cent, the US mint began looking for an alternative type of cent. One solution to the problem was to perforate the coin in the center, creating a ring-like appearance. Pattern ring cents were first struck in 1850 in various test compositions. However, it was found that the coin was difficult to eject from the presses and that it was expensive to recover the silver from the alloy. Because of this, the ring cent was not placed into mass-production and the large cent continued to be produced until 1857, when it was replaced by the Flying Eagle cent. According to numismatic historian Walter Breen, another factor in the rejection of the ring cent was that it reminded many of the Chinese cash coin, which had minimal purchasing value. The ring cent was briefly revived in 1884 by Eastman Johnson, although this time the design was somewhat cruder as the holes appeared to have been handcut as they vary in both size and shape. Although a more refined and smoother design was struck the following year, no more ring cents would ever be struck. 196 ring cents (originals and restrikes) are known to exist. ==Other versions== Patterns of this \\"ring cent\\" were struck in various metals and with various hole sizes. There were also various different designs, with some designs lacking a date or a reverse design. Some did not even have a hole, in its place being a circle resembling a line for perforation. These were known as annular cents. ==Ring cent obverse designs== File:1850 1C Cent, Judd-124G, Pollock-145, High R.7.jpg1850 non-perforated obverse File:1850 P1C One Cent, Judd-119 Original, Pollock-134, Low R.6.jpg1850 perforated obverse File:1851 P1C One Cent, Judd-131A Restrike, Pollock-156, High R.7.jpg1851 non-perforated obverse File:1851 P1C One Cent, Judd-127 Original, Pollock-149, Low R.6 rev.jpg1851 perforated obverse File:1884 1C One Cent, Judd-1721, Pollock-1929, R.5.jpgObverse of the 1884 Eastman Johnson cent File:1885 1C One Cent, Judd-1740, Pollock-1950, High R.6.jpgObverse of the 1885 ring cent.

After completing her graduate degree, she started a doctorate in physics at the Balseiro Institute under the supervision of Dr. Carlos Balseiro. For her doctoral studies Hallberg worked on computational models of quantum materials that demonstrate low dimensional magnetism and superconductivity. When Hallberg arrived at the Bariloche Atomic Centre only 8% of the students were women. == Research and career == After her PhD, Hallberg moved to Germany to work as a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research (MPI-FKF) and at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems (MPI-PKS). Hallberg returned to the Bariloche Atomic Centre in 1997. She has extensively developed computer simulations to understand quantum matter. She is interested in emergent properties such as conductivity, superconductivity and magnetism. Hallberg is a researcher at National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET) and leads the National Atomic Energy Commission (CNEA) condensed matter theory group. She is a Senior Associate of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) and of the International Center for Theoretical Physics-South American Institute for Fundamental Research (ICTP-SAIFR). Hallberg worked on several numerical tools, including the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), a numerical method that can be used for low-dimensional strongly correlated bosonic and fermionic systems. She has studied superconductivity, magnetic order and spin-orbit coupling in complex materials and electronic transport in nanoscopic systems. She has visited and collaborated with centers such as the Indian Institute of Sciences (Bangalore), Oxford University (UK), the London Center for Nanotechnology (UK), University of Augsburg (Germany), University of Fribourg (Switzerland), University of Boston and Argonne National Lab (US) and the University of Tokyo. === Advocacy and academic service === Hallberg has spoken for the need eliminate institutional barriers for women scientists, and for more support to be given to women.

Its nearest higher peak is Mount Carnarvon, to the northwest. Both are part of the President Range which is a subset of the Waputik Mountains. Emerald Peak is visible from Emerald Lake, rising above the northwest shore. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1924 when approved by the Geographical Names Board of Canada, in association with Emerald Lake, which in turn was named in 1900 on account of its color. __NOTOC__ ==Geology== Emerald Peak is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Cambrian period. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. ==Climate== Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Emerald Peak is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. Precipitation runoff from Emerald Peak drains into the Emerald River, which is a tributary of the Kicking Horse River.

The bombings occurred at the end of May 1974, with the name Los Seis de Boulder coined posthumously. The students were protesting the negative treatment of Mexican-American students at the University of Colorado, Boulder at the time of their death. A monument was erected for them in Chautauqua Park on May 27th, 2020. ==Involvement of Los Seis in student groups== Los Seis were active in the UMAS (United Mexican American Students) at the University of Colorado Boulder. At the time [1967-1979], Colorado was one of fewer than 10 U.S. states in which Chicanos (mid-20th century political/cultural term used by some Mexican Americans) were initiating the original MECha groups. As of 2012, there are over 500 chapters. Although these groups originally concentrated more on education issues, this led to participation in political campaigns and protests against widespread issues such as police brutality and the U.S. war in Southeast Asia.Moore, J. W., & Cu√©llar, A. B. (1970). Mexican Americans. Ethnic groups in American life series. Englewood, Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall. p. 150. Outside of Colorado, the Brown Berets, a Chicano youth group which began in California, took on a more militant and nationalistic ideology.Moore, J. W., & Cu√©llar, A. B. (1970). Mexican Americans. Ethnic groups in American life series. Englewood, Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall. p. 151. At the University of Colorado Boulder today, UMAS and MEChA have combined into a single coalition simply referred to as \\"UMAS y MEXA\\". ==Prior to the car bombings== The University of Maryland's Global Terrorism Database has information on other Boulder, Colorado bombings in 1974 suspected to involve the same \\"Chicano activists,\\" and that \\"The explosions came during a time of racial tensions in Colorado, especially in Denver and Boulder, where at least 10 bombings had occurred within the last year, primarily directed at public buildings such as schools, police stations, and courthouses.\\" 2 months prior to the deaths of \\"Los Seis\\", in March 1974 a Boulder police station was bombed. There were no casualties, though $8,000 worth of damage was caused. Minutes later on the same day, the courthouse was bombed. ==Car bombings== ===First === In an article written for the Daily Camera, librarian and local historian Carol Taylor states that the first bombing took place on May 27, 1974, and ===Second=== ===Investigation=== Due to the politicized nature of the activists work as members of UMAS and MEChA, focusing on fighting for Mexican American student rights at the University of Colorado Boulder as well as other institutions of higher education throughout the state, conspiratorial foul play has also been suspected as claimed by some involved in the Chicano community at that time. The crimes have not yet been solved. The FBI and police found that the students themselves triggered bombs they were making to assault civic buildings and personnel. The active COINTELPRO program was a major factor in speculation of government involvement. Priscilla Falcon, professor of Hispanic Studies at the University of Northern Colorado, said in relation to the deaths of Los Seis ‚ÄúAfter that, many people became fearful that they could be the next target of the government,‚Äù and ‚ÄúSo there were peaks and valleys in the movement. If you‚Äôre looking at the activism among the student population, I would definitely say that a peak was 1970, with the Chicano Moratorium in California, where 3,000 folks came, and after that I think we entered into a repressive period where there was a lot of COINTELPRO stuff going on.‚Äù ==In art and media== Los Seis de Boulder Memorial Sculpture on the University of Colorado Boulder campus.

In 2019 a University of Colorado student created an art exhibit on campus dedicated to Los Seis de Boulder. CU students have protested a campus decision not to make the art exhibit permanent. On September 16, 2020, CU officials announced that the sculpture will be made permanent, both at its location in front of Temporary Building 1 as well as part of its library's Special Collections, Archives and Preservation department.

Thomas Burghardt, NASA Spaceflight. 15 December 2018. ==Overview== Simulation-to-Flight 1 (STF-1) is West Virginia‚Äôs first spacecraft to reach orbit. Its purpose is to demonstrate the capabilities of NASA Operational Simulation (NOS) technologies for small satellites and provide a platform for WVU to launch research projects into Low Earth orbit. Along with NASA's mission, WVU is conducting four separate tests. This includes the testing of space weather's effects on spacecraft, the durability of III-V Nitride-Based Materials for shielding spacecraft components from space's harsh conditions, Inertial Measurement Unit Swarm for developing a more power and size efficient IMU for CubeSats, and Precise Orbit Determination (POD) to determine STF-1's exact location by communicating with a variety of other satellites ==Description== Simulation-to-Flight 1 (STF-1) is West Virginia‚Äôs first spacecraft. It was built under NASA‚Äôs CubeSat Launch Initiative, where potential launch opportunities are provided to select CubeSat proposals from NASA Centers, accredited US educational or non-profit organizations. NASA‚Äôs main goal in this initiative is to provide CubeSat developers access to a low- cost pathway to conduct research in the areas of science, exploration, technology development, education or operations. JSTAR‚Äôs main goal in this mission is to fully demonstrate the capabilities of the NASA Operational Simulation (NOS) technologies, most notably its development of the NASA Operational Simulation for Small Satellites, or NOS3 JSTAR had a huge outreach opportunity with West Virginia University through the support of the Katherine Johnson Independent Verification and Validation Facility and West Virginia Space Grants Consortium (WVSGC). By being partnered with JSTAR engineers and scientists, WVU Engineering, Computer Science, and Physics departments got to learn first-hand the rewards and challenges involved in working in any STEM career such as with NASA. More specifically, WVU provided their experimental ideas and worked alongside the JSTAR team to incorporate their scientific instruments into STF-1. Along with offering their professional project management, JSTAR has supported WVU in their scientific development and research. By offering their software resources to this CubeSat, STF-1 has the capability of recording data once it‚Äôs launched into orbit around Earth‚Äîdata that can be sent directly to WVU for STEM research and the education of future scientists. While community outreach is a huge component of this mission, major benefits for NASA and JSTAR have come of it as well. In the development of these NASA Operational Simulation technologies and their demonstrations in the STF-1 mission, the IV&V; tool-set has been matured to better support current and future NASA missions. For example, these NOS technologies, among them NOS3, have demonstrated significant value in several areas such as: the James Webb Space Telescope, Global Precipitation Measurement, Juno, and Deep Space Climate Observatory in the areas of software development, mission operations/training, verification and validation, test procedure development, and software systems check-out. As of now, STF-1 is orbiting earth in Low Earth orbit and operating nominally under the control of the JSTAR team.

The Langmuir probe will be used to measure electron density and temperature of the ionosphere, while the radio sounder will collect plasma density information and magnetic field measurements. Additionally, the particle counters will detect high fluxes of precipitating electrons, which can produce surface and deep dielectric charging on a CubeSat. Ultimately, the combination of all measurements taken will aid in their understanding of space weather and our ability to predict the state of the ionosphere. === WVU Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering: III-V Nitride-Based Materials === This team is employing a precision optoelectronic sensor module containing arrays of light- emitting diodes (LEDs) and photodiodes (PDs) for short-range distance measurement and shape rendering. However, because of space's extremely low temperatures and high levels of radiation, shielding is necessary to ensure the reliability and functionality of the optoelectronic sensor module. Their intent is to test the durability of III-V Nitride-Based Materials for shielding, as well as test the performance of the core components of the sensor at various conditions in space. As a result, the department will be able to determine the optimal thickness for sufficient shielding and extended measurement capabilities. === WVU Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE): MEMS IMU Swarm === Traditionally, high-end IMUs are much larger and more expensive than a regular CubeSat mission can accommodate. However, the WVU MAE Team designed a cluster of 32 smaller, less expensive IMUs with the idea that the averaged results will be extremely accurate. The 2nd generation of this design successfully performed its mission on a sounding rocket in late 2015. The 3rd generation - which overcame the typical size, weight, and power (SWaP) constraints caused by a CubeSat - will be flown on STF-1. === WVU Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering: Precise Orbit Determination (POD) === WVU's MAE Department will be employing a NovAtel OEM615 GPS Receiver for the STF-1 mission. This GPS Receiver will ensure Precise Orbit Determination (POD) accuracy through processing collected data using NASA's GIPSY-OASIS technology. This technology uses the GPS data received from a variety of other satellites to determine STF-1's exact location. ==Milestones== === Contract Awarded === * Late April 2015  STF-1 Team was contracted by the NASA Education Launch of Nanosatellites (ELaNa) === STF-1 Delivered to Rocket Lab for payload checkup and final preparations === * 12 April 2018  STF-1 CubeSat getting loaded into the deployer inside Rocket Lab's facility located at Huntington Beach CaliforniaSTF-1 Loading into CubeSat deployer === Successful Launch into LEO === * 16 December 2018  Successful launch into Low Earth orbit === First Contact === * 19 December 2018  STF-1 team made successful contact with West Virginia‚Äôs First Spacecraft, STF-1 === First Image Received === * 3 January 2019  STF-1's First Captured Image (The Sun is seen reflecting off STF-1's VHF antenna)The first image received from STF-1 was the sun reflecting off the VHF antenna ==See also== *NASA *Katherine Johnson Independent Verification and Validation Facility *West Virginia University *National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program ==References== ==External links== * STF-1 News * NASA: STF-1 * JSTAR Category:Spacecraft launched by Electron rockets Category:CubeSats Category:Spacecraft launched in 2018 ","title":"Simulation-to-Flight 1"},{"id":"60321549","text":"Meiling Subdistrict () is a subdistrict in Jinjiang, Fujian, China. , it has 15 residential communities under its administration. == See also == * List of township-level divisions of Fujian == References == Category:Township-level divisions of Fujian Category:Jinjiang, Fujian ","title":"Meiling Subdistrict, Jinjiang"},{"id":"60321552","text":"Joshua Gross Santana (born in 13 May 1993) is a football player who currently plays for the Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht-side ASWH and on the Aruban national team.https://hendrik-ido-ambacht.dekombinatie.nl/nieuws/algemeen/579852/josh- gross-santana-geniet-van-aswh- ==International career== Gross debuted on 9 September 2018 in a match against Bermuda in a 3-1 victory in the qualifying rounds of the CONCACAF Nations League.

He is most-known by his single, titled Gimme the Loot. On November 16, 2018 Big Baby Tape released his first studio album, titled Dragonborn. == Early life == Born on January 5, 2000. Acquaintance of Egor with rap happened at the age of 4, when he first heard 50 Cent songs, which impressed the future musician. A little later, Egor became acquainted with the songs of Gucci Mane, which influenced the current work of Egor. At the age of six, to the question of the aunt: ‚ÄúWhat do you want to be when you grow up?‚Äù Egor answered: ‚ÄúRapper!‚Äù. At the age of 12, he began to learn how to create music in the Fruity Loops program, which Egor introduced to his sister‚Äôs friend. At first, he randomly pressed various buttons, not understanding how to work with it, and soon abandoned it. A year later, Egor returned to work in this program and did not stop creating beats (hip-hop instrumental), taking breaks for no more than one day for several years. The reference points for bitmaking for him at various times were Madlib, DJ Zinc, DJ Rashad, DJ Smokey and DJ Paul. At the age of 15, Egor took the pseudonym DJ Tape and even planned to release an instrumental music album DJ Tape 2000, but the release did not take place, as Egor was unable to bring the project to the planned quality. After that, he decided to rap under the pseudonym Big Baby Tape. ==Musical career== ===2017‚Äî2018: Hoodrich Tales and Dragonborn=== In May 2017, the first Egor's 4-track mixtape Cookin' Anthem was released. At the end of 2017, the rapper met Feduk, seeing that he was listening to his songs in Stories on Instagram. In an interview for the show \\"–≤–î—É–¥—å\\", Fedor said that Big Baby Tape is in the top 2 of his most beloved rappers, and Big Baby Tape gets its first wide publicity. Subsequently, Egor begins selling instrumental tools to his colleagues. In addition to Feduk, in 2018, Egor caught the attention of such major artists as Kizaru, Boulevard Depo, Face and Pharaoh. March 8, 2018 released a joint with Feduk single \\"Hustle Tales\\". On June 1, 2018, the debut mini-album Hoodrich Tales was released with guest participation Polyana (MellowBite), Alizade, Boulevard Depo, Feduk and Egor's alter ego Tape LaFlare. The musical release was completely produced by Egor himself. On November 16, 2018, was the release of the debut studio album Dragonborn, released on the label Warner Music Russia. Boulevard Depo, Husky, Jeembo, i61, White Punk and others took part in the recording of the music release. A few days after the release of the album, the track \\"Gimme The Loot\\" took the first position in the song charts of Apple Music, the iTunes Store, VKontakte, shifting the latest Feduk and Eldzhey albums, and also beat Travis Scott's \\"Sicko Mode\\" and \\"Thank U, Next\\" by Ariana Grande on the Genius.https://genius.com/Big-baby-tape-gimme-the-loot-lyrics ===2019: the breakdown of the \\"Benzo Gang\\"=== On March 8, 2019, on the official YouTube channel of the creative association Benzo Gang, a half-hour video was released, in which Egor told the story of their acquaintance, about working inside the team and about the relationship with each participant. In the course of the monologue, it became known that the low productivity of the participants contributed to the collapse of the team. Initially, at the direction of Yegor, the association was left by Dope V, Cash Choppa and LilJPlug. Particular attention in the video was paid to his relationship with Dimebag Plugg, Andrey's correspondence with fans, who sent Egor in social networks. The reason for their bad relationship was Andrey's problems with the law, drugs, financial situation, hypocrisy, and low activity within the team. And the video ended with the words of Egor: ‚ÄúIn short, Dimebag is the sheer lame and sheer schmuck.

In 2004, as part of the Melbourne International Arts Festival, La Mama chose an early draft of the script to further develop, and so in 2005, with funding from the Australian Council of Arts, Holloway began the process of researching the event of the Port Arthur Massacre and interviewing those most affected. The play was included in the NSW HSC Drama Syllabus from 2015-2018. == Characters == 1 - 7 year old boy Although the young boy has no clear connection to the Port Arthur Massacre, he is included to show the effects of grief and the differing ways in which individuals deal with it. Feeling lonely and forgotten by his parents, the young boy invents an imaginary friend to keep him company named Michael. The young boy constantly talks to Michael throughout the play, and it becomes known that the imaginary friend is a bad influence, encouraging him to perform violent and sadistic acts, as well as the inappropriate joke that triggers the character's flashbacks towards the end of the play. 2 - 17 year old girl The teenage girl remains largely affected by the events of the Port Arthur Massacre, her father a victim of Martin Bryant. Struggling to deal with his death, she turns to conspiracy theories to explain the events of that day. Due to her mother's quick rebound with her father's best friend, the young girl struggles to connect with them and accept herself within her family. The trip to Port Arthur brings up a multitude of emotions for the character, as seeing the Port Arthur Memorial Garden and commemorative plaque, as well as her conversation with Character 4, allows her to finally understand the reality of the massacre and what happened to her father. 3 - 28 year old woman Character 3 is another individual included to demonstrate the way in which people come to terms with their grief. For the majority of the play, she speaks to her husband David and her child Molly, as they travel on a bus tour around Tasmania with a group of elderly people. It is only at the end of the play, however, when her flashbacks are triggered, that it becomes clear that David and Molly are only memories conjured by her imagination. The two were killed in a car accident, and though some time has passed the young woman continues to struggle to accept the reality of their death. 4 - 75 year old man One of the most important characters within the play, the old man works at the Broad Arrow Caf√© where the massacre took place, and was a direct witness to its atrocities. He suffers significant post-traumatic stress disorder, with flashbacks regularly plaguing him throughout the entirety of the play. The most significant of his episodes occurs at the climax of Beyond the Neck, when Character 1 pretends that a massacre is happening again as a joke. The old man believes that he, and everyone around him, is in danger and thus reacts quickly. The monumental physical and emotional toll of witnessing the massacre is made clear to the audience through his monologue, as he describes in significant depth particular details about the event, such as the woman covered in blood who hugged him. A visitor This character can be played by any one of the actors, required only for the \\"Coda\\" at the end of the play. == Plot summary == === \\"Tune Up\\" === Instruction for the director to raise all lights to full brightness and then slowly dim them, as the characters walk on stage and touch up their outfits before the lights dim to absolute darkness and the play begins. === \\"Overture\\" === Beyond the Neck begins with the \\"Overture\\", in which the location of the play, Port Arthur, is introduced. The character \\"4\\" (old man), details the negative history of the location, speaking of the hardships of the convicts who lived in the penal settlement in the 1800s (see History Port Arthur, Tasmania). The characters \\"1\\" (boy), \\"2\\" (teenage girl), \\"3\\" (young mother and wife), and \\"4\\" (old man) are then introduced, through direct address and as the musical quartet piece that Holloway intended. The \\"Overture\\" acts as a prologue to the characters and their backstories, placing them in relation to the events of the Port Arthur Massacre. left Commemorative memorial to the victims of the Port Arthur Massacre === \\"Setting Off\\" === The next part of the play, \\"Setting Off\\", brings the characters to the ten year anniversary of the Port Arthur Massacre, revealing that the tragedies of the event continue to haunt them to the present day. It is within this section that Holloway's employment of imperatives to remove the audience's emotional attachment to the piece, a Brechtian technique, is exhibited. === \\"The Trip Down\\" === This section of the play details the character's separate journeys as they begin to travel to the Broad Arrow Caf√© in Port Arthur, where the massacre took place. Although they do not travel together, their stories intertwine as they interrupt and talk over the top of each other, contributing to Holloway's intention of creating a musical quartet and chorus, as he outlines in the \\"Important Note to Actors and Director\\". === \\"Arrival\\" === Adding to the character's backstories, \\"The Arrival\\" continues to examine the trauma that the four characters are dealing with, as their arrival to the location of the massacre, Port Arthur, causes them to have flashbacks triggered by post-traumatic stress disorder. The characters continue to act as narrators for each other, revealing more and more small details of information with each line that passes. More information about the Port Arthur Massacre begins to come to light within a conversation between Character 1 and his father. === \\"The Tour\\" === All four characters come together for this scene of the play to participate in the tour of Port Arthur, and Character 4's opening introduction in the \\"Overture\\" is repeated. Character 2 and 4 both have flashbacks to the events of the Port Arthur Massacre, and Character 1's uncomfortable and inappropriate joke triggers post-traumatic stress disorder for all of the character's once more. This scene finally reveals the violence associated with Michael and the park for Character 1, and ultimately allows Character 2 to accept her father's death. left === \\"The Point of No Return\\" === It is within this section of the play that the characters finally interact, with Character 3 talking to Character 1 on a park bench and Character 4 finally telling Character 2 of the events of the Port Arthur Massacre. The conversations trigger flashbacks for the characters, and it is finally revealed that Character 3's husband and daughter are actually dead and she has been hallucinating them throughout the entire play. === \\"Coda\\" === A visitor describes the location of Port Arthur, and a sense of closure for the loss experienced at that site is finally felt. == Relation to the Port Arthur Massacre == In Tom Holloway's \\"Foreword\\" to Beyond the Neck, he recounts where he was and what he was doing at the time of the Port Arthur Massacre, and the long-lasting effect on him is evident, \\"That first day will stay with me forever.\\" Holloway's deep emotional attachment to the events of that day inspired him to write a play on it, especially because it was something that affected the entirety of Australia, \\"It was an event so tragic that people struggled even to talk about it. It was too big and too painful. For many, it still is. For me though it brought up things that I needed to share...\\" What made it even more difficult for Australia to cope and move on from the event was the media blackout on survivor's statements and testimonies during the trial of Martin Bryant. Due to this blackout, the Australian public was deprived of important information regarding the event and survivors were unable to tell their story, preventing healing. Therefore, the shock of Holloway's play was increased, as it broke the silence and began a remedial process for the survivors and the Australian public as a whole. Although Holloway rejects the notion that his play adheres to the \\"verbatim\\" genre, its role in community healing reflects the positive therapeutic and restorative nature of verbatim theatre. It is for this reason that the play was included in the NSW HSC Drama Syllabus from 2015-2018. Additionally, the way in which Holloway constructed the play, through interviews of those most affected, mirrors the process for creating verbatim theatre. Holloway noted the positive impact and healing properties that these interviews fostered, quoted by the ABC as saying, \\"For many people the moment when they were able to share the story was a major part of being able to come to terms with it. Some people could do that straight away, others took years. Some were prompted to share their experience after the events of September 11\\". For Holloway, effect of his play upon the Tasmanian community and those affected in terms of healing was seriously considered, evident in his instruction in \\"Introduction to Port Arthur and the Play...\\": \\"Before each performance, the cast and crew should offer tea and biscuits or similar to the audience without charge. Not in the sense of an emergency centre, but purely to give something away for free.\\" == Adaptations == An early version of Holloway's Beyond the Neck was chosen by La Mama Caf√© in the 2004 Melbourne International Arts Festival for further development, leading to its eventual premiere on 12 September 2007. Located at the Peacock Theatre in Hobart, with Ron Haddrick starring as Character 4, the play was performed for an additional three nights at that location. The play then toured to Launceston, where it was staged from 18 to 21 September at the Earl Arts Centre. Belvoir St Theatre in Surry Hills was the next Australian company to stage the play, from 7 to 31 May and starring award-winning Australian actress Anita Hegh. On 15 March 2012, the play was revived for a production in Melbourne by Red Stitch, a series of shows lasting until 14 April 2012 with Australian theatre veteran Roger Oakley performing as Character 4. Most recently, Emu Productions/Epicentre Theatre Production Company produced Beyond the Neck at King Street Theatre from 28 May ‚Äì 13 July 2015. == Reception == In 2007, \\"Beyond the Neck‚Äù was one of only ten plays selected for stage reading by the Royal Court Theatre's International Young Playwright's Festival in London, out of over four hundred submissions. Adding to its numerous accolades, the play was also appointed as \\"best stage play\\" at the 2008 Australian Writer's Guild Awards. The play has been positively critically received, with The Daily Telegraph reporting it to be \\"a powerful meditation on a national tragedy so brutal that many people are still coming to terms with it.\\" For The Daily Telegraph, the play's musicality and chorus- like performance was both its triumph and its downfall, \\"Although the actors are still in the complicated process of finding the rhythm of this work and the script is occasionally uneven in tone, there are some genuinely moving moments\\".. Of its 2012 Belvoir St production, The Sydney Morning Herald acclaimed, \\"Beyond The Neck echoes in your head for a long time afterwards\\". Anita Hegh further adulated Holloway on his work in her interview with The Daily Telegraph on her involvement in the Belvoir St production, defining him to be \\"a very serious talent\\". Alternatively, the Herald Sun rated its Red Stitch production a high 4.5 stars. The Sydney Morning Herald was equally favourable toward the Red Stitch production, claiming that, \\"Tom Holloway's Beyond the Neck composes the long shadow of the Port Arthur massacre into a beautifully graduated piece of chamber theatre\\", and that the play is \\"a haunting drama, and this nuanced ensemble production from Red Stitch allows its soft, broken chords to sing\\". == Bibliography == Category:2008 plays Category:Australian plays ","title":"Beyond the Neck"},{"id":"60322186","text":"\\"Gimme the Loot\\" is a song by Russian rap artist Egor Rakitin, professionally known as Big Baby Tape, from his debut studio album Dragonborn.

Logan House in Boise, Idaho, is a 1-story adobe structure measuring 32 feet by 22 feet and constructed prior to 1868. The house is Boise's earliest surviving mud brick dwelling, with walls 14 inches thick, set in mud mortar. Mud plaster -inch thick was applied to the interior walls, and a top coat of lime plaster was applied sometime later; the first coat of oil base paint was applied before 1872. The house was moved from its original location at 6th and Main Streets to Julia Davis Park and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. With ==History== The Logan House was built by Boise merchant Charles W. Slocum perhaps as early as 1865. Slocum sold the house to his business partner, James Crawford, and in 1868 Crawford sold the house to dry goods merchant Thomas E. Logan. In 1872 Logan remodeled the house, doubling its size. Logan's additions to the house ended in 1878. The house remained in the Logan family until 1914. It was purchased by the Mountain Bell Telephone Company in 1970 and donated to the Idaho State Historical Society. It is on display at the Idaho History Museum. ==Thomas E. Logan== Thomas E. Logan was born in New York in 1834 and raised in Wisconsin. He and Caroline R. Logan and two children arrived by wagon in Idaho Territory in 1864, settling in Boise City. Logan was listed as a pharmacist in 1865, and he soon entered the dry goods business. He was appointed postmaster of Boise City in 1869, and he was elected to three terms as mayor in the 1870s. Logan retired from business in 1882. He suffered a \\"stroke of paralysis\\" in 1893, and he died while returning to Boise from Pasadena, California, on April 28, 1894. ==See also== * List of mayors of Boise, Idaho ==ReferencesIdaho History Museum website Category:National Register of Historic Places in Boise, Idaho Category:Houses in Boise, Idaho Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1868 Category:Adobe buildings and structures ","title":"Thomas E.

The power station discharges back into the Whanganui River. ==History== ===Development=== Since 1914 the borough of Taumarunui had had a gas plant supplied by the Dreadnought Gas Co. which supplied the town with gas for lighting and cooking but by 1917 the system was beginning to deteriorate. The passing of the Electric Power Boards Act in 1918 which allowed local authorities to generate and distribute electricity assisted in converting Andrew S. Laird, who had been the mayor of Taumarunui since 1917 into an enthusiastic proponent of electricity generation. While the Taumarunui borough council had intended to wait until after the First World War had finished before pursuing the matter further, Laird was able to convince the council to follow the lead of others in the region such as Ohakune, Raetihi and Te Kuiti in building its own hydroelectric power scheme. As a result, W. J. Gibbs the engineer of the Te Aroha Borough Council was engaged to investigate possible options. However, nothing appears to have resulted from his endeavours. Then in early 1919, the council asked the Minister of Internal Affairs to request Lawrence Birks, the senior electrical engineer in the Public Works Department (PWD) to assess the hydroelectric potential of the Taumarunui area. The government declined the request and suggested that the council employ a private consulting engineer. Laird became even more supportive of a scheme after while attending a conference of local bodies in Hamilton in February 1919 to consider the development of hydro-electric power in the Auckland region and visiting the Horohara power station. The borough council polled its ratepayers for approval to raise loan to build a power scheme but the motion was defeated by 118 to 80. Three months later as a result of losing the April 1919 elections Laird was replaced by former mayor, George Steadman and the idea of a power scheme was dropped. By 1920 despite there being 71 local electrical supply authorities throughout New Zealand. Taumarunui had no electrical supply despite the Public Works Department pointing out that there was potentially a demand of 2,000 hp from combined population of the 9,667 in Taumarunui and the surrounding region, which was more than enough to justify the establishment of an electrical supply authority. With the reliability of their gas supply system continuing to deteriorate (for instance by January 1919 it was leaking 25,000 to 30,000 cubic feet of gas per month), the borough council decided to investigate the options for switching to electricity. On 5 August 1920 applications (which closed on 6 September 1920) were called for from electrical engineers to undertake the necessary investigations and to provide an estimate of the required cost of a scheme. From the 16 applications the Wellington-based consulting engineers Hay & Vickerman won the contract, with a fee of ¬£100 subsequently being agreed for their preliminary work. The borough council formally received Hay & Vickerman's report on 18 November 1920. Hay & Vickerman offered four possible hydro-electric power and lighting schemes. The council adopted the engineer's recommended Wanganui River Number 1 proposal, which they estimated would cost ¬£44,000. Due to the undeveloped and sparsely populated state of the rural area surrounding Hay & Vickerman recommended against establishing a power board. After the Wanganui River Trust consented to borough council's proposed power scheme, the Whanganui River or Wanganui River as it was then called, Hay & Vickerman applied on behalf of their client for a water power licence, which was granted on 21 February 1924. This licence also granted the borough council the right to distribute electricity with the borough, the town of Manauni, part of Kaitieke County along the sides of the Whanganui River for a mile either side from Kakahi down to the junction of the Onagare and Whanganui Rivers. A poll of Taumarunui ratepayers in April 1921 by 230 votes to five approved the raising of a loan to pay for the power scheme. Despite having remit over such a large area the borough council followed Hay & Vickerman advice and refused the urgings of the government and local Chamber of Commerce to become a power board. As a result, Piriaka's installed capacity was only sufficient to supply the Taumarunui load. As a result, even the town of Manauni though which the transmission passed from Piriaka to Taumarunui was not allowed to take a supply from the line. Manauni's situation was only rectified in 1928. An economic slump due to the collapse in export prices for New Zealand's meat and wool exports made obtaining financing difficult. It took seven attempts between May 1921 and June 1922 before in that month a Wellington insurance company agreed to finance the project at an interest rate of 6%. With the loan approved the borough council on 18 July 1922 established a committee to oversee the work and obtain the land required for the power scheme. While agreeing to differ payment until a loan was obtained, Hay & Vickerman had continued with a detailed design of the scheme. This allowed construction work to quickly commence following the granting of the loan. One problem that the borough council had was that Cyril Smith the owner of land where it was proposed that the power station was to be located objected to a surveyor coming onto his land to survey the route of the penstock and take bore samples Even after the borough council advised him that the 1908 Public Works Act allowed them to go into his land, he still refused entry. The borough council, therefore, took him to court and received a ruling from the local magistrate on 8 August 1922 that he could not refuse access and had to pay all legal costs. Eventually, Smith and the borough council entered into negotiations, which resulted in it purchasing 15 acres of Smith's land for ¬£450. Orders for equipment were placed in February 1923 to Boving & Co Ltd for turbines and governors (¬£1,905), National Electrical & Engineering for General Electric generators and exciters (¬£2,352) and British Thomson Houston switchgear and power cabling (¬£2,244). ===Construction=== An access road was built to the construction site, where a simple construction camp of four two- man huts together with a workshop and a building to store equipment was established. The workers paid rent of two shillings a week to stay in a hut. Others lived in tents. Construction began on the headworks, canal, penstock and power house and the distribution network under the supervision of construction engineer H. Langdon. As an indication of how many men were employed to build the power station an average of 21.5 men were employed on- site during February 1923. On 14 March 1924, with electricity from Piriaka becoming available the council decided that the gas works should be shut down by the end of the month. By this time there were only 49 customers receiving a gas supply. As work continued on the power station the first customers were being signed up, transmission lines were being constructed, street lighting installed and buildings wired to accept electricity. By January 1925 approximately 210 buildings had been wired. From the power station a 3.3 kV overhead transmission line using No.8 wire was built to supply the village of Piriaka while a second 3.3 kV line was built using7/14 wire via Manunui to Taumarunui. ===Commissioning=== By February 1924 construction had reached the point that commissioning tests could be undertaken. By 4 March 1926 the testing had been completed allowing the main street of Taumarunui to be lit by 22 lamps, while 80 smaller lamps were energised in other streets. The shops in the business area were also lit up with a total of 54 consumers receiving a supply. The power station was commissioned with two Boving & Co 300 hp vertical Francis turbines which were each directly coupled to a General Electric 250 KVA, 212 kW generator to give a total station output of 425 kW at 3.3 kV. The output of the generators connected to British Thomson-Houston switchgear. To manage their new power station and reticulation system the borough council created the Taumarunui electricity department with a permanent staff of H. F. (Henry) McLeod, electrical engineer on a yearly salary of ¬£400; W. Milne, power station engineer on a yearly salary of ¬£325; R.S. Uren, lineman on yearly salary of ¬£250 and Crawford McHenry as assistant lineman on wages of ¬£4 per week. Henry McLeod was to serve as an electrical engineer until his retirement in July 1949. The power scheme had cost ¬£50,000 to build and taken 18 months to complete. The power scheme was officially opened on 21 March 1924 by Prime Minister William Massey first at the power station at 2pm and then following dinner there was a separate evening ceremony in Hakiaka Street in Taumarunui when the street lights were switched on. By August 1925 the uptake of electricity was such that Henry McLeod was recommending that more capacity be installed at Piriaka and that the 3.3 kV transmission voltage be increased to 11 kW. While no more capacity was added at Piriaka the borough council commenced a project in the later half of 1925 to upgrade the transmission voltage to 11 kV. This involved installing a 500 kVA transformer to step up the voltage at Piriaka, replacing the insulators on the 5¬Ω miles (8.85 km) of transmission lines and installing three step down transformers at various locations in the network. By the 1927 financial year the connected load had increased to 440 kW during the day and 245 kW at night. In that same 12-month period the station generated 927,126 GWh, but the electricity department's metering could only account for 704,842 GWh. ===Connection to the national electricity system=== With it unable to meet the demand for more electricity the borough council after investigating other options such as installing a diesel generator at Piriaka reached an agreement with the government in 1938 to connect the local system to the national electricity system via a new transmission line. The connection to the bulk supply entered service on 2 April 1939. As a part of the agreement to take a bulk supply from the government it had been agreed that Piriaka would only be allowed to remain in service as a pumping station for the borough's water supply system. As a result, on 11 October 1939 Piriaka creased generating. In May 1940 to help with the war effort and the demand for electricity from the new war-related industries Piriaka was returned to service, with the government requesting that it run at its maximum output, 24 hours a day. A shortage of staff meant that the PWD had to help repair the weir and tailrace, while the Auckland Electric Power Board loaned an operator to help run the power station. A severe flood on 14 December 1958 damaged the weir, headworks and washed away approximately 2 chains (40 metres) of the canal's concrete lining which reduced the station head, allowing only one of its two generating units being able to remain in service. Even then there were regular stoppages to clear blocked intake screens. The repairs to the power scheme cost ¬£14,000. ===Upgrading=== In the 1960s the power station's existing Turell voltage regulator was replaced by an ASEA solid state voltage regular which meant that the station's voltage did not now require constant attention, allowing the number of operators at the station to reduced from four (on a 24-hour shift) to two people. By the late 1960s, Piriaka had been reduced to a single 300 kW generating unit. Mandeno Chitty & Bell were hired to design and oversee increasing the station's output. As a result, a modified Kaplan turbine driving a 700 kW generator was installed in February 1971 in a separate building. However, the new generating unit gave problems from the time it entered service. It was eventually determined that it had been installed a metre higher than it should have been installed. This led to compensation being paid to the Taumarunui Borough Council which was more than the cost of the new generating unit. Even as late as 1978 the new generating unit was still giving problems with cavitation of the turbine blades and leaking bearing seals, both issues eventually being resolved. The commissioning in 1972 of the Western Diversion of the Tongariro power scheme resulted in the diversion of water from eight tributaries of the upper Whanganui River. By June 1973 so significant was the diversion of waters that it was impacting on the operation of Piriaka. By the end of the year, the NZED was playing compensation to the borough council, the amount depending upon weather conditions and the amount of water they were taking. The lower river flows attracted the attention of other parties which resulted in hearings by Rangitikei ‚Äì Wanganui Catchment Board in 1982 with 17 submissions and again in 1988 with 1,250 submissions being received. Unhappy with the tribunal's ruling that the NZED and its successor, the Electricity Corporation of New Zealand (ECNZ), should return river flows to full into summer and half in winter and also continue to pay compensation they appealed the decision. By September 1989 a total of NZ$510,00 had been paid to date to the borough council for loss of generation at Piriaka. In late 1978 a flood blocked the intake gates with mud and the mistake was made to allow the canal to drain through the generating units, rather than keeping it full of water. With nothing to push back against it, the pressure from the saturated ground beside canal caused the canal walls to collapse inwards. It took three months to repair the damage and return the power station to service. In response to the passing of the 1987 Empowering Act, which opened the electricity supply industry to market forces discussion began between the Taumarunui Borough Council and the King Country Electric Power Board. As a result, the borough council in 1989 sold its electricity assets (including Piriaka) for NZ$750,000 to the power board. In response to the 1992 Energy Companies Act, the King Country Electric Power Board on 1 July 1993 transitioned to a public company King Country Energy Ltd, which took over ownership of Piriaka. In the early 1990s, a fire in the windings of the generating unit G1 resulted in it being out of service for 2¬Ω months. ==Design== The scheme was originally designed with provision to allow the mechanical output to be increased from 600 hp (447 kW) to 1,800 hp (1,342 kW). Three one-metre-high concrete weirs, approximately 200 mm thick connecting natural islands on the Whanganui River impound water in a small headpond. From here water is diverted to control gates and then via a concrete-lined canal to a forebay (fitted with screens) from which it flows through a buried by concrete penstock to a concrete surge chamber located beside the two powerhouses, from which water passes via penstocks to the turbines. There are two powerhouses, the original 1924 building which houses two vertical Francis turbines, each powering a 0.25 MW generating unit, designated G2 and G3. In a separate adjacent building which was commissioned in 1971 is located generating unit G1 which consists of a horizontal Kaplan turbine driving a 1 MW synchronous generator. From each building, separate tailraces discharge the water back into the Whanganui River. The scheme has a head of 8.2 metres. Because of the limited storage capacity in the headpond and canal the scheme is essentially run-of-river. The power station has a total output of 1.3 MW and a mean output of 7 GWh per year. At the power station the voltage is stepped up to 11 kV for transmission. The power station is embedded within The Lines Company network behind Transpower's Hangitaki Substation, but can also be switched within The Lines Company network to support Transpower's Whakamaru substation on a limited supply basis. ==Operation== Operation of the power station is covered by the requirements of three resource consents which expire in December 2030. As the power station is located in an area covered in pumice, the intake to the power station required regular maintenance in its early days to remove the pumice which had become dislodged and then floats down the river to build up behind the weir and block the intake. ==See also== * Hydroelectric power in New Zealand ==Notes== ==Further reading== * * * ==External links== *King Country Energy - Piriaka Power Station (Video) *Piriaka Power Station Category:Hydroelectricity in New Zealand Category:Hydroelectric power stations in New Zealand Category:Buildings and structures in Manawat≈´-Whanganui Category:Manawat≈´- Whanganui Category:Ruapehu District ","title":"Piriaka Power Station"},{"id":"60322335","text":"Colleen M.

Mount Carnarvon is situated five kilometers northwest of Emerald Lake, but is hidden from view behind Emerald Peak. However, Carnarvon is visible from Highway 1, the Trans-Canada Highway. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing Mount Carnarvon. ==History== Originally known as Emerald Mountain, the mountain was named in 1900 by Alexander MacKinnon Burgess (Commissioner of Public Lands) after Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon (1831-1890), who in 1867 authored the British North America Act which conferred self-government on Canada. Then in 1874, he effected the settlement of difficulties between Canada and British Columbia on the \\"Carnarvon Terms\\".BC Geographical Names The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1904 by members of the Dominion Topographic Survey. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1924 when approved by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. ==Geology== Mount Carnarvon is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Cambrian period.

Colin Alexander McVean, FRGS (6 March 1838 ‚Äì 18 January 1912) was a Scottish civil engineer who made a considerable contribution to Japan's engineering development in 1870s.Hideo Izumida, Reconsideration of Commencement of Engineering Education under the Ministry of Public Works in Meiji Japan, Journal of Architectural Institute of Japan, February 2016, Vol.81-No.720, pp.477-487. He left two brief autobiographies, diaries, photos, letters and a collection of Japanese antiques. == Early life and career == He was first son of Reverend Donald McVean, minister of the Free Church of Iona and Mull. After a five-year apprenticeship at Edinburgh, he joined the Hydrographic Office, Admiralty, and was engaged in a survey of the Hebrides under the direction of Captain Henry Charles Otter during 1861-64.Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, 1876-77, pp.152-153. He worked together with William Maxwell, RN, Henry ScharbauHe was a French-born surveyor and cartographer, who was hired by the Admiralty in c. 1845, Japan's Home Office in 1874-1877, and then the Royal Geographical Society. Refer to, Martin Daunton: the Organisation of Knowledge in Victorian Britain, 2005, p.326. and W.E. Cheesman.Archive# G220:4/44, the Royal Greenwich Museum. In 1865-66, he worked for railway construction at Bulgaria. In June, just before departure to Japan, he married Mary Wood Cowan, youngest daughter of Alexander Cowan, a paper-maker in Penicuik. Marriage witness were Archibald Constable and Campbell Douglas. ==Appointment in Japan== McVean was informed by his friend that the Northern Lighthouse Board of Edinburgh was recruiting several engineers for lighthouse construction in Japan in February 1868. It was too late to apply for chief engineer post, and McVean was appointed as assistance engineer together with A.W. Blundell. The chief engineer was Henry Brunton. The first lighthouse construction on Mikomoto-Jima in March to June 1869 was terrible, as Japanese masons did not know western construction manner at all. Although McVean asked Brunton revision of construction scheme, Brunton could not answer properly. McVean made up his mind to resign from the Lighthouse Office together with Blundell, and started engineering business at Yokohama under the name of Vulcan Foundry. He met Yamao Yozo, government officer in charge of Yokosuma Arsenal and Yokohama Ironwork at Yokohama, and got close friend with him in both private life and business as they have had common experience and friends in Scotland. McVean soon suggested Yamao to found survey office to make nationwide geodetic survey. Meanwhile, the Meiji government decided to establish the Ministry of Public Works (Japan) on 12 December 1870 by the advice of Edmund Morel, chief engineer of the Railway Construction to achieve rapid social and industrial development. After long discussions among the Cabinet members, on 28 September 1871 the government eventually arranged the Public Works consisting of 11 departments: railroads, shipyards, lighthouses, mines, an iron and steel industry, telecommunication, civil works, manufacturing, industrial promotion, engineering institution and survey.Hideo Izumida: Reconsideration of Foundation of Ministry of Public Works, Transaction of Japan Institution of Architecture, 2016.

Building Work (1) Engineering College Buildings: McVean was appointed as a chief surveyor for the Survey Department and extensively assisted Yamao, who had to head both the Survey and Engineering Institution. Morel and Yamao rushed to open the engineering college, but Morel passed away in October 1871. While McVean concentrated to design and construct the college buildings together with Henry Batson Joyner, he endeavoured to reunite Yamao with Hugh Matheson via Colin Brown.Colin Brown was Euing Lecturer of the Andersonian College.

They are a group of benthic living fishes distributed worldwide in tropical and temperate oceans, however, few species occasionally enter brackish waters or even fresh water habitats. They bury in sand or mud, leaving only the eyes and anterodorsal part of their head exposed. Members of the stargazers are characterised by having dorsally or dorsolaterally directed eyes placed on or near the top of their large, flattened, cuboid head. They are commonly called stargazers because these small eyes turn upwards 'looking at the stars'. They have oblique to vertical mouth, with lips usually lined with cutaneous cirri. Their body is elongated and sub-compressed. In the family Uranoscopidae, seven genera and 53 valid species are known. The genus comprises a total of 25 valid species of which the last two were discovered in 2018. Uranoscopus brunneus is a member of a species group which is characterised by a supracleithrum with a sharp spine at rear end and one or more spines inside. Hence, the dorsoposterior margin of the pectoral fin is distinctly concave (forming an angle of about 30‚Äì40¬∞ between upper edge and middle ray). Uranoscopus brunneus exclusively possesses within the group: * 12 anal-fin rays (other species 13‚Äì14), * 62 oblique scale rows along the sides of the body (other species 47‚Äì59), * 8 spines on the lower margin of the preopercle (other species 3‚Äì6), * and dark brown pectoral- fin membranes (other species: pale to light brown). == Distribution and habitat == The genus Uranoscopus is distributed in the Indo-West Pacific, the eastern Atlantic, and the Mediterranean and Black Sea. Uranoscopus brunneus can be found in Papua New Guinea (New Britain), Philippines, and Indonesia. The species can be found on soft bottoms of lower continental shelf; known depth range 315‚àí625 m. == Etymology == ‚ÄúBrunneus‚Äù (Latin) means brown; the name refers to the overall brown color of the species, and especially to its brown pectoral fin membranes. Uranoscopus is from the Greek, ouranos, \\"sky\\" and skopein, \\"to watch\\". == Life cycle == The stargazer lays small, transparent eggs on the bottom of the bay. These eggs float to the surface after they are released. They hatch into larvae and grow up to 6‚Äì7 mm (0.24‚Äì0.28 in). They slowly become dark in color and develop the electrical organs from eye muscles when they are 12‚Äì15 mm (0.5‚Äì0.6 in). After this they swim to the bottom and grow into adults. == References == __FORCETOC__ brunneus Category:Fish described in 2018 ","title":"Uranoscopus brunneus"},{"id":"60322678","text":"Gina Beavers is an American artist.

Established on the initiative of the National Committee for a Free Europe and a member of the Assembly of Captive European Nations, the Committee for a Free Lithuania continued to protest the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, advocate for the continued recognition of the state continuity of the Baltic states, and promote the ultimate goal of independent Lithuania. It was funded by the United States and was a part of the larger ideological and propaganda effort directed against the Soviet Union. It was chaired by Vaclovas Sidzikauskas until his death in 1973. After his death and loss of funding, the committee diminished. It became somewhat more active again in the 1980s and was officially closed when Lithuania declared independence in March 1990. ==Relationship with other organizations== The National Committee for a Free Europe, which had ties with the Central Intelligence Agency, approached Povilas ≈Ωadeikis, the Lithuanian envoy in Washington D.C., about creating a Lithuanian committee. In February 1951, ≈Ωadeikis proposed seven men for the Lithuanian Consultative Panel (renamed to the Committee for a Free Lithuania on 1 October 1952). The membership of eight men was approved in May 1951: Vaclovas Sidzikauskas (chairman), Kipras Bielinis (treasurer), Antanas Trimakas (secretary), Bronius Nemickas, Juozas Audƒónas, Mykolas Toli≈°ius, Pranas Vainauskas, Martynas Brakas. Each member was selected to represent a different political party of interwar Lithuania. Its members could be only citizens of Lithuania. The committee was officially organized on 1 June 1951. Latvians and Estonians organized equivalent committees. The three committees worked closely and shared the same office in New York. The Lithuanian committee also established contacts and held meetings with Alexander Kerensky, a key political figure in the Russian Revolution of 1917, the , and the Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic. Lithuania's political aspirations for independence were represented by several groups ‚Äì the Committee for a Free Lithuania, the Supreme Committee for the Liberation of Lithuania (VLIK), the Lithuanian Diplomatic Service, (ALT), and the Lithuanian World Community (PLB). That necessitated coordination between these groups. They held a political conference on 18‚Äì19 May 1954 in New York but did not establish a unified political center. Other coordinating meetings were held on 4‚Äì5 July 1959 in anticipation of the state visit by Nikita Khrushchev, on 30 April ‚Äì 1 May 1960 in anticipation of the 20th anniversary of the Soviet occupation, on 22‚Äì23 January 1966, on 9 January 1972 in anticipation of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, on 26‚Äì27 October 1974 to discuss the Helsinki Accords. However, the Committee for a Free Lithuania did not establish closer cooperation with other Lithuanian organizations or took the leading role among Lithuanian diaspora. ==Activities== One of the first tasks of the Committee for a Free Lithuania was to supply data, documents, and witnesses to the Kersten Committee, a select committee of the United States House of Representatives that investigated the occupation of the Baltic states. It also provided information on forced labor in the Soviet Union to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, published non-periodic Lithuanian-language political magazine Lietuva (Lithuania) in 1952‚Äì1956, joined Latvian and Estonian committees to establish the Baltic Freedom House and publish Baltic Review in English, French, and Spanish, organized events to mark the Captive Nations Week, monitored the Soviet press, and collected and analyzed information from behind the Iron Curtain. In November 1952, Radio Free Europe cancelled planned broadcasts in Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian (they were finally established in 1975) ‚Äì one of the initial stated goals of the Committee for a Free Lithuania was to provide information and other support to the planned radio program. The cancellation was mandated by the United States Department of State which officially stated that such radio programs would duplicate the programs on the Voice of America. The statute of the Lithuanian committee provided that the committee could publish studies and monographs on economy, religion, or education in Lithuania, but no such books were published ‚Äì unlike Polish or Slovak committees that were active in publishing. Sidzikauskas, as chairman of the Lithuanian committee, visited western Europe (Great Britain, Belgium, France, West Germany) in May 1963 and Brazil in February 1965. He was also a frequent member of the delegations to the United States Department of State to discuss foreign policy of the United States as it related to Soviet Union and Lithuania. The committee joined and became an integral part of the Assembly of Captive European Nations (ACEN) when it was established in 1954. Sidzikauskas became involved with ACEN becoming its chairman in 1960‚Äì1961 and 1965‚Äì1966 and deputy chairman in 1959‚Äì1960 and 1971‚Äì1972. ACEN and the Committee for a Free Lithuania wrote numerous memorandums and protest notes to world leaders reminding of the Soviet occupation. They assessed and reacted to world events (e.g. Hungarian Revolution of 1956 or Suez Crisis) looking for an opportunities to raise the issue of Lithuania's and other occupied countries' independence. For example, in May 1955, on the 37th anniversary of the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania, 21 former members of the assembly issued a memorandum to parliament members of United States, Canada, and Great Britain; the Lithuanian committee issued a memorandum to Pope Pius XII when his apostolic letter of 29 June 1956 addressed the danger of the communism to the Catholic Church in Poland and other Eastern Bloc countries, but failed to include Lithuania; ACEN and the Lithuanian committee for several years lobbied for adding the issue of independence of Soviet-occupied territories to the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly; representatives of the Baltic states issued a joint manifesto on the 20th anniversary of the Soviet occupation in June 1960 (in response, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adopted a resolution condemning the occupation in September 1960); the Lithuanian committee published a memorandum on Soviet colonialism in the Baltic states in response to the decolonisation of Africa in 1961; ACEN held a meeting with the International League for the Rights of Man which issued a report condemning human rights violations in the Soviet Union in 1962. They also organized protests on historically important dates or when, for example, Nikita Khrushchev visited United States in 1959. All of these actions kept the issue of Lithuania's independence on the political agenda despite the general fatigue and increasing acceptance of the status quo in Eastern Europe. At the same time, shifting Cold War politics had a direct impact on the Committee for a Free Lithuania. As the West placed hopes with the Khrushchev Thaw in the Soviet Union, funding for the committee was reduced. In January 1958, the paid staff of the committee was reduced from eight to six people. Officially, Kipras Bielinis and Pranas Vainauskas resigned from the committee. In 1965, the budget of ACEN and the Lithuanian committee was cut by 46%. The committee lost its funding from the Central Intelligence Agency in 1971 and was reorganized as a private institution. Its chairman Sidzikauskas died in 1973 and was replaced with Bronius Nemickas, but the committee was virtually inactive. ==References== Category:1951 establishments in the United States Category:Organizations established in 1951 Category:1990 disestablishments in the United States Category:Organizations disestablished in 1990 Category:Anti- communist organizations in the United States Category:Political advocacy groups in the United States Category:Lithuanian-American history Category:Anti-communism in Lithuania ","title":"Committee for a Free Lithuania"},{"id":"60323000","text":"Ostrov Dolgy () is a rural locality (a settlement) in Rassvetsky Selsoviet, Narimanovsky District, Astrakhan Oblast, Russia.

It includes negotiable areas for a particular aircraft application such as thrust or shaft power for fuel consumed, weight, cost, outside dimensions and life. It includes meeting regulated environmental limits which apply to emissions of noise and chemical pollutants, and regulated safety aspects which require a design that can safely tolerate environmental hazards such as birds, rain, hail and icing conditions. Aircraft engines are part of the propulsion system of an airplane, helicopter, rocket or UAV which produce rotary power transferred to a propeller or kinetic energy as a high-velocity gas exhaust stream. Aircraft engine types include turboprop, turbojet, turbofan and turboshaft. Piston engines are used in recreational personal aircraft and older aircraft. Electric engines are used in model aircraft, small drones, small UAVs and small manned aircraft. Aircraft engine performance has improved dramatically since the advent of the first powered flight in 1848 by John Stringfellow. Aircraft engine manufacturers have to constantly innovate to remain competitive by offering more efficient and more reliable engines. Improving the performance of aircraft engines reduces the cost of ownership for operators of commercial, military and private aircraft. ==Performance criteria== The following are different measures of the engine as a black box and most are negotiated between the engine manufacturer and its customer for a particular aircraft installation. Some, like noise, exhaust pollutants and certain operability requirements, such as acceleration times, are regulated with limits that have to be met for commercial operation. Each is the result of design iterations inside the \\"black box\\" using both analytical computer modelling and development testing.

Fuels include jet fuel and AVGAS (aviation gasoline), which differ from automotive engine fuels. Gas turbine engines will run on aviation gasoline as an alternative to jet fuel as in the case of turbojet booster engines on piston-engined aircraft. Small turboprop and business aircraft may be approved for a limited running time on avgas to allow refuelling at remote airstrips with no jet fuel supply. Different fuels are used for different applications due to their performance characteristics. ==== Jet fuel ==== Kerosene jet fuel, also known as aviation turbine fuel (ATF), is designed to be used in aircraft powered by gas turbine engines. Jet fuel used to power gas turbine engines has been the preferred propellant since the advent of this type of engine due to the fuel's favourable combustion characteristics and relatively high energy content. Jet fuel remains the most commonly used fuel in aviation due to the popularity of turbofan and turboprop engines. Turbofan engines power most large commercial passenger and cargo aircraft today. Civil jet fuel grades include A-1, A, B, TS-1. Military grades include JP-4, JP-8 and JP-5. Military varieties differ from civil jet fuels due to the addition of corrosion inhibitors and anti- icing additives. JP-8 jet fuel is the most common fuel among NATO aircraft fleets. ==== AVGAS ==== AVGAS (aviation gasoline) is widely used in reciprocating engines (piston engines). Aviation gasoline is highly volatile and very flammable, with a low flash point, which makes it unsuitable for use in gas turbine engines. Volatility is how easily a substance will change from a liquid to a gaseous state. Highly volatile fuel is required to power reciprocating engines as the liquid gasoline pumped to the carburettor must readily vaporise in order to combust in the engine. There is however a balance of volatility needed. If AVGAS fuel is too volatile, it may cause vapour lock and early detonation in the engine cylinder. If the AVGAS is not volatile enough, there will be inconsistent engine acceleration and power throughout the revolution range. AVGAS is commonly supplemented with Tetraethyl-lead (TEL) to prevent engine knocking, which is a damaging build-up of pressure inside the engine caused by low octane rated fuel which may lead to engine failure in reciprocating engines. Antiknock additives allow for greater efficiencyCaris, D. F. and Nelson, E. E. (1959). A New Look at High Compression Engines SAE Trans. and peak power.Loeb, A.P. (1995). \\"Birth of the Kettering Doctrine: Fordism, Sloanism and Tetraethyl Lead\\" (PDF). Business and Economic History. 24 (2). TEL has been banned by the European Union for automotive use due to environmental concerns, but remains approved for use in aircraft. External fuel tank for the Discovery shuttle ==== Rocket fuel ==== Rocket fuel consists of solid, liquid and gel state fuels for propulsion. In order to power rockets, a fuel and an oxidiser are mixed within the combustion chamber, producing a high energy propulsive exhaust as thrust. The main uses for rocket fuel are for space shuttle boosters in order to propel the craft out of the atmosphere, or for missiles. Solid rocket propellant does not degrade in long-term storage and remains reliable on combustion. This allows munitions to remain loaded and fired when needed, which is highly regarded for military use. Once ignited, solid rocket propellants cannot be shut down. The fuel and the oxidiser are stored within a metal casing. Once ignited, the fuel burns from the centre of the solid compound towards the edges of the metal casing. Burn rates and intensity are manipulated by the changing of the shape of a channel between the fuel and the casing shell. Two varieties of solid rocket fuel propellants exist. These include homogeneous and composite solid rocket fuels. These fuels are characteristically dense, stable at ordinary temperatures and easily storable. Liquid fuels are more controllable than solid rocket fuels, and can be shutoff after ignition and restarted, as well as offering greater thrust control. Liquid propellants are stored in two parts in an engine, as the fuel in one tank and an oxidiser in another. These liquids are mixed in the combustion chamber and ignited. Hypergolic fuel is mixed and ignites spontaneously, requiring no separate ignition. Liquid fuel compounds include petroleum, hydrogen and oxygen. ==== Electric ==== 269x269px Electricity may be transmitted to an aircraft's electric motors through batteries, ground power cables, solar cells, ultra-capacitors, fuel cells and power beaming. Electrically powered engines are currently only suitable for light aircraft and UAV's (unmanned aerial vehicles). Electrical engines are praised for being environmentally friendly and relatively quiet. There are a multitude of personal UAV's and drones available for purchase without a licence or age restriction globally, capable of high speed manoeuvres and agile flight characteristics. Typically aircraft with electric engines have significantly shorter flight durations than conventional fuel powered aircraft although battery technology developments and solar energy conversion has created potential for use in commercial aircraft. Jeffrey Engler, CEO of Wright Electric, estimates that commercially viable electric planes will reduce energy costs by 30%. ==== Hydrogen ==== Hydrogen as a fuel, through the combustion of hydrogen in a jet engine or fuel cell, is a viable fuel source for aircraft engines. Currently, pressurised tanks to hold the hydrogen fuel with sufficient volume and a low enough weight are not available for large commercial aircraft, but have been successfully implemented on smaller personal aircraft such as the Boeing Fuel Cell Demonstrator by Boeing Phantom Works and on launch rockets for space shuttles when stored cryogenically. Hydrogen can be used to power a multitude of craft, via turbine engines, piston engines and rocket engines. Hydrogen fuel cells create electrical power through hydrolysis and are in various stages of research for applications in environmentally friendly engines as they emit no toxic exhaust. Hydrogen powered engines only emit water through the bonding of oxygen and hydrogen, as well as any excess hydrogen as exhaust. This means that this is a highly environmentally friendly propulsion system. ==== Electro-aerodynamic thrust ==== Researchers from MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) have developed an ion drive propulsion system with no moving parts. The 'engine' is propelled by ionic wind, also known as electro-aerodynamic thrust. This new form of aircraft propulsion would be completely silent and require far less maintenance than conventional fossil-fuel powered engines. This technology has the potential to be used in conjunction with conventional aircraft combustion engines as a hybrid system with further development or even as propulsion systems on spacecraft. === Atmospheric conditions === Atmospheric conditions are an important consideration in the analysis of the factors contributing to differing aircraft engine performance. These factors include altitude, temperature and humidity. Aircraft engine performance decreases as altitude and temperature increase. In the case of high humidity, the volume of air available for combustion is reduced, causing losses in power in combustion engines. Aircraft engine performance is measured at baseline parameters of a standard atmosphere (29.92‚Äù of mercury) at 15 ¬∞C. Weather may be a physical barrier to aircraft operation, as it is in the case of forecast of hail or volcanic ash, because of the risk of serious damage to all the engines installed on the aircraft. ==== Altitude ==== Density altitude chart When altitude is increased, air density decreases. With lower air density, air molecules are further apart from each other, which will lead to declines in performance of combustion engines. Electric-powered aircraft will not see losses of power output at high altitude, but rather aerodynamic losses as propellers work harder to propel the same amount of air as at ground level. However, cooling capacity will decline on both combustion and electric motors at high altitude due to the lower density of air. This phenomenon is why the operating limit of helicopters is constrained, as propeller thrust returns to a value of 0 when the air becomes too thin at high altitude. This makes high altitude airports significantly more dangerous than airports at sea level. ==== Temperature ==== Temperature has significant effects on the maximum power available and the operational efficiency of an aircraft engine. This applies for combustion and electrical engines. Pilots account for the ambient temperature on the day of a flight in order to calculate the takeoff distance required. Extreme heat or cold temperatures are performance limitations for aircraft engines. An aircraft flying at a constant altitude with an ambient air temperature of 20 ¬∞C would experience more favourable performance than flying with an ambient air temperature of 40 ¬∞C. With cold temperatures, air is denser and a larger mass of air/fuel mixture is combusted, leading to higher efficiency and greater power. ==== Humidity ==== Humidity affects the mass of oxygen in each unit of volume of air in the atmosphere, reducing the burn rate and increasing the combustion time of fuel in a combustion engine which will reduce thermal efficiency. Minimal losses of power occur where the energy of the engine's combustion heat the moisture in the engine. For electrical components found within electric motors, excess moisture is capable of damaging circuits and electrical systems. In reality, air is never fully dry, or without moisture in the atmosphere. Even when air is considered dry, it retains a moisture content of around 5%. ==== Weather ==== Weather has significant impacts the performance of an engine, and also the propensity to cause engine malfunction or failure. Winds are both beneficial and unfavourable depending on the direction of the wind and the heading of the aircraft. A significant weakness of many aircraft is their use of propellers or turbines in their engines. This is because any particulates that enter the engine other than air may cause damage. An example of this is hail, when precipitation freezes. If the hail is severe enough, engine inlet guide vanes or compressor blades can bend or break under impact. Volcanic ash ejected into the atmosphere due to a volcanic eruption is another example of reduced engine performance due to weather. Particles of volcanic ash are abrasive at high speed, leading to abrasion on compressor fan blades. The glass-like silicate compound found in volcanic ash has a lower melting point than the combustion temperature of fuel and air in a jet engine. When ingested into the engine, the material melts and deposits in cooler areas of the engine, leading to compressor stall and thrust loss. == References == Category:Aircraft Engine ","title":"Aircraft engine performance"},{"id":"60323002","text":"Bo Thao-Urabe (born 1973) is a social entrepreneur and founder and Executive Director of the Coalition of Asian American Leaders.

He was a high-ranking member of the Gulf Cartel, a criminal group based in Tamaulipas, Mexico, and worked as the second-in-command of the cartel in Reynosa from 2005 to 2007. Land√≠n Mart√≠nez was a trusted enforcer of the kingpin Gregorio Sauceda Gamboa. Among his responsibilities included managing international drug trafficking shipments from Tamaulipas to Texas, collecting taxes from independent traffickers who operated in his turf, and managing money laundering operations. Land√≠n Mart√≠nez was also a commander in the Tamaulipas State Police, where he headed the homicide task-force. According to a witness who testified against him in court, Land√≠n Mart√≠nez worked for the Gulf Cartel while still employed by the state police. In July 2007, Land√≠n Mart√≠nez was arrested after being spotted by an off-duty U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent inside a supermarket in McAllen, Texas. He was charged with multiple counts of drug trafficking, conspiracy, and money laundering. In January 2008, he was found guilty of all counts and sentenced to life imprisonment. However, his sentence was later reduced. The case against Land√≠n Mart√≠nez highlighted unprecedented levels of cooperation between local and federal authorities in the U.S. and Mexico. Since the case was built from a bottom-up approach, with low-level criminals providing authorities with information that led to their leadership, investigators stated that the case could potentially serve as a model for future organized crime cases. ==Early life and career== Carlos Land√≠n Mart√≠nez was born in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico, in . He was a member of the Tamaulipas State Police, where he worked as the commander of the homicide investigatory task-force. His efforts in the agency were lauded in law enforcement circles. In the police, he was known as \\"El Puma Uno\\" () for his aggressive stance against the most-wanted criminals in Tamaulipas; his family members nicknamed him \\"El Sapo\\" () for his wide face and neck. In March 1997, the Attorney General's Office (PGR) arrested him and Pablo Villanueva Hern√°ndez, another police chief, for reportedly being involved with Los Nichos, a Reynosa-based drug gang. Hours later, however, Land√≠n Mart√≠nez was released from custody due to lack of evidence and resumed his police duties. On 28 May 1999, Land√≠n Mart√≠nez was permanently released from the Tamaulipas State Police along with nine other police chiefs. This decision was made by the former Tamaulipas Governor Tom√°s Yarrington (1999‚Äì2005). Yarrington released them because they were suspected by the PGR of being involved in drug trafficking during the administration of his predecessor Manuel Cavazos Lerma (1993‚Äì1999). When he was in the state police, Land√≠n Mart√≠nez was involved with the Gulf Cartel, a criminal group based in Tamaulipas. Authorities also stated he worked closely with Los Zetas, the Gulf Cartel's former paramilitary group. Land√≠n Mart√≠nez lived a double life to avoid detection; he posed as a retiree while being involved in organized crime. In Mexico, he ran a criminal organization responsible for international drug trafficking; in the U.S., he spent time with his family, including his three children and four grandchildren. U.S. authorities tracked Land√≠n Mart√≠nez's drug trafficking activities back to 1998, when his criminal cells in Granjeno and Pe√±itas, Texas, worked with a family-led smuggling ring headed by Francisco Meza-Rojas, a former McAllen police officer. For nearly a decade, Land√≠n Mart√≠nez's drug trafficking cells were responsible for moving narcotics from Mexico into the U.S. Most of the drugs from the Gulf Cartel were cultivated in Michoac√°n, smuggled through Tamaulipas, and then redistributed in South Texas and throughout the rest of the U.S. The drugs were smuggled via the Rio Grande River and dropped off in designated spots for arranged middlemen to pick up. The drugs were then given to other smugglers, who met in parking lots of businesses in the McAllen area. Smugglers linked to Land√≠n Mart√≠nez would then take the drugs and store them in stash houses across the city. A group of smugglers would then take those drugs past the U.S. Border Patrol stations in Falfurrias and Sarita, where they would then be distributed to cities like Dallas, Houston, Chicago, Tampa, Nashville, Atlanta, Greensboro, and New York City. Once drug cells were finalized, couriers would bring the money back to Mexico from all over the U.S. through the Reynosa border crossing, where it reached Land√≠n Mart√≠nez's network. In August 2005, U.S. authorities discovered a tunnel that was used by Land√≠n Mart√≠nez's associates to smuggle drugs from Mexico to downtown Hidalgo, Texas. From January 2005 to January 2007, Land√≠n Mart√≠nez was the second-in-command for the Gulf Cartel in Reynosa. Among his duties included collecting taxes from independent drug traffickers who wanted to smuggle drugs through his corridor, which extended between the Tamaulipas municipalities of Gustavo D√≠az Ordaz and R√≠o Bravo. Those who tried to circumvent this taxation, or who were found responsible for losing drugs or money, were kidnapped, tortured, and/or killed on Land√≠n Mart√≠nez's orders. This taxation system was a profitable business for the Gulf Cartel. The Reynosa corridor was headed by Gregorio Sauceda Gamboa, a kingpin that reported to Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n, the top leader of the cartel. Land√≠n Mart√≠nez worked under both of them. However, Sauceda Gamboa began having differences with the Gulf Cartel's leadership due to his perceived weakness; his excessive drinking, drug addiction, and cancer diagnosis pushed him to the sidelines. While Sauceda Gamboa's influence declined, Land√≠n Mart√≠nez began generating more influence and money. The leadership differences triggered an internal rift in the Gulf Cartel; multiple regional leaders were killed, and Land√≠n Mart√≠nez was rumored dead in 2006. Land√≠n Mart√≠nez worked under the kingpin Jorge Eduardo Costilla S√°nchez; his colleagues were the siblings Gregorio and H√©ctor Manuel Sauceda Gamboa, Zeferino Pe√±a Cu√©llar (\\"Don Zefe\\"), and Alfonso Lam Liu (\\"Gordo Lam\\"). However, when the infighting began, Land√≠n Mart√≠nez began having differences with them and others cartel leaders. In the mid-2000s, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) launched Operation Puma, a multi-agency investigation that targeted the Gulf Cartel's network in the U.S.; it was dubbed \\"Puma\\" in reference to Land√≠n Mart√≠nez, the main target of the investigation. The investigation began in Dallas, Texas, and resulted in over 30 arrests in Dallas, San Antonio, McAllen, and Laredo. The DEA teamed up with law enforcement agencies in Mexico, as well as with federal, state, and local police agencies in the U.S. This included collaboration with the police departments in Dallas, McKinney, Garland, Plano, Kaufman, McAllen, Mission, Houston, Laredo, Texarkana, San Juan, Weslaco, Pharr, and San Antonio. In addition, it received support from the Texas Department of Public Safety, the U.S. Marshal's Service, and the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. According to the DEA, the collaboration between agencies, including the ones with Mexico, highlighted an \\"unprecedented\\" level of cooperation between law enforcement. In addition to Land√≠n Mart√≠nez, the DEA's investigation also focused on arresting ten high- ranking members of the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas, who were placed in a most- wanted list with bounties. In May 2007, U.S. federal authorities indicted Land√≠n Mart√≠nez and thirteen others for drug trafficking, conspiracy, and money laundering. == Arrest == On 17 July 2007, Land√≠n Mart√≠nez was spotted inside a H-E-B supermarket in McAllen, Texas, by off-duty DEA agent Leonardo Silva. Land√≠n Mart√≠nez was buying watermelons and was accompanied by two men who were apparently his bodyguards; Silva was at the store to prepare for a barbecue with his family. Silva described that he was in the store buying corn and got a glance of Land√≠n Mart√≠nez by coincidence. At that time, the DEA was investigating Land√≠n Mart√≠nez for his involvement with the Gulf Cartel and had been working on the case for at least two years. Silva recognized his face from the DEA case he and his coworkers had been working on. Days prior to the encounter, the DEA received information that Land√≠n Mart√≠nez was in the Rio Grande Valley. Silva was not properly equipped to execute the arrest. He followed the men as they left the supermarket and drove through an intersection before calling on the McAllen Police Department for assistance. Land√≠n Mart√≠nez did not resist arrest and was unarmed. He then admitted to being himself. Land√≠n Mart√≠nez did not have an arrest warrant that day, but the DEA had been reassured by Mexican authorities that they would arrest him in Mexico if U.S. authorities were unable to get a warrant from a U.S. judge. He was also a wanted criminal in Mexico. \\"He happened to fall into our lap, so we had to move fast,\\" Silva said. \\"You only get one shot at a person like Mr. Land√≠n.\\" Land√≠n Mart√≠nez appeared in court on 19 July for his initial hearing with judge Peter E. Ormsby. His attorney, Oscar Rodolfo Alvarez, told the judge that Land√≠n Mart√≠nez fled Mexico and sought for safe haven in the U.S. because he feared for his life. He said Land√≠n Mart√≠nez was an honorable police officer and that drug traffickers he worked to arrest wanted to kill him. \\"Let's not forget that police commanders are turning up dead every day in Mexico,\\" his attorney said. In the hearing, the prosecution explained the drug charges against Land√≠n Mart√≠nez, which included two drug seizures between 2002 and 2005. DEA agent Jaime Fernandez told the judge that four informants had linked Land√≠n Mart√≠nez with two cocaine seizures in the U.S. from Mexico. One of the sources, according to the DEA, verbally stated that he paid Land√≠n Mart√≠nez to allow him to freely move drugs through the Reynosa corridor. Alvarez told the prosecution they conducted an unlawful arrest because they did not have an arrest warrant when they detained Land√≠n Mart√≠nez outside the store. U.S. authorities stated that they had not issued an arrest warrant for him because they did not expect to arrest him in the U.S. since he rarely visited. The prosecution asked the judge to deny his bond; although Land√≠n Mart√≠nez was legally allowed to enter the U.S. with his Border Crossing Card, he crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally through the Rio Grande River to visit his family in McAllen and Pharr. Authorities stated it was unclear when Land√≠n Mart√≠nez illegally made it into the U.S. Alvarez told the judge that the case against Land√≠n Mart√≠nez was built by criminals that Land√≠n Mart√≠nez helped arrest, and cited vengeance as a driving motive for his detention. He asked the judge to consider Land√≠n Mart√≠nez's years of service in the Tamaulipas State Police and the unknown identities of his accusers as evidence of Land√≠n Mart√≠nez's innocence. \\"If Mr. Land√≠n had been a police officer in the state of Texas and two defendants accused him of criminal activity, he wouldn't have been suspended,\\" Alvarez said. Ormsby ordered Land√≠n Mart√≠nez to be held without bond and under federal custody. Because of his questionable entry to the U.S., the judge stated that Land√≠n Mart√≠nez could also be held on immigration charges. ==Trial == On 14 January 2008, Land√≠n Mart√≠nez appeared in court under tight security. Parking lots close to the courthouse were cordoned off by the police, and officers screened over 30 of Land√≠n Mart√≠nez's family members who attended the initial proceedings. The SWAT team of the Hidalgo County Sheriff's Office was on standby that evening by the McAllen Police Department, where Land√≠n Mart√≠nez was planned to be held for the duration of the trial. The McAllen Police chief confirmed that they were assisting the United States Marshals Service by housing Land√≠n Mart√≠nez in their facilities. During the hearings, the prosecution accused Land√≠n Mart√≠nez of collecting taxes from traffickers on his turf. The defense stated that the evidence from the prosecution relied on gangsters' hearsay and of smugglers who were looking to confess for a reduced sentence. The jury panel consisted of three men and nine women. Land√≠n Mart√≠nez was facing 10-counts of drug trafficking, conspiracy, and money laundering from activities between 2005 and 2007. He pleaded not guilty. On 15 January, witness Francisco Camacho Barajas told the jury that Land√≠n Mart√≠nez was involved in the Gulf Cartel in Reynosa while still working for the Tamaulipas State Police. Camacho was also a smuggler for the Gulf Cartel, and was facing a 10-year conviction for his drug charges; he had worked for two people who reported to Land√≠n Mart√≠nez. \\"They told me many times who was the boss,\\" Camacho said in Spanish to the jury. \\"It was Carlos Land√≠n, El Puma.\\" He also told the jury that he was a rehabilitated man and wanted to tell the truth to help himself from his previous drug abuse. Land√≠n Mart√≠nez's defense accused Camacho of being an unreliable witness. They cited his drug abuse and lack of first-hand knowledge of Land√≠n Mart√≠nez's supposed involvement in the Gulf Cartel as evidence of his unreliability as a witness. When he asked if he had met Land√≠n Mart√≠nez in person or saw him committing a crime, the witness' consistence response was \\"no\\". Land√≠ Mart√≠nez's attorney argued that the witnesses' testimonies did not directly link him to the accusations. Another drug smuggler, Jose Moncerrat Narvaez, testified that he received drug shipments from Land√≠n Mart√≠nez's network across the Rio Grande River from a man named Juan √ìscar Garza Alan√≠s. Narvaez also gave testimony of his personal relationship with Land√≠n Mart√≠nez; he told the jury that he was a former municipal police officer in R√≠o Bravo and he had a special chair to accommodate Land√≠n Mart√≠nez's complexion. He also told the jury that he was not offered a lower sentence if he testified against him, but that he would gladly accept an offer from the prosecution if it were presented to him. On 16 January, the prosecution brought forward multiple bags filled with cocaine to show to the jury. Each bag was valued between US$12,000 to US$15,000. The police described their encounters with people under Land√≠n Mart√≠nez in their investigations, and how they recovered the narcotics as part of the case against him and the thirteen other co-defendants. One of the other co-defendants listed in the indictment, Luis Robledo Mart√≠nez, was present during the courtroom and accused of drug trafficking. The police described his October 2006 arrest in San Juan following a traffic stop, where they discovered he was in possession of more than US$27,000 in cash. Robledo told the police that US$6,000 was to purchase a vehicle in a car auction in Alamo, but the police stated that the auction had been closed for the past two years. Upon inspecting the vehicle with Robledo's consent, the police found an additional US$21,500. The police suspected the money came from drug proceeds. Robledo pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking conspiracy and illegal possession of money. Land√≠n Mart√≠nez and Robledo were present while recordings of phone calls, intercepted by the prosecution's witness Ricardo Mu√±iz, were played for the jury. The recordings included mentions of aliases of members within the Gulf Cartel, drug and money operations, and of worries that they may be heard from authorities through wire tapping. Land√≠n Mart√≠nez was rarely mentioned in the recordings; the witnesses told the jury that they worked under Land√≠n Mart√≠nez but did not have direct contact with him. One of the phones calls from 2006 mentioned a man known by his alias \\"Maestro\\" (), who was responsible for smuggling money from the U.S. to Mexico for Land√≠n Mart√≠nez. The prosecution said that this person was Robledo, but his attorney, Jim Grissom, disputed the claim and said he would bring forward a witness who would tell the jury it was not Robledo. Robeldo told the jury that he never smuggled narcotics or cash for the Gulf Cartel, but admitted to bringing large sums of cash to the U.S. to buy cars to later resell in Mexico. In the phone conversations, Mu√±iz and the \\"Maestro\\" spoke about drug operations in vague terms, often referring to drug proceeds as documents. Several U.S. law enforcement agents who participated in drug seizures from Mu√±iz's operations were expected to testify against Land√≠n Mart√≠nez and Robledo that afternoon before the court session ended. On 17 January, more witnesses testified against Land√≠n Mart√≠nez and accused him of drug trafficking. Daniel Zamorano Marchant, one of the witnesses who had previously smuggled marijuana and methamphetamine for the Gulf Cartel, stated that Land√≠n Mart√≠nez collected fees from drug and human traffickers who wanted to operate in his turf. \\"If you want to participate in illegal activity you need to talk to the cartel leader of that area,\\" he said. \\"Otherwise you will be kidnapped and killed.\\" Zamorano and two other witnesses told the jury that they had met, struck agreements, and/or been kidnapped by a man known as El Puma. Zamorano also stated that the Gulf Cartel received support from the Mexican police to conduct drug trafficking operations in Reynosa. Land√≠n Mart√≠nez's attorney Alvarez questioned the witnesses' claims and asked them if they ever heard Land√≠n Mart√≠nez's actual name in any drug operation. Another witness, Antonio Parra S√°enz, took the stance and said he was kidnapped by the Gulf Cartel in Reynosa and tortured for 15 days after the Mexican police seized US$2.5 million in cocaine from a stash house he was guarding in Las Milpas, Texas. The seizure was conducted in July 2006, and resulted in the confiscation of of cocaine, about of methamphetamine, US$40,000 in cash, and firearms, ammunition and bullet proof vests. Parra S√°enz was released after the cartel was convinced that he did not steal the drugs, but his family was extorted for money to repay the drug debt. He told the jury that Land√≠n Mart√≠nez was one of his captors. He said he saw Land√≠n Mart√≠nez inside a black Suburban in Reynosa moments before he was taken captive by his henchmen. On 18 January, Arturo Alonso Sequera, a drug smuggler from North Carolina that worked for the Gulf Cartel under Land√≠n Mart√≠nez, testified against him in court. He stated that Land√≠n Mart√≠nez supervised and ordered the torture and execution of a man that refused to cooperate with the Gulf Cartel. \\"[Land√≠n Mart√≠nez] told me, 'You don't want to work for us? We will show you what happens to those who don't listen to us'\\", Sequera told the jury. Sequera said that he was forced to work with the Gulf Cartel in August 2005 after he saw two men retrieving drugs hidden inside a vehicle's tires. He said that the men, who were linked to Land√≠n Mart√≠nez, threatened to kill him and his family if he did not join the cartel. Sequera said he worked for the Gulf Cartel in Greensboro, North Carolina, by selling the drugs to U.S. distributors, and by smuggling drug proceeds back to Mexico through Reynosa. He said he stopped working for the cartel when Land√≠n Mart√≠nez's men asked him to smuggle a heroin shipment from Reynosa to McAllen in December 2005. == Conviction == During the seven-day trial, the jury reviewed the exhibits presented by the prosecution, which included drug seizure samples and hours of wiretapped conversations between Land√≠n Mart√≠nez's smugglers in the Rio Grande Valley. Witnesses described the Gulf Cartel as a complex organization where low-level members were not allowed to participate in the criminal group's core operations, thus helping reduce the liability of the cartel leaders and their direct involvement in drug trafficking. In their closing arguments, Land√≠n Mart√≠nez's defense accused the government of using \\"stories from jailbirds\\" as part of their evidence against their client. They reiterated that the charges against him did not link him directly to the crimes. The defense did not call forward any witnesses during the trial, and stated that they did this because the burden of proof fell on the prosecution. The prosecution stated that Land√≠n Mart√≠nez stirred the direction of his criminal activities through his subordinates. Land√≠n Mart√≠nez's defense stated that their client faced five additional drug and money laundering charges in a 29-count indictment that was made from the drug seizure in Las Milpas. This meant that no matter what the verdict was, Land√≠n Mart√≠nez would remain in federal custody to face his additional drug charges in court. Land√≠n Mart√≠nez pleaded not guilty to the charges in the new indictment. On 22 January, after nearly eight and a half hours in deliberations that spanned for over two days, Land√≠n Mart√≠nez was found guilty of all charges: ten counts of drug trafficking, conspiracy, and money laundering. Land√≠n Mart√≠nez appeared emotionless when the verdict was read. His attorney said that he did not believe that the prosecution presented evidence to convict him, but he accepted the verdict and said he would weigh on the options he had left. Over a dozen of Land√≠n Mart√≠nez's family members were present during the trial's sessions. A few of them sobbed outside of the courtroom when the verdict was decided. His eldest daughter, Sandra Land√≠n, spoke to reporters and stated that Land√≠n Mart√≠nez was an exemplary person. \\"He's the best father and grandfather... We love him a lot,\\" she told reporters. Land√≠n Mart√≠nez's legal team was surprised when the verdict was read since they thought the jury would not find enough direct evidence to convict him. They told reports that they were wrong about their assessment of the jury's view. Land√≠n Mart√≠nez's legal team also questioned the credibility of the witnesses presented by the prosecution. They stated that many of them were seeking leniency in their sentences in exchange for testifying against their client. Before being taken back to prison, U.S. Marshalls allowed for Land√≠n Mart√≠nez to have contact with his family, who was present with him throughout the trial and his conviction. U.S. authorities also stated that the conviction of Land√≠n Mart√≠nez would likely serve as a stepping-stone for the case against C√°rdenas Guill√©n, the top leader of the Gulf Cartel who was extradited to the U.S. in 2007. Like Land√≠n Mart√≠nez, he was facing trial in the U.S. and was expected to start in May 2008. Prosecutors stated that they could link the Gulf Cartel's drug trafficking activities in the U.S. through Land√≠n Mart√≠nez, and then use that against C√°rdenas Guill√©n during his trial. === Sentence and aftermath === On 29 April 2008, Land√≠n Mart√≠nez was sentenced to life imprisonment in McAllen by U.S. District Judge Randy Crane. The sentence was for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and for multiple counts of distributing more than of cocaine. He was handed life imprisonment for being accountable for the possession with intent to distribute of of cocaine and for his leadership role in the Gulf Cartel. In addition to these convictions, Land√≠n Mart√≠nez also received the maximum sentence of 20 years for money laundering, which included drug proceeds over US$1.6 million. He was also sentenced to a statutory maximum of 40 years for being in possession with intent to distribute of cocaine and five additional years for a cash smuggling conviction. In addition to Land√≠n Mart√≠nez's convictions, the judge also sentenced Luis Robledo Mart√≠nez to 188 months (15.6 years) in prison in addition to five years of supervised release for possession with intent to distribute cocaine, conspiracy to launder assets, and for laundering US$27,290. The judge ordered all these sentences to be served concurrently. The case established that Land√≠n Mart√≠nez held a leadership role in the Gulf Cartel in Reynosa, and that he was responsible for collecting fees from smuggling activities conducted in Reynosa and across the U.S.-Mexico border in the McAllen‚ÄìMission metropolitan area. The testimony presented in the trial proved that Land√≠n Mart√≠nez exercised the use of force to control drug trafficking activities in Reynosa and against other members of the Gulf Cartel. Multiple law enforcement agencies participated in the case against Land√≠n Mart√≠nez. Among them included the DEA, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Texas Department of Public Safety, and the police departments of McAllen, Pharr, Weslaco, Palmview and Mission. The prosecution team consisted of Assistant U.S. Attorneys Patricia Cook Profit and Jesse Salazar. Moreover, U.S. federal authorities stated that the case against Land√≠n Mart√≠nez was one of the most significant drug cases they had successfully closed in recent years, and highlighted the importance of cross- border collaboration between Mexican officials and U.S. authorities from local, state, and federal agencies. The DEA recognized that their growing collaboration in anti-drug efforts in Mexico improved in the administration of Mexican President Felipe Calder√≥n (2006‚Äì2012) who launched a campaign against organized crime groups in Mexico in 2006 and made the Gulf Cartel one of its priorities. In addition, U.S. federal authorities stated that the case could serve as a model for future organized crime cases charging top crime bosses. Authorities explained that they built the case against Land√≠n Mart√≠nez from the bottom up, using the information from low-level criminals arrested in the U.S. and Mexico, which slowly led them to information about the cartel's leadership structure. When the sentence was read, Land√≠n Mart√≠nez did not issue a statement. His attorney, Eric Jarvis, stated that he maintained his innocence and that they would seek to appeal the sentence. Jarvis said that the case against his client was \\"purely circumstantial\\". Land√≠n Mart√≠nez was also trying to get back two pieces of jewelry that were seized from him by U.S. authorities when he was arrested. One of the pieces he was wearing was a golden pendant depicting St. Jude; the item was later appraised at US$12,400. The item was stubbed in diamonds, emeralds, and a ruby. U.S. authorities seized his jewelry because they believed they were acquired from drug proceeds. Land√≠n Mart√≠nez's defense team said they were surprised when they first heard that U.S. authorities wanted to keep his jewelry, especially after they returned his watch, wallet, and rings prior to the start of his trial. \\"They just want to have a trophy,\\" his attorney stated. Jarvis confirmed that he had not discussed this issue with his client or that he had seen the jewelry; he said they were busy working on the other drug charges his client was facing. On 8 May, the prosecution and the defense reached an agreement to not take this seizure case to a jury. Though the terms were not explicitly outlined, both the prosecution and the defense agreed to either auction the jewelry and divide the earnings, or have each of them take one of the pieces of jewelry. On 6 August 2008, Land√≠n Mart√≠nez pleaded guilty to the second 29-count indictment. As part of the plea agreement, he admitted his involvement in drug trafficking activities from Mexico to the U.S. in 2006. The prosecution agreed to drop four charges during his second sentencing. Land√≠n Mart√≠nez's sentence was later reduced; his released date is scheduled on 13 October 2029. He is imprisoned at the Federal Medical Center, Butner, a North Carolina federal security prison for inmates with special health needs. ==See also== *Mexican Drug War ==Footnotes== ==References== == Bibliography == * * * ==Further reading== * Category:Gulf Cartel members Category:People from Reynosa, Tamaulipas Category:Mexican police officers convicted of crimes Category:Mexican people imprisoned abroad Category:1950s births Category:Living people Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by the United States federal government ","title":"Carlos Land√≠n Mart√≠nez"},{"id":"60323048","text":"Alfred Bernstein (April 9, 1911 ‚Äì February 28, 2003) was an American civil rights and union activist. ==Background== Alfred David Bernstein was born on April 9, 1911, in New York City. He obtained two degrees from Columbia University, including a degree from Columbia University Law School. ==Career== In 1937, he moved to Washington, DC where he worked as an investigator for inquiry by the Senate Commerce Committee (AKA Senate Railroad Investigating Committee AKA Wheeler Committee) into the railroad industry then under scrutiny. (\\"I wasn't always on the payroll of the committee itself, but I always was attached to it,\\" he later said.) While conducting investigations, he observed how poorly government workers, especially blacks, were treated. In 1941, he took a six-week leave of absence to help prepare a wage case for the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen. In 1942, he joined the Office of Price Administration (OPA) based in San Francisco as investigator. In 1943, he served two years in the United States Air Force in the Pacific theater of World War II. Around November 1945, Bernstein became director of negotiations for the United Public Workers of America (UPWA) until July 1951, shortly before he appeared under subpoena before Congress. He was an active opponent of Harry S. Truman's Executive Order No. 9835 which required a loyalty oath \\"designed to root out communist influence in the U.S. federal government\\" and testified against it before the United States House Committee on Education and Labor and was subsequently called by a Senate subcommittee to defend his own loyalty. Later, Bernstein served as a fundraiser for the Eleanor Roosevelt Institute for Cancer Research and the Union of Hebrew Congregations before joining the National Conference of Christians and Jews in 1960 where he served until 1985 as vice president for development. ==Union and civil rights activism== From 1937 to 1950, Bernstein served as an official in the United Federal Workers of America (after its 1946 merger, known as the United Public Workers of America). In the 1940s, he and his wife were members of the Communist party and, according to his son, Carl Bernstein, were persecuted by the US federal government. In 1947, Bernstein testified about a strike against the GSI. (On January 26‚Äì28 and February 2, 1948, a hearing of the House Education and Labor Subcommittee, chaired by U.S. Representative Clare E. Hoffman, occurred on the topic of a strike by United Cafeteria and Restaurant Workers (Local 471) and its parent, the United Public Workers of America (UPWA), CIO, against Government Services, Inc. (GSI), which had already lasted nearly a month. Hoffman refused to let UPWA head Abram Flaxer read a statement and asked questions including whether Flaxer was a communist. One of his UAW attorneys, Nathan R. Witt, objected to \\"abuse of congressional power.\\" When Forer rose to follow on from Witt, Hoffman asked him, \\"Are you the same Forer who defended Gerhard Eisler?\\" When Witt objected to Hoffman's question, it led Hoffman to eject Witt from the hearing. On January 26, 1948, Bernstein charged that House committee agents had raided the union's offices. During January, William S. Tyson, solicitor for the Labor Department, and Robert N. Denham, general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board, both agreed that nothing in the Taft-Hartley Act prohibited GSI from bargaining with a non- complying union. However, Denham added, the Act intended to \\"eliminate Communist influence from unions by denying to such unions the services of NLRB.\\" ) On October 11, 1951, during testimony before the Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security (SSIS), Bernstein refused to answer many questions regarding the UPWA, the Communist Party, and people including Abram Flaxer, Louise Bransten, and Grigory Kheifets. ==Personal life and death== Bernstein married to Sylvia Walker, a civil rights activist. They had three children: journalist Carl Bernstein, Mary Bernstein, and Laura Bernstein.

It is similar to the position of sheriff in some jurisdictions. == Description == The 13th century Castillian-Leon Court started to use the term \\"alguacil\\" to designate the Alf√©rez del rey deputy for judicial matters. However in the 14th century the term \\"Justicia mayor\\" was used to refer to the same officer. The position implied being the executioner of King's and/or Judges. The Justicia mayor was assisted by other \\"alguaciles menores\\" (deputies). The Justicia mayor was the maximum authority in the territory of its jurisdiction. The functions of the Justicia mayor in the King's household were as follows: * Judicial: # Ensure the tribunals possessed the necesario elements to facilitate the judicial proceedings. # Apprehend those who were to be judged and take custody of them. # Follow through on the punishments ordered by the King or his Judges. # Carry out sentences, whether civil or criminal. * Law enforcement: # Detain and jail those charged with an offense # Prevention of crime. # Impose punishment according to the criminal code of justice. # Round-the-clock protection of the Tribunal facilities. # Removal of folks loitering around the tribunals. # Arresting criminals. # Control of business practices to prevent fraude in weights and measures. # Defending the established rule of law, and prevention of civil unrest. # Maintain order during ceremonies of judicial proceedings. ==Puerto Rico== There were justicias mayores named in Puerto Rico in the mid 1810s. These position/titles appeared after the Spanish constitutional system was abolished. The justicias mayores performed the functions today (2019) performed by a mayor, but also many other functions as well. These district authorities had powers that included police, tax collection, justice and war. They were to preside over the ayuntamiento, carry out order from the Provincial Government, and exercise their own judgment where the laws allowed it. In Puerto Rico, the teniente justicia mayor for the Ponce District (which territory included Ponce, Coamo, and much of the southern region) was Alejandro Ordonez. The justicia mayor positions, however, did not last long because, upon the issuance of the C√©dula Real (Royal Decree) of 6 June 1816, they were terminated and regular alcaldes where named instead. The naming of alcaldes lasted until 1820 when towns, like Ponce, went back to electing their own alcalde.Eduardo Neuman Gandia. Verdadera y Autentica Historia de La Ciudad de Ponce.

The main juridical body that regulates is the Law of Referendum or Law 8492. To this date the only nation- wide referendum done since the current Constitution and the afore mentioned referendum regulatory law is in place was the 2007 Costa Rican Dominican Republic ‚Äì Central America Free Trade Agreement referendum. ==Process== To submit a bill to referendum, the petition has to be made into the Tribunal Supremo de Elecciones (TSE), which would transfer the bill to Technical Services which would report if the bill can be submitted to referendum according to the current legislation. If allowed, then the TSE would allow the recollection of signatures that has to be at least 5% of the electoral census (around 167,000 signatures) for a period of nine months extendable to one extra month if requested once. If the signatures are gathered in time, the TSE will establish a date for the referendum that cannot coincide with a presidential election. In order for the referendum to be binding it has to have at least 30% of voters participation in common laws and 40% in constitutional reforms and international treaties. Besides, bills regarding taxes, pensions, administrative matters and budgets can't be subject of referendums according to the law, nor can be any legislation regarding human rights as established by a Constitutional Court's ruling. The Municipal Code also allows for the realization of local referendums, plebiscites and cabildos. These require two-thirds of the votes from the municipality's city council or 5% of residents signatures gathered. ==History== ===Realized referendums=== Costa Rica's only referendum to this date on the modern era has been the 2007 Costa Rican Dominican Republic ‚Äì Central America Free Trade Agreement referendum. Promoted by CAFTA opponent Jos√© Miguel Corrales Bola√±os as an strategy to take the discussion out of the Legislative Assembly were pro-CAFTA parties had majority, the Referendum split public opinion and polarized voters with the main political parties taking positions in favor or against. The \\"yes\\" won over the \\"no\\" with 51% over 48%. ===Stopped referendums=== The Civil Unions Act referendum promoted by conservative and religious groups in 2008 to stop the approval on Parliament of the Civil Unions Act which would legalized same-sex civil partnerships was green-lighted by TSE and had the support of conservative parties, the Catholic Church and evangelical churches. The tentative date for the referendum was set on December 5, 2010. However the Citizens' Action Party, the Ombudsman Office and the LGBT-organization Diversity Movement appealed the decision presenting an amparo in the Constitutional Court, or Fourth Chamber. The Court's ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and declared the referendum unconstitutional as Human Rights matters ca't be submitted to referendum as minorities will be in a disadvantage over the votes of majorities. Same-sex unions including marriage were approved by a Supreme Court ruling on 2018. Another similar case was the Animal Welfare Act which meant to harden the penalties for animal cruelty and was discussed in the Parliament but advanced slowly in part because of the opposition and filibusterism of the Libertarian Movement that opposed it. Frustrated by it slow advance, in 2016 animal rights activists promoted the submitting of the bill to referendum. The TSE allowed the recollection of signatures which was achieved on record time, but a constitutional check made by deputies opposing the bill which found out constitutional frictions on the bill caused the TSE to disallow the referendum arguing that it was unconstitutional. The law was approved by the Legislative Assembly a year later. The Constituent Assembly Convocation Act promoted by the movement New Constitution for Costa Rica lead by ex deputy Alex Sol√≠s and other political figures, and seeks to have a new Constituent Assembly to draft and approve a new constitution The amparo was presented by scholar and researcher Esperanza Tasies arguing that the current Referendum Law does not allows for total changes in the Constitution, only for partial ones. The Constitutional Court sustained the argument and declared that a Constituent Assembly can only be convened by legislative act. ===Authorized referendums=== On of the many public monopolies of Costa Rica in on oil refination, legally on the exclusive hands of the Costa Rican Oil Refinery (RECOPE). On mid-2016 the TSE allowed the citizen group No More RECOPE to gathered signatures for the referendum on ending RECOPE's monopoly. The Chamber of Fuel Enterprises presented an appeal into the Constitutional Court against the referendum arguing it will increase oil prices, however it was rejected in 2018. The National Energetic Resources Advantage Act promoted by Costa Rica Institute of Technology's teacher Carlos Rold√°n and seeks to finish the ban on oil exploration and exploitation the country has. An amparo was presented by deputy Paola Vega of the ecologist Citizens' Action Party. However the amparo was rejected. As of March 2020 (only three months before the sign recollection period ends) organizers report that less than 10% of signatures have been collected. ===Referendums under study of the Constitutional Court=== The Vital Minimal Wage Act which was promoted by some of the labor unions and would take into account the living costs for the calculation of minimal wage. An amparo was presented against it by the Costa Rican Union of Chambers. ===Rejected refer√©ndums=== It was unanimously rejected by the TSE the realization of referendums for recall elections against the President and the deputies, one presented in 2015 and two presented in 2018, in all cases the TSE argued that the current legislation and Constitution do not allow recall elections except for mayors. A request to submit to referendum Costa Rica's signature of the Global Compact for Migration was rejected arguing that administrative decisions can't be subject of referendum according to current laws. ==Recall elections == Mayors in Costa Rica can be submitted to recall elections. This requires at least a two-thirds votes of the Municipal Council or enough signatures gathered among the residents. Two recall elections had happened; one in the Perez Zeledon Canton in 2011 and one in the Paraiso Canton in 2018. Although in both won the \\"yes\\" option, the first succeeded but the second didn't got enough votes to be binding (it requires two-thirds of voters for the \\"yes\\" option and at least 10% of the census). However Paraiso's mayor resign on his own anyway due to corruption charges. ==References== Category:Costa Rican law ","title":"Referendums in Costa Rica"},{"id":"60323419","text":"Daxin () is a town under the administration of Fugou County, Henan, China. , it has 22 villages under its administration. == References == Category:Township-level divisions of Henan Category:Fugou County ","title":"Daxin, Henan"},{"id":"60323426","text":"Saygachny () is a rural locality (a settlement) in Astrakhansky Selsoviet, Narimanovsky District, Astrakhan Oblast, Russia.

Despite introducing popular programs such as You Can't Do That on Television to the lineup in 1981, Nickelodeon operated at a loss of $10 million dollars, and at one point had the lowest number of viewers compared to other cable channels by 1984. In 1983, Bob Pittman was made head of MTV Networks and Schneider was not comfortable with his \\"idiotic\\" approach to \\"home-based\\" television.

However, in 20th century, Syria and Palestine would be later carved and divided between France and the British Empire, and this would remain until the end of World War II. ==Modern relations== Syria soon announced its complete support to Palestine after the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War broke out, and had sent troops to fight against newly-formed Israel Defense Forces, but it failed to change the tie, and later also failed to get a peace talk. Since then, with the influx of Palestinian refugees to Syria, relationship between Syria and Palestine became very complex, while mainly brotherly, also share significant differences. Syria also joined the Six-Day War hoping to expel Israeli Army in order to restore Palestinian state, in which ended with a complete failure. This failed war drastically and radically changed Syrian and Palestinian society. For Syrians, the failure damaged their reputation, and subsequently created further mistrusts despite still maintaining good relationship. Hafez al-Assad was known for his hostility towards Yasser Arafat and Faisal Husseini, with attempts to divide the Palestinian leadership. ===Syrian Civil War=== The Syrian Civil War created divisions among Palestinians over the Assad regime in Syria. Despite this level of hostility Palestinian towards the PLO caused by the Hafez al-Assad Government in the past, Bashar al-Assad however still gained popular support among Palestinians due to his pro- Palestinian rhetoric speeches. Some Palestinians had held rallies in support to majority Assad Government. Some Palestinians have accused Assad of enabling torture and murder of Palestinians, and recently, the demolition of Palestinian refugee camps in Syria, notably in Yarmouk. Assad was further accused of allowing rape and torture of Palestinians. ==Palestinians in Syria== There were over more than 500.000 Palestinians in Syria, mostly refugees, before the outbreak of Syrian Civil War. ==See also== *Palestinians in Syria *Syria Palaestina *Embassy of the State of Palestine in Syria ==References== Category:Bilateral relations of the State of Palestine Category:Bilateral relations of Syria ","title":"Palestine‚ÄìSyria relations"},{"id":"60323740","text":"Tulata () is a rural locality (a settlement) in Solyansky Selsoviet, Narimanovsky District, Astrakhan Oblast, Russia.

He was the first to teach public relations courses at a major university in post-war Japan and is the Chairman and CEO of Inoue Public Relations, which he founded in 1970. He is a Visiting Professor at the Graduate School of Management, Kyoto University and at Kobe Institute of Computing. He was quoted in foreign press reports on the East Japan Earthquake and the 2018 arrest in Japan of Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn. He has written about modern Japan's lack of PR skills and has described the resulting \\"Deficiency of Japanese diplomacy\\", and in 2010 he wrote that corporate Japan's scandals have created \\"A culture of apologies: Communicating crises in Japan\\" == Early life == He was born in the Chinese city of Dalian (formerly Dairen, Mansh≈´) at the end of World War II as the sixth child of Rikichi Inoue, who was then the Japanese wartime vice mayor of the city, and Junko Inoue. He first touched Japanese soil before reaching age 2, when the family repatriated after the war. He grew up in Japan as part of the first postwar generation. == Theories == * Self-Correction Model of Public Relations: To consistently achieve goals and to survive a crisis organizations need to establish a process of two-way communications, ethics, continuous self-correction, and recognition of the central role played by human free- will. * Kizuna Education: \\"Kizuna\\", the Japanese word for building relationships between people, is a fundamental skill that helps people live harmoniously in society and to achieve their personal goals through cooperation with others. \\"Kizuna education\\" is the concept that it is necessary in today's global society to teach children at very early stages, including preschool, the skill of relationship building in order to foster global peace. * Public Relations Life-Cycle Model: Structured public relations process aimed at achieving goals quickly and economically through \\"win-win\\" outcomes for both the organization and its many stakeholders. The model includes defining PR objectives, setting communication channels, PR strategy, PR program, implementation, analysis, and correction. * Japan Model: Japan is an \\"advanced problem solving nation\\" that can provide social and technological solutions to global challenges. * Three Forces of Hyper-globalization: Explains globalization in terms of Hyper-globalization as the new environment of the 21st century being shaped by three forces of (1) massive global trade and cross-border economic integration, (2) global and instant communications of the internet, and (3) rapid disruptive technological change through advances in such things as big data, Internet of Things, and Artificial Intelligence that is bringing massive economic and rapid social changes leading to a world of technological singularity. == Career in public relations == Takashi Inoue founded Inoue Public Relations in 1970 as a Japanese PR firm focused on high technology. Between late 1970s and early 1980s he helped both Intel and Apple Inc. enter the Japan market. In 1984 he planned and executed the public relations program for the launch of the Apple Macintosh in Japan. In the late 1990s when Japan's trade surplus created trade friction with the U.S., his firm helped a U.S. auto parts manufacturer achieve deregulation in Japan in the Tenneco case. By bringing about changes in Japan's tax and automotive regulations in the automotive parts market, which had acted as non- tariff trade barriers, IPR helped Tenneco expand sales in Japan and helped avoided U.S. trade sanctions that U.S. President Clinton had threatened. These changes also resulted in Inoue Public Relations winning in 1997 the International Public Relations Association's Golden World Award Grand Prize. IPR also won the 2015 (IPRA) award for successful deregulation public relations campaign for its client Concur Japan, Ltd. == Career in academia == After practicing public relations in Japan for over 30 years, he started a public relations course at Waseda University in 2004, which was the first of its kind at a major Japanese university. In 2009 Takashi Inoue received a Ph.D. from Waseda University, as the first doctoral degree awarded for public relations, and for research for the Self-Correction Model of Public Relations. He has been teaching at the Kyoto University‚Äôs Graduate School of Management since 2012. == Books written, edited, or co-written == * Inoue, T.

It is one of the gene mapping techniques which can determine the sequence of DNA base pairs with high accuracy. Genetic mapping, another approach of gene mapping, can provide markers needed for the physical mapping. However, as the former deduces the relative gene position by recombination frequencies, it is less accurate than the latter. Physical mapping uses DNA fragments and DNA markers to assemble larger DNA pieces. With the overlapping regions of the fragments, researchers can deduce the positions of the DNA bases. There are different techniques to visualize the gene location, including somatic cell hybridization, radiation hybridization and in situ hybridization. The different approaches to physical mapping are available for analyzing different sizes of genome and achieving different levels of accuracy. Low- and high- resolution mapping are two classes for various resolution of genome, particularly for the investigation of chromosomes. The three basic varieties of physical mapping are fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), restriction site mapping and sequencing by clones. The goal of physical mapping, as a common mechanism under genomic analysis, is to obtain a complete genome sequence in order to deduce any association between the target DNA sequence and phenotypic traits. If the actual positions of genes which control certain phenotypes are known, it is possible to resolve genetic diseases by providing advice on prevention and developing new treatments. == Low-resolution mapping == Low-resolution physical mapping is typically capable of resolving DNA ranging from one base pair to several mega bases. In this category, most mapping methods involve generating a somatic cell hybrid panel, which is able to map any human DNA sequences, the gene of interest, to specific chromosomes of animal cells, such as those of mice and hamsters. The hybrid cell panel is produced by collecting hybrid cell lines containing human chromosomes, identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening with primers specific to the human sequence of interest as the hybridization probe. The human chromosome would be presented in all of the cell lines. There are different approaches to producing low-resolution physical mapping, including chromosome- mediated gene transfer and irradiation fusion gene transfer which generate the hybrid cell panel. Chromosome-mediated gene transfer is a process that coprecipitates human chromosome fragments with calcium phosphate onto the cell line, leading to a stable transformation of recipient chromosomes retaining human chromosomes ranging in size from 1 to 50 mega base pairs. Irradiation fusion gene transfer produces radiation hybrids which contain the human sequence of interest and a random set of other human chromosome fragments. Markers from fragments of human chromosome in radiation hybrids give cross- reactivity patterns, which are further analyzed to generate a radiation hybrid map by ordering the markers and breakpoints. This provides evidence on whether the markers are located on the same human chromosome fragment, and hence the order of gene sequence. == High-resolution mapping == High-resolution physical mapping could resolve hundreds of kilobases to a single nucleotide of DNA. A major technique to map such large DNA regions is high resolution FISH mapping, which could be achieved by the hybridization of probes to extended interphase chromosomes or artificially extended chromatin. Since their hierarchic structure is less condensed comparing to prometaphase and metaphase chromosomes, the standard in situ hybridization target, a high resolution of physical mapping could be produced. FISH mapping using interphase chromosome is a conventional in situ method to map DNA sequences from 50 to 500 kilobases, which are mainly syntenic DNA clones. However, naturally extended chromosomes might be folded back and produces alternative physical map orders. As a result, statistical analysis is necessary to generate the accurate map order of interphase chromosomes. If artificially stretched chromatin is used instead, mapping resolutions could be over 700 kilobases. In order to produce extended chromosomes on a slide, direct visual hybridization (DIRVISH) is often carried out, that cells are lysed by detergent to allow DNA released into the solution to flow to the other end of the slide. An example of high resolution FISH mapping using stretched chromatin is extended chromatin fiber (ECF) FISH. The method suggests the order of desired regions on the DNA sequence by analyzing the partial overlaps and gaps between yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs). Eventually, the linear sequence of the interested DNA regions could be determined. One more to note is that if metaphase chromosome is used in FISH mapping, the resolution resulted will be very poor, which is to be classified to low-resolution mapping rather than a high-resolution mapping. == Restriction site mapping == Restriction mapping is a top-down strategy that divides a chromosome target into finer regions. Restriction enzymes are used to digest a chromosome and produce an ordered set of DNA fragments. It involves genomic fragments of the target rather than cloned fragments in the library. They will be pinned to probes from the genomic library that are chosen randomly for detection purpose. The lengths of the fragments are measured by electrophoresis, which can be used to deduce their distance along the map according to the restriction site, the markers of a physical map. The progress involves combinatorial algorithms. During the progress, a chromosome is obtained from a hybrid cell and cut at rare restriction site to produce large fragments. The fragments will be separated by size and undergo hybridization, forming the macrorestriction map and different contiguous blocks (i.e. contigs). To ensure the fragments are linked, linking clones with the same rare cutting sites at the large fragments can be used. After producing the low-resolution map, the fragments can be cut into smaller sections by restriction nucleases for further analysis to produce a map with higher resolution. PFG fractionation can be used for separation and purification of the fragments generated for small genome. Through different digestion approaches, different types of DNA fragments are produced. The variation in types of fragments might affect the calculation result. === Double digestion === It uses two restriction enzymes and a combination of the two enzymes for digestion separately. It assumes that complete digestion occurs at each restriction site. The lengths of the DNA fragments are measured and used for ordering of fragments by computation. This approach is easier to handle for the experiment but more difficult to solve when dealing with the combinatorial problem required for mapping. === Partial digestion === It uses one restriction enzyme to digest the desired DNA in separated experiments with different duration of exposure. The extent of digestion for the fragments is different. DNA methylation is a technique to that prevent the reaction at cutting sites to be completed. This method requires more care to the experiment. However, its mathematical problem can be solved by easy exponential algorithm. == Sequencing by clones == Using clones to generate a physical map is a bottom-up approach with fairly high resolution. It uses the existing cloned fragments in genomic libraries to form contigs. Through cloning the partially digested fragments generated by bacterial transformation, the immortal clones with overlapping regions of the genome, which will be examined by fingerprinting methods and stored in the libraries, are produced. During sequencing process, the clones are randomly selected and placed on a set of microtitre plates randomly. They will be fingerprinted by different methods. To ensure there is a minimum set of clones that form one config for a genome (i.e. tiling path), the library used will have five to ten times redundancy. However, such techniques might produce unknown gaps in the map produced or result in saturation in clones eventually. == Application == Physical mapping is a technique to complete the sequencing of a genome. Ongoing projects that determine DNA base pair sequences, namely the Human Genome Project, give knowledge on the order of nucleotide and allow further investigation to answer genetic questions, particularly the association between the target sequence and the development of traits. From the individual DNA sequence isolated and mapped in physical mapping, it could provide information on the transcription and translation process during development of organisms, hence identifying the specific function of the gene and associated traits produced. As a result of understanding the expression and regulation of the genes, potential new treatments can be developed to alter protein expression patterns in specific tissues. Moreover, if the location and sequence of disease genes are identified, medical advice can be given to potential patients who are the carrier the disease gene, with reference to the knowledge of the gene function and products. == References == Category:Molecular biology techniques ","title":"Physical mapping"},{"id":"60323857","text":"Thyasidae is a family of mites in the order Trombidiformes.

Early on, he obtained the patronage of Cardinal Alessandro Albani and may have also been supported by Cardinal Neri Maria Corsini. In 1752, he was invited to Naples by the architect, Ferdinando Fuga, but court intrigues prevented him from obtaining any major commissions. However, Queen Maria Amalia introduced him to her father, Elector Frederick Augustus II, who arranged for him to work in Dresden.Biography from the Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani @ Treccani His Academic inclinations were enhanced in Germany; where he met Pietro Metastasio. In 1755, he created frescoes, inspired by Metastasio, at what is now the Austrian Academy of Sciences, and in Sch√∂nbrunn Palace, upon commission by the Sardinian ambassador, Luigi Gerolamo Malabaila (1704-1773). The latter were heavily damaged in World War II. In 1764, at the invitation of a painter named Sophonia De Derichs (1712-1773), he was working in Berlin. A major project, proposed by King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski for Ujazd√≥w Castle never came to fruition. The following year, he made a temporary return to Italy to paint an altarpiece at the and murals at the Royal Palace in Turin, followed by frescoes at the Cappella Colleoni in Bergamo. He then went back to Germany, creating frescoes for the main hallway at the Schaezlerpalais in Augsburg. As early as 1767, he had submitted drawings to the Russian court in Saint Petersburg. In 1770, he was finally called there by Catherine the Great, assisted by the De Derichs, who had already established themselves at the court. But, except for some portraits, his work there never progressed beyond the initial sketches. In fact, it was said (by the sculptor, √âtienne Maurice Falconet), that he died of a \\"putrid fever\\" after Catherine severely criticized a portrait of her. For some commentators, the fact that he and De Derichs died on the same day, followed by De Derichs' wife the day after, suggests that they were poisoned. No motive has been proposed, although Falconet's comment may indicate that he was not well-liked. == References == == Further reading == * Edith Gabrielli; Gregorio Guglielmi: pittore romano del Settecento (exhibition catalog) Istituto poligrafico e Zecca dello Stato, Libreria dello Stato, 2009 * Stefanie von Langen; Die Fresken von Gregorio Guglielmi, Tuduv-Verlag, 1994 == External links == * Biography from the Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani @ Treccani * Guglielmi @ the Artcyclopedia * More works by Guglielmi @ ArtNet Category:1714 births Category:1773 deaths Category:Italian painters Category:Fresco painters Category:Artists from Rome Category:Italian emigrants to Germany ","title":"Gregorio Guglielmi"},{"id":"60323899","text":"Kunzea phylicoides, commonly known as the slender burgan, is a flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to south-eastern Australia.

The leaves are linear to narrow lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flowers are arranged singly or in groups of up to three in the upper leaf axils, each flower on a pedicel long. There are no bracts or bracteoles at the base of the flower. The sepals are green, reddish near the base, triangular and long. The petals are white, more or less round, long and there usually 25 to 35 white stamens that are long with some shorter than the petals. The style is long. Flowering mostly occurs from November to February and the fruit is long, wide and not woody. Kunzea phylicoides is similar K. ericoides but has a more graceful habit, leafy groups of flowers and about twice as many stamens. It sometimes hybridises with K. peduncularis. ==Taxonomy and naming== Slender burgan was first formally described in 1843 by Johannes Conrad Schauer after an unpublished description by Allan Cunningham who gave it the name Baeckea phylicoides. The description was published in Wilhelm Walpers's Repertorium Botanices Systematicae. In 1917, George Claridge Druce changed the name to Kunzea phylicoides.

The election was triggered by the resignation of Leader Michael Daley on 25 March 2019. The election was a combined vote by the party membership and the Labor members of the Parliament of New South Wales, with each component weighted equally. The party members were sent their ballots on 7 June and had until 21 June to return them, while the parliamentary caucus met on 29 June to cast their votes. On 29 June, Jodi McKay was announced as the victor of the contest, winning 60.5% of the combined vote. ==Background== Following Labor's loss in the 2019 state election, then-leader Michael Daley resigned under pressure from the party caucus after initially declaring he would remain as head of the party and leader of the opposition. This triggered a leadership election to be held at an undetermined future date. Daley initially declared his intention to nominate for the leadership in the election, but on 26 March walked back on this statement. The contest was scheduled for after the 2019 federal election to avoid conflicting with Labor's federal campaign. Deputy leader Penny Sharpe served as interim leader after Daley's resignation. ==Campaign== On 23 May, Chris Minns announced he would contest the leadership. The following day, Jodi McKay announced she would also contest the leadership. A leadership debate was held on 3 June between the two candidates. *Minns emphasised the need for party renewal and rejuvenating Labor's image. Referring to Labor's losses in both the recent state and federal elections, he stated: \\"I am firmly of the belief that now is not the time for us to crawl up in a ball and for the Labor party not to believe in things. We are at our best when we believe in things. We are at our best when we stand for principles and fight for that.\\" He said that his focus would be on liveable cities, privatisation, and climate change. He promised to better explain to voters that action on climate change was a necessary measure to protect both the state's environmental assets and its economy. He also emphasised a need to embrace immigrant communities, and make it clear that blame for the difficulties of overpopulation did not fall on immigration. *McKay agreed that Labor's losses prompted a need for self- reflection within the party, and that new leadership presented opportunities for change. She stated that she had \\"[thought] about my values and the values that I bring to the Labor Party.\\" She promised to prioritise homelessness, mental health, and education, seeking to increase teacher salaries and reduce class sizes. She said: \\"I want us to talk about the difficult issues; they're not popular but they're issues that demand a Labor Party response.\\" ==Candidates== ===Nominated=== *Chris Minns, Shadow Minister for Water - announced 23 May 2019 *Jodi McKay, Shadow Minister for Transport and Shadow Minister for Roads, Maritime and Freight - announced 24 May 2019 ===Withdrew=== *Michael Daley, Leader of the Opposition (2018‚Äì2019) (endorsed Jodi McKay) ===Declined=== *Penny Sharpe, Interim Leader (2019‚àípresent) and Deputy Leader (2018‚àí2019) *Ryan Park, Shadow Treasurer *Kate Washington, Shadow Minister for Early Childhood Education and Shadow Minister for the Hunter (endorsed Jodi McKay) ==See also== *2015 New South Wales state election *2019 New South Wales state election *Australian Labor Party leadership spill, September 2013 *2015 Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch) leadership spill *2018 Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch) leadership election *2018 Liberal Party of Australia leadership spills ==References== Category:2019 elections in Australia Category:Australian Labor Party leadership spills Category:June 2019 events in Australia ","title":"2019 Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch) leadership election"},{"id":"60324103","text":"Yinchuan Township () is a township under the administration of Jishishan Bonan, Dongxiang and Salar Autonomous County, Gansu, China. , it has 12 villages under its administration. == References == Category:Township-level divisions of Gansu Category:Jishishan Bonan, Dongxiang and Salar Autonomous County ","title":"Yinchuan Township, Gansu"},{"id":"60324113","text":"\\"Hold Me Tight\\" is a song written and performed by Johnny Nash.

Nastos said \\"As an originator of the initial soul-funk movement of the '60s when he was with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, Golson is eminently qualified to funkify jazz and R&B-flavored; instrumental music. Nat Adderley plays cornet alongside Golson's tenor in this, one of his last recordings before he passed away ... Though they're not swinging, for the most part, in conventional 2/4 or 4/4 jazz beats, in a sense they are swinging in their own inimitable, danceable, street-derived, backbeat-driven way √° la Silver, Stanley Turrentine, and Grant Green, among others. Those inventors of this boogaloo-influenced subgenre should be happy with Golson's results\\". All About Jazz's C. Michael Bailey stated \\"All of the performances are splendidly executed, solos well considered, and performance spontaneously conceived ... What could possibly be better? In two words: the originals. That is not to slight the performances here, they are very fine. I would encourage all who read this to buy this disc and once curious, invest in the original recordings of these tunes. You cannot go wrong.There is no mixed bag here; this is an excellent disc. It will be a fine addition to any fan of jazz. But the originals are brilliant artifacts that while old are still essential to the proper understanding of this great American music\\".Bailey, C. M. All About Jazz Review, accessed March 25, 2019 JazzTimes' John Murph observed \\"With this aptly described quintet, tenor saxophonist Benny Golson pays tribute to the stylistic idiom that made him famous-hard bop. By channeling his R&B; sensibilities, which go back to his 1950s days with Bull Moose, Golson interprets a handful of war horses ...

As a child, he was very shy, but displayed a talent for painting as early as 1876. From 1877 to 1884, he worked with his father, who had become a travelling salesman. He was able to study, briefly, at the √âcole des Arts D√©coratifs, but seems to have been largely self-taught; although he certainly benefitted from a friendship with Camille Pissarro and his son, Lucien, whom he had met while painting in the countryside.Biography @ Stephen Ongpin Art He was initially associated with the Neo-impressionists, such as Paul Signac and Georges Seurat. For a time, he practiced Pointillism, but returned to more classical styles in 1890. As a result, Paul Signac removed his name from the second edition of his book, From Eug√®ne Delacroix to Neo-impressionism (considered to be the manifesto of Pointillism). His original workshop was in La Frette, where he painted numerous cityscapes and landscapes. He also visited Brittany and painted maritime scenes. When he moved to Paris in 1885, he set up a studio in Montmartre on the . He was especially fond of depicting the circus and other entertainments. However, most of his living was earned as a decorative painter. His first exhibit did not come until 1889. In 1894, while exhibiting at Le Barc de Boutteville, he met the actor, Lugn√©-Poe, who asked him to create theatrical sets for his Th√©√¢tre de l'≈íuvre; a project that he was engaged in for thirty years. Hayet's cousin, the Director of the √âcole d'Alembert in Mont√©vrain, hired him as a Professor of ornamental design; a post he held until 1911. In 1910, he won the Concours L√©pine for devising a tripod with a triptych table.No√´l Coret, Les peintres de la Vall√©e de la Marne ; autour des Impressionnistes, Renaissance du Livre, 2000, p.41. Several private exhibitions in the 1900s were unsuccessful and he continued to earn his living doing commercial work. After that time, he focused on painting scenes of Paris. After World War I, he concentrated on still-lifes. By the mid 1920s, he was forgotten. He would spend the last part of his career conducting scientific research on colors and pigments but, by the 1930s, he had given up painting and was in poor health. Of his estimated 500 paintings, over half are lost or unaccounted for. A small college in Cormeilles-en-Parisis has been named after him. ==Selected paintings== File:Hayet-Market.jpgMarket Day in Pontoise File:Hayet-Room.jpgThe Room File:Louis Hayet - Nature morte.jpgStill-life with Oranges File:Louis Hayet - Femme au chapeau.jpgWoman in a Hat File:Hayet-Verhaeren.jpgPortrait of √âmile Verhaeren ==References== == Further reading == * Andr√© Roussard, Dictionnaire des peintres √† Montmartre, Paris, √âditions A.

In 1919, Kang tried to assassinate Sait≈ç Makoto, who was serving as the Governor-General of Korea, but failed. == Life and career == === Early life and educational activities === Kang was born in Deokcheon, Pyeongan Province, in the Kingdom of Great Joseon. He spent his childhood in Jinju and Miryang, both in Gyeongsang Province. Kang studied Korean medicine from a young age after returning home to Deokcheon in Pyeongan Province. In 1884, he moved to Hongwon, Hamkyong Province, where he served as a Korean medicine doctor while teaching children Neo-Confucianism. He reportedly fled there as his personal security was jeopardized because he was involved in Korean patriotic movements. Kang reportedly went to Hongwon with a large sum of money, and engaged in commerce there. He ran a general merchandise store with his son Jung Geon on Nammun Street in the center of Hongwon. The store mainly sold paint, cigarettes, and cotton thread. At the same time, he lent traders money at low interest. === Exile === Following the Japan‚ÄìKorea Treaty of 1905, and the annexation of Korea and its colonial rule by Japan following the Japan‚ÄìKorea Treaty of 1910, Kang was deeply angered. At the time, he was a middle-aged man over 50.Î∞ïÌôò(2008), Í∞ïÏö∞Í∑úÏùò ÏùòÏó¥Ìà¨ÏüÅÍ≥º ÎèÖÎ¶ΩÏÇ¨ÏÉÅ [Kang Woo-kyu's Struggle and the Idea of becoming Korea independence], ÌïúÍµ≠ÎØºÏ°±ÏÇ¨Ïó∞Íµ¨, ISSN : 1226-9980, p. 123 In the fall of 1910, Kang decided to seek asylum and moved members of his family to Khabarovsk. He himself left Hongwon and went into exile in Dudogu, northern Gando (Jiandao), Manchuria, in the spring of 1911, where he ran a herbal medicine shop. In 1915, he moved to Yo-dong in Liaohe County, Jilin, and traveled to and from Vladivostok to work for independence. He reclaimed farmland around Yoha to build Shinheungchon, a Korean village. The village later became the main base for independence forces operating in Siberia and North Manchuria. In 1917, Kang founded Gwandong Middle School in Tonghua County, Jilin Province, Northeast China. He worked hard to promote the spirit of independence by educating his fellow countrymen. As a Christian Presbyterian, he worked in the school of the church, using his position to promote anti-Japanese sentiment among students and Koreans living nearby. Kang condemned Japanese war crimes when teaching the students. He occasionally gathered villagers in the school auditorium to promote national consciousness. In the March 1st Movement in 1919, Kang gathered students and their compatriots at Gwandong School. He organized the independence movement with a focus on Yeohyeon. Kang did not believe that a simple independence movement would lead to the independence of his country, so he went to Vladivostok, where Lee Dong-hwi was active. He served as chief of Yo Ha-yeon's branch in the Senior Citizen's Association with Lee Seung-kyo, Lee Dong-hwi's father. === Infiltration into Korea, attempted assassination === In 1919, Kang handed over Gwandong Middle School and Shinheungchon village to a Korean American before sneaking back into Japanese-occupied Korea. He bought a grenade from a Russian and infiltrated into Gyeongseongbu (as Seoul was then called), via Wonsan, with Huh Hyung. He hid the grenade from Japanese police by wearing it between his legs in a diaper. On September 2, 1919, due to internal and external strife, Japanese admiral Sait≈ç Makoto had been appointed to replace Hasegawa Yoshimichi as the governor-general. On the day Sait≈ç visited Korea, Kang attempted to assassinate Sait≈ç by throwing a bomb at him. The explosion missed Saito but injured several onlookers. The El Paso Herald reported that twenty were injured including an American, a relative of former Chicago Mayor Carter Harrison Sr., who coincidentally had been assassinated in 1893. After the failed assassination attempt, Kang went into hiding. According to Oh Tae- young, Kang hid in Jang Ik-kyu and Lim Seung-hwa's house. He was later caught by Kim Tae-seok and jailed on September 17. Five others were also arrested in connection to the bomb attack. === Death === Kang was sentenced to death for attempted murder and a charge of civilian casualties. Even after the death penalty was confirmed, Kang read the Bible every day, prayed in the morning and evening, and waited for his last day with a relaxed mind. While in prison, Kang told his sons: \\"Don't do anything about my death. I feel rather ashamed that I have done nothing for my country all my life. It is the education of our young people that I cannot forget even when I'm sleeping. If my death give a little impetus to the minds of the young people, that's what I wish for.\\" Informally, he told them to spread his will to schools and churches across the country. Kang was hanged on November 29, 1920. He never renounced his beliefs and was defiant until his death. After the attack the Japanese increased the Korean police presence in the region from 12,000 to 20,000 members. == After death == The Kang Woo-kyu Statue is in front of the Seoul Station, where he threw a bomb at Sait≈ç Makoto. Kang's remains were first buried at a cemetery in Sinsa-dong, Eunpyeong-gu. They were later moved to Suyu-ri, Jindo in 1954 and to the Seoul National Cemetery in 1967. In March 1962, Kang was posthumously awarded the Order of Merit for National Foundation.

A tenor, he sang in prominent concerts of the day. ==Life== Vaughan was born in Norwich in 1782, and was a chorister of the cathedral under John Christmas Beckwith. His father died while Vaughan, still very young, was preparing to enter the musical profession, which he was enabled to do under the advice and patronage of Canon Charles Smith. In June 1799 Vaughan was elected lay-clerk of St George's Chapel, Windsor, where he attracted the notice of George III. In May 1803 he was admitted a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal, and about the same time became vicar-choral of St Paul's Cathedral and lay vicar of Westminster Abbey. In 1811 he joined Charles Knyvett in establishing vocal subscription concerts, in opposition to the Vocal Concerts; but on the death of Samuel Harrison in 1812 the two enterprises were merged, and Vaughan became principal tenor soloist at all the prominent concerts and festivals. He sang at the Three Choirs Festivals from 1805 to 1836, and took part in the British premi√®re of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 in 1825. For twenty-five years the public recognised in him the typical faultless singer of the English school, perfected by the study of oratorio music. Vaughan died at a friend's house near Birmingham, on 9 January 1843, and was buried on 17 January in the west cloister of Westminster Abbey.
