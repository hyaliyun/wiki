A candle wick works by capillary action, conveying (\\"wicking\\") the fuel to the flame. When the liquid fuel, typically melted candle wax, reaches the flame it then vaporizes and combusts. The candle wick influences how the candle burns. Important characteristics of the wick include diameter, stiffness, fire- resistance, and tethering. ==Wick types== Candle wicks are normally made out of braided cotton.Franz Willhöft and Rudolf Horn \\"Candles\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2000, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. Wicks are sometimes braided flat, so that as they burn they also curl back into the flame, thus making them self-consuming. Prior to the introduction of these wicks special scissors were used to trim the excess wick without extinguishing the flame. Large diameter wicks typically result in a larger flame, a larger pool of melted wax, and the candle burning faster. In tealights the wick is tethered to a piece of metal to stop it from floating to the top of the molten wax and burning before the wax does. Candles designed to float in water require not only a tether for the wick, but also a seal on the bottom of the candle to prevent the wick from wicking water and extinguishing the flame. In some birthday candles, the wick is a stub. This limits how long the candle can burn. Wicks can be made of material other than string or cord, such as wood, although they are rare. The cotton of tampons can be used as wicks for oil lamps in wilderness survival situations. Dipped candles hanging by their wicks ==Stiffeners== Fine wire (such as copper) can be included in the wick. This provides two advantages: it makes the wick more rigid, letting it stand further out of the liquid wax, and it conducts heat downward, melting the wax more readily. The latter is particularly important in candles made of harder wax. Stiffeners were once made of lead, but these have been banned in the US for several years by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, due to the concerns about lead poisoning. Other core stiffeners, such as paper and synthetic fibers, may also be used. The CPSC was petitioned to ban candle wicks containing lead cores and candles with such wicks by Public Citizen, the National Apartment Association, and National Multi Housing Council on February 20, 2001. The ban against manufacturing, importing, or selling candles in the US with lead wicks became effective in October 2003. ==How to make a candle wick== Candle wicks can be made with borax. * Firstly, a solution of borax (15 ml) and salt (45 ml) in 250 ml water is needed. The water should be near its boiling temperature. * Secondly, dip a piece of braided cotton rope into the solution. Leaving the rope inside the solution and letting it absorb the borax for 24 hours will give the best results. * Take the rope out with tweezers and leave it to dehydrate for 1-2 days. Technically, the candle wick is ready to use. Nevertheless, if needed to stiffen the wick, also apply the following steps. * Melt a candle of 60 ml with a small pot with approx. 2.5-5 cm height of water inside. Insert a metal box in the water, later add the candle to this box. * Dip the rope of borax into the molten candle. Cover the whole rope with candle as much as possible. * Leave the rope with candle to dry for a couple of minutes. * Repeat the previous two steps once or twice to obtain a harder wick. The wick is ready to use after the candle covering process. ==Pretreatments of wicks== Virtually all wicks are treated with various flame- resistant solutions in a process known as mordanting. Without mordanting the wick would be destroyed by the flames and the flow of melted wax to the flame would cease. Beyond that, wicks can be treated with substances to improve the color and brightness of the flame, provide better rigidity to keep the wick out of the melted wax, and improve the flow of that wax up the wick. Common treatments are borax and salt which are dissolved in water in which the wicks are soaked. ==See also== * Fuse (explosives) ==References== ==External links== Wick ","title":"Candle wick"},{"id":"3247302","text":"Portex on display at Bletchley Park Museum, UK.

The early design collaboration between Henry Stanley Plummer and Franklin Ellerbe established the model for future generations of new clinic and hospital buildings. The new 1928 Art Deco Mayo Clinic building was the physical manifestation of the early Mayo partners (Drs. Will and Charlie Mayo, Dr. Stinchfield, Dr. Graham, Dr. Judd, Dr. Henry Plummer, Dr. Millet, and Dr. Balfour) desire to create the first integrated private group practice. When the building was complete it was the tallest building in Rochester until 2001 when the nearby Gonda Building was completed. It is topped by a distinctive terra-cotta trimmed tower which contains a 56-bell carillon. The carillon is played daily, and its music can be heard throughout downtown. The tower is lit by floodlights every night and is a centerpiece of the city's skyline. Ray Corwin, of Ellerbe and Round, designed the building's decorative elements. Corwin also was responsible for the design of the decorative elements found in the Chateau Theatre and Oakwood Cemetery gate.

Several methods have been developed to carry out this task. Strategic nuclear weapons are used primarily as part of a doctrine of deterrence by threatening large targets, such as cities. Weapons meant for use in limited military maneuvers, such as destroying specific military, communications, or infrastructure targets, are known as tactical nuclear weapons. In terms of explosive yields, nowadays the former have much larger yield than the latter, even though it is not a rule. The bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 (with TNT equivalents between 15 and 22 kilotons) were weaker than many of today's tactical weapons, yet they achieved the desired effect when used strategically. ==Nuclear triad== A nuclear triad refers to a strategic nuclear arsenal which consists of three components, traditionally strategic bombers, intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). The purpose of having a three-branched nuclear capability is to significantly reduce the possibility that an enemy could destroy all of a nation's nuclear forces in a first-strike attack; this, in turn, ensures a credible threat of a second strike, and thus increases a nation's nuclear deterrence. ==Main delivery mechanisms== ===Gravity bomb=== The \\"Little Boy\\" and the \\"Fat Man\\" devices were large and cumbersome gravity bombs. Historically, the first method of delivery, and the method used in the only two nuclear weapons actually used in warfare, was a gravity bomb dropped by a plane. In the years leading up to the development and deployment of nuclear-armed missiles, nuclear bombs represented the most practical means of nuclear weapons delivery; even today, and especially with the decommissioning of nuclear missiles, aerial bombing remains the primary means of offensive nuclear weapons delivery, and the majority of US nuclear warheads are represented in bombs, although some are in the form of missiles. Gravity bombs are designed to be dropped from planes, which requires that the weapon be able to withstand vibrations and changes in air temperature and pressure during the course of a flight. Early weapons often had a removable core for safety, known as in flight insertion (IFI) cores, being inserted or assembled by the air crew during flight. They had to meet safety conditions, to prevent accidental detonation or dropping. A variety of types also had to have a fuse to initiate detonation. US nuclear weapons that met these criteria are designated by the letter \\"B\\" followed, without a hyphen, by the sequential number of the \\"physics package\\" it contains. The \\"B61\\", for example, was the primary bomb in the US arsenal for decades. Various air-dropping techniques exist, including toss bombing, parachute-retarded delivery, and laydown modes, intended to give the dropping aircraft time to escape the ensuing blast. The earliest gravity nuclear bombs (Little Boy and Fat Man) of the United States could only be carried, during the era of their creation, by the special Silverplate limited production (65 airframes by 1947) version of the B-29 Superfortress. The next generation of weapons were still so big and heavy that they could only be carried by bombers such as the six/ten-engined, seventy-meter wingspan B-36 Peacemaker, the eight jet-engined B-52 Stratofortress, and jet-powered British RAF V bombers, but by the mid-1950s smaller weapons had been developed that could be carried and deployed by fighter-bombers. ===Ballistic missile=== Trident II SLBM launched by Royal Navy Missiles using a ballistic trajectory usually deliver a warhead over the horizon, at distances of thousands of kilometers, as in the case of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). Most ballistic missiles exit the Earth's atmosphere and re-enter it in their sub-orbital spaceflight. Placement of nuclear missiles on the low Earth orbit has been banned by the Outer Space Treaty as early as 1967. Also, the eventual Soviet Fractional Orbital Bombardment System (FOBS) that served a similar purpose—it was just deliberately designed to deorbit before completing a full circle—was phased out in January 1983 in compliance with the SALT II treaty. An ICBM is more than 20 times as fast as a bomber and more than 10 times as fast as a fighter plane, and also flying at a much higher altitude, and therefore more difficult to defend against. ICBMs can also be fired quickly in the event of a surprise attack. Early ballistic missiles carried a single warhead, often of megaton- range yield. Because of the limited accuracy of the missiles, this kind of high yield was considered necessary in order to ensure a particular target's destruction. Since the 1970s modern ballistic weapons have seen the development of far more accurate targeting technologies, particularly due to improvements in inertial guidance systems. This set the stage for smaller warheads in the hundreds-of-kilotons-range yield, and consequently for ICBMs having multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV). Advances in technology have enabled a single missile to launch a payload containing several warheads. The number of independent warheads capable of deployment from ballistic missiles depends on the weapons platform the missile is launched from. For example, one D5 Trident missile carried by an is capable of launching eight independent warheads,. while a has missiles capable of deploying 10 warheads at a time... MIRV has a number of advantages over a missile with a single warhead. With small additional costs, it allows a single missile to strike multiple targets, or to inflict maximum damage on a single target by attacking it with multiple warheads. It makes anti-ballistic missile defense even more difficult, and even less economically viable, than before. Missile warheads in the American arsenal are indicated by the letter \\"W\\"; for example, the W61 missile warhead would have the same physics package as the B61 gravity bomb described above, but it would have different environmental requirements, and different safety requirements since it would not be crew- tended after launch and remain atop a missile for a great length of time.. ===Cruise missile=== Cruise missiles have a shorter range than ICBMs. U/RGM-109E Tomahawk pictured (not nuclear capable anymore). A cruise missile is a jet engine or rocket-propelled missile that flies at low altitude using an automated guidance system (usually inertial navigation, sometimes supplemented by either GPS or mid-course updates from friendly forces) to make them harder to detect or intercept. Cruise missiles can carry a nuclear warhead. They have a shorter range and smaller payloads than ballistic missiles, so their warheads are smaller and less powerful. The AGM-86 ALCM is the US Air Force's current nuclear-armed air-launched cruise missile. The ALCM is only carried on the B-52 Stratofortress which can carry 20 missiles. Thus the cruise missiles themselves can be compared with MIRV warheads. The BGM/UGM-109 Tomahawk submarine-launched cruise missile is capable of carrying nuclear warheads, but all nuclear warheads were removed. Cruise missiles may also be launched from mobile launchers on the ground, and from naval ships. There is no letter change in the US arsenal to distinguish the warheads of cruise missiles from those for ballistic missiles. Cruise missiles, even with their lower payload, have a number of advantages over ballistic missiles for the purposes of delivering nuclear strikes: * Launch of a cruise missile is difficult to detect early from satellites and other long-range means, contributing to a surprise factor of attack. * That, coupled with the ability to actively maneuver in flight, allows for penetration of strategic anti- missile systems aimed at intercepting ballistic missiles on calculated trajectory of flight. U.S. and Soviet intermediate-range, ground-launched cruise missiles were eliminated under the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty from 1987 to 2019, following U.S. withdrawal. ===Other delivery systems=== Davy Crockett artillery shell is the smallest known nuclear weapon developed by the US. Mk-17 was an early US thermonuclear weapon and weighed around 21 short tons (19,000 kg). Other delivery methods included artillery shells, mines such as the Medium Atomic Demolition Munition and the novel Blue Peacock, nuclear depth charges, and nuclear torpedoes. An 'Atomic Bazooka' was also fielded, designed to be used against large formations of tanks. In the 1950s the US developed small nuclear warheads for air defense use, such as the Nike Hercules. From the 1950s to the 1980s, the United States and Canada fielded a low-yield nuclear-tipped air-to-air rocket, the AIR-2 Genie. Further developments of this concept, some with much larger warheads, led to the early anti-ballistic missiles. The United States have largely taken nuclear air- defense weapons out of service with the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. Russia updated its nuclear tipped Soviet era anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system, known as the A-135 anti-ballistic missile system in 1995. It is believed that the, in development (2013) successor to the nuclear A-135, the A-235 Samolet-M will dispense with nuclear interception warheads and instead rely on a conventional hit-to-kill capability to destroy its target. Small, two-man portable tactical weapons (erroneously referred to as suitcase bombs), such as the Special Atomic Demolition Munition, have been developed, although the difficulty to combine sufficient yield with portability limits their military utility. Hypersonic Glide Vehicles are a new potential method of nuclear delivery. They can be potentially combined with ICBM MIRVs such as RS-28 Sarmat. ==Costs== According to an audit by the Brookings Institution, between 1940 and 1996, the US spent $ in present-day terms on nuclear weapons programs. 57 percent of which was spent on building delivery mechanisms for nuclear weapons. 6.3 percent of the total, $ in present-day terms, was spent on weapon nuclear waste management, for example, cleaning up the Hanford site with environmental remediation, and 7 percent of the total, $ was spent on the manufacturing of nuclear weapons themselves.. ===Technology spin-offs=== Edward White during the first US \\"Spacewalk\\" Extravehicular activity (EVA), Project Gemini 4, June 1965 Strictly speaking however not all this 57 percent was spent solely on \\"weapons programs\\" delivery systems. ====Launch vehicles==== For example, two such delivery mechanisms, the Atlas ICBM and Titan II, were re-purposed as human launch vehicles for human spaceflight, both were used in the civilian Project Mercury and Project Gemini programs respectively, which are regarded as stepping stones in the evolution of US human spaceflight.. The Atlas vehicle sent John Glenn, the first American into orbit. Similarly in the Soviet Union it was the R-7 ICBM/launch vehicle that placed the first artificial satellite in space, Sputnik, on 4 October 1957, and the first human spaceflight in history was accomplished on a derivative of the R-7, the Vostok, on 12 April 1961, by cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. A modernized version of the R-7 is still in use as the launch vehicle for the Russian Federation, in the form of the Soyuz spacecraft. ====Weather satellites==== The first true weather satellite, the TIROS-1 was launched on the Thor-Able launch vehicle in April 1960.. The PGM-17 Thor was the first operational IRBM (intermediate ballistic missile) deployed by the US Air Force (USAF). The Soviet Union's first fully operational weather satellite, the Meteor 1 was launched on 26 March 1969 on the Vostok rocket,. a derivative of the R-7 ICBM. ====Lubricants==== WD-40 was first used by Convair to protect the outer skin, and more importantly, the paper thin \\"balloon tanks\\" of the Atlas missile from rust and corrosion.Martin, Douglas. \\"John S. Barry, Main Force Behind WD-40, Dies at 84\\". The New York Times, 22 July 2009. These stainless steel fuel tanks were so thin that, when empty, they had to be kept inflated with nitrogen gas to prevent their collapse. ====Thermal isolation==== In 1953, Dr. S. Donald Stookey of the Corning Research and Development Division invented Pyroceram, a white glass-ceramic material capable of withstanding a thermal shock (sudden temperature change) of up to 450 °C (840 °F). It evolved from materials originally developed for a US ballistic missile program, and Stookey's research involved heat-resistant material for nose cones. ====Satellite assisted positioning==== Precise navigation would enable United States submarines to get an accurate fix of their positions before they launched their SLBMs, this spurred development of triangulation methods that ultimately culminated in GPS. The motivation for having accurate launch position fixes, and missile velocities, is twofold. It results in a tighter target impact circular error probable and therefore by extension, reduces the need for the earlier generation of heavy multi-megaton nuclear warheads, such as the W53 to ensure the target is destroyed. With increased target accuracy, a greater number of lighter, multi-kiloton range warheads can be packed on a given missile, giving a higher number of separate targets that can be hit per missile. Global positioning system During a Labor Day weekend in 1973, a meeting of about twelve military officers at the Pentagon discussed the creation of a Defense Navigation Satellite System (DNSS). It was at this meeting that \\"the real synthesis that became GPS was created.\\" Later that year, the DNSS program was named Navstar, or Navigation System Using Timing and Ranging.. During the development of the submarine-launched Polaris missile, a requirement to accurately know the submarine's location was needed to ensure a high circular error probable warhead target accuracy. This led the US to develop the Transit system. In 1959, ARPA (renamed DARPA in 1972) also played a role in Transit. A visual example of a 24 satellite GPS constellation in motion with the Earth rotating. Notice how the number of satellites in view from a given point on the Earth's surface, in this example at 45°N, changes with time. GPS was initially developed to increase Ballistic Missile Circular Error Probable accuracy, accuracy which is vital in a counterforce attack. The first satellite navigation system, Transit, used by the United States Navy, was first successfully tested in 1960. It used a constellation of five satellites and could provide a navigational fix approximately once per hour. In 1967, the US Navy developed the Timation satellite that proved the ability to place accurate clocks in space, a technology required by the latter Global Positioning System. In the 1970s, the ground-based Omega Navigation System, based on phase comparison of signal transmission from pairs of stations, became the first worldwide radio navigation system. Limitations of these systems drove the need for a more universal navigation solution with greater accuracy. While there were wide needs for accurate navigation in military and civilian sectors, almost none of those was seen as justification for the billions of dollars it would cost in research, development, deployment, and operation for a constellation of navigation satellites. During the Cold War arms race, the nuclear threat to the existence of the United States was the one need that did justify this cost in the view of the United States Congress. This deterrent effect is why GPS was funded. The nuclear triad consisted of the United States Navy's submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) along with United States Air Force (USAF) strategic bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Considered vital to the nuclear-deterrence posture, accurate determination of the SLBM launch position was a force multiplier. Precise navigation would enable United States submarines to get an accurate fix of their positions before they launched their SLBMs. The USAF, with two-thirds of the nuclear triad, also had requirements for a more accurate and reliable navigation system. The Navy and Air Force were developing their own technologies in parallel to solve what was essentially the same problem. To increase the survivability of ICBMs, there was a proposal to use mobile launch platforms (such as Russian SS-24 and SS-25) and so the need to fix the launch position had similarity to the SLBM situation. In 1960, the Air Force proposed a radio-navigation system called MOSAIC (MObile System for Accurate ICBM Control) that was essentially a 3-D LORAN. A follow-on study, Project 57, was worked in 1963 and it was \\"in this study that the GPS concept was born\\". That same year, the concept was pursued as Project 621B, which had \\"many of the attributes that you now see in GPS\\" and promised increased accuracy for Air Force bombers as well as ICBMs. Updates from the Navy Transit system were too slow for the high speeds of Air Force operation. The Navy Research Laboratory continued advancements with their Timation (Time Navigation) satellites, first launched in 1967, and with the third one in 1974 carrying the first atomic clock into orbit. Another important predecessor to GPS came from a different branch of the United States military. In 1964, the United States Army orbited its first Sequential Collation of Range (SECOR) satellite used for geodetic surveying. The SECOR system included three ground- based transmitters from known locations that would send signals to the satellite transponder in orbit. A fourth ground-based station, at an undetermined position, could then use those signals to fix its location precisely. The last SECOR satellite was launched in 1969. Decades later, during the early years of GPS, civilian surveying became one of the first fields to make use of the new technology, because surveyors could reap benefits of signals from the less-than-complete GPS constellation years before it was declared operational. GPS can be thought of as an evolution of the SECOR system where the ground-based transmitters have been migrated into orbit. ==See also== * History of nuclear weapons * List of nuclear weapons * Mutual assured destruction doctrine * National missile defense of the United States * Nuclear explosion * Nuclear strategy * Nuclear weapon design * Nuclear terrorism ==Notes== ==References== * Annotated bibliography for nuclear weapon delivery systems from the Alsos Digital Library for Nuclear Issues ==External links== * * Delivery Category:Missile operation ","title":"Nuclear weapons delivery"},{"id":"3247336","text":"A Bitstream or 1-bit DAC is a consumer electronics marketing term describing an oversampling digital-to-analog converter (DAC) with an actual 1-bit DAC (that is, a simple \\"on/off\\" switch) in a delta-sigma loop operating at multiples of the sampling frequency.

After two Hungarian soldiers died there in an accidental explosion, rumors spread that they had been killed by Romanians. After another incident the Royal Hungarian Army, influenced by the rumor, indiscriminately killed around 150 ethnic Romanians in the nearby locations and surrounding areas. ==Events== After the Second Vienna Award of 30 August 1940, as a result of German–Italian arbitration, northwestern Transylvania reverted to Hungary. The area ceded by Romania contained the northwestern part of the homonymous region and the Székely lands. A total of eight of the 23 Transylvanian counties included in the interwar period were entirely alienated, and another three were split. Thus, Sălaj County was also attached to Hungary. On 7 September 1940 the Hungarian Second Army arrived at Ipp (present-day Ip) where they made a short stop. After preparing to leave, more acquired grenades exploded in one of the sling-carts and in the detonation two soldiers died. The negligence of the proper storage was quickly identified but soon rumor had it that it was a willful action. This view escalated rapidly.A történelem tanúi – Erdély – bevonulás (1940), p. 25; On 8 September 1940, the Second Army entered the city of Zalău. On 13 September, the military commander of the district of Szilágysomlyó (present-day Șimleu Silvaniei) was informed that the nearby villages of Alsókaznacs, Felsőkaznacs, Márkaszék, Porc, Lecsmér, Somály, and Kémer (present-day Cosniciu de Jos, Cosniciu de Sus, Marca, Porț, Leșmir, Șumal, and Camăr) armed Romanian groups were looting. According to the report their number was between 80–100. Based on this report the 32nd Regiment stationing in Zilah (present-day Zalău) assigned a group to investigate the area. Meanwhile, the road, they arrived to Szilágynagyfalu (present-day Nușfalău) where they had been informed a few days before in Ipp two soldiers died in a detonation thus the same day they entered the commune where they conducted a raid instantly.Illésfalvi Péter: A román-magyar kapcsolatok katonai vonatkozásai 1940–1944 között (Pertinence of the Romanian-Hungarian military relations between 1940–1944), Háború, hadsereg, összeomlás Magyarország katonai részvétele és szerepe a második világháborúban.

(War, army, downfall – The participation and role of Hungary in WWII) After the reconnaissance, 18 suspicious persons were found and 16 had been executed, according to the official reports, because of their attempts to desert. Overnight, the Hungarian troops were residing in the local school when they were shot at from the street with a machine gun around 03:00 AM (some witnesses attested that the shootings came from a flat in the center, and five persons with machine guns were captured). In retaliation, between 152 and 158 ethnic Romanians were killed. The commander of the Hungarian troops who perpetrated the massacre of civilians was lieutenant Zoltán Vasváry. Some sources have stated that the Hungarian Army was supported by local vigilantes. The soldiers went house-to- house in panic and shot everybody indiscriminately. On 14 September, in Somlyócsehi (present-day Cehei), one person was killed. In the nearby Felsőkaznacs and Szilágcseres forests (present-day Cosniciu de Sus and Cerișa) 55 persons were killed. According to some other sources, the area most affected was Sălaj, where 477 Romanians were massacred. On September 14, at the order of Lt. Vasvári, a pit 24 meters long by 4 meters wide was dug in the village cemetery; the corpses of those killed in the massacre were buried head-to-head in two rows, with no religious ceremony. ==Trial== The facts were established by Decision no. 1 of the Northern Transylvania People's Tribunal (which sat in Cluj and was presided by Justice Nicolae Matei), in a public sentence from 13 March 1946. The findings of the Tribunal were as follows: * Lieutenant colonel Carol Lehotcsky, the military commander of Șimleu Silvaniei district, was found guilty or ordering reprisals against the Romanian inhabitants of Ip and nearby villages. *Ștefan Farago, a landowner from Ip and commander of a local militia was convicted for inducing Lehotcsky to order those repressive measures. (Adalbert Ujhaly was also found to have participated in this inducement, but he had died before the trial.) *Lt. Vasváry was found guilty of commanding the unit that carried out the massacre. *Fifteen locals (Nicolae Bereș, Sigismund P. Bereș, Francisc Borzási, Vasile K.

Each summary should be a concise exposition of the source's central idea(s) and give the reader a general idea of the source's content. == Main components of annotated bibliographies == The following are the main components of an annotated bibliography. Not all these fields are used; fields may vary depending on the type of annotated bibliography and instructions from the instructor if it is part of a school assignment. * Full bibliographic citation : the necessary and complete bibliographical information i.e. (author, title, publisher and date, etc.), * Author's background: the name, authority, experience, or qualifications of the author. * Purpose of the work: the reasons why the author wrote the work * Scope of the work: the breadth or depth of coverage and topics or sub-topics covered. * Main argument: State the main informative points of the paper * Audience: For whom was it written (general public, subject specialists, student? * Methodology: What methodology and research methods did the work employ? * Viewpoint: What is the author's perspective or approach (school of thought, etc.)? E.g., an unacknowledged bias, or any undefended assumptions? * Sources: Does the author cite other sources, and if so, what types? Is it based on the author's own research? Is it personal opinion? * Reliability of the source: How reliable is the work? * Conclusion: What does the author conclude about the work? Is the conclusion justified by the work? * Features: Any significant extras, e.g. visual aids (charts, maps, etc.), reprints of source documents, an annotated bibliography? * Strengths and Weaknesses: What are the strengths and weaknesses of the work? * Comparison: How does the source relate to other works done by other writers on the topic: does it agree or disagree with another author or a particular school of thought; are there other works which would support or dispute it? * Voice / Personal Conclusion: Provide an opinion of the work or a reaction to the source based on other available works, prior knowledge of the subject matter or knowledge pools done by other researchers. ==Types of annotations== Annotations may be written with different goals in mind. There are three types of annotations, depending on what might be most important for the reader or according to a professor's instructions. It is impossible to describe a standard procedure for all types of annotations because one annotation does not fit all purposes. In order to know the best type of annotation, it is prudent to consult the instructor or follow the instructions. For example, if an assignment states that an annotative bibliography should give evidence proving an analytical understanding of the sources used, then an analytical annotated bibliography which includes evaluation of the sources should be written. The three types of annotated bibliographies are; summary annotations, critical annotations and a combination of the former two. Summary annotations Summary annotations are further classified into informative and indicative annotations. The following are the main features of summary annotations: * They show a summary of the source content * They highlight the arguments and proofs/evidence mentioned in the work * They sometimes describe the author's methodology and any theories used * They offer the conclusion of the source * They do not evaluate the work they are discussing Informative Annotations This type of annotation is a summary of the source. An informative annotation should include the thesis of the work, arguments or hypothesis, proofs and a conclusion. Informative annotations provide a straight summary of the source material. They summarise all relevant information about the author and the main points of the work. To write an informative annotation, begin by writing the thesis; then develop it with the argument or hypothesis, list the proofs, and state the conclusion Indicative annotated bibliographies Indicative annotations do not provide actual information from the source. They provide overall information about what kinds of questions or issues are addressed by the work, for example, through chapter titles. In the indicative entry, there is no attempt to give actual data such as hypotheses, proofs, etc. ===Evaluative annotations=== This type of annotation assesses the source's strengths and weaknesses, in terms of usefulness and quality. Evaluative annotated bibliographies do more than just summarising, they provide critical appraisals. They evaluate the source or author critically to find any biases, lack of evidence, objectives, etc. They show how the work may or may not be useful for a particular field of study or audience. They explain how researching the material assisted a project. ===Combination annotations=== Most annotated bibliographies contain combination annotations. This type of annotation will summarize or describe the topic, and then evaluate the source's usefulness and a summary. Usually also includes a detailed analysis on the reason the article was written. == Formats of writing annotated bibliographies == Annotated bibliographies contain two main sections; the bibliographic information section and the annotations section. Since the formats may slightly vary from one institution to another and amongst scholars and researchers depending on the regulations, courses and materials being annotated, it is imperative to ask for specific guidelines. The bibliographic information There are also bibliography annotations that combine all three types (MLA, APA and Chicago style). When deciding on the style for an annotated bibliography, one should consider its purpose and the instructions given. Regardless of the formatting style required, all annotated bibliography pieces need to follow the same rule: the author's last name should be the only part that is flush left, while the rest of the text requires to be indented.Annotated Bibliography Example from the DoMyWriting's blog 2018. Retrieved August 07, 2018 The bibliographic information is written before the annotation using the suitable referencing style. The information is normally identified using a hanging indent. Generally, though, the bibliographic information of the source (the title, author, publisher, date, etc.) is written in either MLA or APA format. The annotations The annotations for each source are written in paragraph form. The lengths of the annotations can vary significantly from a couple of sentences to a couple of pages. The length of the annotation should be between 100 and 200 words. When writing summaries of sources, the annotations may not be very long. However, when writing an extensive analysis of each source, more space may be needed. A few sentences of general summary followed by several sentences of how the work fits into a larger paper or project that can be useful when writing a draft. ==Writing== Sample entry of an APA style annotated bibliography: ==References== == External links == * Writing an annotated bibliography - University of New England * How to Prepare an Annotated Bibliography - Cornell University Library Category:Bibliography Category:Book design ","title":"Annotated bibliography"},{"id":"3247367","text":"The Brief and Frightening Reign of Phil is a 130-page novella by the American writer George Saunders. It has been described as a parable, and has been likened to Animal Farm by George Orwell. Its author has said it is about \\"the human tendency to continuously divide the world into dualities\\". Saunders wrote the book over a number of years at Syracuse University, New York, where he is a creative-writing professor. ==Plot== The story focuses on the border disputes between the countries of Inner and Outer Horner, the former of which is \\"so small that only one Inner Hornerite at a time could fit inside, and the other six Inner Hornerites had to wait their turns to live in their own country while standing very timidly in the surrounding country of outer Horner.\\" Phil, an embittered Outer Hornerite, decides that the puny Inner Hornerites do nothing but stand around very close together solving math proofs all day, and have to stretch one at a time every morning. Seen as an evil threat to the leisure of the five Outer Hornerites, they are understood as abusing the vast good will that they have received courtesy of the Outer Hornerites. As they stand in the short-term residency zone in Outer Horner, they wait their turn to reenter their country. So Phil, gaining the support of the other Outer Hornerites and hiring two giants as his personal policy enforcers, begins to tax the Inner Hornerites for staying in his country. He settles in the end to accept the disassembling of the Inner Hornerites as sufficient payment. The story chronicles Phil's tyrannical rise to power and his attempted Inner Hornerite genocide. ==History== The story grew out of a challenge from the illustrator Lane Smith, who suggested Saunders \\"write a story in which all the characters were abstract shapes\\". Saunders wrote \\"Once there was a country that was too small for all its inhabitants to fit inside at once\\" and the story developed from that point. The abstract shapes became what Saunders regarded as \\"Conglomerates, composed of flesh and machine parts and vegetative portions\\" divided into two groups, one of which, led by Phil, trying to eradicate the other. In his essay \\"Why I wrote Phil\\", Saunders said the story became about \\"the human tendency to continuously divide the world into dualities, and, soon after, cast one's lot in with one side of the duality and begin energetically trying to eliminate the other\\". Saunders initially wanted it to be a children's book before it \\"became about genocide\\". He worked on the story for about six years, from 1999 to 2005, \\"on and off\\" as a side project, with the book reaching about 300 pages at one point. Saunders reduced the length of the story by removing several scenes which he said \\"had to go, because they, in the context of the book, slowed things down, made a story that I hoped would feel catastrophic and a little scary, feel leisurely.\\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:2005 American novels Category:American satirical novels Category:American political novels Category:American novellas ","title":"The Brief and Frightening Reign of Phil"},{"id":"3247369","text":"Secret Gig (SG) 14 - Live in Mallorca was a DVD of a special gig played for a select group of fans by English rock band Embrace, whom they took on a cruise holiday to Majorca, and was released only through their official website.

His text makes the qualifications of what is necessary to be a preacher, and provides a manual-style instruction on the rhetorical and stylistic skills one must have to excel at preaching. His importance is in the historical study of rhetoric, particularly 14th Century rhetoric, because The Form of Preaching is the text that best encapsulates the thematic sermon, a preaching style that developed in the early 14th century, and continues to be used today. == Subject matter == The preaching style first appeared in 1230-1231, at the University of Paris. The format of a university-style sermon takes a single theme from scripture and continuously develops the theme over the course of the sermon. A thematic sermon consists of six parts which are as follows: *The theme, which is taken from a passage of scripture *The protheme', the introduction of the theme, which is followed by prayer *The antetheme', an explanation of the sermon’s purpose *The division of the theme into sub-themes *Further subdivision of the sub-themes *Analysis of the divisions and subdivisions == Opening remarks == The Form of Preaching can be divided into three sections. The first section deals with Basevorn’s introductory remarks. This include his intentions for writing the text as a teaching manual. Basevorn considers preaching an art, so there are aesthetic characteristics to preaching in addition to having a wide knowledge of Christianity. The introduction also includes his criteria for one to be given the title of preacher. They are, first, that one must live a moral and just Christian life. Second, one must have adequate knowledge of sacred texts, including the Bible, Ten Commandments, and scripture. Third, one must be given the authority of the church (from a bishop or Pope) to practice as a preacher. He makes clear, however, regardless of how well schooled and knowledgeable a woman is about Christianity, she cannot preach. == Sources of good preaching == Basevorn says there is no one good style of preaching to emulate, but cites five sources that cover the spectrum of effective preaching styles. He argues that emulation or imitation is an acceptable practice because there is no shame in mimicking what has already been proved effective, and that too much emphasis is put on trying to be original. His five sources are Jesus, Saint Paul, Saint Augustine, Saint Gregory and Saint Bernard, probably Bernard of Clairvaux. Jesus’ methods receive the most attention because, to Basevorn, Jesus \\"included all praiseworthy methods in His own, as the fount and origin of good\\" (p. 128). Basevorn highlights six styles that trace specifically to Jesus: promising salvation (it is effective to use when people need little convincing), threats of damnation (it is effective to use on the stubborn), preaching by example (citing examples of a good Christian life), preaching by reason or logic, speaking clearly, and speaking obscurely. Basevorn provides little explanation for the latter two styles. He cites the passage “Behold, now thou speakest plainly, and speakest no proverb” from John 16:29 for the style of speaking clearly; for the style of speaking obscurely, he writes \\"it is frequently said about His hearers that they did not understand the Word\\". (p. 129) Saint Paul’s method combines reason and authority into one method in which they work in tandem. In Saint Paul’s style authority confirms reason. Saint Paul, as well, appeals to Basevorn because his writings and sermons reflect his compassion and charity he had for his audience. Closely reading a single passage from a sacred text and developing a sermon from a single theme in that specific passage is Saint Augustine’s style, and appeals to Basevorn because it is a type of thematic sermon. The merit in Saint Augustine’s style, according to Basevorn, is it is best suited for people with short memories or attention spans. Morality, not faith, is the point of emphasis in Saint Gregory’s sermons. Basevorn appreciates Saint Gregory’s style because he provides tangible examples of morality and the merits of Christianity in practical terms. He of Basevorn's five sources is the lone one to do so. Lastly, Saint Bernard’s style stands out to Basevorn because he frequently cites from primary sources, so that a more authoritative source confirms what he says in a sermon. == Ornamentation of a sermon == The Form of Preaching’s third focus is the ways in which a sermon can be ornamented. Ornamentation includes aesthetic techniques but also formal characteristics that comprise a sermon’s structure. In all, Basevorn cites twenty-two ornaments. The list of ornaments can be divided into two main categories: ornaments that are intrinsic to a sermon’s content, and ornaments that deal with the presentation of the sermon. The first fifteen ornaments are intrinsic to a sermon, and the list of intrinsic ornaments is as follows: *Invention of the theme *Winning- over of the audience *Prayer *Introduction *Division *Statement of the parts *Proof of the parts *Amplification *Digression (or transition) *Correspondence *Agreement of correspondence *Circuitous development *Convolution *Unification *Conclusion (p. 132). While the intrinsic ornaments deal with the composition and structure of a sermon, the extrinsic ornaments are: *Coloration *Modulation of voice *Appropriate gesture *Timely humour *Allusion *Firm impression *Weighing of subject matter (p. 132). These ornaments are presentational and are a means for delivering an effective sermon. == Sources == * James J., Murphy. “Introduction.” Three Medieval Rhetorical Arts. Ed. James J. Murphy.

Ayob practised law in South Africa and for much of his career the bulk of his work was with anti-apartheid cases. Ayob was involved in a much-publicised series of disputes with Nelson Mandela. == Career == Ayob's cousin Ismail Mahomed, who was later Chief Justice of South Africa, helped Ayob secure his first job in 1969 at a firm involved in cases related to the anti-apartheid movement. In 1973, he left the firm to start his own company by the name of Ismail Ayob & Associates. === Apartheid era lawyer === For the first twenty years of his career, Ayob concentrated on human rights cases, acting for opponents of the apartheid regime. Ayob defended and represented many South African political prisoners. Ayob was one of the few people who were allowed to visit Nelson Mandela while he was imprisoned on Robben Island. His most high-profile case was that of Hélène Passtoors, a Belgian woman accused of ferrying arms for the then-banned African National Congress. Another high-profile client of Ayob's was Winnie Mandela, who he represented during the Stompie Moeketsi kidnapping trial. == Nelson Mandela lawsuit == Ayob was asked by Nelson Mandela in May 2005 to stop selling certain prints signed by Mandela and also to account for the proceeds of the sales of these prints in a prominently publicised application to the High Court of South Africa. Ayob responded that he never sold any prints but had acted only in a professional capacity as attorney and agent for Mandela and his family. Under oath he said that he had never sold any prints nor was he a partner of anyone selling prints. In terms of the written contracts, Ayob was to receive royalties due to the Mandela family. These royalties were received from time to time and were held in the Mandela company accounts under his control; he gave a full accounting with an explanation. Ayob denied any wrongdoing, and declared that he was the victim of a smear campaign orchestrated by Mandela's advisors, in particular lawyer George Bizos. One particular issue was the drawing up of a last will for Mandela. Nelson Mandela stated under oath that despite many requests, Ayob refused to draw up a will. In his answer Ayob enclosed copies of five different wills signed by Mandela over a period of years. These were produced as annexures to Ayob's answering affidavit. After a difference of opinion with Mr Mandela, Ismail Ayob, Zamila Ayob, and Zayd Ismail Ayob were subject to an attack by Mandela's advisors. This campaign was driven through the media by page-one headlines and lead stories on radio and television. Six weeks later, proceedings were launched by Mandela. His new advisors supported the application by way of supporting affidavits. Major clients, religious bodies, mosques, the Law Society, cultural bodies, community associations, and the South African Revenue Service authorities were all contacted and attempts were made to vilify Ismail Ayob and his family. There were public meetings held in Pretoria and Durban. At these meetings, the Minister Essop Pahad in the office of the South African President Thabo Mbeki attacked Ayob and his entire family. He declared that it was an issue of guilt or innocence. Ahmed Kathrada, at a meeting he addressed in Laudium, called on Ayob to \\"surrender\\". Ahmed Docrat called Ayob a \\"crook\\" at the same meeting. There were calls for Ayob and his family to be ostracised by society and to be expelled from mosques and community and charitable organisations, and that there be protest marches and paid newspaper advertisements signed by supporters of Mandela. In terms of the High Court rules, Mandela and his new advisors were required to reply within two weeks of the answer of Ismail Ayob and Zamila Ayob. Some 20 months later, no reply had been made. === 2007 court action === Ismail Ayob, George Bizos and Wim Trengrove were trustees of the Nelson Mandela Trust. The Trust was set up to hold money donated to Nelson Mandela. Ayob resigned from the Trust. In 2006, the two remaining trustees of the Nelson Mandela Trust launched an application against Ayob for disbursing money in terms of the trust deed without their express consent. Ayob explained these disbursements included money that was paid to the South African Revenue Service, to the children and grandchildren of Mandela, Mandela himself, and to an accounting company for four years of accounting work. It was alleged that Ayob made defamatory remarks about Mandela in his affidavit, for which the court order stated that Ayob should apologise. These alleged that Mandela had foreign bank accounts and had not paid tax on these were later pointed out to have originated not from Ayob's affidavit but from Mandela's, George Bizos', and Iqbal Meer's affidavits against Ayob. == Personal life == Ayob attended the Methodist Coloured School until the age of 14, when he was sent to Pretoria to continue his schooling at the Pretoria Indian Boys High School, as schools in his area were closed to him because of his race. He is married to Zamila Ayob and they have one son, Zayd Ismail Ayob, who is also his law partner. Due to his Indian heritage, Ayob found that he could not attend university after he completed high school in 1959.Harry Belafonte & Michael Shnayerson, He moved to London, where he attended the London School of Economics and read law. He qualified as a barrister and returned to South Africa to practice as an attorney. ==References== Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of the London School of Economics Category:People from Mahikeng Category:20th- century South African lawyers Category:21st-century South African lawyers ","title":"Ismail Ayob"},{"id":"3247417","text":"Litchfield Park can refer to: * Litchfield Park, Arizona; or * Litchfield Park, Northern Territory, a locality ** Litchfield National Park, Australia.

His success in the club from Rosario (Santa Fé) took him to Fiorentina, a young man in a club facing bankruptcy made things hard for him to settle in Italy, his raw talent was there for all to see it was just the wrong time to be at the club. Early in 2002 El Equi returned to Argentina to play for Boca Juniors, and then a year later he joined his first club, Rosario Central. After half a season (a short championship in Argentina), Ezequiel transferred to Panathinaikos, where he was very much loved by fans of Panathinaikos, he became captain of the team, and helped the club to win the double in 2004, the first title in 7 years, a Greek Cup, and the Greek Championship, all in 2004. Equi González has great technique, creative passing and high influence. His first UEFA Champions League appearance (September 2004) was more than successful, as he scored two fantastic goals against Norwegian champions Rosenborg. Unfortunately, Gonzalez picked up a damaged cruciate ligament during the friendly match Panathinaikos vs. Apollon Athinon (1-0). Due to this injury, he played only one match during the 2006-2007 season. Equi returned fit from his injury, against Apollon Kalamarias (1-0) on January 6, 2008. On June 27, 2008 he went back to Rosario Central. With the number 10 he made a good season. In the end of the season he went on a free transfer to Fluminense to play the Brazilian League. He changed team again and he played for LDU Quito in 2011. When he finished the contract he was retired. ==Honors== Boca Juniors *Copa Libertadores: 2003 Panathinaikos *Super League Greece: 2003–04 *Greek Cup: 2003–04 ==References== ==External links== *Statistics at Guardian Stats Centre * Argentine Primera statistics * at Footballdatabase *Profile at WorldSoccer *Fan Club *zerzerofootball.com Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Rosario, Santa Fe Category:Argentine footballers Category:Rosario Central footballers Category:Boca Juniors footballers Category:ACF Fiorentina players Category:Panathinaikos F.C. players Category:Fluminense FC players Category:L.D.U.

This has the effect of maximizing the efficiency with which sound waves from the particular source are transferred to the air. Conversely, a horn can be used at the receiving end to optimize the transfer of sound from the air to a receiver. Acoustic horns are found in nature in the form of the burrows constructed by male mole crickets to amplify their song. The earliest appearance of the horn in connection to sound in The Times was published in 1786: :Red-cross Knight, approach the Gate; :Sound the horn, not fear thy fate.The Times, Oct. 18, 1786, pg. 2 == Applications == A traditional reed bulb horn Acoustic horns are used in: * horn loudspeakers * brass and woodwind musical instruments * vehicle horns such as those used on cars, trucks, trains, boats, and bicycles * megaphones, often used by lifeguards at public swimming pools. * ear horns, used by people who are hard of hearing (the human ear itself having the form of a horn) * pickup horns, used e.g. on acoustic phonograph players ===Horn loudspeakers=== A patent horn loudspeaker Loudspeakers are often built into horn-shaped enclosures or use horns. Most often the higher-frequency elements (tweeters and midranges) use horns, sometimes with acoustic diffraction lenses to spread the sound waves in a horizontal pattern at ear-level and limit the vertical pattern. An audio driver (e.g., a speaker cone or dome) is mounted at the small, inner end. Horn loudspeakers are very efficient, but have a sharp cutoff frequency, depending on the area of the horn mouth, with little sound output below. Bass sounds are usually produced by conventional speaker cones, since a circular horn mouth sufficient to reproduce 20 Hz would have a diameter of about , except when a building, ground surface, or room itself is considered an extension of the horn.http://www.jhsaudio.com/design.html ====Use of the surroundings as part of the horn==== Large bass speakers often take advantage of the surroundings as part of the horn. For example, they can be put in the corners of a room, so the walls act as part of the horn. Even outdoors, the ground can form part of the horn surface, and thus a partial horn can help provide a good impedance match to ground, or one or more walls, even at very low frequencies. ===Material handling 'sound horns'=== In agriculture, and dry material handling generally, sound horns are often used to start material flow or to force release of impacted materials. In a grain silo, such a horn may be mounted inside the silo and sounded as the silo is emptied to loosen stuck granules. Typically, these use any fundamental frequency from around 120–250 Hz, are about 120 dB SPL, and are powered by compressed air. They are sometimes called acoustic cleaners or acoustic horns. ===Horn-loaded musical instruments=== Many wind instruments have some kind of flaring bell shape. These are generally not exponential in configuration, and are used to modify the standing wave patterns of the instrument, and thereby the musical notes which can be produced. :\\"The flared section of the bore in many instruments are almost conical. First let's look at what this does to the spacing of the frequencies. In the page about pipes and harmonics, we saw that closed conical pipes have resonances whose frequencies are both higher and more closely spaced than those of a closed cylindrical pipe. So one can think of introducing a conical or flared section of the pipe as raising the frequencies of the standing waves, and raising the frequencies of the low pitched resonances most of all. The bell also contributes to this effect: in the rapidly flaring bell, the long waves (with the low pitches) are least able to follow the curve of the bell and so are effectively reflected earlier than are the shorter waves. (This is because their wavelengths are very much longer than the radius of curvature of the bell.) One might say therefore that the long waves 'see' an effectively shorter pipe.\\"Brass instrument (lip reed) acoustics: an introduction This has the effect of providing both the \\"brassy\\" sound of horn instruments versus woodwinds or even metal instruments which lack a flare, and also of increasing the perceived loudness of the instrument, as harmonics in the range to which the ear is most sensitive are now delivered more efficiently. However, this enhanced radiation in the higher frequencies means by definition less energy imparted to the standing waves, and thus less stable and well-defined notes in the higher registers, making the instrument more difficult to play. ==In nature== Male mole cricket in singing position in burrow. The burrow is shaped as a double exponential horn with bulb. Acoustic horns are found in nature in the form of the burrows constructed by male mole crickets to amplify their song. Gryllotalpa vineae digs a carefully smoothed burrow with no irregularities larger than 1 millimetre. Its song is loud enough to make the ground vibrate; its 3.5 milliwatts of mechanical power delivers a peak of 92 decibels at a distance of one metre. The song can be heard up to 600 metres away. ==References== Category:Sound production ","title":"Horn (acoustic)"},{"id":"3247457","text":"An Elephant Bar at Serramonte Center in Daly City, California.

After the First World War he entered graduate studies, first at Rutgers University, where he was awarded an M.S. in chemistry in 1921, and then at Cornell University, gaining a Ph.D. in physical chemistry in 1924. Wilcoxon entered a research career, working at the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research from 1925 to 1941. He then moved to the Atlas Powder Company, where he designed and directed the Control Laboratory, before joining the American Cyanamid Company in 1943. During this time he developed an interest in inferential statistics through the study of R. A. Fisher's 1925 text, Statistical Methods for Research Workers. He retired in 1957. Over his career Wilcoxon published over 70 papers.Karas, J. & Savage, I.R. (1967) Publications of Frank Wilcoxon (1892–1965). Biometrics 23(1): 1–10 His most well-known paperWilcoxon, F.

The C-terminus of the ubiquitin protrudes through the active site of USP21 (lower right). Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), also known as deubiquitinating peptidases, deubiquitinating isopeptidases, deubiquitinases, ubiquitin proteases, ubiquitin hydrolases, ubiquitin isopeptidases, are a large group of proteases that cleave ubiquitin from proteins. Ubiquitin is attached to proteins in order to regulate the degradation of proteins via the proteasome and lysosome; coordinate the cellular localisation of proteins; activate and inactivate proteins; and modulate protein-protein interactions. DUBs can reverse these effects by cleaving the peptide or isopeptide bond between ubiquitin and its substrate protein. In humans there are nearly 100 DUB genes, which can be classified into two main classes: cysteine proteases and metalloproteases. The cysteine proteases comprise ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs), ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs), Machado-Josephin domain proteases (MJDs) and ovarian tumour proteases (OTU). The metalloprotease group contains only the Jab1/Mov34/Mpr1 Pad1 N-terminal+ (MPN+) (JAMM) domain proteases. == Classes == In humans there are 102 putative DUB genes, which can be classified into two main classes: cysteine proteases and metalloproteases, consisting of 58 ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs), 4 ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs), 5 Machado-Josephin domain proteases (MJDs), 14 ovarian tumour proteases (OTU), and 14 Jab1/Mov34/Mpr1 Pad1 N-terminal+ (MPN+) (JAMM) domain-containing genes. 11 of these proteins are predicted to be non- functional, leaving 79 functional enzymes. In yeast, the USPs are known as ubiquitin-specific-processing proteases (UBPs). === Cysteine proteases === There are six main superfamilies of cysteine protease DUBs: * the ubiquitin- specific protease (USP/UBP) superfamily; (USP1, USP2, USP3, USP4, USP5, USP6, USP7, USP8, USP9X, USP9Y, USP10, USP11, USP12, USP13, USP14, USP15, USP16, USP17, USP17L2, USP17L3, USP17L4, USP17L5, USP17L7, USP17L8, USP18, USP19, USP20, USP21, USP22, USP23, USP24, USP25, USP26, USP27X, USP28, USP29, USP30, USP31, USP32, USP33, USP34, USP35, USP36, USP37, USP38, USP39, USP40, USP41, USP42, USP43, USP44, USP45, USP46) * the ovarian tumour (OTU) superfamily (OTUB1, OTUB2); * and the Machado-Josephin domain (MJD) superfamily. (ATXN3, ATXN3L) * the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (UCH) superfamily; (BAP1, UCHL1, UCHL3, UCHL5) *the MINDY family of K48-specific deubiquitinases; (MINDY1, MINDY2, MINDY3, MINDY4) *the recently discovered ZUFSP family, at present solely represented by ZUP1 There is also a little known putative group of DUBs called the permutated papain fold peptidases of dsDNA viruses and eukaryote (PPPDEs) superfamily, which, if shown to be bona fide DUBs, would be the seventh in the cysteine protease class. === Metalloproteases === The Jab1/Mov34/Mpr1 Pad1 N-terminal+ (MPN+) (JAMM) domain superfamily proteins bind zinc and hence are metalloproteases. == Role of deubiquitinating enzymes == Schematic representation DUBs function DUBs play several roles in the ubiquitin pathway. One of the best characterised functions of DUBs is the removal of monoubiqutin and polyubiquitin chains from proteins. These modifications are a post translational modification (addition to a protein after it has been made) where single ubiquitin proteins or chains of ubiquitin are added to lysines of a substrate protein. These ubiquitin modifications are added to proteins by the ubiquitination machinery; ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1s), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) and ubiquitin ligases (E3s). The end result is ubiquitin bound to lysine residues via an isopeptide bond. Proteins are affected by these modifications in a number of ways: they regulate the degradation of proteins via the proteasome and lysosome; coordinate the cellular localisation of proteins; activate and inactivate proteins; and modulate protein-protein interactions. DUBs play the antagonistic role in this axis by removing these modifications, therefore reversing the fate of the proteins. In addition, a less understood role of DUBs is the cleavage of ubiquitin-like proteins such as SUMO and NEDD8. Some DUBs may have the ability to cleave isopeptide bonds between these proteins and substrate proteins. They activate ubiquitin by the proteolysis (breaking down) of the inactive expressed forms of ubiquitin. Ubiquitin is encoded in mammals by 4 different genes: UBA52, RPS27A, UBB and UBC. A similar set of genes is found in other eukaryotes such as yeast. The UBA52 and RPS27A genes produce ubiquitin that is fused to ribosomal proteins and the UBB and UBC genes produce polyubiquitin (a chain of ubiquitin joined by their C- and N-termini). DUBs cleave the ubiquitin from these proteins, producing active single units of ubiquitin. DUBs also cleave single ubiquitin proteins that may have had their C-terminal tails accidentally bound to small cellular nucleophiles. These ubiquitin-amides and ubiquitin-thioesters may be formed during standard ubiquitination reactions by the E1-E2-E3 cascade. Glutathione and polyamines are two nucleophiles that might attack the thiolester bond between ubiquitin and these enzymes. Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase is an example of the DUB that hydrolyses these bonds with broad specificity. Free polyubiquitin chains are cleaved by DUBs to produce monoubiquitin. The chains may be produced by the E1-E2-E3 machinery in the cell free from any substrate protein. Another source of free polyubiquitin is the product of ubiquitin- substrate cleavage. If DUBs cleave the base of the polyubiquitin chain that is attached to a protein, the whole chain will become free and needs to be recycled by DUBs. ==Domains== Catalytic domain of USP7. Catalytic domains of USPs can be visualised as the fingers palm and thumb of a hand. Ubiquitin fits into the hand with its C-terminus poking through between the thumb and palm. DUBs often contain a catalytic domain surrounded by one or more accessory domains, some of which contribute to target recognition. These additional domains include domain present in ubiquitin-specific proteases (DUSP) domain; ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain; meprin and TRAF homology (MATH) domain; zinc- finger ubiquitin-specific protease (ZnF-UBP) domain; zinc-finger myeloid, nervy and DEAF1 (ZnF-MYND) domain; ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain; CHORD- SGT1 (CS) domain; microtubule-interacting and trafficking (MIT) domain; rhodenase-like domain; TBC/RABGAP domain; and B-box domain. ===Catalytic domain=== The catalytic domain of DUBs is what classifies them into particular groups; USPs, OTUs, MJDs, UCHs and MPN+/JAMMs. The first 4 groups are cysteine proteases, whereas the latter is a zinc metalloprotease. The cysteine protease DUBs are papain-like and thus have a similar mechanism of action. They use either catalytic diads or triads (either two or three amino acids) to catalyse the hydrolysis of the amide bonds between ubiquitin and the substrate. The active site residues that contribute to the catalytic activity of the cysteine protease DUBs are cysteine (diad/triad), histidine (diad/triad) and aspartate or asparagine (triad only). The histidine is polarised by the aspartate or asparagine in catalytic triads or by other ways in diads. This polarised residue lowers the pKa of the cysteine, allowing it to perform a nucleophilic attack on the isopeptide bond between the ubiquitin C-terminus and the substrate lysine. Metalloproteases coordinate zinc ions with histidine, aspartate and serine residues, which activate water molecules and allows them to attack the isopeptide bond. ===UBL=== Ubiquitin-like (UBL) domains have a similar structure (fold) to ubiquitin, except they lack the terminal glycine residues. 18 USPs are proposed to have UBL domains. Only 2 other DUBs have UBLs outside the USP group: OTU1 and VCPIP1. USP4, USP7, USP11, USP15, USP32, USP40 and USP47 have multiple UBL domains. Sometimes the UBL domains are in tandem, such as in USP7 where 5 tandem C-terminal UBL domains are present. USP4, USP6, USP11, USP15, USP19, USP31, USP32 and USP43 have UBL domains inserted into the catalytic domain. The functions of UBL domains are different between USPs, but commonly they regulate USP catalytic activity. They can coordinate localisation at the proteasome (USP14); negatively regulate USPs by competing for the catalytic site of the USP (USP4), and induce conformational changes to increase catalytic activity (USP7). Like other UBL domains, the structure of USP UBL domains show a β-grasp fold. ===DUSP=== Single or multiple tandem DUSP domains of approximately 120 residues are found in six USPs. The function of the DUSP domain is currently unknown but it may play a role in protein-protein interaction, in particular to DUBs substrate recognition. This is predicted because of the hydrophobic cleft present in the DUSP domain of USP15 and that some protein interactions with DUSP containing USPs do not occur without these domains. The DUSP domain displays a novel tripod-like fold comprising three helices and an anti-parallel beta-sheet made of three strands. This fold resembles the legs (helices) and seat (beta-sheet) of the tripod. Within most DUSP domains in USPs there is a conserved sequence of amino acids known as the PGPI motif. This is a sequence of four amino acids; proline, glycine, proline and isoleucine, which packs against the three-helix bundle and is highly ordered. ==Role in disease== The full extent of the role of DUBs in diseases remains to be elucidated. Their involvement in disease is predicted due to known roles in physiological processes that are involved in disease states; including cancer and neurological disorders. The enzyme USP28 is over-expressed in different types of cancer such as colon or lung. In addition, USP28 deubiquitinates and stabilizes important oncogenes such as c-Myc, Notch1, c-jun or ΔNp63.. In squamous tumors, USP28 regulates the resistance to chemotherapy regulating DNA repair via ΔNp63-Fanconia anemia pathway axis. The deubiquitinating enzymes UCH-L3 and YUH1 are able to hydrolyse mutant ubiquitin UBB+1 despite of the fact that the glycine at position 76 is mutated. UCH-L1 levels are high in various types of malignancies (cancer). == References == Category:Protein domains Category:Enzymes ","title":"Deubiquitinating enzyme"},{"id":"3247529","text":" HMS Leda, launched in 1800, was the lead ship of a successful class of forty-seven British Royal Navy 38-gun sailing frigates. Ledas design was based on the French , which the British had captured in 1782. (Hébé herself was the name vessel for the French s. Hébé, therefore, has the rare distinction of being the model for both a French and a British frigate class.) Leda was wrecked at the mouth of Milford Haven in 1808, Captain Honeyman was exonerated of all blame, as it was a pilot error. ==French Revolutionary Wars== Captain George Johnstone Hope commissioned Leda in November 1800. In 1801 he sailed her in the English Channel and to the coast of Egypt. On 12 March 1801, Leda recaptured the slave ship , Captain Watson, a 20-gun letter of marque that had sailed from Demerara for Liverpool some six weeks previously in company with and . These two vessels were also slave ships and letters of marque, all carrying valuable cargoes of sugar, coffee, indigo and cotton. During the voyage Union started to take on water so her crew transferred to Bolton. Then Bolton and Dart parted company in a gale. Next, Bolton had the misfortune to meet the French privateer Gironde, which was armed with 26 guns and had a crew of 260 men. Gironde captured Bolton in an hour-long fight that killed two passengers and wounded Watson and five men. Although Gironde was damaged, she had suffered no casualties.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5, p.275. Bolton was also carrying ivory, a tiger, and a large collection of birds, monkeys, and the like. Then on 5 April Leda captured the French ship Desiree, of eight men and 70 tons. She was sailing from Bordeaux to Brell with a cargo of wheat. Four days later Leda recaptured the Portuguese ship Cæsar, of 10 men and 100 tons. Cæsar had been sailing from Bristol to Lisbon with a cargo of sundries when the French privateer Laura had captured her. Lastly, on 1 May, Leda captured the French privateer Jupiter. Jupiter, of 90 tons, was armed with 16 guns and had a crew of 60 men. She was from Morlaix on cruise. On the same day Leda recaptured the Portuguese vessel Tejo. Then on 2 September Leda captured Venturose. Because Leda served in the navy's Egyptian campaign (8 March to 8 September 1801), her officers and crew qualified for the clasp \\"Egypt\\" to the Naval General Service Medal that the Admiralty issued in 1847 to all surviving claimants. In September 1802 Leda came under the command of Captain John (or James) Hardy. ==Napoleonic Wars== Captain Robert Honyman (or Honeyman) recommissioned Leda in August 1803 for the North Sea. he would remain her captain until her loss in 1808. Still, at various times Leda was under the temporary command of Captain Henry Digby in 1804 and Captain John Hartley in February 1805. In 1803 Leda was in the Channel. When the war with France recommenced, Honeyman was put in charge of a small squadron of gun-brigs off Boulogne. On 18 May Leda and detained the Dutch ship Phoenix. The next day Leda captured Bodes Lust. Five days after that, Leda, Amelia, and were in company at the capture of the Dutch ship Twee Vrienden. On 29 September Honyman and his squadron attacked a division of 26 enemy gun boats. The engagement lasted several hours until the gunboats took refuge off the pier in Boulogne. Honyman wanted to have his bomb vessels engage them, but winds and tide were unfavorable. The next day 25 more French gunboats arrived. However, before they could join the division that had arrived the night before, the British were able to drive two on shore where they were wrecked. The British suffered no casualties or material damage though a shell did explode in Ledas hold. Fortunately, this did little damage and caused no casualties. On 21 October Honyman sighted a convoy of six French sloops, some armed, under the escort of a gun-brig. He sent and to pursue them but the winds were uncooperative and the squadron was unable to engage. Instead, the hired armed cutter , which had only 35 men and twelve 12-pounder carronades, came up and attacked the convoy. After two and a half hours of cannonading, Admiral Mitchell succeeded in driving one sloop and the brig, which was armed with twelve 32-pounder guns, on the rocks. Admiral Mitchell had one gun dismounted, suffered damage to her mast and rigging, and had five men wounded, two seriously. At the end of July 1804, a boarding party under Lieutenant M'Lean took Ledas boats to mount an unsuccessful attack on a French gunvessel in Boulogne Roads. The attackers succeeded in capturing their target, but the strong tide prevented them from retrieving her. Casualties were heavy in the cutting out party and M'Lean was among the dead; in all, only 14 out of the 38 men in the boarding party returned to Leda.Marshall (1824), Vol. 2, p.180. Early in the morning of 24 April 1805, Leda, again under Honyman's command after Hartley's temporary command, sighted twenty-six French vessels rounding Cap Gris Nez. Honyman immediately ordered , Harpy, , , , , , , , , and to intercept. After a fight of about two hours, Starling and Locust had captured seven armed schuyts in an action within pistol-shot of the shore batteries on Cap Gris Nez.A schuyt was a Dutch flat-bottomed sailboat, broad in the beam, with square stern; usually equipped with leeboards to serve for a keel. The schuyts were all of 25 to 28 tons burthen, and carried in all 117 soldiers and 43 seamen under the command of officers from the 51st. Infantry Regiment. The French convoy had been bound for Ambleteuse from Dunkirk. On the British side the only casualty was one man wounded on Archer. The seven schyuts were: * Schuyt No. 52, under the command of a Sub-Lieutenant of Infantry Loriol, armed with three 24-pounders; * Schuyt No. 48, under the command of A. Joron of the 51st the Infantry, armed with two 6-pounders, one 24-pounder and one brass howitzer; * Schuyt No. 57, under the command of Lieutenant Loriol of 51st Infantry, armed with one 24-pounder and two 6-pounders; * Schuyt No. 45 under the command of Sub-Lieutenant Litner of the 51st Infantry, armed with one 24-pounder, one 12-pounder and one 6-pounder; * Schuyt No. 3. under the command of Mr. Calder, the senior commander, who left her before the British took possession of her; * Schuyt No. 54, under the command of Sub-Lieutenant Bragur of the 51st Infantry, armed with one 24-pounder and two 6-pounders; * Schuyt No.43, Sub Lieutenant Billa of the 51st Infantry, armed with one 24-pounder and two 6-pounders. The next day Archer brought in two more schuyts, No.s 44 and 58, each armed with one 24-pounder and two 12-pounders. On 25 April 1805 Railleur towed eight of the French schuyts into the Downs. Starling, which had received a great deal of damage, followed Railleur in. Leda was one of the escorts to a convoy of transports and EIC vessels that were part of the expedition under General Sir David Baird and Admiral Sir Home Riggs Popham that would in 1806 capture the Dutch Cape Colony. They would carry supplies and troops to the Cape, and then continue on their voyages. At 3:30a.m. on 1 November, near Rocas Atoll at , Leda sighted breakers and fired a gun, the signal to tack, herself barely missing the danger. King George was unable to tack and wrecked. As was on the point of tacking she ran afoul of and lost her bowsprit and foretopmast. She then drifted on to the atoll where she lost her rudder and bilged. In the morning Leda was able to rescue the survivors from King George and , , and sent their boats and were able to rescue about 400 people from Britannia, including Captain Brisk, his crew, and recruits for the EIC's armies. The British fleet, including Leda, arrived in Table Bay on 5 January 1806 and anchored off Robben Island. Leda supported the landing of the troops. On 6 January 1807 Leda was in company with and at the capture of Ann, Denning, master. Leda shared in the capture of the Rolla on 21 February. On 4 March she was at Table Bay and in sight when captured the French frigate and the two transports that Volontaire was escorting, which turned out to be two British transports that the frigate had captured in the Bay of Biscay, together with the British troops on board. On 19 March the squadron captured the General Izidro. In June 1810 the prize money for the capture of the Cape of Good Hope was payable. Then in July 1810 there was further distribution of money for the capture of Volontaire and Rolla. In December 1810 prize money for General Izidro was payable. Leda then accompanied Home Popham across the Atlantic for his expedition to the River Plate. On 9 September 1806 Leda pursued a brigantine on her way to Montevideo until the brigantine's crew beached her. Leda then sent her boats to retrieve or destroy the brigantine. However, when the boarding party reached the brigantine they discovered that her crew had already abandoned her. They also found that she was unarmed, though pierced for 14 guns. Because of the heavy seas the boarding party could not retrieve the brigantine, or even burn her. Instead they simply set her adrift among the breakers. During the operation small arms fire from the shore wounded four men. Leda remained in South America until the final British evacuation in about September 1807. On 22 August she was in sight, together with a number of other warships, when captured Minerva. Leda then returned to Sheerness and served in the Channel. At eight o'clock on the morning of 4 December, some off Cap de Caux, Leda sighted a privateer lugger making for the French coast, as well as a brig that appeared to be her prize. The brig ran for Havre de Grace but the lugger sailed in another direction as Leda pursued her. After six hours Leda succeeded in capturing the lugger, which turned out to be the brand new vessel , under the command of Nicholas Famenter. Adolphe was armed with ten 18-pound carronades, four 4-pounder guns, two 2-pounder guns and two swivel guns. She was eight days out of Boulogne. She had only 25 men on board as she had already put another 45 men of her crew on prizes. She ran ashore on the Bemberg Ledge and it was unlikely she would be gotten off. ==Loss== On 31 January 1808, Leda was caught in a gale that did much damage to the ship. Honeyman decided to try to take refuge at Milford Haven but she was wrecked at the mouth of the harbour. The quarantine master for the port came aboard Leda to urge her abandonment. The entire crew was able to get off safely. A court martial held on board HMS Salvador del Mundo in the Hamoaze acquitted Honeyman and his crew of all blame. It found that the pilot, James Garretty, had laid a wrong course after mistaking Thorn Island for the Stack Rocks, a mistake that was due to the bad weather and poor visibility. ==Notes, citations, and references== Notes Citations References * * Hepper, David J.

The parties then select their representatives to fill out elected office. General ticket systems are or were used in elections to the US House of Representatives; in France, beginning in the Third Republic; in Italy and in Singapore. ==Examples== ===France=== The scrutin de liste (Fr. scrutin, voting by ballot, and liste, a list) was, before World War I, a system of election of national representatives in France by which the electors of a department voted for all the deputies to be elected in that department. It was comparable with the general ticket. It was distinguished from the scrutin d'arrondissement, also called scrutin uninominal, under which the electors in each arrondissement voted only for the deputy to be elected in it. Nowadays, it is used on two- round bases to elect one third of the members of the regional councils, so as to ensure a landslide victory to the party which receives a majority. ===Italy=== In Italy, general ticket representation is the system that has been used to elect one fifth of the members of the regional councils since 1995. As in the French version, its goal is to ensure that the assembly is controlled by the leading coalition of parties. Unlike France, it is used on a single round of voting. ===Singapore=== In Singapore, the general ticket system, locally known as the , is used to elect members of the Parliament of Singapore from multi-member districts known as group representation constituencies (GRCs), on a first-past-the-post basis. This operates in parallel to elections from single-member district and nominations. ===United States=== For convenience or in order to assure majority control, many states adopted general ticket representation to elect the multiple members of a state delegation to the House of Representatives. In doing so, those states ensured that a group which might be a majority in only a portion of the state would always be outvoted by the larger majority throughout the state. States using this method elected their entire delegation in a statewide manner, either on a single ballot (by means of bloc voting) or on separate ballots for each seat, but always allowing every voter in the state to vote for a candidate for each seat. It was a system used frequently until restricted by the 1842 Apportionment Bill and subsequent legislation, most recently in 1967.Public Law 90-196, ) After 1842, it has continued to be used in rare instances, typically states with small delegations or admitted to the union since the last census.

He played for Panathinaikos and he is widely regarded as the best Greek player of the pre-war era. This is probably also due to the myth that for decades followed his sudden and mysterious early leaving from football. He made his last appearance in the football field on 23 April 1931 at the age of 21, in a match against AEK Athens. Panathinaikos were losing 2-0 but Messaris tied the score with two reverse headers and he received great cheering. His nickname was \\"Ο Ξανθός Άγγελος, The Blonde Angel\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20090621045105/http://www.pao.gr/el/history/pastlegends/?itemid=ad4e7271-d56f-4fe6-930c-ac4859ccf2a7 ==Career== ===Playing career=== Messaris was descended from people of Kefalonia, an island in the Ionian sea, but he was born in Cape Town, South Africa in 1910. In 1924, he moved to Athens, and spent three years at Goudihttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFh-xz3yN_A before transferring to Panathinaikos. His dribbling skills, his ball control together with his versatile mind and hard work quickly propelled him up the ranks in Greek football. During his short career he scored 53 goals: 23 in the Athens FCA Championship, 11 in the Panhellenic Championship, 2 with the Greece national team and 17 in international and friendly games of Panathinaikos and the mixed team of Athens.https://eu-football.info/_player.php?id=13817 He was first scorer in the 1929–30 season with 7 goals.https://web.archive.org/web/20110922204106/http://www.pao.gr/el/history/bydecade/?itemid=db7bd3d3-68ac-4f6a-b438-a80f172431ce Aggelos Messaris is widely known for his performance in the 8–2 victory over rivals Olympiakos, where he scored three goals and had three assists. This is the largest win either rival had recorded against each other. He also performed well in a 4–1 victory versus Aris, which inspired the following chant: \\"We scored eight to Olympiakos and four more to Aris. Hooray to Angelos Messaris!\\" (Greek: \\"Εβάλαμε οκτώ στον Ολυμπιακό και άλλα τέσσερα στον Άρη. Γεια σου Άγγελε Μεσσάρη!\\") ===After football=== After giving up football, Messaris concentrated on his studies at the National Technical University of Athens. Then he returned to South Africa where he concluded his studies and following this he came back to Greece where he became an executive manager at the Doxiadis enterprises. It is said that the reason why he left Panathinaikos rests on the unbearable pressure Apostolos Nikolaidis was putting on him in order to persuade him to commit himself to football and forget about his studies at NTUA. In a short telephone talk that he had with journalist Dimitris Liberopoulos back in 1973 Messaris said: \\"Please leave me alone... The football player you are asking for died in 1931\\". He died in 1978 and his funeral was attended by thousands of people.http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JGCOxpOgZRw/T89X7bqHDMI/AAAAAAAABjQ/ZzJkVSOsdN8/s1600/messaris_pethane.jpg ==Honours== *Panhellenic Championship: ::1930 *Athens FCA Championship (3): ::1929, 1930, 1931 *Panhellenic Championship top scorer : ::1930 *Athens FCA Championship top scorer (2): ::1930, 1931 ==External links== * pao.gr, Panathinaikos F.C.

It is on the white sand beach shoreline of the Lake of the Woods, near the United States border with Canada. The park is open for year-round recreation including camping, hiking, fishing and cross-country skiing. ==History== The history of human habitation in the Zippel Bay area of Lake of the Woods dates back to prehistoric times. Evidence of their settlements have been found along the Rainy River just east of the bay. The first Europeans in the area were the French explorers of New France. Coureur des bois Pierre La Vérendrye passed through the area in 1732 and reported settlements of the Cree, Monsoni, Dakota, and Assiniboine tribes. These natives preceded the Ojibwe who were pushed into the area by European-American settlers as they pushed their way west through Canada and the United States. La Vérendrye built Fort St. Pierre, a small post on Rainy River. La Vérendrye next established a strong French foothold in the area at Fort St. Charles on what is now known as Magnuson's Island. From here, French-Canadian voyageurs explored a large section of mid-continent North America, constructed other forts, and conducted fur trading, whose revenues were critical to the economy of the colony. The \\"golden age\\" of the French-Canadian fur trade lasted for 30 years before they were forced to abandon their forts at the end of the French and Indian War in 1763. As a result, the area came under the jurisdiction of the British. Transfer of the area to the rule of the United States occurred at the conclusion of the American Revolutionary War when the Treaty of Paris was signed in 1783. The exact boundary was not established until 1842. This was due to confusion about the precise location of the \\"northwest corner of Lake of the Woods.\\" After 50 years of controversy and confusion the matter was officially settled when the official boundary was established. Wilhelm Zippel was one of the first permanent settlers in the area. He moved to the area in 1887 and built a home on a peninsula near the entrance of Zippel Bay. Zippel and his family established a commercial fishing enterprise on the lake. A small fishing village also was established in the area and was thriving by 1909. The village included a post office, cold-storage building and homes for the fishermen. There is little evidence of the remains of the village besides foundations, debris and depressions in the land. Zippel Bay State Park was established in 1959 to provide public access to Lake of the Woods and provide recreational opportunities in the area. Construction of the park did not get underway until 1963 and was completed in 1967. ==Ecology== Zippel Bay State Park is home to a diverse population of jack pine, birch and quaking aspen trees. Other plants in the area include choke cherries, blueberries, cranberries, juneberries, pin cherries, strawberries and mushrooms. The plant life attracts herbivores like western moose and Dakota white-tailed deer. Other wildlife in the park include eastern black bears, northeastern coyotes, Hudson Bay minks, fishers, North American river otters and the rarely seen American marten. Eastern wolves have also been sighted in this park. The shoreline of Lake of the Woods attract a wide variety of shorebirds, water fowl and birds of prey. Sandhill cranes nest on the northern side of Zippel Bay. The bay is one of four known breeding areas for the rare piping plover. The plover is nearing extinction in the Great Lakes region of North America. Other birds found in the park include American white pelicans, Franklin's and Bonaparte's gulls, double-crested cormorants, and several species of terns. Ospreys and bald eagles nest within this park. ==Geology== Zippel Bay State Park is in a part of Minnesota that was at one time park of a glacial lake, Lake Agassiz. Lake of the Woods is a remnant of the glacial lake. The glacial history of northern Minnesota created areas of peatlands and sandy mineral rich soil. The topography of the area is generally gently sloped with some abrupt slopes that are former beaches of Lake of the Woods. Several rock outcrops a scattered around the shores of the lake and the bay. ==Recreation== Zippel Bay State Park is open for year-round recreation with fishing being the primary attraction. Lake of the Woods has an abundance of walleye and sauger which is a smaller relative of the walleye. Other fish caught in the lake at the park include perch, muskellunge and smallmouth bass. Lake sturgeon are rarely caught in the modern era, but they do play a role in the history of the park. Wilhelm Zippel built his fishing business on sturgeon. The sturgeon were caught for their valuable eggs, caviar. The fish were butchered and sent to market. The fish which can weigh up to and reach an age of 100 are occasionally caught by anglers at the park. Zippel Bay State Park has two campgrounds with 57 campsites and one group camping area for organizations like the Boy Scouts. The camping areas have showers and vault toilets with dumping stations available for campers with recreational vehicles. The park has of hiking trails, of cross-country skiing trails and of snow mobile trails. Additionally Zippel Bay State Park has picnic facilities including separate tables and a pavilion, a swimming area, boat ramps and a fishing pier. ==References== ==External links== * Zippel Bay State Park Category:1959 establishments in Minnesota Category:Protected areas established in 1959 Category:Protected areas of Lake of the Woods County, Minnesota Category:State parks of Minnesota Category:Lake of the Woods ","title":"Zippel Bay State Park"},{"id":"3247650","text":"Nora Fries, also known as Mrs. Freeze (previously known as Lazara prior to the continuity alteration), is a fictional supervillain appearing in media published by DC Entertainment, commonly as an adversary of the superhero Batman. She is the wife of villain Mr. Freeze, and was introduced in Batman: The Animated Series. Nora Fries made her first live-action debut in the film Batman & Robin, played by supermodel Vendela Kirsebom Thomessen. She has also appeared in the second season of Gotham, portrayed by Kristen Hager, and the 2018 Arrowverse crossover event Elseworlds, portrayed by Cassandra Jean Amell. ==Fictional character biography== ===DC Animated Universe (1992-2006)=== After marrying Victor Fries, a cryogenics researcher working for GothCorp, Nora is diagnosed with a terminal illness. Fries uses the company's equipment to cryogenically freeze his wife until a cure can be found. GothCorp CEO Ferris Boyle cuts the funding and later goes into Fries' laboratory to shut down the project personally with some security guards. According to “Heart of Ice”, Nora is presumed dead after the resulting scuffle, which destroys the lab. However, in the episode \\"Deep Freeze\\" Nora is revealed to still be alive within her chamber. Victor, who has by then become Mr. Freeze, eventually retrieves Nora's chamber and keeps it in his cave in the Arctic until Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero, when Nora's chamber is broken. No longer frozen, Nora does not have long to live. In desperation, Freeze bribes an old colleague into helping her. This leads to Freeze hunting down Barbara Gordon, one of the few women on hospital records with Nora's rare blood type. Freeze plans to use Barbara for a fatal organ transplant to save Nora, but Batman intervenes. Nora is ultimately cured by Dr. Lyle Johnston of Wayne Enterprises. According to The New Batman Adventures episode \\"Cold Comfort\\", Nora waits for the missing and presumed dead Freeze for some time before she decides to marry her doctor Francis D'Anjou. This subplot is expanded in The Batman Adventures, a comic series based on Batman: The Animated Series, with one issue seeing Freeze working with Nightwing and Batgirl to stop a criminal who has abducted Francis D'Anjou out of recognition of Nora's feelings for him. In Volume 2, after Nora receives a letter from Victor, D'Anjou is frozen in their home in an attack from Victor's technology. Batman and the police believe that Mr. Freeze was behind the attack and are suspicious of both his and Nora's intentions when Nora gets a ticket to the Arctic Circle. Nightwing discovers that the attack was set up by D'Anjou himself in an attempt to frame Victor and make Nora hate him. D'Anjou is quickly defeated and arrested by Nightwing. In the Arctic Circle, Nora reunites with Victor to confirm he wasn't behind the attack and confesses that she never truly loved Francis as she embraces him. Batman and Batgirl arrive to apprehend Victor, who chooses to fight back thinking Batman will arrest him for his other crimes even if he isn't responsible for D'Anjou's attack. During their fight, Batman causes Victor's suit to overload which leaves his head to fall into the Arctic Ocean, devastating Nora. After talking to her incarcerated ex-husband and Victor's former assistant Koonak (whom Victor looked after following the death of Koonak's parents), Nora returns to the Arctic Circle, hoping to find Victor's head. The web cartoon Gotham Girls also reveals that Nora has a younger sister named Dora Smithy. Dora is very close to Nora and hates Victor Fries for keeping her sister in a coma. Dora's campaign against costumed vigilantes and villains results in her becoming one herself in the series finale. By the time of Batman Beyond, Nora is not seen; however, when Mr. Freeze (whose frozen body slows his aging to an almost immortal level) returns to his normal human self of Victor Fries in the episode \\"Meltdown\\", he starts a Nora Fries Foundation in memory of his wife. The comic series Batman: The Adventures Continue, which follows from The Batman Adventures comics, reveals that Nora's terminal illness had relapsed, and with Victor still missing then, and therefore not present to put her in cryostasis again, Nora succumbed to her illness and died. Afterward, somehow, Victor had been found, obtained a new suit, and returned to Gotham. In his grief, he becomes obsessed with resurrecting Nora, and steals a shawl that legend (incorrectly) claims has the power of resurrection. The theft brings Freeze into conflict against Batman again, along with Azrael, sent by the religious order that possessed the shawl. Victor is defeated and taken into custody, with Nora still deceased. Nora Fries has never had a voice actress on appearances in the animated series, she is always unconscious (usually floating in the cryogenic tank); the only time she is seen awake is in photographs and at the end of Batman & Mr. Freeze: Subzero, when a report is shown of her recovery. ===Comic books=== ====Falling ill==== Nora is an attractive and gentle girl. She meets Victor Fries in a strict boarding school and later marries him. Shortly after their marriage, Nora falls terminally ill. Victor discovers a way to put Nora into cryostasis, hoping to sustain her until a cure can be found. In time her husband will become one of Batman's well-known enemies, Mr. Freeze. Over time she falls to pieces in her ice state, but Freeze puts her back together again. ====Lazara==== Freeze helps Nyssa al Ghul by creating a machine for the Society that can also be used to capture Batgirl. In return, Nyssa has offered to help him restore his wife using the Lazarus Pit. Though Nyssa has told him the pit needs to be adjusted for Nora, Batgirl convinces Freeze that Nyssa has no intention of reviving her at all, and he throws Nora into the pit himself. Because of all the years of being altered and broken, Nora absorbs the pit's alchemy, acquiring the powers to conjure flame and reanimate the dead. She becomes a supervillainess, calling herself Lazara. Mr. Freeze manages to stop her by freezing her once again. ====The New 52==== Nora's history was revised as of DC Comics' 2011 reboot of its continuity, The New 52. Nora Fries is now Nora Fields, a woman born in 1943 and placed in cryostasis by her parents at age 23 due to her being diagnosed with incurable heart disease. Her case was taken on by Wayne Enterprises employee Victor Fries, who fell in love with her, becoming obsessed to such a degree that he began believing that she was his wife. The project was terminated by Bruce Wayne, and in rage, Victor threw a chair at him. Wayne dodged the chair, which hit a freezing chemical tank, leaving Fries's body permanently ruined due to the blistering cold while also causing Fries to become Mr. Freeze. Sometime later, Mr. Freeze escapes his cell and tries to steal Nora's body and flee Gotham while also vowing to kill Bruce Wayne. Batman intervenes and ultimately tells Freeze the truth concerning Freeze's \\"wife\\" with Freeze reacting angrily, saying that it's all lies. The two later engage in a fight with Batman eventually emerging as the victor and stopping Freeze. This version of Victor and Nora's relationship has been acknowledged as far more disturbing than previous adaptions, to the point of actually bothering Batman, who comments to Freeze that Nora is old enough to be Freeze's grandmother.Batman: Annual #1. DC Comics. ====DC Rebirth==== The Nora from New 52 had been retconned, thereby making her history more similar to the animated series and post-Zero Hour. She was the wife of Victor Fries (having a career as a talented ballerina) but discovered she had an incurable type of cancer. She had wanted to live the last years of the life of her own free will, but her husband forced her into the cryogenic storage. Several years later due to the events in \\"Year of the Villain,\\" Lex Luthor gives Mr. Freeze a vial that would cure and furthermore revive his frozen wife. Mr. Freeze had to kidnap several women who matched his late wife's characteristics, in both mental and physical states, going as far as modifying their DNA to hers in order to experiment with the vial before reviving his wife. In the end, it worked, and his wife came back to life cured. She soon took up the name Mrs. Freeze. ==Powers and abilities== After emerging from the Lazarus Pit, Nora Fries becomes Lazara. Lazara is a supervillainess who can summon fire and raise the dead. She blames her husband Victor Fries for her transformation. ==In other media== ===Television=== * Nora Fries also appears in The Batman. In the episode \\"The Big Chill\\", she is briefly shown in pictures in her husband's car before the accident that turns Victor Fries into Mr. Freeze. * Nora Fries appears in season 2 of Gotham portrayed by Kristen Hager. As in the comics, she is the terminally ill wife of scientist Victor Fries performing cryogenic experiments to find a cure. Nora discovers that Victor has been freezing human subjects for these experiments and recoils in horror. Jim Gordon and Harvey Bullock find Victor and Nora's residence and take her into custody. Nora becomes the patient of Leslie Thompkins and is moved to Arkham Asylum. Victor breaks into the asylum and takes both Nora and Thompkins. Victor attempts to perform a cryogenic treatment on her that Victor believes will save her life, but Nora sabotages it and allows the chemicals to freeze her solid and kill her, as she does not want to live in a world where Victor is either dead or in prison. * Nora Fries appears in Elseworlds, the 2018 Arrowverse crossover event between The CW series The Flash, Supergirl, and Arrow, portrayed by Cassandra Jean Amell. This version is shown as an inmate of Arkham Asylum who is released from her cryostasis after John Deegan causes a mass breakout. While looking for a way to get her body temperature back to 196 degrees below zero, she encounters Killer Frost and uses her husband's freeze gun on her. However, she is forced to flee after a scuffle with Oliver Queen in Barry Allen's body; knocking over confiscated canisters of Scarecrow's fear gas in the process. * Nora Fries appears in the Harley Quinn episode \\"Thawing Hearts\\", voiced by Rachel Dratch. Mr. Freeze has been working to find a cure for Nora after freezing Harley and claiming territory as part of the Injustice League in \\"New New Gotham\\". When Harley's plans to get revenge on Freeze ends in her capture, he tries to use her as his first human subject to test for a cure. In order to save herself, Harley persuades Freeze to spare her after mentioning that her friend, Poison Ivy, could find a cure for his wife. After witnessing Freeze's strange behavior with Nora's frozen body, Harley comes to the conclusion that Freeze froze Nora after she decided to leave him and that he made up her disease as a means to justify it. Harley defrosts her body and breaks Freeze's gun, only to learn he was telling the truth. Nora is eventually cured by Poison Ivy, though at the cost of Mr. Freeze's life, who sacrificed himself to give her the cure via a blood transfusion. Harley and her friends try to offer condolences, but Nora angrily tells them to get out. Nora also briefly appears in the episode \\"Bachelorette\\", where she attends Ivy's bachelorette party and enters a relationship with Maxie Zeus. In \\"The Runaway Bridesmaid\\", Nora attends Ivy's wedding as a bridesmaid and with Maxie as her date. ===Film=== Nora Fries is played by supermodel Vendela Kirsebom Thomessen in the 1997 movie Batman & Robin. She is cryogenically frozen throughout the movie and has no dialogue. In the film, she suffers from a fictional illness called MacGregor's Syndrome. Batman reveals that she has the most advanced stages of this disease, for which Mr. Freeze has yet to find a cure. Poison Ivy pulls the plug on Nora’s cryogenic tank in an attempt to kill her and have Freeze to herself. Nora lives, however, as her cryo-chamber was restored in time, and Batman has her sent to Arkham Asylum so that Mr. Freeze can continue his research for a cure during his imprisonment there. ===Video games=== * Nora Fries appears in Batman: The Enemy Within. Her body is kept frozen in Mr. Freeze's part of The Pact's hideout. When infiltrating the Pact on Amanda Waller's behalf, Bruce Wayne can win Mr. Freeze over through promises to cure his wife Nora Fries after making sure the cryogenic technology was not damaged by the EMP that was accidentally set off by \\"John Doe.\\" * Nora Fries is mentioned in Injustice 2 in pre-battle dialogue by Mister Freeze who is researching a way to cure Nora. * Nora is the default female name for the sole survivor in Fallout 4 who is cryogenically frozen at the beginning of the video game. ==== Batman: Arkham ==== Nora Fries appears in most games in the Batman: Arkham series. *Chronologically, she first appears in the Cold Cold Heart DLC for Batman: Arkham Origins, in cryostasis. In this continuity, her terminal disease is Huntington's Chorea. Victor Fries made a deal with Ferris Boyle, secretly developing weapons for GothCorp in exchange for Boyle devoting his company's resources to finding a cure. However, when Fries discovered that Boyle never intended to uphold his end of the deal, Boyle removed Nora from his lab to another section. The struggle that followed resulted in the accident that transformed Victor into the villain Mr. Freeze, bent on saving his wife at all costs and exacting revenge on Boyle. Freeze kidnaps Boyle to force him to release Nora. When Nora's chamber begins to lose power, Boyle tries to stop Freeze from saving her, intent on forcing Freeze to watch his wife die. Batman intervenes, however, and saves Nora while subduing Boyle. *In Batman: Arkham City, Nora is still in cryostasis, and Mr. Freeze is said to have been working on a cure for her while imprisoned in the titular mega-prison. However, the prison's warden, Dr. Hugo Strange, had Nora's cryogenics chamber stolen and delivered to the Joker, who demand that Freeze creates a cure for the Joker's disease in exchange for returning her. Upon being saved by Batman from the Penguin's clutches, Freeze asks him to find Nora's chamber in Arkham City in exchange for developing a cure for the Joker's disease, which Batman also suffers from, having been infected by the Joker. The player can find Nora and relay her location to Mr. Freeze in a side mission, aptly named \\"Heart of Ice\\". Nora's biography states that she was a gifted dancer. Mr. Freeze's interview tapes recount his first meeting Nora at a reform school and marrying her soon after, only to realize Nora was terminally ill. He tried to put her in a state of cryogenic sleep until a cure could be found. Ferris Boyle discovered the experiment and tried to stop it, claiming that Victor was illegally using GothCorp property. Victor attacked Boyle, who knocked him into a vat of cryogenic chemicals and left him to die. Victor then became Mr. Freeze and planned on murdering Boyle and reclaiming his wife. At first, Batman tried to stop him, not knowing his intentions, but eventually learned of Boyle's actions and helped Freeze to be reunited with Nora, while stopping him from killing Boyle, who was exposed and arrested, leading to Freeze being grateful to Batman. After the completion of the side mission, Nora is last seen reunited with Freeze, who thanks Batman for finding her. * Nora appears again in Batman: Arkham Knight, voiced by Cissy Jones. She appears in the \\"Season of Infamy\\" DLC pack, in the side mission \\"In From the Cold\\". Members of Arkham Knight's militia steal Nora's cryogenics chamber to try to force Mr. Freeze to kill Batman for them. Batman helps Freeze track down the chamber. When he finds it, he is forced to release Nora. Nora tells Victor that she no longer wants him to try and save her. Mr. Freeze sacrifices his equipment to stop the militia and he is reunited with Nora. Mr. Freeze removes his helmet and informs his wife that they have mere days to live. They then sail away together and Batman tells Alfred not to track their ship and to let them go. ===Miscellaneous=== Nora Fries is featured in the Smallville Season 11 digital comic based on the TV series. ==References== ==External links== * Nora Fries at the DC Database * Nora Fries at the DC Animated Universe Wiki Category:Fictional cryonically preserved characters in comics Category:Fictional necromancers Category:Batman: The Animated Series characters Category:DC Comics supervillains Category:Female characters in animation Category:Female characters in comics Category:Female supervillains Category:Comics characters introduced in 1992 Category:Characters created by Bruce Timm Category:Characters created by Paul Dini Category:DC Animated Universe characters ","title":"Nora Fries"},{"id":"3247657","text":"Linda Grant (born 15 February 1951) is an English novelist and journalist. ==Early life== Linda Grant was born in Liverpool. She was the oldest child of Benny Ginsberg, a businessman who made and sold hairdressing products, and Rose Haft; both parents had immigrant backgrounds – Benny's family was Polish- Jewish, Rose's Russian-Jewish – and they adopted the surname Grant in the early 1950s. She was educated at The Belvedere School, read English at the University of York (1972 to 1975), then completed an M.A. in English at McMaster University in Canada. She did post-graduate studies at Simon Fraser University. ==Career== In 1985, Grant returned to England and became a journalist, working for The Guardian, and eventually wrote her own column for eighteen months. She published her first book, a non-fiction work, Sexing the Millennium: A Political History of the Sexual Revolution, in 1993. She wrote a personal memoir of her mother's fight with vascular dementia called Remind Me Who I Am, Again, which was cited in a discussion about ageing on BBC Radio 4's Thinking Allowed in December 2003. Her fiction draws heavily on her Jewish background, family history, and the history of Liverpool. In an interview by Emma Parker for the University of Leicester's July 2008 'Unsettling Women: Contemporary Women's Writing and Diaspora' conference, and later published in the journal Wasafiri, Grant said: > \\"I always wanted to make my living as a writer, but you couldn’t get a job > as an author, so I got a job as a reporter on a local paper just before my > eighteenth birthday.

In November 2016, The Guardian newspaper published a detailed account of Grant's writing process, in which she noted, \\"My rituals of writing are so calcified I could be an elderly colonel at his gentleman's club: ironed newspaper, tea piping hot, shoes the correct colour for in town. Without the scaffolding of my habits, I'm superstitiously convinced I'd never write a word. I don't – can't – write after lunch, in a cafe or any other public place, including trains and planes, or when anyone else is in the house. It's an act of severe, intense solitude, partly now destroyed by the internet, and its deceptive promise of the ease of looking things up as you go along.\\" ==Bibliography== ===Non fiction=== *Sexing the Millennium: A Political History of the Sexual Revolution.

Three years later her second, non-fiction, work, Remind Me Who I Am Again, won both the Mind and Age Concern Book of the Year awards. Her second fictional novel, When I Lived in Modern Times won the 2000 Orange Prize for Fiction and was short-listed for the Jewish Quarterly-Wingate Literary Prize the same year. In 2002 her third novel Still Here was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize. In 2006, Grant won the First Prize Lettre Ulysses Award for the \\"Art of Reportage\\", the last to be awarded, for her non-fiction work about the Israeli people entitled The People on the Street: A Writer's View of Israel.

It was also long- listed for the Orange Prize for Fiction in the same year. In 2014, Grant was appointed a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature (FRSL). In March 2017, it was announced that Grant's novel The Dark Circle had been longlisted for the Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction. ==References== ==External links== * *Journalisted – Articles by Linda Grant Category:1951 births Category:Alumni of the University of York Category:English women journalists Category:English Jewish writers Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Literature Category:Living people Category:People educated at The Belvedere Academy Category:Jewish women writers Category:Jewish novelists Category:English women novelists Category:20th-century English novelists Category:21st-century English novelists Category:20th-century English women writers Category:21st- century English women writers Category:The Guardian journalists Category:English women non-fiction writers ","title":"Linda Grant"},{"id":"3247662","text":"The cover to the Project 4.1 Final Report, \\"Study of Response of Human Beings Accidentally Exposed to Significant Fallout Radiation.\\" Project 4.1 was the designation for a medical study and experimentation conducted by the United States of those residents of the Marshall Islands exposed to radioactive fallout from the March 1, 1954 Castle Bravo nuclear test at Bikini Atoll, which had an unexpectedly large yield. Government and mainstream historical sources point to the study being organized on March 6 or March 7, 1954, six days after the Bravo shot. == Establishment and secrecy == In the wake of the Castle Bravo detonation, a new research section was added to the Castle Bravo Weapons Effects research section. Program 4, \\"Biomedical effects,\\" was to include one project, Project 4.1, titled \\"Study of Response of Human Beings exposed to Significant Beta and Gamma Radiation due to Fall-out from High- Yield Weapons.\\" Eugene P. Cronkite of the National Naval Medical Center was designated as Project Officer.James Reeves to Frank D. Peel, \\"Establishment of Program 4 and Project 4.1 in Castle\\" (11 March 1954), online at . Cronkite's instructions stressed the importance of secrecy surrounding the project: The purpose of the project, as a 1982 Defense Nuclear Agency report explained, was both medical as well as for research purposes: == Preparation == As a Department of Energy Committee writing on the human radiation experiments wrote, \\"It appears to have been almost immediately apparent to the AEC and the Joint Task Force running the Castle series that research on radiation effects could be done in conjunction with the medical treatment of the exposed populations.\\"Final Report of the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, Chapter 12, Part 3: \\"The Marshallese\\". Available online at https://ehss.energy.gov/ohre/roadmap/achre/chap12_3.html. The DOE report also concluded that \\"The dual purpose of what is now a DOE medical program has led to a view by the Marshallese that they were being used as 'guinea pigs' in a 'radiation experiment.'\\" The Castle Bravo fallout plume spread dangerous levels of radiation over an area over 100 miles long, including inhabited islands. Organizations involved in the project included the Naval Medical Research Institute, the Naval Radiological Defense Laboratory, Patrol Squadron 29, the Naval Air Station, Kwajalein, Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Applied Fisheries Laboratory at the University of Washington, and Hanford Atomic Power Operations. Three U.S. Navy ships were used in the project: USS Nicholas, USS Renshaw, and USS Philip. The primary study of the Marshallese was terminated around 75 days after the time of exposure. In July 1954 a meeting at the Division of Biology at the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission decided to complete 6- and 12-month follow-up exposure studies, some of which were later written up as addendums to Project 4.1.See the \\"Introduction\\" of E.P. Cronkite, C.L. Dunham, David Griffin, S.D. McPherson, Kent T. Woodward, Twelve-Month Postexposure Survey on Marshallese Exposed to Fallout Radiation (Upton, NY: Brookhaven National Laboratory, August 1955). Available online at http://worf.eh.doe.gov/data/ihp1a/1013_.pdf. == Intentionality == Some Marshallese have alleged that the exposure of the Marshallese was premeditated. In 1972, Micronesian Representative Ataji Balos charged at the Congress of Micronesia that the exposure during Bravo was purposeful so that the AEC could develop medical capabilities for treating those exposed to fallout during nuclear war, and charged that the Marshallese were chosen because of their marginal status in the world at large. According to a U.S. internal transcription of Balos' talk, Balos alleged that \\"The U.S. chose to make guinea pigs out of our people because they are not white but some brown natives in some remote Pacific islands. Medical treatment that Rongelapese and Utrikese have been receiving is also highly questionable.\\"See entry under 25 Jan 1972 at http://worf.eh.doe.gov/ihp/chron/ . Quote is from unclassified telegram DISTAD Palau to SECSTATE Wash. DC, 27 Jan 72, Document 48025, CIC, available online at http://worf.eh.doe.gov/ihp/chron/G15.PDF. The AEC issued a staff comment denying these charges. In 1994, a 1953 Castle Bravo program prospectus was found which included reference to Project 4.1 apparently written before the Bravo shot had occurred. The U.S. government responded that someone had gone back into the project list after the Bravo test to insert Project 4.1; thus, according to the U.S. government, the acts were not premeditated. All other U.S. documents point to Project 4.1 having been established after the Bravo test—most sources point to its having been organized on March 7, 1954.See the chronologies at both the Department of Energy Marshall Islands Chronology and Republic of the Marshall Islands Embassy . The final Project 4.1 report began in its preface with the statement that \\"Operation CASTLE did not include a biomedical program\\" (it mentions this in discussing the ad hoc nature by which the project personnel were assembled).E.P. Cronkite, V.P. Bond, L.E. Browning, W.H. Chapman, S.H. Cohn, R.A. Conard, C.L. Dunham, R.S. Farr, W.S. Hall, R. Sharp, N.R. Shulman, Study of Response of Human Beings Accidentally Exposed to Significant Fallout Radiation, Operation CASTLE—Final Report Project 4.1, Naval Medical Research Institute, Naval Radiological Defense Laboratory, Defense Atomic Support Agency, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Report #WT-923 (October 1954). Online at http://worf.eh.doe.gov/data/ihp2/2776_.pdf. All official and mainstream historical accounts of the Bravo test indicate that its high level of fallout was a result of a miscalculation in relation to its design and was not deliberate (see the Castle Bravo article for more information on the alleged accident). Barton C. Hacker, the official historian of U.S. nuclear testing exposures (who is, in the end, very critical of the U.S. handling of the Bravo incident), characterized the controversy in the following way: nuclear fallout sticking to the common damp areas of exposed human skin, and the resulting beta burns. Controversy continues however, fed by the legacy of mistrust sown by American nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands, which involved relocating hundreds of people and rendering several atolls uninhabitable. While most sources do not think that the exposure was intentional, there is no dispute that the United States did carefully study the exposed Marshallese, but never obtained informed consent from the study subjects. This study of the Marshallese was in some cases beneficial for their treatment, and in other cases not. In these ways, the study of the exposed Marshallese reflects the same ethical lapses as were undertaken in other aspects of the secret human radiation experiments conducted by the Atomic Energy Commission in the 1940s and 1950s, which came to light only after the end of the Cold War. == Results about effects == According to the Final Project 4.1 report, the Bravo test exposed 239 Marshallese on the Utirik, Rongelap, and Ailinginae Atolls to significant level of radiation, and 28 Americans stationed on the Rongerik Atoll were also exposed. Those on the Rongelap Atoll were the most seriously affected, receiving approximately 175 rads of radiation before they were evacuated. Those on Ailinginae received 69 rads, those on Utirik received 14 rads, and the Americans on Rongerik received an average dose of 78 rads. The results of the original Project 4.1 were published by the study's authors in professional medical journals in 1955, such as the Journal of the American Medical Association.For example, Cronkite, et al., \\"Response of Human Beings Accidentally Exposed to Significant Fall-out Radiation,\\" JAMA 159 (1 October 1955): 430-434. In 2010 it was calculated that by sub-population, the projected proportion of cancers attributable to radiation from fallout from all nuclear tests conducted in the Marshall Islands is 55% (with a 28% to 69% uncertainty range) among 82 persons exposed in 1954 on Rongelap Atoll and Ailinginae Atoll. Most of the individuals exposed did not immediately show signs of radiation sickness, though within a few days other effects of significant radiation exposure manifested: loss of hair and significant skin damage, including \\"raw, weeping lesions\\", among the Rongelap and Ailinginae groups. The lesions healed quickly, however, consistent with radiation exposure. The report abstract concluded that \\"estimates of total body burden indicate that there is no long term hazard.\\" Additional follow-up checks on the Marshallese studied in Project 4.1 were conducted at regular intervals afterwards every year since 1954. Though the Marshallese experienced far milder immediate effects than the Japanese fishermen exposed to Bravo fallout on the fishing boat Daigo Fukuryū Maru, the long-term effects were more pronounced as they depended largely on subsistence living and were relocated to the site of the testing in Bikini, Ene Wetak, and Rongelap while the Japanese fisherman were returned to Japan. For the first decade after the test, the effects were ambiguous and statistically difficult to correlate to radiation exposure: miscarriages and stillbirths among exposed Rongelap women doubled in the first five years after the accident, but then returned to normal; some developmental difficulties and impaired growth appeared in children, but in no clear-cut pattern. In the decades that followed, though, the effects were undeniable.

It is equal to the portion of the total community income that would have to be redistributed (taken from the richer half of the population and given to the poorer half) for there to be income uniformity. It can be graphically represented as the longest vertical distance between the Lorenz curve, or the cumulative portion of the total income held below a certain income percentile, and the 45 degree line representing perfect equality. The Hoover index is typically used in applications related to socio- economic class (SES) and health. It is conceptually one of the simplest inequality indices used in econometrics. A better known inequality measure is the Gini coefficient which is also based on the Lorenz curve. == Computation == Let x_i be the income of the i-th person and \\\\bar{x} be the mean income. Then the Hoover index H is: H = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\frac{\\\\sum_i x_i - \\\\bar{x}}{\\\\sum_i x_i}. This value can also be computed using quantiles. For the formula, a notationThe notation using E and A follows the notation of a small calculation published by Lionnel Maugis: Inequality Measures in Mathematical Programming for the Air Traffic Flow Management Problem with En- Route Capacities (für IFORS 96), 1996 is used, where the amount N of quantiles only appears as upper border of summations. Thus, inequities can be computed for quantiles with different widths A. For example, E_i could be the income in the quantile #i and A_i could be the amount (absolute or relative) of earners in the quantile #i. E_\\\\text{total} then would be the sum of incomes of all N quantiles and A_\\\\text{total} would be the sum of the income earners in all N quantiles. Computation of the Robin Hood index H: : H = {\\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\left {\\\\frac{{E}_i}{{E}_\\\\text{total}}} - {\\\\frac{{A}_i}{{A}_\\\\text{total}}} \\\\right. For comparison,For an explanation of the comparison with Henri Theil's index see: Theil index here also the computation of the symmetrized Theil index T_s is given: : T_s = {\\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\ln{\\\\frac{{E}_i} \\\\left({\\\\frac{{E}_i}{{E}_\\\\text{total}}} - {\\\\frac{{A}_i}{{A}_\\\\text{total}}} \\\\right).

It draws on earlier blues songs and has inspired many subsequent versions, including hits by Ray Charles, Rufus and Carla, and James Brown. ==Earlier songs== Blues pianist Roosevelt Sykes (listed as \\"the Honey Dripper\\") recorded \\"Night Time Is the Right Time\\" in 1937.Decca Records 7324 Called \\"one of his 'hits' of the day\\", it is a moderate-tempo twelve-bar blues that features Sykes on vocal and piano. It has been suggested that it was \\"drawn from the old vaudeville tradition\\": In 1938, Big Bill Broonzy recorded the song with slightly different (and more suggestive) lyrics.Vocalion Records 4149 The same year, Roosevelt Sykes recorded a second version titled \\"Night Time Is the Right Time #2\\",Decca 7438 also with slightly different lyrics. These earliest recordings of \\"Night Time Is the Right Time\\" are credited to Roosevelt Sykes and Leroy Carr. Although Carr died in 1935 without any known recordings of the song, \\"Night Time Is The Right Time\\" bears considerable similarity to Carr's \\"When The Sun Goes Down\\". The latter was phenomenally popular song at this time, having been covered by the Ink Spots and also serving as a model for \\"Love In Vain\\" by Robert Johnson. ==Nappy Brown song== In 1957, Nappy Brown recorded the song as \\"The Right Time\\".Savoy 1525 Called \\"a highlight of Brown's early career\\", his version features additional lyrics with background singers answering his vocal lines.

Brown's song opens with Brown's version did not reach the national record charts, but was \\"borrowed by Ray Charles in short order\\". During his career, Brown recorded several versions of the song (sometimes varying the title). His original single lists the songwriter as \\"N.

According to Brown, \\"The difference between me and Ray Charles's ‘Night Time Is the Right Time'... is he had it up-tempo with Mary Ann and them behind him—the ladies [Charles' female backup singers, the Raelettes]. I had mine in a slow tempo with a gospel group behind me. That was my gospel group. But he got everything just like mine, note for note\\". Margie Hendrix with Charles' backup singers the Raelettes provided the accompaniment to Charles' vocals. The song became a hit in 1959, when it reached number five in the Billboard R&B; chart and number 95 in the pop chart. The song is included on the albums Ray Charles at Newport and The Genius Sings the Blues, and on the soundtrack of Ray. In the second season episode of The Cosby Show \\"Happy Anniversary\\", the Huxtable family lip- syncs to Ray Charles' version.

The system is manufactured by Raytheon Space and Airborne Systems at its facility in Goleta, California. The ALE-50 system consists of a launcher and launch controller installed on the aircraft (usually on a wing pylon), and one or more expendable towed decoys. Each decoy is delivered in a sealed canister and has a ten-year shelf life. When deployed, the decoy is towed behind the host aircraft, protecting the aircraft and its crew against RF-guided missiles by luring the missile toward the decoy and away from the intended target. In both flight tests and actual combat, the ALE-50 has successfully countered numerous live firings of both surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles. U.S. military pilots have nicknamed the decoy \\"Little Buddy\\". The ALE-50 was first deployed in 1995, but is also used on the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and the B-1B Lancer. The ALE-50 has also been integrated into the next-generation ALQ-184(V)9 ECM pod, creating an integrated threat-protection system that can be carried on a larger number of platforms. The ALE-50 expendable decoys’ estimated value is $22,000 each. The latest production run of 1,048 units will be delivering through October 2010.

In general, approaches of this type aim to \\"alter beliefs, attitudes, and behaviours...from negative to positive attitudes toward conflict as a basis for preventing violence\\" (Van Slyck, Stern and Elbedour, 1999, emphasis added).Van Slyck, M.R., Stern, M., and Elbedour, S.

San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers. There are various styles or approaches in conflict resolution training (ADR, Verbal Aikido, NVC) that can give the practitioner the means to accept the conflictual situation and orient it towards a peaceful resolution. As one peer mediation coordinator put it: \\"Conflict is very natural and normal, but you can't go through your entire life beating everybody up—you have to learn different ways to resolve conflict\\".Jeffries, R. Examining barriers to effective peace education reform. Contemporary Education, 71, 19-22. ===Democracy education=== Peace education programs centered on democracy education typically focus on the political processes associated with conflict, and postulate that with an increase in democratic participation the likelihood of societies resolving conflict through violence and war decreases. At the same time, \\"a democratic society needs the commitment of citizens who accept the inevitability of conflict as well as the necessity for tolerance\\" (U.S. Department of State, The Culture of Democracy, emphasis added).U.S. Department of State Bureau of International Information Programs. (n.d.). The culture of democracy. Retrieved January 13, 2003, from http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/whatsdem/whatdm6.htm Thus programs of this kind attempt to foster a conflict-positive orientation in the community by training students to view conflict as a platform for creativity and growth. Approaches of this type train participants in the skills of critical thinking, debate and coalition-building, and promote the values of freedom of speech, individuality, tolerance of diversity, compromise and conscientious objection. Their aim is to produce \\"responsible citizens\\" who will hold their governments accountable to the standards of peace, primarily through adversarial processes. Activities are structured to have students \\"assume the role of the citizen that chooses, makes decisions, takes positions, argues positions and respects the opinions of others\\":Quoted from CIVITAS BiH, a program of democracy and human rights education in primary, secondary and tertiary schools of Bosnia and Herzegovina. http://www.civitas.ba/nastavni_planovi/index.php skills that a multi-party democracy are based upon. Based on the assumption that democracy decreases the likelihood of violence and war, it is assumed that these are the same skills necessary for creating a culture of peace. === Justice education === Education for justice is the process of promoting the rule of law (RoL) through educational activities at all levels. Education for justice teaches the next generation about crime prevention, and to better understand and address problems that can undermine the rule of law. It promotes peace and encourages students to actively engage in their communities and future professions. Making the RoL and a culture of lawfulness a priority is not just about transmitting knowledge but also about values and behaviours that are modelled and enforced on a daily basis through what is called the ‘hidden curriculum. ‘The ‘hidden curriculum’ of the classroom and school transmits norms, values and beliefs to learners in ways other than formal teaching and learning processes and ensures learners develop the skills and know-how they need to engage in society as ethically responsible citizens. ===Human rights education=== Peace education programs centered on raising awareness of human rights typically focus at the level of policies that humanity ought to adopt in order to move closer to a peaceful global community. The aim is to engender a commitment among participants to a vision of structural peace in which all individual members of the human race can exercise their personal freedoms and be legally protected from violence, oppression and indignity. Approaches of this type familiarize participants with the international covenants and declarations of the United Nations system; train students to recognize violations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; and promote tolerance, solidarity, autonomy and self-affirmation at the individual and collective levels.Brabeck, K. (2001). Justification for and implementation of peace education. Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology, 7, 85-87. Human rights education \\"faces continual elaboration, a significant theory- practice gap and frequent challenge as to its validity\\".Swee-Hin Toh. 1997. \\"Education for Peace: Towards a Millennium of Well-Being\\". Paper for the Working Document of the International Conference on Culture of Peace and Governance (Maputo, Mozambique, 1–4 September 1997) In one practitioner's view: > \\"Human rights education does not work in communities fraught with conflict > unless it is part of a comprehensive approach... In fact, such education can > be counterproductive and lead to greater conflict if people become aware of > rights which are not realized. In this respect, human rights education can > increase the potential for conflict\\"Parlevliet, M. (n.d.). Quoted in Pitts, > D. (2002).

Retrieved January 12, > 2003, from http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itdhr/0302/ijde/pitts1.htm To prevent these outcomes, many such programs are now being combined with aspects of conflict resolution and democracy education schools of thought, along with training in nonviolent action.Kevin Kester. 2008. Developing peace education programs: Beyond ethnocentrism and violence. Peace Prints, 1(1), 37-64. ===Worldview transformation=== Some approaches to peace education start from insights gleaned from psychology which recognize the developmental nature of human psychosocial dispositions. Essentially, while conflict-promoting attitudes and behaviours are characteristic of earlier phases of human development, unity-promoting attitudes and behaviours emerge in later phases of healthy development. H.B. Danesh (2002a, 2002b, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008a, 2008b)Danesh, H. B. (2006). Towards an integrative theory of peace education. Journal of Peace Education, 3(1), 55–78. Danesh, H. B. (2007).

Peace and Conflict Studies, 11(2), 55–84. proposes an \\"Integrative Theory of Peace\\" in which peace is understood as a psychosocial, political, moral and spiritual reality. Peace education, he says, must focus on the healthy development and maturation of human consciousness through assisting people to examine and transform their worldviews. Worldviews are defined as the subconscious lens (acquired through cultural, family, historical, religious and societal influences) through which people perceive four key issues: 1) the nature of reality, 2) human nature, 3) the purpose of existence, 4) the principles governing appropriate human relationships. Surveying a mass of material, Danesh argues that the majority of people and societies in the world hold conflict-based worldviews, which express themselves in conflicted intrapersonal, interpersonal, intergroup, and international relationships. He subdivides conflict-based worldviews into two main categories which he correlates to phases of human development: the Survival-Based Worldview and the Identity-Based Worldview. It is through the acquisition of a more integrative, Unity-Based Worldview that human capacity to mitigate conflict, create unity in the context of diversity, and establish sustainable cultures of peace, is increased—be it in the home, at school, at work, or in the international community. ===Critical peace education=== Modern forms of peace education relate to new scholarly explorations and applications of techniques used in peace education internationally, in plural communities and with individuals. Critical Peace Education (Bajaj 2008, 2015; Bajaj & Hantzopoulos 2016; Trifonas & Wright 2013) is an emancipatory pursuit that seeks to link education to the goals and foci of social justice disrupting inequality through critical pedagogy (Freire 2003). Critical peace education addresses the critique that peace education is imperial and impository mimicking the 'interventionism' of Western peacebuilding by foregrounding local practices and narratives into peace education (Salomon 2004; MacGinty & Richmond 2007; Golding 2017). The project of critical peace education includes conceiving of education as a space of transformation where students and teachers become change agents that recognise past and present experiences of inequity and bias and where schools become strategic sites for fostering emancipatory change.Salomon, G. (2004). \\"Comment: what is peace education?\\" Journal of Peace Education, 1:1, 123-127.Mac Ginty, R. & Richmond, O.

(2013). \\"Introduction,\\" in Critical Peace Education: Difficult Dialogues. New York: Springer, (xiii-xx). ===Yogic peace education=== Where Critical Peace Education is emancipatory, seeking to foster full humanity in society for everyone, yogic peace education (Standish & Joyce 2017)Standish, K. & Joyce, J (2017). (Forthcoming) Yogic Peace Education: Theory and Practice. Jefferson: McFarland and Company. is concerned with transforming personal (as opposed to interpersonal, structural or societal/cultural) violence. In yogic peace education, techniques from yogic science are utilized to alter the physical, mental and spiritual instrument of humanity (the self) to address violence that comes from within. Contemporary peace education (similar to all peace education) relate to specific forms of violence (and their transformation) and similar to teaching human rights and conflict resolution in schools critical peace education and yogic peace education are complementary curricula that seek to foster positive peace and decrease violence in society. == Criticism == Toh Swee-Hin (1997) observes that each of the various streams of peace education \\"inevitably have their own dynamics and 'autonomy' in terms of theory and practice\\". \\"Salomon (2002) has described how the challenges, goals, and methods of peace education differ substantially between areas characterized by intractable conflict, interethnic tension, or relative tranquility\\".Salomon, G.

An essential component of this integrated theory must also be the recognition that a culture of peace can only result from an authentic process of transformation, both individual and collective.\\"Clarke-Habibi, Sara.

Owing to a leaflet distribution campaign in 1935, he was denounced. Before the court Fritz frankly admitted his guilt. From 29 August 1935 he found himself serving a three-year sentence at Landsberg prison in \\"protective custody\\" for \\"conspiracy to commit high treason\\". During his three-year solitary confinement (then the maximum penalty for youths), he was constantly in the penal company. On 25 January 1939 he was transferred to Buchenwald concentration camp. There he met his brother Josef, who was likewise interned at Buchenwald. On 14 March 1942 came his transfer to Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp. There he fell deeply in love for the first time, with a Jewish internee, who probably later perished. Sometime after 17 December 1943 Fritz Pröll and his brother were brought back to Buchenwald concentration camp. While the resistance managed to keep his brother back in Buchenwald, Fritz was shifted on 1 November 1944 to the notorious Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp near Nordhausen in the Harz. In underground shelters where the water reached the walls, the daylight never came in, and the crashing and dust from constant explosions made life hell, worked tens of thousands from all over Europe in drudgery to produce Hitler's \\"wonder weapons\\", the V1 and V2. Wernher von Braun's career began here, before he became a rocket specialist in the United States after the war. There, Pröll also met the resistance fighters Albert Kuntz, Georg Thomas, Ludwig Szymczak, Otto Runki, Christian Behan, Heinz Schneider, the social democrat August Kroneberg, the Czechoslovakian doctor and Communist Dr. Jan Čespiva, the Soviet flight lieutenant Yelovoy from Odessa who was at Dora under the false name Simeon Grinko, and also Polish, French, and Dutch resistance fighters. ==Sabotage and terror in the camps== The unarmed, half-starved prisoners managed to thwart Hitler's wonder weapon plan. In one third of the rockets sent off in 1944, the mechanisms failed. Out of all the 10,800 V2 rockets that were deployed, more than half blew up while still aloft. The SS Oberscharführer Sander and Colonel Eichhorn were specially deployed to arrest the suspected sabotage group. The camp was covered with a system of spies. When on 18 November 1944 the Wehrmacht sent two whole trainloads of rockets back marked \\"Unusable – Sabotage\\", the fascist terror struck hard. Dozens of prisoners who were suspected of taking part in the sabotage were tortured and hanged. Onto beams between two cranes ropes with nooses were fastened, and twelve, fifteen, twenty people were hanged on them at once, strangled once the cranes lifted them up high. Fritz Pröll busied himself during his long detention with medicine, thus enabling him to help save many people's lives at Dora. Now, however, he had to use his knowledge so that there would be no danger of his betraying his fellow fighters under torture. In the end, on 22 November 1944, he took his own life with a poison syringe. Fritz Pröll was only 29 years old; he had spent 9½ of those years locked up in prisons and concentration camps. ==Since the war== A school class from the Paul-Klee- Gymnasium in Gersthofen did an Internet project in 2001 on, among other things, the Pröll family's life. They ran into unforeseen difficulties. The mayor refused to allow the students access to the archives. Access could only be gained by court order. One of the Pröll family has sought to change the street name Wernher von Braun Straße in Gersthofen to Fritz Pröll Straße, but it has not come about yet. The Town of Gersthofen justified its refusal to change the name arguing that there was a longstanding policy of naming streets in any particular part of town thematically. Following this policy, and to redress any oversight, the streets in a new neighbourhood are to be named after resistance fighters. == Literature == * Gernot Römer: Für die Vergessenen : KZ-Aussenlager in Schwaben; Schwaben in Konzentrationslagern. - Augsburg : Presse-Dr., 1984 == External links == *School project about Fritz Pröll *School project thwarted at every turn (see above) *\\"Anna, ich hab Angst um dich\\", a film by Josef Pröll, Junior and Wolfgang Kucera about Anna Pröll, Fritz Pröll's sister-in-law, Category:1915 births Category:1944 deaths Category:People from Augsburg Category:German civilians killed in World War II Category:People condemned by Nazi courts Category:People who died in Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp Category:Resistance members who died in Nazi concentration camps Category:People from the Harz Category:Suicides by poison Category:Drug-related suicides in Germany ","title":"Fritz Pröll"},{"id":"3247748","text":"Triadelphia may refer to: * Triadelphia, Ohio, an unincorporated community * Triadelphia, West Virginia * Triadelphia Reservoir - Maryland * Triadelphia Middle School ","title":"Triadelphia"},{"id":"3247752","text":"Tri-Lakes can refer to a place in the United States: * Tri-Lakes, Colorado * Tri-Lakes, Indiana ","title":"Tri-Lakes"},{"id":"3247759","text":"Tribbey may refer to: *Tribbey, Kentucky, a community in Perry County, Kentucky *Tribbey, Oklahoma, a community in Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma ","title":"Tribbey"},{"id":"3247766","text":"OTN may refer to: *OTN1, a Canadian television channel *Ontario Telemedicine Network, a not-for-profit, Ontario funded Telemedicine organization *Open Transport Network, a specific ring-based telecommunication network architecture *Optical Transport Network, a telecommunication network standards framework for optical networks *Oracle Technology Network, the official online/offline community for Oracle technical professionals *Ed-Air Airport - Oaktown, Indiana, United States (IATA code: OTN) *Our Teen Network, a teen social network website ","title":"OTN"},{"id":"3247768","text":"Dover Athletic in 2010 Maidenhead United Football Club is a semi- professional football club based in Maidenhead, Berkshire, England.

Some dates of the tour also include local openers. == References == == External links == * *The Decibel Magazine Tour website Category:Music magazines published in the United States Category:Monthly magazines published in the United States Category:Heavy metal publications Category:Magazines established in 2004 Category:Magazines published in Philadelphia Category:Periodicals with audio content Category:2004 establishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"Decibel (magazine)"},{"id":"3247790","text":"The World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations is a working party (WP.29) of the Sustainable Transport Division of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). Its responsibility is to manage the multilateral Agreements signed in 1958, 1997 and 1998 concerning the technical prescriptions for the construction, approval of wheeled vehicles as well as their Periodic Technical Inspection and, to operate within the framework of these three Agreements to develop and amend UN Regulations, UN Global Technical Regulations and UN Rules, kind of vehicle regulation. WP.29 was established in June 1952 as the \\"Working Party of experts on technical requirement of vehicles\\", while its current name was adopted in 2000. At its inception, WP.29 had a broader european scope. Since 2000, the global scope of this forum was recognized given the active participation of Countries in all continents. The forum works on regulations covering vehicle safety, environmental protection, energy efficiency and theft-resistance. This work affects de facto vehicle design and facilitates international trade. ==1958 Agreement== The core of the Forum's work is based around the \\"1958 Agreement\\", formally titled \\"Agreement concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or be used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions\\" (E/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.2, amended on 16 October 1995). This forms a legal framework wherein participating countries (contracting parties) agree on a common set of technical prescriptions and protocols for type approval of vehicles and components. These were formerly called \\"UNECE Regulations\\" or, less formally, \\"ECE Regulations\\" in reference to the Economic Commission for Europe. However, since many non-European countries are now contracting parties to the 1958 Agreement, the regulations are officially entitled \\"UN Regulations\\".The End of the 'ECE' Era, Driving Vision News, 29 August 2011 According to the mutual recognition principle set in the Agreement, each Contracting Party's Type Approvals are recognised by all other Contracting Parties. ===Participating countries=== 350px The first signatories to the 1958 Agreement include Italy (March 28), Netherlands (March 30), Germany (June 19), France (June 26), Hungary (June 30), Sweden and Belgium. Originally, the agreement allowed participation of ECE member countries only, but in 1995 the agreement was revised to allow non-ECE members to participate. Current participants include European Union and its member countries, as well non-EU UNECE members such as Norway, Russia, Ukraine, Croatia, Serbia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Azerbaijan and Tunisia, and even remote territories such as South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia. , the participants to the 1958 Agreement, with their UN country code, were: { class =\\" sortable\\" !UN Code  Country  Effective date  Notes -  1    -  2    -  3    -  4    -  5    -  6    -  7    -  8   (formerly Czechoslovakia) -  9    -  10    (formerly Yugoslavia) -  11    -  12    -  13    -  14    -  15    (expired in 1999) -  16    -  17    -  18    -  19    -  20    -  21    -  22    -  23    -  24    -  25    -  26    -  27    -  28    -  29    -  31    -  32    -  34    -  35    -  36    -  37    -  39    -  40    -  42    -  43    -  45    -  46    -  47    -  48    -  49    -  50    -  51    -  52    -  53    -  54    -  56    -  57    -  58    -  60    -  62    } Most countries, even if not formally participating in the 1958 agreement, recognise the UN Regulations and either mirror the UN Regulations' content in their own national requirements, or permit the import, registration, and use of UN type- approved vehicles, or both. The United States and Canada (apart from Lighting Regulations) are the two significant exceptions; the UN Regulations are generally not recognised and UN-compliant vehicles and equipment are not authorised for import, sale, or use in the two regions, unless they are tested to be compliant with the region's car safety laws, or for limited non driving use (e.g. car show displays). ===Type approval=== Two types of EU markings: top - according to UN regulations, bottom - according to EC directives The 1958 Agreement operates on the principles of type approval and reciprocal recognition. Any country that accedes to the 1958 Agreement has authority to test and approve any manufacturer's design of a regulated product, regardless of the country in which that component was produced. Each individual design from each individual manufacturer is counted as one individual type. Once any acceding country grants a type approval, every other acceding country is obliged to honor that type approval and regard that vehicle or item of motor vehicle equipment as legal for import, sale and use. Items type-approved according to a UN Regulation are marked with an E and a number, within a circle. The number indicates which country approved the item, and other surrounding letters and digits indicate the precise version of the regulation met and the type approval number, respectively. Although all countries' type approvals are legally equivalent, there are real and perceived differences in the rigour with which the regulations and protocols are applied by different national type approval authorities. Some countries have their own national standards for granting type approvals, which may be more stringent than called for by the UN regulations themselves. Within the auto parts industry, a German (E1) type approval, for example, is regarded as a measure of insurance against suspicion of poor quality or an undeserved type approval. ===UN Regulations=== , there are 135 UN Regulations appended to the 1958 Agreement; most regulations cover a single vehicle component or technology. A partial list of current regulations applying to passenger cars follows (different regulations may apply to heavy vehicles, motorcycles, etc.) ====General lighting==== * R3 — Retroreflecting devices * R4 — Illumination of rear registration plates * R6 — Direction indicators * R7 — Front and rear position lamps, stop lamps and end-outline marker lamps * R19 — Front fog lamps * R23 — Reversing lights * R37 — Filament lamps (bulbs) (See: Automotive lamp types) * R38 — Rear fog lamps * R48 — Installation of lighting and light-signalling devices * R77 — Parking lamps * R87 — Daytime running lamps * R91 — Side marker lamps * R112 — Headlamp Asymmetric * R119 — Cornering lamps * R123 — AFS lamps * R128 — LED light sources ==== Headlamps ==== * R1 — Headlamps emitting an asymmetrical passing beam and/or a driving beam, equipped with R2 or HS1 bulbs (superseded by R112, but still valid for existing approvals) * R5 — Sealed Beam headlamps emitting an asymmetrical passing beam and/or a driving beam * R8 — Headlamps equipped with replaceable single-filament tungsten-halogen bulbs (superseded by R112, but still valid for existing approvals) * R20 — Headlamps emitting an asymmetrical passing beam and/or a driving beam and equipped with halogen double-filament H4 bulbs (superseded by R112, but still valid for existing approvals) * R31 — Halogen sealed beam headlamps emitting an asymmetrical passing beam and/or a driving beam * R45 — Headlamp cleaners * R98 — Headlamps equipped with gas-discharge light sources * R99 — Gas-discharge light sources for use in approved gas-discharge lamp units of power-driven vehicles (See: Automotive lamp types) * R112 — Headlamps emitting an asymmetrical passing beam and/or a driving beam and equipped with filament bulbs * R113 — Headlamps emitting a symmetrical passing beam and/or a driving beam and equipped with filament bulbs ==== Instrumentation/controls ==== * R35 — arrangement of foot controls * R39 — speedometer equipment * R46 — rear-view mirrors * R79 — steering equipment ==== Crashworthiness ==== * R11 — door latches and door retention components * R13-H — braking (passenger cars) * R13 — braking (trucks and busses) * R14 — safety belt anchorages * R16 — safety belts and restraint systems * R17 — seats, seat anchorages, head restraints * R27 — advance-warning triangles * R42 — front and rear protective devices (bumpers, etc.) * R43 — safety glazing materials and their installation on vehicles * R94 — protection of the occupants in the event of a frontal collision * R95 — protection of the occupants in the event of a lateral collision * R116 — protection of motor vehicles against unauthorized use * R129 — enhanced child restraint systems (ECRS) ==== Environmental compatibility ==== * R10 — electromagnetic compatibility * R15 — emissions and fuel consumption (superseded by R83, R84 and R101) * R24 — engine power measurement, smoke emissions, engine type approval * R51 — noise emissions * R68 — measurement of the maximum speed * R83 — emission of pollutants according to engine fuel requirements * R84 — measurement of fuel consumption * R85 — electric drive trains — measurement of the net power and the maximum 30 minutes power of electric drive trains * R100 — approval of battery electric vehicles with regard to specific requirements for the construction, Functional Safety and hydrogen emission. * R101 — measurement of the emission of carbon dioxide and fuel consumption * R117 — rolling sound emissions of tyres ==== Tyres & wheels ==== * R30 — Tyres for passenger cars and their trailers * R54 — Tyres for commercial vehicles and their trailers * R64 — Temporary use spare unit, run flat tyres, run flat-system and tyre pressure monitoring * R75 — Tyres for motorcycles/mopeds * R88 — Retroreflective tyres for two-wheeled vehicles * R106 — Tyres for agricultural vehicles * R108 — Retreaded tyres for passenger cars and their trailers * R109 — Retreaded tyres for commercial vehicles and their trailers * R124 — Replacement wheels for passenger cars ====Automated/autonomous and connected vehicle regulations ==== * R155 — cyber security * R156 — software updateshttps://www.interregs.com/articles/spotlight/new-un-ece-regulations-on- cyber-security-and-software-updates-adopted-000220. * R157 — Automated Lane Keeping Systems ==North America== The most notable non-signatory to the 1958 Agreement is the United States, which has its own Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards and does not recognise UN type approvals. However, both the United States and Canada are parties to the 1998 Agreement. UN-specification vehicles and components which do not also comply with the US regulations therefore cannot be imported to the US without extensive modifications. Canada has its own Canada Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, broadly similar to the US FMVSS, but Canada does also accept UN-compliant headlamps and bumpers. The impending Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between Canada and the European Union could see Canada recognise more UN Regulations as acceptable alternatives to the Canadian regulations. Canada currently applies 14 of the 17 ECE main standards as allowable alternatives - the exceptions at this point relate to motorcycle controls and displays, motorcycle mirrors, and electronic stability control for passenger cars. These three remaining groups will be allowed in Canada by the time the ratification of the trade deal occurs. ===Self-certification=== Rather than a UN-style system of type approvals, the US and Canadian auto safety regulations operate on the principle of self- certification, wherein the manufacturer or importer of a vehicle or item of motor vehicle equipment certifies—i.e., asserts and promises—that the vehicle or equipment complies with all applicable federal or Canada Motor Vehicle Safety, bumper and antitheft standards.https://www.hsdl.org/?view&did;=751039 No prior verification is required by a governmental agency or authorised testing entity before the vehicle or equipment can be imported, sold, or used. If reason develops to believe the certification was false or improper — i.e., that the vehicle or equipment does not in fact comply — then authorities may conduct tests and, if a noncompliance is found, order a recall and/or other corrective and/or punitive measures. Vehicle and equipment makers are permitted to appeal such penalties, but this is a difficult direction. Non- compliances found that are arguably without effect to highway safety may be petitioned to skip recall (remedy and notification) requirements for vehicles already produced. ==Regulatory differences== A comparison of European (top) and US (bottom) headlamp configuration on similar-year Citroën DS cars Historically, one of the most conspicuous differences between UN and US regulations was the design and performance of headlamps. The Citroën DS shown here illustrates the large differences in headlamps during the 1940-1983 era when US regulations required sealed beam headlamps, which were prohibited in many European countries. A similar approach was evident with the US mandatory side marker lights. It is not currently possible to produce a single car design that fully meets both UN and US requirements, but it is growing easier as technology, and both sets of regulations, evolve. Given the size of the US vehicle market, and differing marketing strategies in North America as opposed to the rest of the world, many manufacturers produce vehicles in four versions: North American, UNECE right-hand drive (RHD), UNECE left-hand-drive (LHD), and Rest of the World (for non-regulated countries or countries with poor market fuel quality. ==1998 Agreement== The \\"Agreement concerning the Establishing of Global Technical Regulations for Wheeled Vehicles, Equipment and Parts which can be fitted and/or be used on Wheeled Vehicles\\", or 1998 Agreement, is a subsequent agreement. Following its mission to harmonize vehicle regulations, the UNECE solved the main issues (Administrative Provisions for Type approval opposed to self-certification and mutual recognition of Type Approvals) preventing non-signatory Countries to the 1958 Agreement to fully participate to its activities. The 1998 Agreement is born to produce meta regulations called Global Technical Regulations without administrative procedures for type approval and so, without the principle of mutual recognition of Type Approvals. The 1998 Agreement stipulates that Contracting Parties will establish, by consensus vote, United Nations Global Technical Regulations (UN GTRs) in a UN Global Registry. The UN GTRs contain globally harmonized performance requirements and test procedures. Each UN GTR contains extensive notes on its development. The text includes a record of the technical rationale, the research sources used, cost and benefit considerations, and references to data consulted. The Contracting Parties use their nationally established rulemaking processes when transposing UN GTRs into their national legislation. The 1998 Agreement currently has 33 Contracting Parties and 14 UN GTRs that have been established into the UN Global Registry. Manufacturers and suppliers cannot use directly the UN GTRs as these are intended to serve the Countries and require transposition in national or regional law. ==2013 Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (proposed)== As part of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations, the issues of divergent standards in automobile regulatory structure are being investigated. TTIP negotiators are seeking to identify ways to narrow the regulatory differences, potentially reducing costs and spurring additional trade in vehicles. ==OICA== Organisation Internationale des Constructeurs d'Automobiles (OICA) hosts on its web site the working documents from various United Nations expert groups including World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations. ==See also== *Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedures *Vehicle regulation *Car safety *National Highway Traffic Safety Administration *Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards *Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108 *Automotive lighting *Headlamps *Assured clear distance ahead ==References== ==External links== *UN Regulations *World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations (WP.29) – How It Works, How to Join It *World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations FAQ Category:Automotive standards Category:Automotive safety Category:United Nations Economic Commission for Europe ","title":"World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations"},{"id":"3247793","text":"Helen Boaden (born 1 March 1956) is a British former broadcasting executive who spent more than 30 years working for the BBC, including as Director of Radio between February 2013 and September 2016.Tom Harper \\"BBC news head Helen Boaden moved to radio as ex-minister becomes strategy chief\\", London Evening Standard, 14 February 2013 Boaden is a Fellow of The Radio Academy,The Radio Academy \\"Fellows\\" and in May 2019 she joined the board of the UK Statistics Authority for a period of three years.https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/about-the-authority/meet-the- board/helen-boaden/ ==Early life== Boaden was born on 1 March 1956 in Colchester in Essex.

She says that she came \\"from one of those families where there was quite a lot of shouting and plates whizzing through the air\\".My Best Teacher - Interview with Helen Boaden Publisher: Times Educational Supplement. Published 20 April 2001. Updated 11 May 2008. Retrieved 30 January 2013. Boaden says that she found school \\"a great relief from home life because it was calm and ordered\\". She was educated at Rushmere junior school and Northgate Grammar School (now Northgate High School) in the large county town of Ipswich in Suffolk, and at Cedars Grammar School (now Cedars Upper School) in the town of Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire, followed by the University of Sussex, where she gained a BA Honours in English literature, and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1999, where she gained an MBA.Helen Boaden Publisher: The Media Briefing.Com. Retrieved 30 January 2013. ==Life and career== Boaden began her career in 1978 as a care assistant with disturbed adolescents in the London Borough of Hackney. The following year, she became a journalist with the New York City radio station WBAI. On returning to the UK, she took a course in radio journalism at the London College of Printing (now the London College of Communication). After work at Radio Tees and Radio Aire, Boaden joined the BBC in 1983 as a news producer with Radio Leeds. From there, she joined BBC Radio 4 as a reporter on the File on 4 series, then as its editor from 1991. She worked from the BBC in Manchester as a presenter for Woman's Hour and later presented other documentaries for Radio 4, and for the Brass Tacks political programme on BBC 2. In 1997, Boaden became the BBC's Head of Business Programmes, then in 1998 Head of BBC Current Affairs – the first woman to hold this position. She was Controller of BBC Radio 4 from March 2000 until 20 September 2004, superseded by Mark Damazer. She became Controller of BBC7 in 2002, when the station was launched. In 2004, she succeeded Richard Sambrook as Director of BBC News. Boaden received criticism following the July 7 terror attacks in London when she issued a memo instructing BBC staff not to refer to the perpetrators as terrorists, arguing that the term \\"can be a barrier rather than aid to understanding\\". Former BBC reporter Martin Bell was one of those who condemned the memo, accusing the BBC of being \\"overcautious\\" and noting that the attackers seemed to meet the definition of terrorists. Writing in The Spectator, Michael Vestey suggested \\"it's almost as if the BBC is afraid of offending suicide bombers in the Muslim world\\". In December 2012, Boaden was asked to temporarily step down from her position as the Director of BBC News while the BBC awaited the results of Operation Yewtree, a wide-ranging police investigation of sexual abuse, primarily of children, by former BBC presenter Jimmy Savile (who died in 2011) and others. A second and parallel investigation, launched by the BBC into possible management failings at the corporation, called the 'Pollard Report' after the lead investigator, Nick Pollard (a former senior executive at Sky News), criticised the BBC and several executive members for continuing with plans to celebrate Savile's life, despite apparently having received advance information that Savile was being investigated for multiple cases of sexual abuse. The report explicitly criticised Boaden for having handled the matter too casually. Boaden returned to her position later the same month. In February 2013, Boaden was appointed director of radio by incoming director-general Tony Hall. This was widely seen as a demotion. After a period with Fran Unsworth in her former post, James Harding became Director of BBC News later in 2013.Josh Halliday \\"James Harding named BBC News chief\\", guardian.co.uk, 16 April 2013 Boaden resigned from the BBC in September 2016. She is a Fellow of The Radio Academy. In May 2019, she joined the board of the UK Statistics Authority for a period of three years. ==Awards== Boaden has won Sony Awards for a programme on AIDS in Africa, and bullying in Feltham Young Offenders Institution when at File on 4. Radio 4 won the Gold Award for Station of the Year in 2003 and 2004. In 1990, Boaden won awards from the Industrial Society for her work on safety standards in the oil industry. She has honorary degrees from Suffolk College, the University of Sussex, and the University of York. She is on the committee of the Sony Radio Academy. In February 2013, she was assessed as one of the 100 most powerful women in the United Kingdom by Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4. ==Personal life== Boaden is married and owns a home in Scarborough.

Mário de Miranda Quintana (July 30, 1906 – May 5, 1994) was a Brazilian writer and translator. He became known as the poet of \\"simple things\\", and his style is marked by irony, profundity and technical perfection. The main themes of his poetry include death, the lost childhood and time. Quintana also worked as a journalist and translated into Portuguese innumerable books, such as Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf. ==Biography== The son of Celso de Oliveira Quintana de Miranda and Virginia, Mário Quintana was born in Alegrete, where he received his early education. He moved to Porto Alegre in 1919 to study at the Military School, and there he published his first works. He started working for Editora Globo, while it was still a state-owned publishing house. Considered the \\"poet of simple things\\" with a style marked by irony, depth, and technical perfection, he worked as a journalist for most of his life. He translated over one hundred and thirty books of world literature, including in Search of Lost Time by Marcel Proust, Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, and Words and Blood, by Giovanni Papini.Susana Gonçalves, Markus A. Carpenter Diversity, Intercultural Encounters, and Education 2012 – Page 215 \\"Obviously, poetry and art are the privileged territories for this game of reversibilities where the ambient opens up, as the Brazilian poet Mário Quintana says, \\"poetry is not a flight from reality, but a flight to reality.\\" Only this flight \\"to reality\\" ... In 1940, he released his first book of poetry, The Windmills Street, beginning his career as a poet, writer and children's author. In 1953, Quintana worked at the newspaper Correio do Povo as a columnist of a subsection on culture, which was published every Saturday, and left the newspaper in 1977. In 1966, to commemorate his sixty years of age, he published \\"Poetics Anthology\\", with sixty poems, organized by Rubem Braga and Paulo Mendes Campos, and for this reason the poet was aclaimed by the Brazilian Academy of Letters by Meyer and Manuel Augusto Bandeira, who recited his own poem \\"Quintanares\\", in honor of his fellow gaucho. In the same year he won the Brazilian Union of Writer's Fernando Chinaglia Prize for best book of the year. In 1976, after turning seventy years old, Quintana was awarded from the state of Rio Grande do Sul government the Medal Negrinho do Pastoreio. In 1980, for his body of work, Quintana was awarded the Machado de Assis prize from the Brazilian Academy of Letters. Mario Quintana never married nor had children. Solitary, he lived most of his life in hotels: from 1968 to 1980 he resided at the Hotel Majestic, in the historic center of Porto Alegre, from where he was evicted when financial problems, due to the temporary closing of Correio do Povo, left him without pay. At the time, the sports commentator and former player of the Brazilian national soccer team Paulo Roberto Falcão gave him a room at the Hotel Royal, of his property. To a friend who found the room too small, Quintana said, \\"I live in myself. Never mind that the room is small. It's good, so I have fewer places to lose my stuff.\\" The poet tried three times for a chair at the Brazilian Academy of Letters, but in none of the occasions he was elected, falling short of twenty votes required to qualify. Even with the promise of unanimimous approval, the poet refused to apply a fourth time. He died in Porto Alegre, aged 87. ==Works== * A Rua dos Cataventos, 1940 * Canções, 1946 * Sapato Florido, 1948 * O Aprendiz de Feiticeiro, 1950 * Espelho Mágico, 1951 * Inéditos e Esparsos, 1953 * Poesias, 1962 * Caderno H, 1973 * Apontamentos de História Sobrenatural, 1976 * Quintanares, 1976 * A Vaca e o Hipogrifo, 1977 * Esconderijos do Tempo, 1980 * Baú de Espantos, 1986 * Preparativos de Viagem, 1987 * Da Preguiça como Método de Trabalho, 1987 * Porta Giratória, 1988 * A Cor do Invisível, 1989 * Velório Sem Defunto, 1990 * Água, 2001 ==References== ==External links== * Mario Quintana – A Life in Poems < Eyes On Brazil > Category:1906 births Category:1994 deaths Category:People from Alegrete Category:Culture in Rio Grande do Sul Category:20th-century Brazilian poets Category:Brazilian male poets Category:Translators to Portuguese Category:20th-century translators Category:20th-century Brazilian male writers ","title":"Mário Quintana"},{"id":"3247813","text":"Troutman is a surname.

The exact name of the list varies by league; it is known as \\"injured reserve\\" in the National Football League (NFL) and National Hockey League (NHL), the \\"injured list\\" in the Canadian Football League (CFL), and the injured list (historically known as the \\"disabled list\\") in Major League Baseball (MLB). The National Basketball Association (NBA) does not have a direct analog to an injured reserve list, instead using a more general-purpose \\"inactive list\\" that does not require a player to be injured. It is used because the rules of these leagues allow for only a certain numbers of players on each team's roster. Designating a player as \\"Injured/Reserve\\" frees up a roster spot, enabling the team to add a new replacement player during the injured athlete's convalescence. ==NHL rules== A player may be placed on injured reserve if he is unable to participate due to illness or injury, provided that the player had passed the club's initial physical examination at the start of the season. To qualify for the IR due to injury, that injury must be sufficient (in the opinion of the team's medical staff) to render the player unable to participate for the seven days following that injury. Once placed on IR, the team may then replace the player on their roster. The player on IR may not return to active play for seven days, although they may participate in non-competitive events such as practice, meetings, etc. ==NFL rules== A team may place a player on injured reserve (reserve/injured list) who is \\"not immediately available for participation with a club\\". Generally, these players may not practice or return to the active roster for the rest of the season (including postseason games or the Pro Bowl) in which they are placed on injured reserve but are allowed to be with the team.2009 NFL Record and Fact Book, p. 32 Starting in 2012, the NFL and the NFLPA reached an agreement allowing one player placed on injured reserve to be brought back to the active roster. Provided that the player was on the final 53-man preseason roster (a rule exempted for the 2012 season), and that the injury is deemed to keep this player unable to practice or play football for an estimated six weeks, the player may be allowed to practice after Week 6, and be activated to play after Week 8.http://wcfcourier.com/sports/football/nfl-changes-rule-for- players-on-ir/article_19dcb07c-f329-11e1-ba45-0019bb2963f4.html In 2017, the rule was changed to allow up to two players to return from injured reserve after Week 8. In 2018, the rule was slightly modified due to timing of team bye weeks so players are only eligible to return after their team has played eight games instead of after eight weeks. In 2020, the number of players eligible to return to each team in a season increased to three. Teams may also place a player on injured reserve with a minor injury designation, but the team must release the player once he is healthy. During the preseason, the league also allows players with long-term, but not season-ending, injuries to be placed into one of three designations: physically unable to perform (PUP), for injuries sustained during the previous season or during offseason training activities (a player who passes their physical at the beginning of training camp and practices is physically able to participate and is thus ineligible for the PUP list), reserve/non-football injury (NFI), for injuries sustained outside of team or league activities (despite the name, this includes lingering injuries from college football play, should an injured player be drafted and join the team), or reserve/non-football illness (NFI), for severe illnesses sustained by players unrelated to football. Players on the PUP list can be moved to the active roster after week 6 of the regular season or placed on injured reserve. , players on the NFI lists can begin practicing after week 6 but cannot be activated until their team has played eight games. When a player from the NFI lists begins practicing, a three-week window starts in which they are eligible to be moved to the active roster. If the player is not activated at the conclusion of the three-week window, they must remain on the NFI list for the rest of the season. During the regular season, players on the PUP list and injured reserve do not count against the league's 53-man roster maximum, but do count against the 90-man roster limit. ==NBA rules== Due to abuses in the use of the injured reserve list, where some teams found it convenient to use the IR to stash players without independent medical oversight, the injured reserve has been renamed the Inactive List with the last collective bargaining agreement. Starting in the , players can enter the inactive list one hour before tip-off for as little as one game. The inactive list has a minimum of one player and a maximum of three, subject to hardship rules when a team with three injured players already on its inactive list has a fourth player injured. Players sent to the NBA G League will continue to count on a team's inactive list. ==WNBA rules== Unlike its parent league, the WNBA has no injury list as of the 2019 season. This notably affected the Seattle Storm going into that season, when reigning league MVP Breanna Stewart tore her right Achilles in the 2019 EuroLeague Women final. Because of the lack of an injured list, the Storm suspended Stewart without pay to free up a roster spot. (The WNBA would later make Stewart a paid league ambassador during her rehabilitation.) The league had an injury list when it began play in 1997; players placed on this list were required to sit out at least three games. In 2006, the league changed to an inactive list of up to two players, but it was eliminated after the 2008 season, when rosters were reduced to 11. WNBA rosters now consist of 12 players. ==MLB rules== There are four types of injured reserve lists in Major League Baseball. :Up to 7 Games: The Paternity and Bereavement Lists in MLB are designed for family situations. A player on Bereavement List for the health of another family member may miss 3-7 games, while Paternity List players for birth of a child allows a player up to three games missed. :7 Days: When a player is placed in concussion protocol, players will be assigned to the seven-day IL to prevent long-term brain damage. If a player is not activated by the seventh day, he is moved to the regular IL. :10 Days: Depending on severity and/or recovery time, a player is placed on the ten-day IL. Players may attend games and stay with the team, and leave the team for minor league rehabilitation assignments if necessary. The player is removed from the active roster. :60 Days: More severe injuries will result in a player being placed on the 60-day IL. The player will not be listed on any 40-man roster, allowing an additional player to be available. ==References== Category:Sports terminology Category:Sports injuries ","title":"Injured reserve list"},{"id":"3247841","text":"Events from the year 2006 in Ireland. ==Incumbents== * President: Mary McAleese * Taoiseach: Bertie Ahern (FF) * Tánaiste: ** Mary Harney (PD) (until 13 September 2006) ** Michael McDowell (PD) (from 13 September 2006) * Minister for Finance: Brian Cowen (FF) * Chief Justice: John L.

Roger Waters repeatedly plays the B on the 16th fret of the G-string by varying the lower note from D to F# on the D string. Unlike many older beat and pop songs, the guitar rarely plays chords, and most unusually for Western music, Wright provides an organ solo in the F# Phrygian dominant scale with a natural sixth instead of its typical flatted counterpart. The song ends with a simple E mixolydian-based waltz with wordless vocal harmonies of Wright and Barrett. Barrett originally wrote the song around verses from Hilaire Belloc's Cautionary Tales, in which a series of naughty children, including Matilda, receive their (often gruesome) comeuppance.

Several of Lauryssens's non-fiction books have been serialised in The Mail on Sunday. Lauryssens has faced criticism over his depiction of persons such as Salvador Dalí and Julien Schoenaerts. His 2007 book Dalí and I has been met with criticism from the Salvador Dali Foundation over claims about the artist's sex life and that Dalí knowingly participated in the production of fake artworks, which Lauryssens sold for him. The Foundation stated that these claims were made to promote the book and a prospective film that would have starred Cillian Murphy and Al Pacino as Lauryssens and Dalí, respectively. Filming on the adaptation was halted due to a dispute between the Foundation and the movie's director, as the Foundation held the rights to Dali's name. A lawsuit was levied by Matthias Schoenaerts and his mother Dominique Wiche against Lauryssens and the publisher of his biography on Schoenaerts's father Julien Schoenaerts, Manteau, over claims of misrepresentation. In regards to the lawsuit Lauryssens acknowledged that he used artistic license when writing the biography and that it contained untruths and misinformation. The judge ruled that the book must contain a sticker that acknowledged the misinformation, as Lauryssens stated in the book that it was truthful, and that they may not use Matthias Schoenaerts's name or false claims that Julien Scheoenaerts was an exhibitionist in interviews or publicity for the book. In 2019 concerns were raised by Doorbraak that Lauryssens had plagiarized content for his 2019 book Mijn Herinneringen aan Jef Geeraerts, a biography on Belgian writer Jef Geeraerts. Doorbraak reported that Pandora Publishing had made Lauryssens re-write portions of the book twice due to \\"copying memories of Jeroen Brouwers, Julien Weverbergh and Jef Geeraerts himself\\".

Instrumental rationality recognizes means that \\"work\\" efficiently to achieve ends. Value rationality recognizes ends that are \\"right,\\" legitimate in themselves. These two ways of reasoning seem to operate separately. Efficient means are recognized inductively in heads or brains or minds. Legitimate ends are felt deductively in hearts or guts or souls. Instrumental rationality provides intellectual tools—scientific and technological facts and theories—that appear to be impersonal, value-free means. Value rationality provides legitimate rules—moral valuations—that appear to be emotionally satisfying, fact-free ends. Every society maintains itself by coordinating instrumental means with value rational ends. Together they make humans rational. Sociologist Max Weber observed people exercising these capacities and gave them these labels that have stuck, despite scholars constantly coining new labels. Here are his original definitions, followed by a comment showing his doubt that humans are rational to believe that unconditionally right ends can be coordinated with conditionally efficient means. This article demonstrates the paradox of mutual contamination between instrumental and value rationality by reporting the reasoning of five scholars. Max Horkheimer linked instrumental reason with oppression. Harvard professors John Rawls and Robert Nozick, globally recognised as expert practitioners of value rationality, produced mutually incompatible theories of distributive justice. Neither is universally recognized as legitimate, but both continue to be defended as rational. Emory University professor James Gouinlock and Harvard professor Amartya Sen argued that Rawls and Nozick erred in believing that unconditionally valuable ends can work conditionally. Despite this disagreement, the scholarly community continues to accept as unavoidable this paradox of rationality contaminating itself. ==Max Horkheimer== In \\"On the Critique of Instrumental Reason\\" and \\"Means and Ends\\", philosopher Max Horkheimer argued that instrumental rationality plays a key role in the oppressive industrial culture of capitalism. ==John Rawls== Philosopher John Rawls accepted the reality of Weber's two kinds of rationality. He reasoned value rationally to identify unconditionally just patterns of social action capable of providing humans with a permanent instrumental moral compass. In two works, A Theory of Justice, published in 1971, and Justice as Fairness, published in 2002, he claimed to have identified one such pattern, valued both for its intrinsic legitimacy and its instrumental efficiency. Rawls did not use Weber's labels but made Weber's distinction. He relabeled social action “institutions” to identify rational patterns of socially prescribed behavior. He relabeled instrumental rationality \\"the rational” to identify institutions believed to work conditionally. He relabeled value rationality \\"the reasonable” to identify institutions believed to be unconditionally legitimate. Rawls recognized that individuals have conflicting interests and moral judgments. But he imagined groups of people in a hypothetical original position—stripped of personal interests and conditions—agreeing value rationally on intrinsically just institutions, forever worthy of voluntary obedience. He searched traditional philosophies for reasonable universal propositions about justice, and adopted one as fundamental. He concluded that humans have an innate sense of fair distribution of social advantages. It provides \\"a workable [instrumental] and systematic moral [value-rational] conception.\\" It overrides the \\"irreconcilable differences in citizens' reasonable comprehensive religious and philosophical conceptions of the world\\". It can replace the dominant modern school of moral philosophy, utilitarianism, that prescribes satisfaction of individual wants as unconditionally just. Rawls reasoned that if citizens design an institution that always redistributes unplanned advantages fairly, they will sense its justice and obey it voluntarily. This reasonable institution will successfully turn instrumental means into value rational ends, forestalling contaminated rationality. Rawls recognized that his fair institution would redistribute advantages unequally. But that unintended consequence will be just \\"if [it results] in compensating benefits for everyone, and in particular for the least advantaged members of society.\\" Community belief in this principle will provide a value rational \\"overlapping consensus\\" on instrumentally just behavior patterns. Rawls hoped that his theory of justice would generate a rational and reasonable \\"overlapping consensus.” Instead, it resulted in a double paradox, neither working nor acceptable as legitimate. It failed his criterion of universal intuitive acceptance as an embodiment of justice, but he continued to endorse it. In his 1999 revision of A Theory of Justice he reasserted his faith that justice as fairness would be recognized as an instrumentally efficient institution valued “for its own sake.” ==Robert Nozick== Philosopher Robert Nozick accepted the reality of Weber's two kinds of rationality. He believed that conditional means are capable of achieving unconditional ends. He did not search traditional philosophies for value rational propositions about justice, as Rawls had done, because he accepted well-established utilitarian propositions, which Rawls found unacceptable. In 1974, three years after publication of Rawls's Theory of Justice, he published Anarchy, State, and Utopia, rebutting that theory. In 1993 he published The Nature of Rationality, refining Weber's understanding of instrumental and value rationality. The first sentence of Anarchy, State, and Utopia asserted a value rational principle of justice: Individual want satisfaction is legitimate. Nozick's basic right was the principle of entitlement to just deserts. He replaced Rawls's complex value reasoning about fair redistribution with a simple principle of distributive justice: any distribution of holdings justly acquired must be forever respected because valued for its own sake. Humans know intuitively—before and apart from social conditions—that they want utility, along with a logical corollary that planning one's individual pursuit of utility is moral—life-fulfilling. The utilitarian right to satisfy individual ends does not prescribe just institutions. Instead, it creates a \\"moral side restraint.” It forbids social rules that require one individual to serve the interests of others. It entitles every human to be treated as a value rational end in himself, never to be used as means to ends pursued by others. Nozick's statement of this utilitarian principle invalidated Rawls's justice as fair redistribution by definition. The behavior Rawls identified as the epitome of justice violates the right Nozick believed was the epitome of justice—a rational paradox. Rawls's institution destroys individual freedom to enjoy just deserts of pursuing one's ends with instrumentally chosen means. Nozick followed this rejection-by-definition with 48 pages explaining logical flaws in Rawls's just redistribution. Anarchy ended as it began, asserting that Rawls's justice as fair redistribution is unjust, and that only institutions of a minimal state—protecting established social advantages—can be just. Twenty years later, Nozick turned from debating value rational principles with Rawls to explaining how the human capacity for value rationality creates universal propositions capable of providing an instrumental moral compass for humanity. He opened Nature of Rationality with a chapter heading and first sentence asking two questions. Chapter 1 was entitled \\"How to Do Things with Principles\\"; the first sentence: \\"What are principles for?\\" Translating into Weber's labels, Nozick was proposing to explain how principles—universal propositions connecting unconditional ends to conditional means—work instrumentally to identify conditionally-efficient-but- unconditionally-want-satisfying means. These connections eliminate the distinction between instrumental and value rationality. Principles that are legitimate also \\"work\\". Principles \\"work\\" by coordinating actions that become legitimate as their success becomes recognized. Individuals are free to apply principles they find work for them, and to behave accordingly. Chapter 1 explained four ways that individuals use principles to coordinate group behavior instrumentally. Nozick then moved on to explain that instrumental rationality—finally using Weber's label—cannot shape workable and just institutions by itself. Only value rationality can identify utility as a universal end. He then relabeled Weber's criteria \\"[instrumental] rationality of decision\\" and \\"[value] rationality of belief\\". He gave instrumental rationality pride of place as \\"the means-ends connection\\" and \\"the efficient and effective achieving of goals\\". \\"Instrumental rationality is within the intersection of all theories of rationality... [It] is the default theory, the theory that all discussants of rationality take for granted.”” But he accepted the traditional proposition that instrumental rationality is incomplete because value-free. It only reveals value-free facts as means for pursuing fact-free self-interested utility. By \\"substantive rationality of goals and desires\\", Nozick meant explaining how applying principles generates utility—intrinsically valuable satisfaction—for actors who accept them. This proposition required more relabeling. Weber's \\"instrumental rationality\\" and Rawls's \\"the rational\\" became actors' \\"causally expected utility\\"—satisfaction with workmanlike behavior—and \\"evidentially expected utility\\"—satisfaction with predicted utility after successful instrumental action. Weber's \\"value rationality\\" and Rawls's “the reasonable” became actors' \\"symbolic utility\\"—satisfaction with behavior that, in itself, symbolizes universal justice. Jointly, these three sorts of utility establish the social measure of “decision value”—instrumentally successful moral actions. \\"Even if rationality were understood and explained only as instrumental rationality, that rationality can come to be valued in part for itself ... and so come to have intrinsic [fact-free] value. Nozick's assertion of a value rational human right to pursue individual utility resulted in the same double paradox as Rawls’s institution of justice as fairness. He admitted that it was not rationally persuasive — \\"most people I know and respect disagree with me\\"— but continued to believe that both instrumental and value rationality are universally known to satisfy human wants. Neither expert in value rationality was able to convince the other with contaminated reason. ==James Gouinlock== Philosopher James Gouinlock does not believe in the reality of Weber's two kinds of rationality. He became a critic of the separation between instrumental and value rationality while describing and extending John Dewey's efforts to understand human intelligence. Belief in two criteria for reasoning was one of many popular dualism against which he and Dewey railed. They did not believe anything could be valued in isolation—good “for its own sake.” In his introduction to volume two of Dewey's collected works, John Dewey The Later Works 1925–53, published in 1984, Gouinlock criticized the modern practice of value rationality as represented by Rawls and Nozick. He developed that criticism in his 1993 study, Rediscovering the Moral Life. In 2004, he published Eros and the Good, describing his personal effort to eliminate the dualism. Gouinlock's 1984 introduction never used Weber's labels “instrumental and value rationality.” Instead, it distinguished Dewey's explanation of rationality—itself sometimes labeled \\"instrumentalism\\" and identified with \\"pragmatism\\"—from two traditional schools of philosophy that assumed divided rationality: rationalism and classical empiricism. Rationalists are prone to favor Weber's value rationality. They assume a human deductive capacity for immediate knowledge of meaningful beliefs and behaviors—fact-free human ends. Empiricists, by contrast, favor Weber's instrumental rationality. They assume a human inductive capacity to recognize how brute facts work as value-free means. Gouinlock explained Dewey's reasons for rejecting both poles of this traditional division. He quoted from a Dewey article on pragmatism to show how Dewey replaced value rational objects, labeled by Rawls “institutions” and by Nozick “principles” with “general ideas”—an intellectual tool relating means to conditional ends serially and inter-independently. Dewey wrote of \\"intelligence\\" rather than “rationality\\" because he considered reasoning to be a two-step way of thinking, not two distinct structural capacities. It involves endless linking of available means to proposed ends. Gouinlock wrote: \\"Realization of the good life [a contextual end for Dewey, not Nozick’s universal want satisfaction] depends … on the exercise of intelligence. Indeed, his instrumentalism ... is a theory concerning the nature of intelligent conduct.\\" Gouinlock criticized Rawls and Nozick for contaminating conditional instrumental reasoning by isolating value rational principles of truth and justice from experienced conditions.[9]:xxx, xxxv-vi Dewey's “general ideas” were not pre-known legitimate ends actors intended to achieve. They were hypothetical visions of ways of acting that might solve existing problems developmentally, restoring coordinated behavior in conditions that obstruct it. They visualize where a situation should go; what “from here to there” looks like. In Rediscovering the Moral Life, Gouinlock again criticized Rawls and Nozick for imagining value rational principles in their heads, while ignoring facts of human nature and real-life moral conditions. He listed traditional forms of value-rationality, all of which he found incompetent to serve humans as moral compass. Gouinlock's \\"additional considerations\\" ignored claims that legitimate ends work by maximizing utility. His virtues must solve problems developmentally. Instead of trying to identify eternally legitimate institutions, he searched for continuity in virtuous ways of behaving. By treating rationality as a criterion for judging means-ends working to produce developmental consequences, Gouinlock gave practical meaning to Dewey's instrumentally reasoning: \\"For the virtue of rationality I ask no more than a sincere attempt to seek the truth relevant to a given situation.\\" ==Amartya Sen== Early in the 21st century, economist Amartya Sen expressed doubts about the separation of instrumental from value rationality, similar to doubts Max Weber expressed early in the 20th century. In 2002 he published a collection of his papers under the title Rationality and Freedom to explain how these two normative conceptions are conditional and inter-related. In 2009 he published The Idea of Justice, questioning whether unconditional value rationality used inconclusively by Harvard colleagues Rawls and Nozick is legitimate at all. He recognized that the alternative to human rationality is rarely insanity. It is more often conceptions that contaminate reasoning. In Rationality and Freedom, Sen defined rationality as a discipline \\"subjecting one's choicesof [instrumental] actions as well as of [value rational] objectives, values and prioritiesto reasoned scrutiny\\". More forcefully than Weber, he questioned the rationality of believing that unconditionally legitimate ends can be coordinated with conditionally efficient means. He essentially made both instrumental and value rationality conditional, eliminating the paradox of reason contaminating reason. To scrutinize choices seems to mean treating them as hypotheses to be tested, not as knowledge already acquired. All knowledge is conditional, subject to revision. Sen relabeled instrumental and value rationality by naming their traditional defects. Weber's value-rationality became \\"process-independent\\" reasoning. It ignores instrumental means as it judges intended consequences: \\"the goodness of outcomes\\" always valuable in themselves. Its use produces fact-free intrinsically good knowledge. Weber's instrumental rationality became \\"consequence-independent\\" theory, because its practitioners develop \\"right procedures”instrumental means for reasoningwithout evaluating ends. Its use produces value-free facts. His message was that rationality requires using \\"both the [instrumental] 'dueness' of processes and the [value-rational] 'goodness of narrowly defined 'outcomes.'\\" Sen showed the paradox of believing in fact-free ends and value- free means. Economists have developed a model of \\"rational action\\" that creates \\"rational fools” of both social scientists and the people they study. Sen called the scientist an \\"instrumental rationalist.\\" Imagine a scientist observing a man happily cutting off his toes with a blunt knife. Does the scholar judge the man rational or not? Forbidden by the axiom that want satisfaction is good in itself, the scientist can only judge means. Regarding his colleagues Rawls and Nozick, Sen was little critical of their practice of instrumental rationality, but quite critical of their practice of value rationality. Their theories were largely “consequence-independent”fact-free, correct regardless of actual consequences. \\"Justice as fairness\\" and \\"Entitlement theory\\" are \\"not only non-consequentialist but they also seem to leave little room for taking substantive note of consequences in modifying or qualifying the rights covered by these principles.\\" He proposed new terms for Weber's two kinds of rationality, relating them to specific flaws he found in the reasoning of Rawls and Nozick. He labeled their instrumental rationality \\"transcendental institutionalism\\" and \\"arrangement-focused\\" analysis, prescribing fact-free patterns of coordinated behavior assumed to be instrumentally efficient without conditions. For Rawls, there are eternally and universally just rules of fairness: \\"comprehensive goals,... deliberately chosen ... through an ethical examination of how one 'should' act [value- rationally]. For Nozick there are eternally and universally right rules that cover personal liberties as well as rights of holding, using, exchanging, and bequeathing legitimately owned property.\\" In Idea of Justice, Sen asked “What is the role of [instrumental] rationality and of [value-rational] reasonableness in understanding the demands of justice?” He rejected the search for a theory of perfect justice in favor of a search for practical means to reduce injustice. Sen's analysis was complex, but not his message. He concluded that both instrumental rationality and value-rationality are capable of error. Neither premises nor conclusions about means or ends are ever beyond criticism. Nothing can be taken as relevant or valid in itself. All valuations must be constantly reaffirmed in the continuity of rational inquiry. \\"We have to get on with the basic task of obtaining workable rules [means] that satisfy reasonable requirements [conditional ends].\\" Belief in value rationalityunconditionally true and just knowledgecontinues to contaminate conditional instrumental rationality. == See also == * Categorical imperative * Communicative rationality * Fact–value distinction * Instrumental and intrinsic value * Instrumental and value-rational action * Instrumentalism * Objectivity (philosophy) * Rationalisation (social process) ==References== Category:Critical theory Category:Social philosophy Category:Sociological terminology ","title":"Instrumental and value rationality"},{"id":"3247950","text":"Realms is a 1991 real-time strategy game produced by Graftgold Ltd. for MS- DOS, Amiga, and Atari ST.

During this intro, it tells the story of a prince watching his late father, the king being immolated at sea. Mourning, he sheds a tear, and his mourning is rewarded by the gods. He is struck by lightning, which forms and serpent in hands, an emblem of his right to rule the world. A tagline appears afterwards, stating \\"There can only be one... just make sure it's yours.\\" After inserting and loading the second disk, the game can start. ==Gameplay== First, the player must choose a race to control. Each of the six races is based on a fantasy race ala Tolkien. Each race have their own attributes, including some strengths and weaknesses. For example, Dwarves prefer having an axe as a weapon, but Elves are the best archers. After completing a training mission, which allows the player to get to grips with raising armies and keeping the population fed, the player can play any of the 10 missions on offer. ;Cities Player controlled cities can be taxed, fed by buying of grain, improved defensively with city walls and grown by cultivating surrounding land. If the population is sufficient, an army of 1000 men/women can be raised. Information about population, health rating, morale and grain amounts for the city are found by clicking on a friendly city. ;Armies A player can raise an army from a player-controlled city. Infantry or cavalry can be raised. The quality of the soldiers (elite warriors, warriors, militia or raw recruits) depends on city size and number of armies already raised from that particular city. The army can be equipped with a range of weapons, armour and bows. The army also needs to be paid. A well paid army will have high moral and recover its numbers quickly after battles, whereas a lowly paid or unpaid army will disband soon after creation. An army can be paid through the pillages it carries out, but this needs to be done regularly to avoid the unit disbanding. An army's equipment level and pay can be adjusted when the army is based in a friendly city, but there are no refunds for removing more expensive kit. Army units will appear as coloured flags when based in a city (yellow for player controlled units, red for other units). Horse image represents one cavalry unit and an image of a man represents one infantry unit. Moving the mouse over the image will give information about the number of soldiers and where it was raised. When a unit is crossing over water, a Trireme image is shown. ;World Map The world map is a 3D world, with mountains, grassland, forests and oceans. It is also populated with cities of your realm and of your rivals. As the game happens in real-time, a handy 'message board' informs you of your army movements, famine and disease warnings, and alerts regarding sieges of your cities and the cities you're attacking. Army movements can be tracked on the map using the mouse or the keypad. Unit speed is based on the type of unit (as cavalry are faster) and the amount of armour on the soldiers (lighter units move faster). An overview map allows trade routes to be adjusted. Trade routes are important to collect tax revenues and keep control of your cities. ;Attacking and defending The objective of each mission is to conquer all of the cities on the map. Capturing an enemy city involves laying siege to it, by sending an army to attack it. Most cities will be defended by an army, which will cause a battle to occur. The player can organise their armies formation and can maneuver them before the battle begins. Armies with bows can fire a set number of arrows at the enemy to reduce their numbers, but the bowmen's range depends on the race. When morale or troop numbers for one side fall sufficiently, that side loses the battles and the troops retreat. A player can order a retreat, but this has a bad effect on the army's morale. Depending on grain levels, morale and whether a city has walls, a city can take a while to fall to a siege. When a city falls, it can be sacked, razed to the ground or captured. If you capture a city with a different race from your own, you can raise army units with that race, enabling specialised armies to be created in the later stages of the mission. Games can take many hours to complete, but there is a save game option to allow progress to be saved. ==Reception== Computer Gaming World reviewed the MS-DOS version, stating that the game's high difficulty level and \\"awkward interface\\" made Realms best suited for \\"tenacious fantasy wargamers with the perseverance to learn the game system and master the included scenarios\\". The magazine concluded that the game \\"advances the genre but doesn't quite usurp SSG's Warlords as the quintessential fantasy wargame\\". The game was reviewed in 1993 in Dragon #194 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 3½ out of 5 stars. The One gave the Amiga version of Realms an overall score of 81%, starting their review by saying \\"Yes, it's like Powermonger and no, it's not as good.\\" The One highly criticizes the gameplay, stating that \\"Realms has missed quite a few opportunites with its design, most notably in the combat sections. The whole process of laying siege to a town is glossed over and the battles could have had a lot more depth and strategic content.\\" The One's main criticism of Realms is unoriginality, expressing that \\"[Realms] is trying to enter a market that's flooded with similar strategy titles ... [Realms] is little different from many others\\". Despite this criticism, The One says that Realms \\"Doesn't enter any new territory but does what it sets out to do with a degree of competence\\", and praises the controls as \\"concise and easy to get to grips with\\". ==References== == External links == * Category:1991 video games Category:DOS games Category:Amiga games Category:Atari ST games Category:Real- time strategy video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Virgin Interactive games ","title":"Realms (video game)"},{"id":"3247958","text":"UEC may refer to: *Urban Entertainment Center *Union Election Commission, the electoral commission of Myanmar (Burma) *Unified Examinations Certificate, an examination held by the United School Committees' Association Malaysia for Chinese independent high school students *Universal electronic card, an identity card formerly issued to citizens of Russia to use instead of an internal passport *University of Electro-Communications, a Japanese university based in Chofu city, Tokyo *University of Exeter, Cornwall Campus, campus of the University of Exeter at Tremough, in Penryn, Cornwall, United Kingdom *Union Européenne de Cyclisme (European Cycling Union) *United Electric Car Company, a defunct tramcar manufacturer in the United Kingdom *United Engine Corporation, a Russian aircraft engine manufacturer *Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud, open-source infrastructure for cloud computing under Ubuntu Linux *Urea, electrolytes, creatinine, a blood test sometimes referred to as a basic metabolic panel *UEC Cup, computer Go tournament held at the University of Electro-Communications *Uganda Electoral Commission, the electoral commission of Uganda ","title":"UEC"},{"id":"3247967","text":"Light Green SF, also called C.I. 42095, Light Green SF Yellowish, is a green triarylmethane dye. ==Uses== ===Biomedical=== It is used in histology for staining collagen; for that purpose it is a standard dye in North America. In Masson's trichrome it is used as a counterstain to acid fuchsin. It is a component of Papanicolaou stains together with eosin Y and bismarck brown Y. It usually comes as a disodium salt. Its maximum absorption is at 630 (422) nm. The dye is not very durable — it has a tendency to fade. When fading is to be avoided, it is replaced with Fast Green FCF, which also has more brilliant color. Fast Green FCF can also substitute Light Green SF in other procedures. Lissamine green dye can be used to check the health of the anterior surfaces of the eye. It is available on a swab, which is wet with saline and then the dye is dropped into the lower fornix. The dye shows up conjunctival staining similar to rose Bengal dye but it does not sting like rose Bengal does. ===Food coloring=== Light Green SF was once used as a green food colorant. Its use in the U.S. was discontinued due to its low popularity. ==References== Category:Triarylmethane dyes Category:Staining dyes Category:Benzenesulfonates Category:Anilines ","title":"Light Green SF"},{"id":"3247984","text":"A temperate forest in France Metropolitan France contains a total of of tree coverage, with considered to be forestry by the National Forest Inventory (IFN).

His biggest success came in 1972 when he won the Polish cup as well as appearing in several Polish international matches. His international career began in 1965 when he played against Scotland. At the time of his arrival in the national game, a player of such speed and agility was practically unheard of in Poland, and he frequently was substituted into games to bring to his teams extra power in not just defense, but attack. Anczok was given an opportunity in 1966 to go on a tour of South America, where he more than held his own against players such as Pelé. Numerous minor injuries gave him problems throughout the years to come, including in the 1974 FIFA World Cup. He continued to play in Norway in the late seventies, before retiring as a player in 1979 and heading into management. He originally managed in Poland before health problems forced him into relinquishing his duties. ==References== Category:Footballers at the 1972 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic footballers of Poland Category:Olympic gold medalists for Poland Category:Poland international footballers Category:Polish footballers Category:Polonia Bytom players Category:Górnik Zabrze players Category:Polish football managers Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:People from Lubliniec Category:Olympic medalists in football Category:Skeid Fotball players Category:Sportspeople from Silesian Voivodeship Category:Polish expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Norway Category:Polish expatriate sportspeople in Norway Category:Medalists at the 1972 Summer Olympics Category:Association football defenders ","title":"Zygmunt Anczok"},{"id":"3247990","text":"Covered with Ants is the sixth album by the Huntington Beach, California punk rock band Guttermouth, released in 2001 by Epitaph Records.

It was founded in 1994 by John Fry, co-founder of Fry's Electronics, and originally located in the Fry's Electronics San Jose, California location. It was privately funded by Fry at inception, and it obtained NSF funding starting in 2002.. Brian Conrey became the institute's director in 1997. The Institute was founded with the primary goal of identifying and solving important mathematical problems. Originally, very small groups of top mathematicians would be assembled to solve a major problem, such as the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. Now the Institute also runs an extensive program of week-long workshops on current topics in mathematical research. These workshops rely strongly on interactive problem sessions. From 1998 to 2009 (with the exception of 1999), AIM annually awarded a prestigious five-year fellowship to an \\"outstanding new PhD pursuing research in an area of pure mathematics\\", and currently is not offering the fellowship. AIM also sponsors local mathematics competitions and a yearly meeting for women mathematicians. The Institute will eventually move to Morgan Hill, California, about 39 miles (63 km) to the southeast of San Jose, when its new facility there is completed. Plans for the new facility were started about 2000, but construction work was delayed by regulatory and engineering issues. In February 2014, the AIM received permission to start construction of the facility, which will be built as a facsimile of The Alhambra, a 14th- century Moorish palace and fortress in Spain, but as of three-and-a-half years later (August 2017), no construction activity had started. == Sponsored research == The American Institute of Mathematics has sponsored fundamental research for high-profile problems in several mathematical areas.

It was performed by Pink Floyd only once, as an encore in May 1968; it was subsequently performed by David Gilmour in September 2008 in memory of Wright, who had recently died of cancer, on Later... with Jools Holland, and by Nick Mason during his Saucerful of Secrets tour. The dreamy, poetic lyrics are about nostalgia for the lost paradise of early childhood. ==Recording== The song, written and sung by Wright, was recorded during two different sessions. During the first session (May 1967), Wright's vocals, piano, and Farfisa organ were recorded and during the second session (October 1967) Syd Barrett's acoustic and slide guitar as well as the bass and drum sections were recorded at De Lane Lea Studios in London. The sessions also produced \\"Jugband Blues\\". Andrew King, Pink Floyd's manager, recalls: \\"I remember De Lane Lea... we did 'Vegetable Man' there... and 'Remember a Day', which Syd does a guitar solo on.\\" In 1968 Barrett wrote: \\"I was self-taught and my only group was Pink Floyd. I was not featured on 'Corporal Clegg' but did play on another track written by Richard Wright. I forget the title but it had a steel guitar in the background. There have been complications regarding the LP but it is now almost finished and should be issued by EMI in a few months. I now spend most of my time writing.\\" During the sessions for the song, the band's drummer Nick Mason became agitated that he could not come up with the right drum part. Producer Norman Smith, however, knew what he wanted with the drums, so he played the part himself.Blake, Mark. Comfortably Numb: The Inside Story of Pink Floyd. Thunder's Mouth Press, 2008, p. 117. ==Release and aftermath== A rare United States single release (Tower 440) contains edited mono versions of this and the song before it in the album, \\"Let There Be More Light\\". This single was never released in the United Kingdom, although it was intended to be a single before being replaced by \\"Apples and Oranges\\". An instrumental version of the studio version appeared in the film of the same name, Remember a Day. ===Reception=== In a negative review for A Saucerful of Secrets, Jim Miller of Rolling Stone described \\"Remember a Day\\" as \\"inoffensive, but features some rather miserable bottleneck guitar, second rate piano, and empty-sounding acoustic guitar work.\\" Miller further described [Norman Smith]'s drumming as \\"busy and ineffective.\\" ===2008 performance=== For 'Later...', Gilmour played the song on his 'Fender Telecaster 52V', a 1982 reissue of the 1952 original; seen here displayed at the Pink Floyd: Their Mortal Remains exhibition On 23 September 2008, David Gilmour performed the song on a live broadcast of Later... with Jools Holland on BBC Two as a tribute to Rick Wright, who had died eight days earlier. In an interview later in the show, Gilmour said that Wright had intended to perform with him that day, but had sent Gilmour an SMS message a couple of weeks before his death to advise him that he would not be well enough to attend. This was the first live performance of the song since 1968 by any member of the band, although none of the original lineup that recorded the song took part in the performance. Gilmour's band comprised Phil Manzanera, Guy Pratt, Jon Carin and Steve DiStanislao. ==Personnel== *Richard Wright – piano, Farfisa organ, lead vocals *Syd Barrett – slide guitar, acoustic guitar, vocals *Roger Waters – bass with: *Norman Smith – drums, backing vocals ==References== ==External links== * Category:Pink Floyd songs Category:1968 songs Category:Songs written by Richard Wright (musician) he:Remember A Day ","title":"Remember a Day"},{"id":"3248020","text":"WTS is an acronym for: ==Military== * War Training Service, formerly known as the Civilian Pilot Training Program * Women's Transport Service, part of the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry * , a museum collection of historical technological defence systems ==Places== * Wall Township Speedway, a former speedway in Wall Township, New Jersey * Wong Tai Sin, a place in Kowloon, Hong Kong ==People== * William Tecumseh Sherman, American Civil War general ==Other== * Want/willing to sell * Want to show, a frequently used phrase in mathematics * The Watchtower Society (aka Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania), the primary corporation for administration of Jehovah's Witnesses' activities worldwide * , a transport social network * Westminster Theological Seminary, a Christian graduate institution * World Tax Service (WTS Group), an international consulting group with tax, legal and consulting business units * Wind turbine syndrome, various illnesses attributed to proximity to wind turbines * Windows Terminal Server, a component of Microsoft Windows to access a computer remotely * World Tour Soccer, a game released on the PS2 PSP and Xbox * ITU World Triathlon Series, the International Triathlon Union's annual series of triathlon events * Women's Transportation Seminar, a women's organization for transportation professionals - https://www.wtsinternational.org/ ","title":"WTS"},{"id":"3248025","text":"Gergely Kulcsár (10 March 1934 - 12 August 2020) was a Hungarian javelin thrower.

The company operated from 1979 until 1989 when it was shut down by federal regulators as a result of bank failure, leading to a loss of $60 million for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Beginning in 1982, the bank was owned and managed by Jim McDougal, a friend of Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton. On March 8, 1992, during the 1992 United States presidential election the bank was the subject of an article in The New York Times by Jeff Gerth, which linked the bank to Whitewater Development Corporation, owned by McDougal and the Clintons. After Clinton's election as president, the bank was the subject of investigations by the United States Congress and special prosecutor Ken Starr as part of the Whitewater controversy. McDougall was investigated to determine if he improperly diverted money from the bank to Whitewater or the Clinton campaign during the Arkansas gubernatorial election, 1984. ==History== In 1979, the bank received a state savings and loan charter from Arkansas as Woodruff County Savings and Loan. From June 1979 to December 1981, assets grew from $2.6 million to $3.8 million. In April 1982, an audit by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the bank's regulator, found substantial losses and questioned the solvency of the bank. Later in 1982, Madison was acquired by Jim McDougal and Steve Smith. John Latham was named chief executive officer. The bank continued its rapid growth, increasing in assets from $6.7 million at the end of 1982 to $48.6 million in 1986. In 1983, McDougal and his wife, Susan McDougal, took control of the institution. In a 1984 audit, federal regulators found the bank was making unsound loans and noted that if paper losses were realized, Madison would be insolvent. In August 1986, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board ordered McDougal's removal from management of Madison, although he remained its owner. Robert W. Palmer, an appraiser, admitted to falsifying appraisals. In 1986, the assets of the bank peaked at $125.5 million. On March 2, 1989, Madison was seized by Federal regulators and put into receivership with the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation as receiver. On April 14, 1997, Jim McDougal was convicted of 18 felony counts of fraud conspiracy charges as a result of bad loans made by Madison. He was sentenced to 3 years in prison and payment of $4.27 million in restitution to the Small Business Administration and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Madison Guaranty and McDougal hired the Rose Law Firm, where Mrs. Clinton worked, as a defense attorney. Mrs. Clinton's billing records on Madison Guaranty and McDougal's Castle Grande real estate development project could not be found. How much work she actually did on Madison and Castle Grande was the subject of the missing billing records. McDougal also held a fundraiser at Madison Guaranty that paid off Clinton's campaign debt of $50,000. Madison cashier's checks accounted for $12,000 of the funds raised. On January 4, 1996, Clinton's billing records were found on a table in the White House, which showed that she performed 60 hours of legal work for Madison in 1985 and 1986. ==References== Category:Whitewater controversy Category:Fraud in the United States Category:Banks established in 1979 Category:Banks disestablished in 1989 Category:Defunct banks of the United States Category:Defunct companies based in Arkansas Category:Banks based in Arkansas Category:Bank failures in the United States Category:Savings and loan crisis Category:1989 disestablishments ","title":"Madison Guaranty"},{"id":"3248029","text":"2 Minute Drill is an ESPN game show based on the general knowledge UK game show Mastermind. The program aired from September 11, 2000 to December 28, 2001. ESPN Classic currently airs reruns of the series daily at 11:30 AM Eastern. Kenny Mayne hosted the show, and began each player's turn at the front game by telling them, \\"Your 2-Minute Drill Begins Now!\\". ==Format== ===Round 1=== ====Season 1==== Three players competed. The show featured a four athlete/celebrity panel. The scoreboard was an eggcrate display. Sometimes it malfunctioned, such as a transition from a number. (e.g. when a player gets a question correct sometimes a blank digit would show before going to the next number.) For each contestant's turn, they would be given 2:00 to answer sports trivia questions and would have a choice of 4 categories; each represented by a member of the panel, each pertaining to that panelist's area of expertise, and each containing 5 questions. If a contestant got a question right in any category, they could continue to play it or pick another category, but an incorrect answer or a pass forced them to pick another category (although they could go back to it at any time, provided there were still questions left in it). Each correct answer was worth one point, and one bonus point was awarded if the contestant swept a category (got all 5 right), for a maximum of 24 first round points. The lowest scorer at the end of the first round was eliminated. Prior to the show, the contestants are also asked a numerical question and asked to give an answer. If there is a tie for low score at the end of this round, the answers are compared, and the player whose answer is closest to the correct answer moves on. ====Seasons 2 and 3==== Two players competed as opposed to three. This time, the scoreboard was computerized to match the on-screen graphics, and the current question and answer would be shown to the home viewers who were playing along. To accommodate this, players could no longer interrupt during the question, and must wait for the question to be completely read before answering. For each contestant's turn, again, they would be given 2:00 to answer sports trivia questions from 4 categories. This time, however, contestants would pick an athlete/celebrity, and they would read all of their questions (in their entirety), regardless of whether or not the contestant missed or passed one along the way. The contestant could only select another celebrity after the current celebrity's questions were completed. In addition, each category had only 4 questions in it as opposed to 5, but bonuses were still awarded for sweeping a category; 20 points was the maximum possible first round score. Because there were only two players, nobody is eliminated at the end of the round. ===Round 2=== In the second round, the contestants faced a rapid fire series of general knowledge sports trivia questions from the panel for two minutes, with no categories or panelist selections before each question. One at a time, each panelist asked a question and the contestant had to wait for a question to be completed before they could answer. In season one, the panel included host Kenny Mayne, who sat in the center position at the panel desk. When the show made its aforementioned aesthetic changes for season two, Mayne got his own desk and sat to one side of the panel; he thus ceased to be an active part of the front game (as in, he no longer asked any of the questions). Whoever had the highest score after this round won $5,000 in cash, an \\"ESPN Experience\\", and advanced to the bonus round for a chance to double the money to $10,000. If there was a tie after the end of round 2, the tiebreaker rules from the previous round were used. ===Bonus Round=== The winner would get a question (usually with more than one part) in a category that they chose as their area of expertise (usually a specific sports team of the past or single athlete). In the second and third seasons, Mayne called it the \\"Question of Great Significance.\\" Answering it correctly doubled what they won in the front game. Also in the second and third seasons, to heighten the dramatic effect for the question, every light in the studio was turned out except for those focused on Mayne and the contestant, and the panel's table was moved off to the back of the set so the contestant would only be focused on the host. ==Tournament== Each player in 2 Minute Drill was part of a tournament. After all the first-round matches were played, the winners plus the highest scoring non-winner advanced to the quarterfinals, with $15,000 and another ESPN Experience going to the winner, with a chance to double it to $30,000 in the bonus round. The six winners of the quarterfinal advanced to the semifinals, with another Experience and $30,000 with a chance to double it to $60,000 given to the winners. The finals involved the two semifinal winners and the contestant who had the highest score among non-winners (i.e. a wild card). The winner received another ESPN Experience and $50,000, with a final shot to double their earnings to $100,000 in the bonus round; thus making total winnings a possible $200,000 in the event a player gets all their specialty category questions correct. Regardless of the outcome, the Grand Champion also receives a trophy. In seasons two and three, the tournament was shortened to 13 episodes and was changed to a two-player game; the rules involving wild cards were eliminated as a result. As long as a player kept winning matches, he/she could continue to play-- meaning that, if a contestant was a good enough player, they could potentially win more than one tournament. In fact, Willy Gibson from Columbus, Ohio did exactly that; he won the first and second 2 Minute Drill season championships and was eliminated on a tiebreaker after winning two games during the third season. All in all, he won 9 ESPN Experiences and $220,000 in cash. Nearly all of Gibson's winnings were from match victories, as he tended to struggle with his Questions of Great Significance (Gibson chose individual subjects, Deion Sanders and Eddie George, instead of past teams and thus was given questions with more obscure information). Gibson's second tournament championship aired on September 11, 2001. The third season premiered on September 18, 2001 in its normal primetime slot but was moved to late nights later on in the run. The final tournament was won by Syracuse University student and ESPN The Magazine writer Adesina Koiki. ==References== ==External links== 2 Minute Drill @ IMDb Category:ESPN game shows Category:ESPN Classic original programming Category:2000s American game shows Category:2000 American television series debuts Category:2001 American television series endings Category:American sports television series Category:Television series by Embassy Row Category:Television series by Sony Pictures Television Category:English-language television shows Category:American television series based on British television series ","title":"2 Minute Drill (game show)"},{"id":"3248030","text":"Loukas Panourgias (, 4 September 1899 – Athens, 17 January 1981) was a Greek athlete and footballer.

Starting in the late 1960s, together with Marshall and Vox, Hiwatt contributed to the sonic image popularly termed \\"British sound\\". ==History== === Origins of the Dave Reeves Hiwatt legacy === Hylight Electronics was the brainchild of British audio engineer David Reeves. He attended technical school in the late 1950s, and did apprenticeships at Marconi Electronics and Mullard. While working his day job, young Reeves also started working evenings in a small room over Plato Music on Crown Passage in Morden from 1964–1968. He fixed things at first, repairing hifi sets and televisions as well. It was during this time that he first conceived the idea to start his own company and invented the Hiwatt name. === Early timeline === 1963 – Local band \\"The Hylights\\" amplifier blew up, Dave Reeves said \\"I could build a better one than that\\" so he did. He conceived the idea to build more amps from this whilst living in 3a Cotswold road, Belmont, Surrey. March 1964 – Moved to Morden, Surrey (The maisonette). Early 1966 – Made redundant (laid off) from Mullard, used £800 separation pay to give him breathing space to develop Hiwatt idea, whilst wiring the amps at 4 Crown Passage, Kingston, Surrey (Plato Musical Instruments Ltd.) and finishing them in the maisonette in Morden. Late 1967 to early 1968 – Was under contract to build Sound City Amplifiers and with £800 earned from his work, he placed a deposit on 171 Malden Way, New Malden and moved in March, 1968. Then started to build Hiwatt amplifiers in the garage. Between 26 Jan and 1 Feb 1972 – Moved Hiwatt from the garage on Malden Way to a facility at 16 Park Road, Kingston, Surrey. ===First amplifiers=== The first series of units that were produced bearing the moniker first appeared from Reeves work bench in 1964 (based on one early example obtained by Plexi Palace). These first models used ultralinear taps for the screen grids. They were a split-chassis design 50 watt head with the control panel mounted on the top of the cabinet, and a black and gold nameplate that featured small-case, cursive writing spelling out the name \\"hi- watt\\". The original HIWATTs owed more of their design and look to the VOX and SELMER counterparts of the day than to the classic look of the British guitar amplifier that HIWATT later embodied. The DR506 (S/N 159) pictured on this site was built in this shop in 1966, based on receipts still in existence. Reeves apparently created a few early Hiwatt amps using a script logo, but we don't know where exactly in the timeline these fit in. There followed a number of more traditional front-panel head designs, the earliest of which had \\"HIWATT AMPLIFIER COMPANY\\" printed on the control panel where the more familiar \\"CUSTOM HIWATT 100\\" text would later go. Partridge transformers and Mullard valves were part of the Hiwatt recipe from the earliest days, in large part because Reeves was intimately familiar with them from working at Mullard. ===Hylight and Sound City=== Reeves eventually started the Hylight company (the name came from an early 1960s band named \\"The Hylights\\" that a friend belonged to), and the name was registered in September 1966. The first big order for amplifiers came from Ivor Arbiter's Sound City music store—these became the original Sound City amps. These amps (the so-called \\"Mark I\\") were apparently just his current amplifier design, re-badged with the Sound City name. Note that many of these amps still have the \\"Hylight Electronics\\" stickers on the chassis inside. He received 800-odd pounds for this batch of amps, but decided to focus on producing amps using the HIWATT name after this. In an interesting turn, Arbiter took Reeves to court afterwards saying they owned the design and Hylight was using it without permission. During the proceedings, Reeves pointed to the unused holes in the amp chassis and asked the Arbiter engineers what they were for—they couldn't answer, since they were just producing copies of the existing chassis that Reeves had originally designed! The case was decided in Reeves favour shortly thereafter. Several units later, Dave Reeves starting building amplifiers that more closely resembled the modern day HIWATT. The nameplates had been changed as well to feature a non-hyphenated, bold, all capital letter logo that stated . At around the same time (1967–68), Dave was made redundant from Mullard (\\"laid off\\" in US terms), and got another 800-odd pounds redundancy pay. He used the two sums of money to help put a down payment on a house in New Malden. The new house had a small garage, and this became the new home of Hylight Electronics. Hylight Electronics originally sold direct to the musicians so that they could put the additional fees charged by distributors and music stores back into the growth of HIWATT. Probably the earliest famous user was Glenn Cornick, then bassist of Jethro Tull, who often played up the road at the Toby Jug. It was at his urging that the first 200-watt (and later 400-watt) amps were produced. Hiwatt heads can be seen on the January 8, 1969 Toby Jug (and subsequent) pictures on the cornick.org website. The May 8 Royal Albert Hall picture in particular looks like a Hiwatt advert! Certainly one of the most famous guitarists to endorse the brand in the early days was Pete Townshend of The Who. Dave Reeves had made the Townshend connection earlier via the original SOUND CITY heads that Pete used. By February 1970 when the famous Live at Leeds concert occurred, The Who stage was full of Hiwatts. To subsidize its income at the time, HyLight Electronics also started manufacturing amplifiers under the SOLA SOUND name for Macari Ltd., one of the largest musical instrument distributors in the U.K. This arrangement only lasted for a short while as the popularity of the HIWATT amps were becoming more overwhelming on a daily basis. As the demand for HIWATT Amplification grew towards the end of the 1960s, so did Dave Reeves passion for producing an even more \\"road-worthy\\" unit for professional musicians. Much of the credit for getting HIWATT gear into the hands of such legendary bands as The Who, Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, The Moody Blues, Manfred Mann's Earth Band and others, must go to HIWATT'S original Sales Manager, Peter Webber. Peter Webber was a former band road manager whose savvy, experience, and connections with many high-profile British musicians made him the perfect choice to promote Dave Reeves premier line of amplifiers. Peter logged endless hours driving the lengths of the U.K., giving bands \\"hands-on\\" demos of the HIWATTS, and selling them on HIWATT's superior tonal capabilities and unmatched reliability. The bands initially trusted Peter for his reputation and knowledge, and the deals were closed once they plugged in. In particular, he would regularly take a set of Hiwatts up to a place in London called the Roundhouse, where they became the house amplifiers. With Peter Webber selling HIWATTS as quickly as the Hylight Electronics garage workshop could turn them out, Dave Reeves knew he needed help. The most critical and time-consuming stage in building the amps was in the wiring of the chassis. (Note that the trademark \\"right angles and neat bundles\\" internal wiring was being used in Hiwatts as early as 1969, before anyone external was brought into the picture.) In 1971 Reeves picked up the phone book to find a wirer that would be able to re-create and fine tune his \\"super neat\\" approach to wiring amplifiers, and came across the name Harry Joyce. When Dave Reeves initially visited Harry's workshop in Walton-on-Thames in early 1971, and approached him with the proposition of wiring the chassis for HIWATT amps, Harry was skeptical. Harry Joyce Electronics was at that time under contract to Gravesby Instruments Ltd. to produce wiring projects for the British Navy which required Harry's \\"no compromise\\" workmanship and quality control. Harry had hand-picked his elite crew of wiring technicians who were \\"fresh\\" out of technical school and taught them his meticulous format for \\"military-spec\\" wiring. After some prodding by Dave Reeves, Harry agreed to take on the chassis-wiring chores for Hylight Electronics on one condition: He insisted that they not be asked to produce more than forty units per month, to maintain a high standard of quality control. Dave reluctantly agreed, and the legendary marriage between Hylight Electronics and Harry Joyce Electronics began in earnest. Harry's company wired many Hiwatts from this time until early 1984, when Biacrown could no longer pay its bills. Once the services of Harry Joyce and Co. had been acquired, the next step for Hylight Electronics was to find a \\"proper\\" facility for the research, design, assembly and marketing of HIWATT Amplification. Just up the road from New Malden was the town of Kingston upon Thames. Dave Reeves found a site for HIWATT'S new home, a converted bakery complex in a very old building that was located in a small industrial section of town known as ParkWorks. In January 1972, Dave Reeves, Doug Fentiman, and newly appointed factory foreman Ian Oates began settling into their new address at 16 Park Road. The HIWATT legend was shifting in to high gear. ===Building the team=== The next step in getting the production of HIWATT amps out of the garage and into the new facilities at ParkWorks was to find a superior cabinet-making team that could develop a \\"tank-like\\" skin to protect the premier electronics that Dave Reeves had developed. Mike Allen and Danny Edwardson were brought on board to improve upon the current crop of speaker cabinets that were currently being produced in the U.K. The first step was to use a more robust and acoustically sound material for the cabinets construction. This came in the form of 14-ply Baltic Birch, which was a much heavier and dense wood product than most of the other amplifier manufacturers of the day were using. Next, the cabinets were internally braced at no less than 9 points, and the construction was finished using tongue- and-groove joints. The cabinets were finished off with the most resilient and \\"classic- style\\" vinyl covering Reeves could find (made by Brymor Ltd.) and the \\"tough as nails\\" black, white & grey fret cloth (speaker cloth) covering that was distinctively HIWATT. To put the cabinets into a small production stage, Reeves enlisted the services of Henry Glass and Co., known as BEESKIT, one of the U.K.'s premier cabinet builders. Henry's meticulous production techniques were a perfect complement to HIWATT'S already legendary road-worthiness, and Reeves fanatical approach to building nothing less than the ultimate guitar amplifier. Another integral member that was added to the team at Hylight Electronics was Phil Dudderidge, whose specialty was the design and manufacture of public address systems. Phil's knowledge and extensive expertise in working with most of the major acts in Europe at the time, made him the perfect choice to expand the HIWATT name into the realm of sound reinforcement. Soon HIWATT would become almost as well known for their P.A. gear as they were for their guitar amplifiers. Phil went on to form Soundcraft with Graham Blyth. The design of the amplifiers changed bit by bit through the 1970s, reflecting changing tastes within the industry. Some odd designs briefly surfaced during this period, including the \\"SAP\\" model with footswitch and the mysterious DR118. Also, in a concession to modern times, the use of printed circuit boards was started at the end of the 1970s, although the same strict construction and wiring standards were still employed. Also during this time, some custom amplifiers were produced by Hiwatt for their most famous clients, including Pete Townshend's CP103 (a recreation of the early Sound City-era Hiwatt design) and David Gilmour's linked-input models. ===The company changes hands=== In early 1981, Dave Reeves suffered a fatal fall down a flight of steps. Because he was divorced at the time and had not remarried, control of the company fell into the hands of solicitors (lawyers). Although his stated intention had been for his three children to inherit the business, this did not happen. Mary Clifford, the admin for the company at the time, along with other existing employees formed Biacrown Ltd., and continued making Hiwatt amplifiers. There were some minor innovations to the circuitry produced during this time, including the \\"OL\\" (overload) model which had an extra gain stage added. Some were labeled \\"OL\\", while many were not. Some had an additional gain control added to the front panel labeled \\"overdrive\\". ==Technical== ===Classic Hiwatt circuits=== Input stage variations: * The early input circuit version (Input 1) used a traditional resistive mixer to combine the two input channels. Half of V2 went unused. * The later input circuit (Input 2), used both halves of V2 to do the input channel mixing. * The OL and LEAD input circuits (Input 3) went back to the resistive mixer, and used the second half of V2 as an additional gain stage. These can be easily recognized by the \\"flying\\" components on the V2 socket. Phase Inverter (PI) Variations: * The earlier circuit (PI 1) used a cathode-follower directly connected to the PI circuit to both set the DC level and buffer the signal. * The middle and later units (PI 2) capacitively coupled the last preamp stage to the PI. The former cathode follower section now has its input connected to a DC voltage divider, and is used strictly as a low impedance voltage reference. Combination I: The earliest DRs with 4-inputs used Input 1 and PI 1. Combination II: At some point, the circuit was changed to use Input 1 and PI 2 (this version is represented by the Audio Bros and Hiwatt.com schematics). Some 4-inputs may have been made this way. Combination III: Finally, the circuit was changed to use Input 2 and PI 2. This change was definitely in all the 2-input heads, and is represented by the widely circulated freehand-drawn schematics in Pittman and elsewhere. The OL Model (early 1980s): Biacrown's \\"high gain\\" model moved back to the Input 1 circuit (still keeping PI 2), but used the \\"extra\\" half triode as an additional gain stage. The LEAD Model (early 1980s): This was basically the same as the OL model, but with an extra level control after the extra gain stage, which was marked \\"Overdrive\\" on the front panel. ===DR103 amplifier=== alt=A Hiwatt Model DR103 100W Guitar Amplifier This is the amp that started it all. The dr103 has proved itself as the cornerstone of such a huge variety of acts that has provided them all with the platform on which to build their own, unique sounds.

A polarizing filter or polarising filter (see spelling differences) is often placed in front of the camera lens in photography in order to darken skies, manage reflections, or suppress glare from the surface of lakes or the sea. Since reflections (and sky-light) tend to be at least partially linearly-polarized, a linear polarizer can be used to change the balance of the light in the photograph. The rotational orientation of the filter is adjusted for the preferred artistic effect. For modern cameras, a circular polarizer (CPL) is typically used; this comprises firstly a linear polarizer which performs the artistic function just described, followed by a quarter-wave plate which further transforms the now-linearly polarized light into circularly-polarized light before entering the camera. This additional step avoids problems with autofocus and light-metering sensors within some cameras, which otherwise may not function reliably with a simple linear polarizer. == Use == Video of the effects of a polarizer. { class=\\" floatright\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" - ! 0 degrees rotation ! 30 degrees rotation -  200px  200px - ! 60 degrees rotation ! 90 degrees rotation -  200px  200px } Light reflected from a non-metallic surface becomes polarized; this effect is maximum at Brewster's angle, about 56° from the vertical for common glass. A polarizer rotated to pass only light polarized in the direction perpendicular to the reflected light will absorb much of it. This absorption allows glare reflected from, for example, a body of water or a road to be reduced. Reflections from shiny surfaces (e.g. vegetation, sweaty skin, water surfaces, glass) are also reduced. This allows the natural color and detail of what is beneath to come through. Reflections from a window into a dark interior can be much reduced, allowing it to be seen through. (The same effects are available for vision by using polarizing sunglasses.) Some of the light coming from the sky is polarized (bees use this phenomenon for navigation). The electrons in the air molecules cause a scattering of sunlight in all directions. This explains why the sky is not dark during the day. But when looked at from the sides, the light emitted from a specific electron is totally polarized.Halliday, David, Resnick, Robert (1966). Physics, p. 1167. John Wiley, New-York. Hence, a picture taken in a direction at 90 degrees from the sun can take advantage of this polarization. Actually, the effect is visible in a band of 15° to 30° measured from the optimal direction. Use of a polarizing filter, in the correct direction, will filter out the polarized component of skylight, darkening the sky; the landscape below it, and clouds, will be less affected, giving a photograph with a darker and more dramatic sky, and emphasizing the clouds.http://www.dslrtips.com/workshops/How_to_use_polarizing_filters/reduce_haze_deep_blue_sky.shtml Perpendicularly incident light waves tend to reduce clarity and saturation of certain colors, which increases haziness. The polarizing lens effectively absorbs these light waves, rendering outdoor scenes crisper with deeper color tones in subject matter such as blue skies, bodies of water and foliage. Much light is differentiated by polarization, e.g. light passing through crystals like sunstones (calcite) or water droplets producing rainbows. The polarization of the rainbow is caused by the internal reflection. The rays strike the back surface of the drop close to the Brewster angle.http://www.polarization.com/rainbow/rainbow.html Polarizing filters can be rotated to maximize or minimize admission of polarized light. They are mounted in a rotating collar for this purpose; one need not screw or unscrew the filter to adjust the effect. Rotating the polarizing filter will make rainbows, reflections, and other polarized light stand out or nearly disappear depending on how much of the light is polarized and the angle of polarization. The benefits of polarizing filters are the same in digital or film photography. While software post-processing can simulate many other types of filter, a photograph does not record the light polarization, so the effects of controlling polarization at the time of exposure cannot be replicated in software. == Types == There are two types of polarizing filters readily available, linear and circular, which have exactly the same effect photographically. But the metering and auto-focus sensors in certain cameras, including virtually all auto-focus single-lens reflex cameras (SLRs), will not work properly with linear polarizers because the beam splitters used to split off the light for focusing and metering are polarization-dependent. Linearly- polarized light may also defeat the action of the anti-aliasing filter (low- pass filter) on the imaging sensor. Circular polarizing photographic filters consist of a linear polarizer on the front, with a quarter-wave plate on the back. The quarter-wave plate converts the selected polarization to circularly polarized light inside the camera. This works with all types of cameras, because mirrors and beam-splitters split circularly polarized light the same way they split unpolarized light. Linear polarizing filters can be easily distinguished from circular polarizers. In linear polarizing filters, the polarizing effect works (rotate to see differences) regardless of which side of the filter the scene is viewed from. In \\"circular\\" polarizing filters, the polarizing effect works when the scene is viewed from the male threaded (back) side of the filter, but does not work when looking through it backwards. == Other effects == Polarizing filters reduce the light passed through to the film or sensor by about one to three stops (2–8×) depending on how much of the light is polarized at the filter angle selected. Auto-exposure cameras will adjust for this by widening the aperture, lengthening the time the shutter is open, and/or increasing the ASA/ISO speed of the camera. Polarizing filters can be used deliberately to reduce available light and allow use of wider apertures to shorten depth of field for certain focus effects. Some companies make adjustable neutral density filters by having two linear polarizing layers. When they are at 90° to each other, they let almost zero light in, admitting more as the angle decreases. ==See also== * Polarized 3D glasses ==References== ==External links== * Polarizer another must-have filter Category:Optical filters Category:Polarization (waves) Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Polarizing filter (photography)"},{"id":"3248059","text":"József Várszegi (also known as József Vennesz; 7 September 1910, in Győr – 12 June 1977, in Budapest) was a Hungarian athlete who competed in the javelin throw. Among his best results are a European Championships bronze medal from 1938 and an Olympic Games bronze from 1948. Várszegi won the Hungarian national championships a record 20 times between 1932 and 1952 and also broke the Hungarian national record six times during his career. ==Career== Várszegi was born in Győr and began to do athletics in local clubs Dunántúli AC and Győri AC. An all-around athlete in his youth, he competed both in running and throwing events, achieving his best results in javelin throw. In 1930 he won the national high school championships with a competition record of 52.22 metres. Later he went to study on the University of Physical Education in Budapest. His first major results came at International University Games, winning the javelin throw event in 1933 and finishing second in 1937. In addition he earned a sixth place in 1935. He also won the unofficial, German- led 1939 International University Games. He participated at his first European Championships in 1934, coming fifth with a distance of 65.81 metres. Four years later he finished third in the same event thanks to throw of 72.78 metres, with that he set a new national record which was broken only 17 years later. In 1936 Várszegi was present at the Olympic Games, where although he came through the qualifying round with the best result (69.7 meters), he did not manage to go anywhere near that distance in the final and eventually finished eighth. In the next decade due to the World War II there were no other major events held, however, the Hungarian Athletics Championships were not interrupted and took place in every year. Várszegi, who was unbeatable since 1932, extended his run during this period and won a total of 20 national titles until 1952, making him the most successful javelin thrower in the competition history. Várszegi did not participate at the 1946 European Championships, however, in the next year he competed at International University Games and won the gold medal for the second time after his success in 1933. The best achievement of Várszegi's career came in 1948, when at the Olympic Games in London he won the bronze medal in the javelin throw. His last major event was the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki at the age of 41. Várszegi failed to advance to the final round after he could not hit the qualifying limit of 64 metres and finished 23rd overall. After retirement from professional sport, Várszegi became a coach and worked for Vasas SC and Budapest Honvéd SE. He died in Budapest in 1977. ==References== Category:1910 births Category:1977 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Győr Category:Hungarian male javelin throwers Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1936 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1948 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1952 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic athletes of Hungary Category:Olympic bronze medalists for Hungary Category:European Athletics Championships medalists Category:Medalists at the 1948 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic bronze medalists in athletics (track and field) ","title":"József Várszegi"},{"id":"3248074","text":"Mimis Pierrakos Mimis Pierrakos, Greek: Μίμης Πιερράκος;1906-November 1940) a Greek footballer, was a co-player of Angelos Messaris and the top goalscorer for Panathinaikos in 1936, with 18 goals in 10 games.

The program focuses on two main human characters, Annie and Zach, who learn various life lessons from their friends Plato the bison, Aurora the red-tailed hawk, Aristotle the prairie dog, and Socrates the bobcat. These lessons are told in the form of animated segments based on stories from a variety of sources including Bible stories, fairy tales, fables, mythology, and folk stories from different cultures. Adventures originally aired as part of PBS's children's programming block from September 2, 1996 until the show's series finale in December 2000; an epilogue to the series would be released on home video in June 2001. There was a two-year gap in between the second and third seasons; the series' production ended in June 2000 when Fox Animation Studios ceased operations. Reruns of the series were broadcast on PBS Kids until September 4, 2005, and on Qubo from November 3, 2008 until September 24, 2017.http://qubo.com/show/adventures-from-the-books-of-virtues ==Plot== The series focuses on two best friends: 10-year-old Annie Redfeather, who is Native American, and 11-year-old Zach Nichols, who is white American. In each episode of the series, one of them commits an act contrary to that day's chosen virtue (loyalty, compassion, courage, moderation, honesty, etc.) and suffers pain as a result (be it physical or moral). They seek counsel of one of Annie's animal friends. These animal friends are four anthropomorphic mountain-dwelling entities who between them possess immense knowledge of legends and literature as well as common sense and a lively sense of fun. They utilize classical works of famous authors, philosophers, poets, as well as fables and myths to communicate the truth of virtue to Zach and Annie. Plato, the oldest, is a scholarly bison; Aurora, the most gentle, is a Red-tailed hawk; Socrates \\"Soch\\" is a rambunctious bobcat; and Aristotle \\"Ari\\" is a prairie dog who is seldom without his bag of books. These four, whose existence seems a secret from the majority of humans in the town of Spring Valley, advise Annie and Zach patiently and often. The children then proceed to live according to the virtue of the day, completing what they have begun. ==Cast== ===Principal voice actors=== * Pamela Adlon (seasons 1–2) and Andrew Francis (season 3) as Zach Nichols * Kath Soucie (seasons 1–2) and Adrienne Carter (season 3) as Annie Redfeather * Kevin Michael Richardson (seasons 1 & 2) and Christopher Judge (season 3) as Plato * Kath Soucie (seasons 1 & 2) and Gillian Barber (season 3) as Aurora * Frank Welker (season 1 & 2) and Michael Donovan (season 3) as Socrates * Jim Cummings (season 1 & 2) and Lee Tockar (season 3) as Aristotle Frank Welker also voices Aegeus, Minotaur, Dharma, Mongal Dog, The Man, and The Dog.

In June 1994, television producer Bruce D. Johnson, then an executive vice-president at Hanna-Barbera, was browsing through a bookstore in Washington, DC when he stumbled upon Bennett's 1993 book of moral tales, The Book of Virtues. Compelled by the book's themes, Johnson called Bennett with the idea of an animated television program for children based upon the book.\\"PBS Special Report: Program profiles: Adventures From the Book of Virtues.\\" (1997). Kidscreen, Nov. 1, 1997. According to Johnson: \\"...I placed a cold call to William Bennett. To my surprise, he takes the call; to my chagrin, he informs me that 19 other companies have already approached him, including Disney, and that he was 'down the road' on a probable deal at that moment. Nevertheless, I inform him of my experience producing anthologies and express an interest in producing his book wherever it ended up. We have a pleasant conversation, and he offhandedly asks me to fax my resume to him. I do.\\"\\"PBS Special Report: Program profiles: Adventures From the Book of Virtues.\\" (1997). Kidscreen, Nov. 1, 1997. Johnson and Bennett eventually met and bonded over their shared dedication to children's television and moral philosophy. From there, the two agreed to begin production on what would become Adventures.\\"PBS Special Report: Program profiles: Adventures From the Book of Virtues.\\" (1997). Kidscreen, Nov. 1, 1997. That same year in the 1994 midterm elections, the Republican Party won control of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate, giving the Party control of Congress for the first time in four decades. In January 1995, Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich expressed publicly his desire to \\"zero out\\" federal funding for PBS, stating, \\"Why would you say to some poor worker out here with three kids, 'We're now going to take your money and tax you for a program that you may never watch?'\\"Oullette, Laurie. (2002). Viewers Like You?: How Public TV Failed the People. New York: Columbia University Press. p. 1. As the debate over federal funding for public broadcasting was being waged in Congress, Johnson shopped the developing project around to various networks, hoping to find one that would air Adventures in a prime time slot. According to conservative commentator L. Brent Bozell III, the show was rejected by CBS, while ABC, Family Channel and HBO were interested but ultimately did not take it.L. Brent Bozell III, \\"Virtue is On the Air.\\" Media Research Center, Sept. 10, 1996. The final taker was PBS. Many conservative figures, including Bozell, approved of PBS's pickup of the series. When asked whether PBS was attempting to appease Congressional Republicans by accepting a series developed by a well-regarded Reagan cabinet appointee, PBS President Ervin S. Duggan denied, stating, \\"We are not buying Bill Bennett's opinions... The series is not political at all.\\"Zurawik, David. (1995). \\"Future brightens for PBS funding.\\" Baltimore Sun, July 27, 1995. The show sought to illustrate themes of common virtues through well-known international heroes and stories, based on Bennett's Book of Virtues. The core audience were families with children who were between the ages of 3 and 10 years old. Music was produced by J. A. C. Redford. ==Episodes== ===Series overview=== {class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" !colspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !rowspan=\\"2\\"Episodes !colspan=\\"2\\"Originally aired - !First aired !Last aired - dd4422\\" 1 13   - ffca14\\" 2 13   - 0057a9\\" 3 14   } ===Season 1: 1996–1997=== {class= - !# !!Title !!Aired !!Summary - 1 Work September 2, 1996 A thunderstorm strikes the forest, knocking a tree into the Rainbowl river. Zach and Annie volunteer to clean it out, along with Plato, Ari, and Aurora, but Soc isn't interested in helping. Plato tells him the story \\"How the Camel Got His Hump\\", where the camel's refusing to work gave him trouble, and \\"Tom Sawyer Gives Up the Brush\\", where it was learned that working is more enjoyable than laziness. Stories: *How the Camel Got His Hump *Tom Sawyer Gives Up the Brush - 2 Honesty September 2, 1996 Zach is sorely tempted to touch his father's beautiful antique camera, despite promising not to - and when he does, he breaks it and lies that it fell off its display table naturally. Plato tries to convince Zach to tell the truth by telling him the stories of \\"The Frog Prince\\", where the title character received a punishment for breaking his word and \\"George Washington and the Cherry Tree\\", whose protagonist too broke something he promised to guard but learned his lesson in a different way. Annie even tells a family tale of \\"The Indian Cinderella\\", where a Native American warrior only wished for an honest companion. Even the poem \\"Truth\\" shows how good it is to be seen and how much joy it can give through life. Stories: *The Frog Prince *George Washington and the Cherry Tree *The Indian Cinderella - 3 Responsibility September 3, 1996 Annie agrees to put her brand-new bike to good use by delivering cakes from her mother's bakery, but can't resist Zach's offer to race - and is angry with him when her bike crashes and the food is ruined. Plato and Aurora try to convince her that responsibility is always handy to keep around as shown in \\"Icarus and Daedalus\\" where a boy had too little responsibility to obey his father and paid for it, or \\"King Alfred and the Cakes\\" where even a renowned English ruler was forced to admit he neglected his simple duty. Ari tells \\"The Chest of Broken Glass\\", where a mother reminds her family what rewards responsibility versus irresponsibility bring and how much can be owed to those in a family. Even the poem \\"If You Were\\" sums up what responsibility everyone has to humanity for making the world better. Stories: *Icarus and Daedalus *King Alfred and the Cakes *The Chest of Broken Glass - 4 Compassion September 3, 1996 Emile Zigrodny, a classmate Zach barely knows, loses his house in a fire, and Zach is hesitant to show him support since their first meeting would be his giving charity. Plato and the others try to push him in the right direction by pointing out that anyone can be kind since even the least likely are capable of it as shown in the Biblical story \\"The Good Samaritan\\". They encourage him that anyone can make a difference no matter how young by reading \\"The Legend of the Dipper\\", or how it proved to have lasting effects for the giver and the receiver in \\"Androcles and the Lion\\". Even the poem \\"The New Colossus\\" shows what many hope America and all people should be to the needy. Stories: *The Good Samaritan *The Legend of the Dipper *Androcles and the Lion - 5 Courage September 4, 1996 Annie is defeated badly by a formidable opponent in a hurdles race, and her confidence leaves her after that. Plato tries to help her get her it back by telling the story of \\"Theseus and The Minotaur\\", where an opportunity was taken to protect people in spite of the danger, and of William Tell, who put plenty at risk for his own sake and others'. When Zach acts confident, Ari points out to them both that different levels of courage are needed in different situations, as shown in \\"The Brave Mice\\". Even the poem \\"If\\" is read as a reminder about how much courage life demands all in all. Stories: *Theseus and The Minotaur *The Brave Mice *William Tell - 6 Self-Discipline September 4, 1996 Zach offers Annie and the animals favors for money since he wants to buy a new game, but his mother won't give him an advance on his allowance at home. So the animals help him learn more about self-discipline and patience by telling stories. Plato tells him the story of \\"King Midas\\" and how he loved his gold so much, he wished that everything he'd touch would turn to gold, but got carried away due to his greed and lack of self-discipline. After Zach explains that he got into a fight with his mother about not giving him more money and said he'd be better off without her, Aurora tells \\"The King and His Hawk\\" where Genghis Khan didn't control his temper when he killed his pet hawk after it tried to stop him from drinking water poisoned by a snake. To teach Zach more about patience, Plato narrates \\"The Magic Thread\\" where a boy learned that experiencing only the good moments in life didn't turn out as he expected. Even a set of Bible verses from Ecclesiastes points out that \\"To Everything There is a Season\\". Afterwards, Zach realizes that the game he wanted doesn't come out till next week and heads home where he gives his mother a flower to apologize to her. Stories: *The Golden Touch *The King and His Hawk *The Magic Thread - 7 Friendship February 9, 1997 Annie is upset when her friend, Sarah picks a partner other than her on their school field trip canoeing, even though she agreed to pair up with her. Plato points out that friendship can take a lot of strength to build but it takes more to get through life without it by telling \\"Why Frog-child and Snake-child Never Play Together\\", where two creatures regret the lack of friendship in their lives. \\"Waukewa's Eagle\\" shows how compassion is occasionally found in real friendships by a Native American's relationship with a bird and saved it when his father advised him to put it out of its misery, and he reminds her of just how much true friendship is worth, as proved in \\"Damon and Pythias\\", where two best friends put ultimate trust in one another. Even the poem \\"New Friends and Old Friends\\" sets a good example of how long friendship should last. Stories: *Waukewa's Eagle *Damon and Pythias *Why Frog-child and Snake-child Never Play Together - 8 Loyalty February 9, 1997 Zach enjoys birdwatching with a man from town, but in climbing on a plaque to get up to a tree he breaks it and doesn't get why Mr. Cleveland is so worked up over it. Plato explains the meaning of one of the words on it, \\"loyalty\\", by telling the stories of \\"Yudisthira at Heaven's Gate\\", where a king is challenged to choose between a companion and his dreams, and \\"The Cap That Mother Made\\", where a boy is tempted with great things for a homemade cap. When Plato remembers that the plaque was a war memorial and Zach remembers that Mr. Cleveland knew someone who died there, he also brings up the story of the Jewish Persian queen Esther, who had to make the choice of risking life itself if she wished to save her own people. Even the poem \\"The Thousandth Man\\", shows how strong and great true loyalty is. Stories: *Yudisthira at Heaven's Gate *The Cap That Mother Made *Persian Queen Esther - 9 Respect February 16, 1997Zach and Annie are building a go-cart out of scraps from a friend's junkyard, but don't strike gold with every piece they find right away, and are ready to blame Jake Jeeters when he kicks them out after they yell at him. Plato hears their complaints and points out that manners leave a lasting impression, just as they did in the story \\"Please\\", and that the results for using and not using them are different by reading \\"Diamonds and Toads\\". & finally Plato points out that everyone deserves respect no matter who or what they are, with the telling of \\"The Bell of Atri\\", when a horse gets justice for its master improperly treating it. Stories: *Please *Diamonds and Toads *The Bell of Atri - 10 Faith February 16, 1997 Annie is saddened when her faith-devoted neighbor and friend Ruth passes away, and wonders whether faith is really worth it because of that. Plato tries to convince her that it is very much worth it by telling the stories of the Hebrew Daniel in the lions' den, who looked to faith always and saw how times of trouble caused it to prove strong, and \\"Harriet Tubman's determination\\" to use faith to continue taking risks throughout her life. Even the 23rd Psalm is a good example of why there's enough reason for faith to live throughout life. Stories: *Daniel in the Lions' Den *Harriet Tubman's determination - 11 Humility February 23, 1997 Annie is delighted to win the class presidency, but upon receiving it becomes proud of her position, creating conflicts with other students and teachers. Plato reminds her that a ruler's not swallowing pride often brings a painful fall to humiliation as proved in \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\". On the other hand, \\"King Canute at the Seashore\\" is noted as a reminder of how humility is a good thing for anybody but especially those trusted with power, but the mistakes made by a noble-blooded youth who thought only of what he could do with his power brought suffering to many in \\"Phaeton\\". Even the Serenity Prayer is read as a reminder of how much peace humility can bring. Stories: *The Emperor's New Clothes *King Canute at the Seashore *Phaeton - 12 Generosity February 23, 1997 Plato learns that Annie and Zach are collecting canned goods for a homeless shelter, but their first priority is the rewards they'll get instead of helping the hungry. He tries to explain how true giving requires selflessness, as shown in the story of \\"Rocking-Horse Land\\" where it's done between friends, and how it can be more satisfactory than receiving by telling \\"Old Man Rabbit's Thanksgiving Dinner\\". \\"The Gift of the Magi\\" is read as a reminder that even the thought of attempting to give something helps since it is the thought that counts. Even the poem \\"Count That Day Lost\\" is read as a reminder of exactly what giving, in any form, is worth in life. Stories: *Rocking-Horse Land *Old Man Rabbit's Thanksgiving Dinner *The Gift of the Magi - 13 Perseverance March 2, 1997 Zach and Annie have been taking lessons in guitar and karate, respectively, but now decide they don't want to stay in them anymore. Plato tries to remind them of how rewarding persistence can be by telling the stories of \\"Scarface\\", about a Native American warrior who was rewarded based on how hard he tried for something he wanted after saving a god's son from giant vulture-like birds of prey, and \\"The Stars in the Sky\\", where a girl learned how pleasing staying with a goal was afterward. A Greek hero's story in \\"Odysseus and the Cyclops\\" proved how important tenacity is in times of trouble. Even the poem \\"You Mustn't Quit\\" shows how important perseverance is through life. Stories: *Scarface *The Stars in the Sky *Odysseus and the Cyclops } ===Season 2: 1998=== {class= - !# !!Title !!Aired !!Summary - 14 Trustworthiness February 15, 1998 Zach is excited that a college football player that he has as his role model will attend his school pep rally, so volunteers to help out in order to meet him. But he doesn't think cleaning up for the assembly is worth it, and is prepared to go back on his word. Meanwhile, Sock is reluctant to help Ari find his misplaced glasses as promised because of his fear of tunnels. Plato explains that character is shown by letting actions compare to words as shown in \\"The Bear and the Travellers\\", where a badger learned of his companion's nature in a bad time, and in \\"The Knights of the Silver Shield\\" where one was rewarded based on his choices on how to see his job completed. Stories: *The Bear and the Travellers *Knights of the Silver Shield - 15 Determination February 22, 1998 Zach and Annie take off on a biking trail, determined to complete it before sun down. But when Zach has an accident and sprains his ankle, he and Annie tell each other stories of determination such as the myth of Proteus and Menelaus and the true story of courageous Jinkyswoitmaya. Stories: *Proteus and Menelaus *Jinkyswoitmaya - 16 Integrity March 1, 1998 Annie gets more orders for her craft weather vanes than she can deliver right away, so rushes through them to sell them on time - then gets complaints about how they're dysfunctional. Plato encourages her to consider what the results show by telling \\"For Want of a Horseshoe Nail\\", where one incomplete task led to a remarkably high amount of trouble, and \\"Charlemagne and the Robber Knight\\", where a German emperor's thoughtfulness in how to deal with people proved life-saving. Stories: *For Want of a Horseshoe Nail *Charlemagne and the Robber Knight - 17 Gratitude March 8, 1998 Zach plans to invite a lot of classmates to his birthday party—more guests means more gifts!--until his parents tell him that they can only afford a small party for Zach's closest friends. Disappointed, Zach retreats to Plato's Peak where he hears tales on gratitude: \\"The Discontented Stonecutter\\", which warns that the grass is not greener on the other side of the fence and \\"Cornelia's Jewels\\", where a proud mother reminds a snobbish rival that people are more important than riches. Stories: *The Discontented Stonecutter *Cornelia's Jewels - 18 Selflessness March 15, 1998 Annie's enthusiasm about her family's upcoming spring vacation doesn't last when she learns her mother wants her to be a part-time sitter for her little cousins. Plato tries to explain how helping out can bring rewards, as shown in \\"The Line of Golden Light\\", or should at least bring joy, as it did to a knight in \\"Saint George and the Dragon\\". Stories: *The Line of Golden Light *Saint George and the Dragon - 19 Honor March 22, 1998 Zach needs a 90 on his history test to get an A minus on his report card and just make the school honor roll. And it looks like he's done it...until he realizes his teacher added the points wrong and he only got an 87. If he tells, he'll lose the honor he wanted so badly to win. But the tales of \\"The Honest Woodsman\\" and President Abraham Lincoln help him realize there's a more important kind of honor at stake. Stories: *The Honest Woodsman *Abraham Lincoln - 20 Patience March 29, 1998 Annie volunteers to tutor a younger student in math, but grows openly frustrated with him when it doesn't turn out as easy as she hoped, then regrets her offer to help to begin with. Plato tries to convince her that patience can make a difference, just like it did with another teacher, Anne Sullivan, who was forced to test every bit of hers to help her pupil, Helen Keller. He also shows how swallowing impatience in front of others brings satisfaction in \\"How the Brazilian Beetles Got Their Coats\\". Stories: *Anne Sullivan & Helen Keller *How the Brazilian Beetles Got Their Coats - 21 Charity April 5, 1998 Annie and Zach are saddened to see some families in town don't have any heat or warm clothes for the cold winter, and wish someone could help. Plato explains how anyone can make a difference and even tells them the story of how a monk's giving to those in need was enough reward for him throughout his life in \\"The Emerald Lizard\\". The two are eager to donate many clothes to the families who need them, and Annie is even willing to offer her favorite coat - but soon wishes she never had done that. Hoping to bring out the satisfaction for her that everyone should feel after giving, Plato tells the story \\"Mr. Straw\\", where a poor man finds wealth through generosity to others. Stories: *The Emerald Lizard *Mr. Straw - 22 Leadership April 12, 1998 Zach doesn't think much of his football captain, until he's elected to the job himself and sees how hard it is to lead. Plato tries to encourage him how to make the job work by telling \\"The Tower to the Moon\\", where selflessness was needed to guide people through a task, and \\"The Gordian Knot\\", where the ability to think clearly was needed before any glory. Stories: *The Tower to the Moon *The Gordian Knot - 23 Citizenship April 19, 1998 Annie is disappointed that her family's vacation is postponed since her father has jury duty, and wonders why he simply doesn't postpone it. Plato explains citizenship can reward good character, as shown in \\"The Stone in the Road\\" where those with and without it are repaid accordingly, and even if it doesn't, can make differences for the better, as a Roman demonstrates in \\"Cincinnatus\\" by leading when and how he believes he must during war. Stories: *The Stone in the Road *Cincinnatus - 24 Diligence April 26, 1998 Zach decides he wants to be a photographer. He is diligent in his study of photography, until the school newspaper offers him what he considers a thankless assignment taking pictures for their new classified ads section. Zach is disappointed. With guidance from Plato and Aurora, he realizes he should apply himself to this assignment with the same diligence he originally had for learning photography. - 25 Moderation May 3, 1998 Annie wants to play baseball so works hard at it, but starts to spend too little time on schoolwork. Plato points out that involving too much in something doesn't mean it brings reward, as a creature learns in \\"The Spider's Two Feasts\\" where determination to take much forced him to make a decision he didn't handle well, and a farmer learns in \\"The Goose That Laid the Golden Egg\\", where working too hard for something and not thinking of anything else proved disappointing. Stories: *The Spider's Two Feasts *The Goose That Laid the Golden Egg - 26 Wisdom May 10, 1998 Faced with the prospect of attending a new school, Zach wonders whether he is wise enough to make new friends or handle his new, more difficult studies. A story told up at Plato's Peak, and a recap of his and Annie's past adventures, help him realize that he is wiser than he thought. } ===Season 3: 2000=== {class= - !# !!Title !!Aired !!Summary - 27 Integrity September 24, 2000 Zach's dad brings a model replica of an artifact from Egypt for him to use on his history project, but Zach is embarrassed that it is fake and claims it is a real artifact - then trouble occurs when his teacher wonders if he can put it on display at a museum. Plato reminds him that exaggerating tall tales never pay off, as another found out in \\"The Boy Who Cried Wolf\\" when he wasn't believed even when he was truthful since he had a habit of lying. - 28 Work October 1, 2000 Annie chooses to build an electric motor for her science project but has a tough time with it so is ready to quit. Plato reminds her of a pair who wanted to build a machine but had to put a lot of effort into making the first airplane in \\"The Wright Brothers\\". - 29 Friendship October 8, 2000 Zach's new track-teammate is so skilled, Zach thinks he has to compete with him rather than try to befriend him. Plato points out that friends are interesting people since they can come from anywhere, and proves it by telling the story of another pair of rivals who ended up friends in \\"Robin Hood and Little John\\". - 30 Courage October 15, 2000 Zach is asked to deliver his father's film to the film laboratory, but is distracted on the way and chooses to go hiking first - then is trapped by a steep wall. Ari and Sock arrive with a rope after they find him, and while helping him, tell him the moralized version of the story of \\"Zach and the Beanstalk\\" to help him face his obstacle - and his problem of admitting he missed the opportunity to do his work. - 31 Perseverance October 22, 2000 Racing with Zach in the woods, Annie is quickly outrun and is unhappy enough about it to want to quit when she runs into Plato and the others. They remind her of another racer whose odds were against him but managed to win something even greater than a race when he persisted in \\"The Tortoise and the Hare\\". - 32 Honesty October 29, 2000 Annie agrees to give Zach $15 if he'll paint her fence for her, but later is reluctant to pay up. Plato tells the story of \\"The Pied Piper\\" as a reminder of how those who don't keep their word usually end up paying a higher price for dishonor than they would otherwise. - 33 Responsibility November 5, 2000 Annie is left to tend her uncle and aunt's garden, but is distracted by an invitation to play ball with some friends, so neglects it badly. Plato recites the poem \\"The Pupil in Magic\\" as a reminder that not taking care of duties quickly leads to trouble, as learned by a magician's apprentice whose trick of transforming a broom to carry water for him caused chaos. - 34 Self-Discipline November 12, 2000 Zach spends too much time playing a video-game when he should be reading his scout manual, so isn't ready for their camp-out. Plato reminds him too much of a good thing can hurt, as shown in \\"The Dancing Horses of Sybaris\\", where a whole community ended up suffering because they put pleasure before work. - 35 Moderation November 19, 2000 When a new TV channel showing all the most popular movies airs, Zach promises his family he can watch it if he finishes all his homework and does his chores, but is unable to keep his promise. Plato reminds him that moderation is a good way to live, proved in \\"The Cat and The Parrot\\", where a greedy animal gained nothing but trouble from his indulgence. - 36 Humility November 26, 2000 After boasting about how good she is at snowboarding, Annie feels bold enough to take a dare to ride down Deadmans Bluff, without thinking of the dangers it might bring. Nobody can convince her to change her mind, until Plato tells the story of \\"Pecos Bill and Slue-Foot Sue\\", where a foolhardy risk led to a bad situation. - 37 Gratitude December 3, 2000 Annie is glum when she gets a postcard from a New York City friend and wishes she lived somewhere more interesting like New York. Plato points out that Spring Valley has its fair share of advantages and tells the story of \\"The Country Mouse and the City Mouse\\", where a creature becomes grateful for the plain and routine home she has for its safety. - rowspan=\\"2\\"38–39 rowspan=\\"2\\"A Christmas Carol December 10, 2000 rowspan=\\"2\\"In the series finale, Annie is elected to be president of the drama club just in time for the Christmas pageant, but soon becomes obsessed with how much money will be made so forgets about the point of the message the play is trying to send when they do Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol and dreams that she is Scrooge, Zach is Bob Crachit, Plato is Jacob Marley, Aristotle is the Ghost of Christmas Past, Socrates is the Ghost of Christmas Present, and Aurora is the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. Annie later mentions her dream to Plato, who reads A Christmas Carol to explain what they tell her - and remind that throughout the year, but especially at Christmas, giving to others is the greatest gift to give and the greatest reward. - December 17, 2000 - 40 Plato's Guide for Parents and Kids June 3, 2001 In the epilogue of the series, Plato the Buffalo and friends from Adventures from the Book of Virtues dispense advice on how best to handle the sometimes challenging aspects of parenting, focusing on the issue of character development in children. Fun-filled stories from the series provide answers for both kids and adults on many of the ongoing dilemmas faced by today's families. The VHS was released on June 12, 2001. } ==Home releases== Turner Home Entertainment, under license to PBS Home Video, released various video tapes of the series during 1996–1997. They were later re-released through Warner Home Video and Paramount Home Entertainment. During 2008 and 2010, PorchLight Entertainment released various DVDs of the series. The series became available for streaming with the launch of Yippee in December 2019. ==References== ==External links== *Official website (Archive) * Category:1996 American television series debuts Category:2000 American television series endings Category:1990s American animated television series Category:2000s American animated television series Category:American animated television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:American children's animated adventure television series Category:American children's animated anthology television series Category:American children's animated fantasy television series Category:PBS original programming Category:PBS Kids shows Category:YTV (TV channel) original programming Category:Television series by Fox Television Animation Category:American television shows based on children's books Category:Animated television series about birds Category:Animated television series about cats Category:Animated television series about children Category:Animated television series about dogs ","title":"Adventures from the Book of Virtues"},{"id":"3248110","text":"The New England Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) is a jurisdictional synod (similar to a diocese in the Roman Catholic or Episcopal churches), consisting of all of the New England states (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont), as well as the Lake Champlain area of eastern New York state.

Pasachoff is Field Memorial Professor of Astronomy at Williams College and the author of textbooks and tradebooks in astronomy, physics, mathematics, and other sciences. ==Biography== After the Bronx High School of Science, Pasachoff studied at Harvard, receiving his bachelor's degree in 1963, his master's degree in 1965, and his doctorate in 1969. His doctoral thesis was titled Fine Structure in the Solar Chromosphere. He worked at the Harvard College Observatory and Caltech before going to Williams College in 1972. His sabbaticals and other leaves have been at the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy, the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris, the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Caltech in Pasadena, California and most recently at the Carnegie Observatories, also in Pasadena. He has taken a leading role in the science and history of transits of Mercury and Venus, as an analogue to exoplanet studies, leading up to the transit of Venus, and the 2016 and 2019 transits of Mercury. Jay Pasachoff on solar eclipses: \\"Each time is like going to the seventh game of the World Series with the score tied in the ninth inning.\\" ==Work== Pasachoff observes with a wide variety of ground- based telescopes and spacecraft, and reports on those activities in writing his texts. Pasachoff has carried out extensive scientific work at total solar eclipses, and has championed the continued contemporary scientific value of solar eclipse research. His research has been sponsored by the National Science Foundation, NASA, and the National Geographic Society. He is Chair of the Working Group on Eclipses of the International Astronomical Union of the Sun and Heliosphere Division and of the Education, Outreach, and Heritage Division. His solar work also includes studies of the solar chromosphere, backed by NASA grants, using NASA spacecraft and the 1-m Swedish Solar Telescope on La Palma, Canary Islands, Spain. With Richard Cohan and his sister, Nancy Pasachoff, Pasachoff wrote in 1970 an article for Nature discussing that the belief in the supernatural such as horoscopes impede the growth of science. He has collaborated with a professor of art history, Roberta J. M. Olson of the New-York Historical Society, on astronomical images in the art of Renaissance Italy, Great Britain, the U.S. (eclipse oil paintings), and elsewhere. Jay and Naomi Pasachoff wrote a review of Alexander Borodin’s solar-inspired opera for Nature produced by the New York Metropolitan Opera in 2014. Also with his wife, Naomi, Pasachoff wrote biographies of Henry Norris Russell, John Pond, Hypatia, and Edward Williams Morley for the Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers. Their books and other publications are listed at http://solarcorona.com as links to publishers’ websites. Pasachoff received the 2003 Education Prize of the American Astronomical Society, \\"For his eloquent and informative writing of textbooks from junior high through college, For his devotion to teaching generations of students, For sharing with the world the joys of observing eclipses, For his many popular books and articles on astronomy, For his intense advocacy on behalf of science education in various forums, For his willingness to go into educational nooks where no astronomer has gone before, the AAS Education Prize is awarded to Jay M. Pasachoff.\\" Asteroid 5100 Pasachoff recognizes Pasachoff's astronomical accomplishments. In addition to his college astronomy texts, Pasachoff has written Peterson Field Guide to the Stars and Planets, and is author or coauthor of textbooks in calculus and in physics, as well as several junior-high-school textbooks. Pasachoff received the 2012 Prix- Jules–Janssen from the Société astronomique de France,\\"for your outstanding research, teaching and popularisation of Astronomy, in the spirit with which Camille Flammarion created the award back in 1897.\\" He received the 2017 Richtmyer Memorial Award from the American Association of Physics Teachers \\"for outstanding contributions to physics and effectively communicating those contributions to physics educators.\\" He received the 2019 Klumpke-Roberts Award of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific \\"for his contributions to the public understanding and appreciation of astronomy\\", based in part on his role at the times of solar eclipses, when \\"Jay becomes astronomy's cheerleader-in- chief, allowing more and more people to become interested and engaged in the field.\\" Pasachoff collaborated with scientists from Williams College and MIT to observe the atmospheres of outer planets and their moons, including Pluto, its moon Charon, Neptune’s moon Triton, and other objects in the outer solar system. He has also using radio astronomy made observations of the interstellar medium, concentrating on deuterium. Pasachoff has been active in educational and curriculum matters. He was U.S. National Liaison to and was President (2003–2006) Commission on Education and Development, which is now Commission C1 on Astronomy Education and Development of Division C on Education, Outreach, and Heritage, of the International Astronomical Union. He has twice been Chair of the Astronomy Division of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and has been on the astronomy committees of the American Astronomical Society (and its representative 2004–2013 to the AAAS), the American Physical Society, and the American Association of Physics Teachers. He was on the Council of Advisors of the Astronomy Education Review. He has spearheaded a discussion of what should be taught in astronomy courses, championing the position of including and emphasizing contemporary astronomy. He is a Fellow of the American Physical Society, the International Planetarium Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, and the Royal Astronomical Society, and he has held a Getty Fellowship. He was elected a Legacy Fellow of the American Astronomical Society in 2020. He has lectured widely, including a stint as a Sigma Xi Distinguished Lecturer. He is also Director of the Hopkins Observatory and (in rotation, most recently beginning in the fall semester of 2019) Chair of the Astronomy Department at Williams. Pasachoff has been Chair of the Historical Astronomy Division of the American Astronomical Society (2013-2015). He is on the Organizing Committee for Commission C.C3 on the History of Astronomy of the International Astronomical Union (2015-2018) and on the Johannes Kepler Working Group.

Introduced by executive producer Barbara Emile in 1994, Roy is scripted as a love interest for Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement). Caunter remained a regular character until new executive producer Louise Berridge axed him in 2003, a decision which she later stated she regretted. ==Storylines== Roy arrives in Albert Square with his son Barry (Shaun Williamson) at the end of 1994, a successful car-dealer and business associate of David Wicks (Michael French). While undertaking business arrangements, Roy meets and is instantly attracted to David's mother Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement). Recently separated from her former husband Frank (Mike Reid), who has mysteriously disappeared, Pat is unwilling to begin a new romance with Roy. However, David, sensing that it may benefit a favorable outcome between their businesses, encourages the relationship and the pair soon fall in love and move in together. The relationship suffers a setback when it is revealed that Roy is unable to consummate his love for Pat because he has been impotent for many years. Although Pat is understanding, Roy nevertheless feels emasculated. Eventually they both agree that love and companionship are more important than sex. Pat and Roy's relationship blossoms until the reappearance, on Christmas Day 1995, of Frank – who has come home to claim his business and his wife. Frank and Roy are involved in a feud over the ownership of the car lot and Frank continuously tries to convince Pat to resume their relationship. Despite Frank stirring up buried feelings in Pat and a secret one-night stand, she ends up divorcing him and marries Roy in 1996. After David flees Walford, Roy buys his share in the car lot, and renames it Evans & Son. Preferring to take a back seat, he leaves the running of the business to Barry. Unfortunately Barry is not up to the job and after grifter Vanessa Carlton, steals Roy's hard-earned fortune, he is forced to sell his other business (Manor Wood) and come out of retirement. Roy's health suffers because of this, and he gives his family a scare when he is rushed to hospital after suffering a heart attack. With bailiffs knocking on his door, and with Roy unfit to work, Pat turns to Frank to bail them out. An unwilling Roy eventually accepts Frank's help. However, his animosity towards Frank continues and when his son informs him of a suspected affair between Pat and Frank, he becomes suicidal and flees Walford in a speeding car, threatening to throw himself off a multi-storey car park. However, he is found by Frank, who persuades Roy to rethink. They manage to put their differences aside and soon after, Roy and Pat forge a strong friendship with Frank and his love interest Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor). Frank becomes a 'silent' partner in the car lot, providing the much needed cash while Roy deals with the running of the business. Despite suffering with angina, Roy's torment over his inability to perform sexually prompts him to illegally buy Viagra. However, after suffering serious side effects that almost kill him, he eventually turns to counselling to fix the problem. During the sessions, it is revealed that his impotence occurred straight after the death of his first wife Doreen, who died from complications while giving birth to his daughter (who also died shortly after her birth), more than 20 years earlier. Roy later reveals that he was in bed with another woman at the time and he was never able to forgive himself. Money is still tight for Roy in 2000, and wanting to give his wife a more luxurious lifestyle, he gets involved with a car scam, instigated by Frank's hostile stepson and local mechanic Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). The usually honest Roy agrees to sell stolen, re-conditioned cars for large sums of money. However, it is not long before Frank's daughter Janine (Charlie Brooks) discovers this and informs Peggy, who is furious and even more annoyed when she discovers Frank is not receiving a share of the money. Roy is eventually forced to stop the scam and the cars are all sold off at a loss. Peggy agrees to keep Frank and Pat in the dark, but soon after, she becomes in desperate need of money in order to pay off her enemy Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass). The scam is started again, with Frank also heavily involved. However, Janine maliciously informs Dan about the scam and he in turn reports them to the police. Dan quickly informs Peggy that the police are on the way, claiming that he overheard a punter reporting the scam. Pat, Peggy and Dan manage to remove the cars before the police arrive and they avoid arrest. However, with a furious Pat now knowing about her husband's dishonesty, she goes behind his back, sells his cars for scrap and gives the money to charity. Peggy and Frank are then unable to pay Dan, while Pat throws Roy out of their marital home. Pat feels that she cannot trust Roy any longer and begins contemplating divorce. Roy spends his time drinking heavily, sleeping in the office of the car lot and threatening to turn himself in to the police. Eventually, when Roy attempts to move out permanently, Pat relents and allows him to stay, but tells him that it will take a long time to earn her trust again. After many weeks sleeping on the sofa, Pat finally makes up with Roy and he, along with Phil and Frank, eventually get revenge on Dan by conning him to sign back his share of The Queen Victoria public house. Roy faces more marital problems that year when he and Pat are on a joint holiday in Spain with Frank and Peggy. Frank seduces Pat and they end up in bed. Their affair continues back in Walford and they plan to elope. However, Pat changes her mind at the last minute and calls the relationship off. But it is too late, as Frank has already left a goodbye note telling Peggy he still loves Pat and is leaving her. This culminates in a huge showdown in The Queen Vic, where Peggy tells the punters what Frank and Pat have planned. Roy is initially willing to forgive Pat, but Barry then alerts him to a suitcase containing massage oil, fishnet stockings and a red Basque, which Pat had been planning to take with her when she ran away with Frank. Roy is furious and evicts Pat. However, he forgives her three months later, when she heads to the airport to leave Walford and move to New Zealand to be with her son Simon. Despite objections from Barry, she moves back in with Roy soon after. The dynamics of the relationship change completely after this, with Roy being very much in charge. Later in 2001, Jane Williams (Ann Mitchell), the woman Roy had been having an affair with at the time of his wife's death, arrives in Walford, terminally ill. She has contacted Roy because she wants to tell him that he is the father of her son, Nathan Williams (Doug Allen), who is by now well into his twenties. The news upsets the balance in the Evans household, and his relationship with Barry severely suffers as he is devastated to learn that his father was unfaithful to his dead mother, as well as the revelation that he had a brother he knew nothing about. Jane dies in January 2002, leaving Nathan penniless and bankrupt. With nowhere to go, Nathan turns to Roy and soon moves in with the Evanses. The pair bond until it is revealed that Nathan has attempted to seduce Barry's wife Natalie (Lucy Speed) and set him up for the theft of money from the car lot. An angry Roy banishes Nathan from their lives and tells him he never wants to see him again. In March 2003, stress finally gets the better of Roy when he discovers Pat is helping Natalie hide her affair with Frank's son, Ricky (Sid Owen). Roy feels Pat has chosen Frank over him because she helped Frank's offspring over his own. This leads to Roy's second heart attack. Roy later dies in hospital, leaving Pat bereft and homeless after Barry kicks her out. ==Creation and development== Roy was one of the introductions of series producer Barbara Emile in 1994. He was introduced primarily to be a love interest to Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement). Actor Brian Croucher was shortlisted for the role; however, the production decided they did not want to use him for the part of Roy, and as Caunter and Croucher shared the same agent, Caunter was suggested for the part and was successful. Croucher was later cast as Ted Hills. Caunter has said that he was only brought in originally as a temporary replacement for Pat's husband Frank Butcher (Mike Reid), whose actor was taking a hiatus \\"but fortunately the storylines were quite good so they kept me in\\". Scripted as a successful businessman, Roy moved to the soap's setting of Walford in 1995. Caunter commented to fan magazine, Walford Gazette: \\"I think there was that concern in the beginning [about reasons why a wealthy man like Roy would move to Walford] but the writers created a plausible reason for him to move into the Square. He's from that environment initially; he's an East End boy. He's not a posh gent although he does know about good wine and fine dining. He really loves Pat and she didn't want to leave because her family and friends were there and by then he'd have done anything for Pat. He'd reached a time in his life when he desperately wanted a good home life with a good woman. He was already semi- retired and could afford to sit back and smell the roses, so to speak – and he wanted to smell them with Pat!\\" A notable storyline in Roy's narrative is his disclosure to Pat that he is impotent. Caunter believes the writers made Roy impotent because they were concerned about Pat having sex with someone so soon after her husband Frank absconded. The dangers of viagra were explored in the storyline, when Roy, after suffering from angina, illegally buys the drug and suffers life-threatening repercussions, which leads to him attempting counselling instead. In 2002, it was announced that Roy was being written out of the soap. Caunter said playing Roy had been \\"the happiest period of my career. We felt we'd done enough with Roy, and it was time for me to move on. I will miss working alongside my screen family and all the team at EastEnders, but I look forward to trying out some new roles.\\" Executive producer Louise Berridge said, \\"The character of Roy has been invaluable to us. He provides a centre of stability it will be hard to replace, and represents a sense of values we must make sure we retain. I agree that it's time for the character to move on, but we will all miss Tony very much. Apart from being always the consummate professional, he is also a really lovely man, and we all wish him every success in whatever he turns his hand to next.\\" In 2003, it was reported that Roy would depart the serial by being killed off. A source told the Daily Mirror, \\"He decided to leave the show but wanted scriptwriters to leave the door open for his character to return for guest spots. Sadly, the producers have closed that door by killing him off. Tony is disappointed by the way he'll be leaving Albert Square. He's a popular character and viewers will be sad to see him go.\\" Roy suffered a fatal heart attack following the breakdown of his son Barry's (Shaun Williamson) marriage to Natalie (Lucy Speed), making his final appearance in March 2003. In 2010, in an interview with website Walford web, Berridge reflected on Roy's axing, saying that she did regret it in retrospect: \\"[Roy's] personality didn’t generate story material, but in his case he was also beginning to stifle Pat. John Yorke and I share a great passion for the old, wild dangerous Pat who wore the white mac and looked as if she chewed up broken bottles for breakfast, but the Pat we had [at that time] had become too safe and comfortable. She’d had her affair story with Frank – and since he was and is the love of her life, if she didn’t leave [Roy] for Frank she wasn’t going to do it for anyone else. To galvanise Pat we had to lose Roy. But I wish now we’d found some other way. Roy had a stability about him that we needed, and losing both him and Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) within a year left us a kind of moral hole in the centre of the show. Those older ‘good’ characters have a role that extends far beyond the immediate gratification of story – as Lou Beale did in the past.\\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:EastEnders characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1994 Category:Fictional businesspeople Category:Fictional salespeople Category:Male characters in television Category:Fictional attempted suicides ","title":"Roy Evans (EastEnders)"},{"id":"3248123","text":"Son Sann (; 5 October 191119 December 2000) was a Cambodian politician and anti-communist resistance leader who served as the 22nd Prime Minister of Cambodia (1967-68) and later as President of the National Assembly (1993). A devout Buddhist, he fathered seven children and was married. His full honorary title is \\"Samdech Borvor Setha Thipadei Son Sann\\" (). ==Early life== Son Sann was born at Phnom Penh in 1911. Son Sann's family was of Khmer Krom background; both of his parents came from wealthy landowning families in Trà Vinh Province, Vietnam. Son Sann's father, Son Sach moved to Cambodia prior to Son Sann's birth to serve as an official for Sisowath Souphanouvong, a brother of King Monivong.Corfield (1994), p. 5 Son Sann studied in Phnom Penh and later Paris, where he graduated from the École des Hautes Études Commerciales in 1933. He briefly spent time in London, learning English in the process. Having returned to Cambodia in 1935 he joined the Civil Service, serving in the provinces of Prey Veng and later Battambang where he was in charge of trade. Son Sann was also a member of a Cambodian economic mission to Tokyo in 1941. ==Political career== An early supporter of the Khmer Democratic Party, Son Sann became a member of its steering committee. He served as the vice- president of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Finance in the Sisowath Youtévong government from 1946-47. Following the death of Youtévong he retained his post as vice-president of the council of ministers (effectively Deputy Premier)Cambodian Envoy Off to Paris, New York Times, May 31, 1973, Thursday until February 1948 and in 1949, he was the vice chairman of the Council of Ministers. He became Foreign Minister in June 1950-March 1951. Following the \\"crushing\\" of the Democrat Party in 1952, he resigned from the leadership of the party. He re-entered politics as a member of the Sangkum party and served in several governments in the late 1950s to the early 1960s holding various posts before becoming president of the National Bank of Cambodia (1955–1968). ===House arrest and France=== Following the 1970 coup against Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Son Sann was placed under house arrest and later left for France. In June 1970 he went to Beijing to attempt a reconciliation between Sihanouk and Lon Nol, who had overthrown him. He continued with these efforts even after the October proclamation of the Khmer Republic and by late 1971 he had gained the support of politicians and diplomats in Cambodia, France and China. However, in 1972 the Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai denounced the initiative and Lon Nol responded by naming himself President of the Khmer Republic. ===Return to Cambodia=== In 1978, he formed the Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) to unite anti-communist refugees on the Thai-Cambodia border following the 1979 Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. The KPNLF later joined with the Armeè Nationale Sihanouk to form the non-communist resistance and in 1982, the KPNLF joined with Sihanouk and the Party of Democratic Kampuchea to form the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea.Two old enemies fight Cambodia war, Christian Science Monitor, October 23, 1985 Son Sann was named Prime Minister in the new coalition government. ===United States support=== In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Son Sann drew some limited military and financial support from the United States, which sought to assist his movement as part of the Reagan Doctrine effort to counter Soviet and Vietnamese involvement in Cambodia. One of the Reagan Doctrine's principal architects, The Heritage Foundation's Michael Johns, visited with Sonn Sann and KPNLF forces in Cambodia in 1987, and returned to Washington urging expanded U.S. support for the KPNLF and the resistance forces of Norodom Sihanouk as a third alternative to both the Vietnamese- installed and supported Cambodian government and the Khmer Rouge, which also was resisting the government.\\"Cambodia at a Crossroads\\", Michael Johns, The World and I magazine, February 1988 The U.S. responded by providing limited military and humanitarian aid to the Sonn Sann and Sihanouk resistance forces in Cambodia in an effort to pressure the Vietnamese to leave Cambodia and also to build a non-communist opposition alternative to the Khmer Rouge. Following Cambodia's Paris Peace Agreement, Son Sann formed a new political party, the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party in 1992 and participated in the 1993 elections. Son Sann was elected along with nine other members of the party and served as a minority member in the coalition government. He was President of the National Assembly from June to October 1993. In 1997, Son Sann left Cambodia again for Paris, where he remained with his family until his death from heart failure, on 19 December 2000, at 89 years of age.Former Cambodian Prime Minister Son Sann Dies, People's Daily, December 20, 2000 ==Honour== ===Foreign honour=== * : Honorary Commander of the Order of the Defender of the Realm (1963) == References == ==Bibliography== * - - - - - Category:1911 births Category:2000 deaths Category:20th century in Cambodia Category:20th-century Cambodian politicians Category:Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party politicians Category:Sangkum politicians Category:Cambodian emigrants to France Category:Cambodian expatriates in France Category:Cambodian anti-communists Category:Cambodian nationalists Category:Finance ministers of Cambodia Category:Foreign ministers of Cambodia Category:Government ministers of Cambodia Category:Governors of the National Bank of Cambodia Category:Cambodian Buddhists Category:Khmer Krom people Category:People from Phnom Penh Category:Presidents of the National Assembly (Cambodia) Category:Members of the National Assembly (Cambodia) Category:Prime Ministers of Cambodia Category:Honorary Commanders of the Order of the Defender of the Realm Category:HEC Paris alumni ","title":"Son Sann"},{"id":"3248132","text":"ApeXtreme is a cancelled video game console that was developed by Apex Digital.

McDougal (August 25, 1940 – March 8, 1998), a native of White County, Arkansas, and his wife, Susan McDougal (the former Susan Carol Henley), were financial partners with Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton in the real estate venture that led to the Whitewater political scandal of the 1990s. Starting in 1982, McDougal operated Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association. ==Political career== McDougal was a Democrat and a former aide to the late U.S. Senator James William Fulbright. He later was a political science professor at Ouachita Baptist University in Arkadelphia. In 1982, McDougal made a failed bid for the United States House of Representatives against the Republican incumbent John Paul Hammerschmidt in Arkansas's northwesterly Third Congressional District. Hammerschmidt polled 133,909 votes (66 percent) to McDougal's 69,089 (34 percent). Clinton himself had been defeated by Hammerschmidt in the same district in 1974. McDougal entered the political arena again at the height of the Whitewater controversy, running in the 1994 Democratic Primary in Arkansas' Fourth Congressional District, in South Arkansas. McDougal ran last in a three-man race, getting 23% of the vote in a primary won by State Senator Jay Bradford of Pine Bluff, who, in turn, lost the general election to a first-term representative, Republican Jay Dickey in 1994's \\"Battle of the Jays\\". ==Controversies== On April 14, 1997, he was convicted of 18 felony counts of fraud and conspiracy charges. The counts had to do with bad loans made by Madison in the late 1980s. As his savings and loan was federally insured, the $68 million was paid by taxpayers. During the case, special prosecutor Kenneth Starr requested a reduced sentence because of McDougal's assistance in the investigation. He joined with his wife, who later divorced him, and the Clintons to borrow $203,000 to buy land in the Ozark Mountains for vacation homes. When the development failed, he attempted to cover the losses with savings-and-loan funds. Prosecuted for fraud in 1984, he hired the Rose Law Firm, which had Hillary Clinton as a partner, to defend him. McDougal held a fundraiser, which paid off Bill Clinton's campaign debt of $50,000. Madison cashier's checks accounted for $12,000 of the funds that were raised. McDougal was also found by federal regulators to have made fraudulent loans with regard to his Castle Grande project, a real estate development 10 minutes south of Little Rock. The project was a lot on which he hoped to build microbrewery, shopping center, a trailer park, and other future projects in 1985. The sale price was $1.75 million. Since state regulations prohibited him from investing more than 6% of his savings-and-loan assets in the project, he put in $600,000 of Madison Guaranty money and had Seth Ward put in the difference, which was $1.15 million. Ward lent the money from Madison Guaranty as a non-recourse loan. ==Death== McDougal died of a heart attack at the Federal Correctional Facility in Fort Worth, Texas, aged 57. ==References== ==External links== *Washington Post time line *CNN whitewater report *CNN report *Caught In The Whitewater - CBS *CNN Report: McDougal had no access to his heart medication nor doctors just before his death * Hickman Ewing reduced Jim McDougal's prison sentence in exchange for testimony that Susan McDougal refused to confirm. *Rose Law Firm Billing Records, PBS, WGBH educational foundation, Frontline *Labaton, Stephen. \\"Appraiser on Madison Loans in Plea Accord\\", New York Times, December 6, 1994 *Snopes.com on Jim McDougal's death Category:1940 births Category:1998 deaths Category:American fraudsters Category:American white-collar criminals Category:American real estate businesspeople Category:American people who died in prison custody Category:Arkansas Democrats Category:People from White County, Arkansas Category:Prisoners who died in United States federal government detention Category:American businesspeople convicted of crimes Category:Businesspeople from Arkansas Category:Whitewater controversy Category:Bill Clinton ","title":"Jim McDougal"},{"id":"3248165","text":"Pauline \\"Polly\\" Tompkins (March 5, 1918 - November 19, 2004) was the first woman President of Cedar Crest College in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in the United States and a pioneer in American education and women's education.

Taking advantage of a moment of weakness for the Achaemenid Empire due to riots in some satrapies in Asia Minor, Teos sought assistance from both the octogenarian king Agesilaus II of Sparta and the Athenian general Chabrias, including a number of mercenaries and 200 triremes, from Greece. However, to finance such an expedition, Teos had to impose new taxes and to expropriate the goods of the temples, destroying the delicate balance artfully established by his father Nectanebo. This action ensured to Teos both the required finances and a great unpopularity. Athenian General Chabrias (left) with Spartan king Agesilaus (center), in the service of Egyptian king Nectanebo I and his regent Teos, Egypt 361 BCE. The operation against the Persians started with Chabrias as the admiral of the fleet, Agesilaus as the commander of the Greek mercenaries and Teos' nephew Nakhthorheb as the leader of the machimoi (Diodorus Siculus, certainly exaggerating, claimed that the machimoi were 80,000 in number). Teos placed himself in the supreme command of the expedition (the position claimed by Agesilaus) leaving his brother Tjahapimu, the father of Nakhthorheb, in Egypt as his regent. The expedition made its way to Phoenicia without particular problems. ===Betrayal and end=== Teos, cartouche fragment Unfortunately for Teos, his brother Tjahapimu was plotting against him. Taking advantage of Teos' unpopularity, and with the support of the priestly classes, Tjahapimu convinced his son Nakhthorheb to rebel against Teos and to make himself pharaoh. Nakhthorheb persuaded Agesilaus to join his side by taking advantage of the several disagreements that had arisen between the Spartan king and the pharaoh. Nakhthorheb was acclaimed pharaoh – better known today as Nectanebo II – and the betrayed Teos had no alternative but to flee to Susa, the court of his enemies. Knowledge of the final fate of Teos comes from the inscription by a noble called Wennefer, who also participated in Teos' unfortunate expedition as a physician. Wennefer was sent by Nectanebo II in search of Teos and managed to have him held by the Persian king Artaxerxes II at Susa. Wennefer then had Teos brought back with him in chains to the Egyptian pharaoh. ==Sources== ==Bibliography== : : : : : ==External links== *Livius.org: Teos Category:4th-century BC Pharaohs Category:Pharaohs of the Thirtieth Dynasty of Egypt Category:4th-century BC Egyptian people ","title":"Teos of Egypt"},{"id":"3248183","text":"The Delaware-Maryland Synod is one of the 65 synods of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. It consists of the entire state of Delaware and most of the state of Maryland, with the exception of the counties surrounding Washington, D.C., and extreme western Maryland. With its office in downtown Baltimore, Maryland, the synod encompasses two states with totally different histories; Maryland, a primarily Roman Catholic colony, and Delaware, originally part of Pennsylvania and primarily Quaker and Methodist. Both states supplied militia in the American Revolution and as so-called border states in the American Civil War, were allowed to keep slaves, while fighting alongside of Union forces.

It is located within the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco and is thirty minutes from San Francisco to the north and San Jose to the south. ==History== The 2008 graduation procession was led by Brother Edward Englund (1942–2014). The Priory was founded in 1957 by a group of seven Hungarian Benedictine Monks from Saint Martin's Archabbey in Pannonhalma, Hungary. In 1974, the monks affiliated with Saint Anselm Abbey in Goffstown, New Hampshire. The school began on an ranch and over the years has expanded significantly to the point that the campus now encompasses some . Originally the school was made up entirely of all-male boarders, but over the years the ratio of boarders to day students changed, and today the boarding school accounts for a smaller percentage of the upper school student body. In the early 1990s, the school began admitting females to the day program, with the first coed senior class graduating in 1995. The Priory's boarding program was expanded to include girls in 2004. The Priory was granted a seven-year accreditation by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC), the California Association of Independent Schools (CAIS) and the Western Catholic Education Association in June, 2019. ==Athletics== The Priory offers football, cross country, volleyball, tennis, water polo, soccer, basketball, lacrosse, swimming, track and field, and baseball. In 2000, the girls' volleyball team won the state championship for Division V. The school competes in Central Coast Section (CCS) post-season competition. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Benedictine secondary schools Category:Catholic secondary schools in California Category:Catholic boarding schools in the United States Category:High schools in San Mateo County, California Category:Educational institutions established in 1957 Category:1957 establishments in California Category:Private middle schools in California Category:Private high schools in California ","title":"Woodside Priory School"},{"id":"3248190","text":"Steampipe Alley is a children's television program that aired on Secaucus, New Jersey station WWOR-TV from February 7, 1988 to April 18, 1993. The program was hosted by comedian Mario Cantone, with announcing duties handled by longtime station staff announcer Ted Mallie (referred to on-air by Cantone as \\"Don Pardonmeo\\", a play on the name of another veteran announcer, Don Pardo). Each episode featured celebrity guests (often encountering other WWOR personalities), recurring segments, comedy sketches and games for its young audience members, with old Looney Tunes and Max Fleischer cartoons rounding out the program. The series was written by Judy Katschke (who also served as producer), with Rick Derman as senior producer. Its director was Neil Borrell, who served in the same capacity on the station's local newscasts from the mid-1970s until 2005. ==Characters== Playing up his comedic persona, Cantone would portray a variety of characters, including: *Julia Children, a parody of TV chef Julia Child, who gave recipes for snacks that kids could make at home. *Joe Rivers, supposedly the brother of comedian Joan Rivers. *Poochano Pavarachi, a parody of Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti, who sang about his bean-induced flatulence problem and presided over the Out of Gas segment (see below). *Ciao Aldo, who appeared in mock commercials to promote a line of fragrances that smelled like pasta. *Ted Ringer, a stereotypically shady used car salesman who appeared in mock commercials delivering a pitch for the deals available on his \\"Used and Abused Car Lot\\". *Frankie D, a parody of Frank Sinatra, who was a teacher that gave lessons to his \\"class\\" via song. *Richie Morales, a neighborhood kid who appeared in the \\"Something to Think About\\" segment (see below). *Sammy Sammy, Jr., a parody of Sammy Davis Jr. who presided over the \\"Eye In the Pie\\" segment (see below). *Rex Can Read, a parody of film critic Rex Reed, who co-hosted the \\"At the Alley\\" segment (see below). *Angelo Antonelli, a stereotypical Italian-American sewer worker who presided over the \\"Three Sewer Monte\\" segment (see below). ==Recurring segments== A wide variety of games and sketches were featured, including:Steampipe Alley. Summary. Cast & Crew. www.tv.com. *Three Sewer Monte - Angelo Antonelli (who always pronounced the \\"three\\" in the game's title as \\"tree\\") chose a member of the audience to pull the string on one of three pipes hanging overhead. If the right one was chosen, it was worth a prize; otherwise, the audience member would have \\"spiders primavera\\" (a mix of rubber spiders and spaghetti) dumped on their head. *The Dream Date Game - A parody of The Dating Game, in which a bachelorette asked questions of three potential bachelors (one of whom was always Cantone in disguise). *Where In the World? - Kids attempted to identify world landmarks to win prizes. *Steampipe Theatre - Cantone (as \\"Cecil B. DeMario\\") would serve as acting coach to a group of kids as they attempted to re-enact scenes from a well known film or play. *Cream the Teach - Two kids from a local school were given 30 seconds to throw pies at one of their teachers (whose head was stuck through a prop wall); if they managed to land one directly in the teacher's face, they won a prize for their school. *Something to Think About - In one of the show's few semi-serious segments, neighborhood kid Richie Morales would relate a story to the audience, typically involving himself and his friends, intended to offer genuine advice on handling real-life situations. *Eye In the Pie - A kid contestant was given 30 seconds to find Sammy Sammy, Jr's glass eye inside a pie in order to win a prize. For the show's Thanksgiving episodes, this segment became Eye In the Stuffing, with the search taking place inside a bowl of stuffing. *Out of Gas - Italian tenor Poochano Pavarachi would lead a group of kids in a flatulence-themed Musical chairs variant, where all the chairs were equipped with whoopee cushions; the sole survivor would win a prize. *The National Gallery of Excuses - Cantone would read various excuses for childhood offenses (not finishing homework, etc.), as sent in by home viewers; those whose excuses were read on-air received a prize. *At the Alley - A takeoff of TV's At the Movies, snooty critic Rex Can Read would offer a scathing review of a well-known nursery rhyme or fairy tale, which was typically at odds with that of his more agreeable fellow critic, young Bill Getsharassed (a parody of Bill Harris). *Mystery Guest - Based on the long-running panel game What's My Line?, a blindfolded panel of three audience members attempted to guess the identity of a celebrity by asking \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" questions, with each kid allowed to keep asking questions until getting a \\"no\\" answer or successfully identifying the guest; doing so was worth a prize. Among the Mystery Guests who appeared in this segment were Morris the Cat, Brice Beckham, and fellow WWOR host Morton Downey Jr. *Brain Drain - The last segment of each show; inspired by the popular kids' game show Double Dare, two kids competed in a rapid-fire 60-second question round, and the player with the high score won a prize and went on to run an obstacle course for the chance at the day's grand prize. == External links == * Steampipe Alley Opening Sequence * * Laugh Whore - On Broadway: Steampipe Alley == References == Category:1988 American television series debuts Category:1993 American television series endings Category:1980s American children's television series Category:1990s American children's television series Category:Local children's television programming in the United States ","title":"Steampipe Alley"},{"id":"3248197","text":"For the city in Quebec, see Sept-Îles, Quebec Location of Sept Îles Sept Îles, seen from Ploumanac'h Sept-Îles (French for seven islands) or Jentilez (in Breton) is a small archipelago off the north coast of Brittany, in the Perros- Guirec commune of Côtes-d'Armor.

Afterwards, she lived as a writer in Britain (1920–1951) and the United States (1951–1962). ==Biography== ===Revolutionary beginnings=== Ariadna Vladimirovna Tyrkova was born on 13 November 1869, the daughter of Vladimir Tyrkov, a landowner whose hereditary estate was Vergezhi in the Novgorod region. She studied in Saint Petersburg. There she married A. N. Borman, an engineer, and with him had a son, Arcadiy (b. 1891). In the early 1900s, she became active among liberal opposition groups linked to Pyotr Struve's periodical, Osvobozhdenie ('Liberty'), and in 1904 was arrested while trying to smuggle 400 copies of Osvobozhdenie into Russia . Later the same year, she was arrested again, sentenced to 30 months in prison and fled to Stuttgart, where she met Williams; together they moved to Paris.SHADOW OF DEMOCRACY. Dispatches from Russia: 1905 Revolution, by Harold Williams. At the end of the year Williams was sent to St Petersburg. His wife would follow. Returning to Russia under the general amnesty granted by the October Manifesto during the Russian Revolution of 1905, she helped found the Constitutional Democratic party (also known as the Kadet Party), and in 1906 became a member of its Central Committee. ===Between the Revolutions=== In 1906, she married Harold Williams (1876–1928), a New Zealand-British Slavist who was working as a journalist in Saint Petersburg for the Morning Post. The same year she joined the All-Russian Union for Women's Equality and, with Ekaterina Kuskova, became a leading campaigner for equal rights for women, prompting the Constitutional Democratic party to add women's suffrage to its platform . After the defeat of the revolution in late 1907, Tyrkova-Williams moved to the far Right of the Constitutional Democratic party, and advocated an alliance with the Progressive faction in the State Duma and the Left wing of the Octobrist party . In 1911, the family was briefly embroiled in controversy, when Harold Williams was accused of espionage, supposedly as a result of Russian secret police machinations . During World War I, she worked in the All-Russian Union of Cities. She also spent a year in Turkey and wrote a book about her experiences there (Staraya Turtsia, 1916) . ===1917 Revolution and emigration=== On March 17, 1917, immediately after the February Revolution, Tyrkova-Williams was elected a member of the Petrograd Committee of the Kadet party. She coordinated party publications in Petrograd, and in the summer of 1917 was elected to the Petrograd Duma, where she led the Constitutional Democratic faction. In August, she became a member of the Democratic Conference, and in September was elected to the Pre-Parliament. After the Bolshevik seizure of power during the October Revolution of 1917 she ran for the Constituent Assembly in November elections, and, with Alexander Izgoev, briefly edited the newspaper, Borba, until it was shut down by the Bolshevik government. After the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly by the Bolsheviks, she helped organize anti-Bolshevik resistance in southern Russia. But in the spring of 1918, she emigrated to Britain, and in 1919 published an account of the first year of the Russian revolution, From Liberty to Brest- Litovsk, before returning to Russia in the spring, when Harold Williams was sent to the areas controlled by Gen. Anton Denikin to report on the progress of the White Movement. By then, she had moved further to the Right, and wrote: > We must support the army first and place the democratic programs in the > background. We must create a ruling class and not a dictatorship of the > majority. The universal hegemony of Western democracy is a fraud, which > politicians have foisted upon us. We must have the courage to look directly > into the eye of the wild beast—which is called the people . In late 1919, General Denikin was defeated, and Tyrkova-Williams returned to Britain in 1920. In London, she became a founder of the London-based Russian Liberation Committee, edited its publications, and raised money for Russian orphans . In November 1928, her husband died. Afterwards she wrote a biography of Alexander Pushkin (Zhizn' Pushkina, 2 vols., 1928–1929) , and a book about her late husband (Cheerful Giver, 1935). After the second World War, in March 1951, she migrated to the United States of America and later published three volumes of memoirs (1952, 1954, 1956) in Russian. Ariadna Tyrkova-Williams died on 12 January 1962 in Washington DC and was buried there in Rock Creek Cemetery.Ariadna Vladimirovna Tyrkova-Williams ==Notes and references== * See Shmuel Galai.

Wooden neck cradle An animal collar is a device that attaches to the neck of an animal to allow it to be harnessed or restrained. *Pet collar. A piece of material put around the neck of certain pet animals, such as dogs, cats, or pigs, for control, identification, or other purposes. Identification tags and medical information is often placed on collars. Collars are also useful for controlling the animal, as they provide a handle for grabbing or a means of leading. Similar collars are used with non-pet animals, such as zoo animals and livestock. Pet collars can be made of leather, nylon or metal. Metal collars are normally used for larger dogs. They can come with traditional or quick-release buckles. Collars are sometimes used for fashion purposes. *Cat collar. Similar to dog collars, but often include a bell to warn of the cat's presence. Collars used on cats are smaller and thinner than traditional dog collars. They can be made of leather, nylon, or other types of materials. Some cat collars are impregnated with flea, tick, and mosquito repellents. *Anti- bark dog collar, or bark control collar. These collars are predominantly used as a training mechanism. There are a few different types of mechanisms which can be incorporated into anti-bark collars: **Citronella - The citronella collar releases a spray of citronella-scented liquid when the wearer barks. Most dogs find this scent unpleasant and will resist further barking. **Static shock - This collar emits a shock through two metal prongs that touch animal's neck. The shock will increase in intensity if the barking continues. This kind of collar is illegal to sell in the UK but is popular in the USA. **Sonic - Dogs can hear much higher pitches than humans. This collar sends an unpleasant pitch when the dog barks. This collar is tested for each dog to ensure that the pitch is perfectly tuned. **Vibration - These collars often feature both sound and vibration. Instead of using sonic, they use a low pitched beep when barking begins. This is soon followed by a vibration if barking continues. The vibration is harmless. *Training collar or shock collar. These collars administer an electric shock to the animal in training, in order to reinforce commands and eliminate any bad habits. It may be combined with an \\"invisible fence,\\" a signal wire surrounding the dog's permitted area. The dog receives a shock if it strays too near the perimeter. *Choke collars are also a type of training collars. They are made of different materials with high resistance, such as metal or various composites. This type of collar is suitable for obedience training as it tightens around the neck of the animal if it pulls. It is mainly used on dogs. *Insect collar or flea collar. Impregnated with chemicals that repel or kill external parasites, they are often a supplementary collar worn in addition to the conventional buckle collar. The effectiveness of flea collars is arguable. Although they are convenient because of their cost and accessibility, the insecticide within the collar is most effective in the neck and face area and does not provide full and complete coverage. Flea collars are considered to be more effective in preventing infestation with external parasites rather than treating an active infestation. Flea collars are best used when a proper disinfestation has been performed, both indoor and outdoor. These collars are primarily worn by cats and dogs. A number of the insecticides used in these flea collars are toxic.Flea Collar – Do They Work or Endanger Your Pet? - The Bug Squad, Updated 2012 *Pig hunting dog collar. This collar integrates a wide collar and a breastplate for dogs that hunt pigs. They are made from multiple layers of extra tough fabric or leather to protect the vital carotid artery and jugular vein of pig hunting dogs should they be attacked. Some of the pig hunting dog collars come in the form of a full-body protection collar. These collars provide good protection for the dog's chest, neck and rib cage. *Elizabethan collar. Often made of plastic, this collar is shaped like a cone and used to prevent an animal from self-harm, such as a licking at a wound. *Tie-up collar. Used for bulls and other cattle, this may be a chain (sometimes covered in plastic hose), or a collar of heavy leather or synthetic material fastened with a heavy duty buckle. *Animal tracking collar. Used for tracking animal migration or to locate lost pets. In its simplest form, it contains a radio beacon to allow the location of the animal to be determined. More sophisticated devices may contain a GPS tracking unit to record the animal's tracking pattern. Other sensors record water depth or other environmental information and use a mobile phone or other radio transmitter to report location and other data. It may have a timed or remotely controlled release device. *Horse collars. **Full collar or Horse Collar. Used for horses or other draught animals, this consists of a robustly constructed leather device stuffed with straw or other material that sits comfortably on the animal's shoulders around its lower neck, supporting a set of hames that transfer the draught forces from the animal to the traces. **Breast collar or breastplate. Two forms: One is a simpler type of draught collar for lighter loads, consisting of a padded strap around the chest of the animal. The other is similar, but is attached to a saddle and used when riding a horse to prevent the saddle from sliding back. **Horse tie-up collar. A collar designed to teach horses to tie up and to tie stallions at public events. It is constructed from double-stitched wide leather (sometimes fleece lined), with heavy duty dees sewn into each end. The collar is placed on a horse just behind the poll strap of a headcollar (headstall) which is used in conjunction, and a strong rope passes through the headcollar to secure the two dees so that the horse's wind is not impaired in any way. This manner of application will reduce the likelihood of the collar slipping and injuring or choking the horse.

A simple narrow leather strap buckled around a horse's neck to give security to jockeys and other riders. Another form of neck strap (or rope) is the one used by cowboys when roping. This style is shorter and placed closer to the horse's head with the lariat passing through in order to keep the horse facing the calf after it has been roped. It also refers to the part of a martingale, which buckles around the horse's neck. A loose neck collar is also used on harness racing horses when the reins are passed through. Safety collars are designed for pets that live in crates or that might get tangled in tree branches. There is a particular type of safety collar which is intended for both dogs and cats. Breakaway collars are especially designed to prevent the pet from choking or getting stuck. They feature a clever design that releases quickly when a small amount of pressure is applied, such as a cat hanging from a tree branch. The clasp will release, which quickly frees the pet from a possibly desperate situation. However, it is recommended that pets have their collars removed before sleeping in a wired crate. ==See also== *Dog collar *Horse collar *Collar (BDSM) *Choker ==References== * The Horse Breeding Farm, Larryann C.

The league serves as the fifth division of the French football league system behind Ligue 1, Ligue 2, Championnat National, and the Championnat National 2. Usually contested by 168 clubs, the Championnat National 3 operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the Championnat National 2 and the regional leagues of the Division d'Honneur, the sixth division of French football. Seasons run from August to May, with teams in twelve groups playing 26 games each totalling 2080 games in the season. Most games are played on Saturdays and Sundays, with a few games played during weekday evenings. Play is regularly suspended the last weekend before Christmas for two weeks before returning in the second week of January. The competition was founded in 1993 as National 3 and lasted for five years before being converted to Championnat de France Amateur 2 in 1998. In 2017 the FFF reorganised amateur football and the restructured 5th level again became Championnat National 3. Most clubs that participate in the league are amateur clubs, but a small number of clubs are semi-professional. The matches in the league attract on average between 200 and 400 spectators per match. However, this average is dragged down by the minuscule turnouts for the pros' home reserve matches. ==History and format== The amateur championship of France was created in 1993 under the name National 3. The league's debut coincided with the creation of the Championnat National, the third division of French football, which is commonly known as National. For the first three years of the competition, an amateur champion was crowned in France regardless of whether the club was amateur or a reserve team. In 1998 the competition was renamed Championnat de France Amateur 2 as part of a restructuring of Amateur football. In this guise, the competition saw 112 clubs participate, split into eight parallel groups of 14 with their group affiliation being based on the regional location of the club. The league became open to reserve teams in France and amateur clubs in France and both were eligible for promotion to the Championnat de France Amateur. ===Current format=== In 2017 the FFF reorganised amateur football along the lines of the 2016 reorganisation of the Regions of France, creating Championnat National 2 and Championnat National 3 to replace CFA and CFA2. For National 2 this was in effect just a change of name, whilst National 3 saw a major restructure. This new competition sees 168 clubs participating, in twelve parallel groups directly aligned to the thirteen new regions (Corsica is merged with Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur to form a Méditerranee-Corse group). The administration of the league is devolved to the regional leagues on a group by group basis, with the exception of the 'Méditerranee-Corse group, which is directly managed by the FFF. During the course of a season, usually from August to May, each club plays the others in their respective group twice, once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for a total of 26 games. Teams are ranked by total points. Ties between clubs with equal points are resolved by: a) points gained in games between the two (or more) clubs, b) goal difference in games between the two (or more) clubs, c) overall goal difference, d) goals scored, e) best disciplinary record, f) drawing of lots. At the end of each season, the winner of each group is promoted to Championnat National 2. If a group winner is prevented from being promoted, or elects not to be promoted, they are replaced by the next best team in the group who are eligible. At least the bottom three teams in each group are relegated to the Regional league's top division. In the case of groups which start a season with more than 14 teams, extra relegation places will ensure the league conforms to 14 teams for the following season. Extra relegation places will also be added depending on which regional groups the teams relegated from Championnat National 2 will enter the following season. ==External links== *Official FFF site ==References== 5 Category:Sports leagues established in 1993 Category:1993 establishments in France Fra ","title":"Championnat National 3"},{"id":"3248286","text":"Frontenac State Park is a state park of Minnesota, United States, on the Mississippi River southeast of Red Wing. The park is notable both for its history and for its birdwatching opportunities. The centerpiece of the park is a , steep limestone bluff overlooking Lake Pepin, a natural widening of the Mississippi. The bluff is variously called Garrard's Bluff or Point No-Point, the latter name coming from riverboat captains because of the optical illusion that it protruded into the Mississippi River. There is a natural limestone arch on the blufftop called In-Yan-Teopa, a Dakota name meaning \\"Rock With Opening\\". Park lands entirely surround the town of Frontenac, once a high- class resort at the end of the 19th century. == Geology == In-Yan-Teopa, a natural limestone arch atop the bluff in Frontenac State Park Limestone was laid down 500 million years ago as organic sediments settled to the bottom of a shallow sea that covered much of the Midwest. Much later Glacial River Warren carried torrents of runoff from the melting glaciers of the last ice age. Flowing out of Lake Agassiz, Glacial River Warren carved the Minnesota River valley and the Mississippi River Valley, leaving steep bluffs along the latter's banks. At times Glacial River Warren overflowed its bed and Garrard's Bluff would have been an island.State of Minnesota, Department of Natural Resources. Frontenac State Park. April 2005. The area is near the northern extreme of the Driftless Area of Minnesota, a region that remained unglaciated during the phases of the last ice age. In the present day, a creek flows through the eastern end of the park into Lake Pepin. Wells Creek carries substantial amounts of sand eroded out of the nearby hills. As it hits the slow-moving river water, it drops its sediment load, creating a delta and Sand Point, a sand spit jutting perpendicularly out into the lake. Downstream the Chippewa River performs the same action on a larger scale. This sediment blockage is what causes the Mississippi to widen into Lake Pepin. == Flora == The forest on the bluff is a mix of maple, basswood, elm, oak, and aspen. The back of the bluff transitions from this forest to lightly wooden meadows to prairie. The eastern end of the park is a bottomland forest of cottonwood, maple, and willow. == Fauna == The park is home to mammalian species of deer, raccoon, coyote, opossum, red fox, woodchuck, beaver and various ground squirrels. On the Mississippi Flyway, the Frontenac area has been known for birdwatching since 1900. 260 bird species have been sighted in Frontenac State Park. Bald eagles and golden eagles are seen around the bluff. The bottomland forest is excellent habitat for warblers. Sand Point is a popular rest-stop for migrants, including ruddy turnstones and sanderlings. One terrestrial species of note is the timber rattlesnake, though it is rare in the park and only dangerous if provoked. ==History== A model of Fort Beauharnois in the Canadian Museum of Civilization Village sites and burial mounds prove that members of the Hopewell culture were living and dying within the park between 400 BCE and 300 CE. At the beginning of historical times Dakota and Fox people lived in the region. The first Europeans to see this area were Father Louis Hennepin and his exploration party in 1680. In 1727 a party from Montreal led by René Boucher came ashore and built a fort. Fort Beauharnois was intended as a base of operations for trade with the Dakota and for French explorers seeking a route to the Pacific. Ultimately a number of French posts were built on either shore of Lake Pepin until the territory was ceded to Britain after the French and Indian War. Only one of those forts has been located by archaeologists. The first American settler was James \\"Bully\\" Wells, who had a fur trading post near modern Frontenac town by 1840. Later he sold his interests to a Dutch immigrant named Evert Westervelt. However the Dakota were evicted onto reservations, and Westervelt was forced to diversify. He partnered with another settler, Israel Garrard, and established a town in 1857 which he named after himself. Two years later Garrard bought out Westervelt and renamed the town Frontenac, after Louis de Buade de Frontenac who had been governor of New France in the late 17th century. Garrard served in the Civil War, rising to the rank of general. After the war he helped turn Frontenac into a summer resort for the leisure class. His brother Jeptha Garrard was an inventor of flying machines, which were tested, unsuccessfully, from the bluff overlooking the town. Wealthy visitors arrived in Frontenac by steamboat from as far away as New Orleans.Gardner, Denis P. Minnesota Treasures: Stories Behind the State's Historic Places. Minnesota Historical Society Press: St. Paul, 2004. Meanwhile, limestone was quarried from the bluff. The Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City was constructed of stone from Frontenac. Frontenac's heyday ended when railroads supplanted river travel at the end of the 1800s. Proposals were made in the 1920s and 30s to protect Garrard's Bluff, Wells Creek, and Sand Point. However serious efforts didn't get underway until a local advocacy group purchased in 1955. Their holdings more than doubled the next year when of Garrard's Bluff were donated by the chairman of an insurance company. The group lobbied directly to state legislators and other influential people. However other residents of Frontenac were fiercely opposed to a park, fearing that heightened visitation would compromise the town's charm and disturb the wildlife. These concerns were not without merit; at one point there were plans for a \\"skyline drive\\" along the blufftop. A bill authorizing the park passed in 1957, with sharp restrictions on recreational development. Purchasing the land from its current owners was similarly contentious. The owner of Sand Point was a particularly adamant holdout, and several tracts had to be acquired through eminent domain. Modest recreational facilities were not installed until the mid-1960s. Land has been added to the park over the years but the minimal-development ethic has been maintained.Meyer, Roy W. Everyone's Country Estate: A History of Minnesota's State Parks. Minnesota Historical Society Press: St. Paul, 1991. ==Recreation== Entrance to the park *Camping: Atop the bluff there is a campground with 58 sites (19 with electrical hookups) and 6 walk-in campsites. *Fishing: Walleye, northern pike, crappie, bluegill, and channel catfish can be caught in Lake Pepin. *Sledding: On the substantial hill behind the park office.

It was Republic's thirty-first serial, of the sixty-six they produced. ==Synopsis== In The Masked Marvel, a hero dressed in a business suit and a face mask fights the Japanese saboteur Sakima and his espionage organization. The hook of the story is that, in a reversal of the common serial \\"Masked Mystery Villain\\" stock character, the audience doesn't know who the hero is until the final reel—all the audience is told is that The Masked Marvel is one of a group of special investigators (the same plotline is used in the Republic serial The Lone Ranger). ==Cast== * William Forrest as Martin Crane * Louise Currie as Alice Hamilton * Johnny Arthur as Mura Sakima, Japanese saboteur * Rod Bacon as Jim Arnold * Justin Cousson as Alan Wallace * Richard Clarke as Frank Jeffers * Anthony Warde as 'Killer' Mace * David Bacon as Bob Barton/the Masked Marvel * Bill Healy as Terry Morton * Howard C. Hickman as Warren Hamilton * Tom Steele as the Masked Marvel (and two Sakima thugs, both of whom are quickly killed, uncredited) * Gayne Whitman as The Masked Marvel's voice (uncredited) ==Production== The Masked Marvel was budgeted at $157,110 () although the final negative cost was $179,960 ()—a $22,850, or 14.5%, overspend. It was filmed between 14 July and 18 August 1943. In terms of cost per chapter, this was Republic's third most expensive serial, behind Radar Men from the Moon and The Tiger Woman. The serial's production number was 1296. The Masked Marvel is a reverse of the \\"old mystery villain theme.\\" The identity of the Masked Marvel is kept secret from the audience until the last chapter. Clues and red herrings about the hero's identity are unveiled throughout the serial. Four possible candidates are shown: Bob Barton (David Bacon), Frank Jeffers (Richard Clarke), Terry Morton (Bill Healy) and Jim Arnold (Rob Bacon). The Masked Marvel is really stuntman Tom Steele throughout the serial except the very final shot, in which he removes his mask. The mask was directly moulded from Steele's face. Despite this, Tom Steele was given no screen credit at all, even for the bit parts and stunts he performed in addition to the title role. The voice of the Masked marvel was dubbed in by radio actor Gayne Whitman, since Steele's natural voice was a light tenor, somewhat similar to Henry Fonda's, and did not record as particularly \\"tough.\\" However, in Steele's most visible secondary role, as a murderous assassin, he disguises his voice, apparently believing that his natural voice would be used for the Marvel. Bob Barton was a \\"jinxed\\" role. David Bacon got the role because four previous actors had injured themselves and were unable to work. While filming one of the serial’s big fight scenes, every actor but Bacon was seriously injured. \\"I’ll probably get hurt going home in the car,\\" he had joked. Just two weeks after the production of the serial had been completed, Bacon was murdered and died moments after exiting his car. Rod Bacon who played Jim Arnold was murdered in 1948. The Masked Marvel was screenwriter George Plympton's only work at Republic. ===Cliffhangers=== Chapter four has an unusual cliffhanger, especially for Republic, as it has no action or death involved. Instead, Sakima, sitting behind his desk in his secret basement, simply (although incorrectly) announces \\"So, Jim Arnold is the Masked Marvel.\\" ===Stunts=== In addition to playing the main character, Tom Steele was also the stunt gaffer on this serial. As stated above, he received no screen credit for this. Steele himself was doubled by a dummy in the scene in which the Marvel is thrown off the top of an enormous gas tank. On the way down one of the dummy's arms gets caught in the rigging of the tank and is clearly ripped off. Yet when the Marvel lands in the back of the truck below, he has both arms intact. The budget and schedules of serials mandated retakes only in the most dire circumstances. As an odd outcome of playing both the Masked Marvel and other stunts and bit parts, in one scene Tom Steele chased himself up some stairs. One stunt in Chapter 10 is particularly notable: to prevent a rolling handcar filled with explosives from destroying a train transporting aircraft parts, the Masked Marvel crashes his own car into the handcar. The Masked Marvel survives by jumping aside at the last second. Harmon and Glut write that \\"the scene is both thrilling and perfect craftsmanship.\\" *Tom Steele, Republic's stunt gaffer *Fred Graham doubling Roy Barcroft & Harry Woods *Duke Green doubling Anthony Warde & Stanley Price *Betty Miles doubling Louise Currie *Allen Pomeroy *Ken Terrell doubling Johnny Arthur * Carey Loftin * Eddie Parker ===Special effects=== The effects in The Masked Marvel were produced by Republic's team, the Lydecker brothers. ==Release== ===Theatrical=== The Masked Marvel's official release date is 6 November 1943, although this is actually the date the sixth chapter was made available to film exchanges. ===Television=== The Masked Marvel was one of twenty-six Republic serials re-edited into features for television release in 1966. The title was changed to Sakima and the Masked Marvel. This version was 100-minutes in length. ==Critical reception== Harmon and Glut describe The Masked Marvel as an \\"exciting serial, one of Republic's best.\\" They especially note \\"some of the most beautifully photographed and edited action sequences in the history of cliffhangers.\\" Cline writes that the sight of seeing the hero \\"jump right into his own fights\\" rather than have the camera cut between an actor and a stuntman, more than compensated for the reveal in the final chapter when the actor playing the Masked Marvel removes his mask and is clearly not the same actor playing the part in every other scene. This scene is described as almost anticlimactic and \\"must have been just a little embarrassing.\\" This was one of Republic's best serials. ==Chapter list== # The Masked Crusader (26min 11s) # Death Takes the Helm (15min 33s) # Drive to Doom/Dive to Doom (15min 33s)\\"Drive to Doom\\" is recorded as the title of the third chapter in William C.

His mother, Margarete Heil-Eisner, was an artist. Escaping the Nazi regime, the family moved to Barcelona and, following the Spanish Civil War, to Uruguay. The Eisners came to the U.S. in 1947. Thomas Eisner became a naturalized American citizen, and applied to Cornell University as an undergraduate, but was rejected. He received his B.S. and PhD degrees from Harvard University, and joined Cornell's entomology faculty in 1957. He married Maria Eisner, who was a member of his lab. In 1964, he helped found the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, where he worked until his death. In addition to his academic work, he was a passionate nature photographer and videographer. His film Secret Weapons won the Grand Award at the New York Film Festival and was named Best Science Film by the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He was also an avid pianist and occasional conductor. Eisner died on March 25, 2011, of Parkinson's disease. He was an atheist.Natalie Angier (April 4, 2011). \\"Paths of Discovery, Lighted by a Bug Man's Insights\\". The New York Times. Retrieved 19 April 2012. Dr. Eisner died from complications of his disease on March 25, at the age of 81. He had a notoriously mordant sense of humor: \\"I may not believe in God,\\" he once said, \\"but I don't ring doorbells saying I'm a Seventh-Day Atheist,\\"... ==Work== Series from a study by Eisner and colleagues investigating defensive spray in Chlaenius beetles with paper that turns dark in response to chemicals. Eisner's main body of work was in chemical ecology, primarily studying the chemical defenses of insects against predation. Some of his most famous work was conducted on the bombardier beetle, which he discovered creates a chemical reaction within its body to shoot a boiling noxious liquid from a nozzle in its abdomen. A field biologist with working experience on four continents, he was also an active conservationist. He served on the Board of Directors of the National Audubon Society, the National Scientific Council of the Nature Conservancy, and the World Resources Institute Council. He was a past president of the American Society of Naturalists, and chairman of the Biology Section of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He played a key role in initiating the Congressional Fellow Program in Washington DC, and in efforts to preserve wilderness areas in Florida and Texas. Eisner was furthermore a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. He received numerous honors, including the Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement, the Harvard Centennial Medal, the 1994 National Medal of Science and the Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science. He also held honorary degrees from universities in Sweden, Germany, Switzerland and the United States, and was a foreign fellow of the Royal Society. Eisner was additionally a member of the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina and Academia Europaea. In 2008, Eisner was awarded the John J. Carty Award by the National Academy of Sciences. == Publications == * Eisner, T, (2003) For Love of Insects.

The Helfensteins resumed control of the ceded half in 1586, but when they went extinct in 1627, it reverted to the sovereignty of the now Duchy of Württemberg. Hohenstadt only fully came under Württemberg's control when in 1806 the Lordship of Wiesensteig, which controlled the town at that time, was mediatized to Württemberg, now a Kingdom. The town was assigned to , after 1938 Landkreis Göppingen, its contemporary incarnation. Hohenstadt began a period of urban growth after World War II that ended in the 1960s. ==Geography== The municipality (Gemeinde) of Hohenstadt is situated in the district of Göppingen, of the German state of Baden-Württemberg. Hohenstadt lies at the southernmost tip of Göppingen's district, along its border with the Alb-Danube district. The municipal area is physically located in the . Elevation above sea level in the municipal area ranges from a high of Normalnull (NN), the highest elevation above sea level in the Administrative Region of Stuttgart, to a low of NN. ==Politics== Hohenstadt has one borough (Ortsteil), Hohenstadt, and one village, Weilerhöhe. There are three abandoned villages in the municipal area: Feuerbach, Heudorf, and Waldstetten. Hohenstadt is a member of the Oberes Filstal municipal association, headquartered in Wiesensteig. ===Coat of arms=== Hohenstadt's coat of arms displays a white elephant head behind a white castle wall upon a field of red. The elephant is a reference to the House of Helfenstein, whose arms feature one, while the castle wall is to distinguish Hohenstadt's blazon from those of other municipalities. The coat of arms was created and accepted by the municipal council in 1948. It was approved by the Federal Ministry of the Interior, and a corresponding municipal flag issued, on 19 March 1960. ==Transportation== Hohenstadt is connected to Germany's network of roadways by an access road from its local Landesstraßen und Kreisstraßen to the Bundesautobahn 8.

Stony Creek drains 72 square miles (116 km²) of northern Oakland County and the lake formed from the dams covers . Stony Creek Metropark is situated on a moraine which makes for varied landscape. The park has forests, hills, prairies, as well as swamps. The park is also relatively high above sea level, 875 feet (267 m) at the park office. Although a visitor can see downtown Detroit (26 miles away) from the park office, it is not the highest point in Macomb County, as many people believe. Trombley Mountain, located in the Ford Proving Grounds (Bruce Township), is above sea level - the highest point in Macomb County. ==Activities== Stony Creek has a vast amount of trails in four different locations around the park. There are 14 miles (22.5 km) of mountain biking/hiking trails located on the grounds of a former estate, of which the foundations are still visible. There are another 8.5 miles (13.7 km) of hiking trails near the nature center, and over 6 miles (10 km) of foot trails near Inwood lake. Additionally, there is a 6.2 mile (10 km) paved trail that circles Stony Creek lake which is popular with joggers, and inline-skaters.

The lignite-fired power station has an installed capacity of 3,000 megawatts and consists of six 500 MW units. It is the third-largest brown coal power plant in operation in Germany and is currently owned by EPH, who took over its ownership from Vattenfall in 2016. ==Overview== The power station was built by VEB BMK Kohle und Energie (de) between 1976 and 1988. Between the German reunification and the mid-1990s, modern environmental technology was adopted, making higher energy efficiency possible. Despite this, the power station has the fifth- lowest ratio of energy efficiency to CO2 emission in Europe, according to a study by the WWF.http://assets.panda.org/downloads/european_dirty_thirty_may_2007.pdf The Dirty Thirty report Jänschwalde power station predominantly fires raw brown coal from nearby open-pit mining in Jänschwalde and Cottbus to the north. At full load the power station burns approximately 80,000 tons of brown coal a day. From one kilogram of brown coal about one kilowatt-hour of electrical energy is produced. The yearly power output lies around 22 billion kWh, 22 TWh. The site formerly featured three obsolete chimneys. These were gradually dismantled in a complex process between 2002 and 2007, as conventional demolition was not possible on the site for space reasons. A unique procedure was introduced for this task: the chimneys were broken down from the top to a height of by a special mechanism equipped with excavators which works round the edges of the chimneys, after which the remaining stacks were demolished by conventional means. ==See also== * List of largest power stations in the world ==Notes== Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1976 Category:Towers completed in 1976 Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1989 Category:Coal-fired power stations in Germany Category:Vattenfall Category:Towers in Germany Category:Buildings and structures in Spree-Neiße Category:Chimneys in Germany Category:Energetický a průmyslový holding ","title":"Jänschwalde Power Station"},{"id":"3248444","text":"Al Mahwit ( ') is one of the governorates of Yemen. ==Description== A terraced side of one of the Haraz Mountains in the governorate near Jabal An-Nabi Shu'ayb (the highest mountain in the Arabian Peninsula), west of Sanaa ===Districts=== *Al Khabt District *Al Mahwait District *Al Mahwait City District *Ar Rujum District *At Tawilah District *Bani Sa'd District *Hufash District *Milhan District *Shibam Kawkaban District ==References== Category:Governorates of Yemen ","title":"Al Mahwit Governorate"},{"id":"3248445","text":"José Antonio Villarrubia Jiménez-Momediano (born 17 November 1961) - known professionally as José Villarrubia - is a Spanish-American artist and art teacher who has done considerable work in the American comic book industry, particularly as a colorist. ==Biography== Villarrubia was born in Madrid, moved to Baltimore, Maryland, in 1980.

Combe argues that the human mind is best understood through Phrenology, and that the relative size of the various regions of the brain defined by Phrenology determines a person's behavior and potential interactions with the external world. In The Constitution of Man Combe uses Phrenology to create a practical science of morality, proposing that conforming to Natural Laws leads to happiness based on the Phrenological understanding of human nature. The book was an international bestseller, selling at least 100,000 copies in Britain alone and over 300,000 copies worldwide by 1855, largely due to the publication of the 'people's edition,' making it one of the best-sellers of the nineteenth century. == Summary/Content == === Preface === Combe prefaces his work by stating, \\"no author has hitherto attempted to point out, in a combined and systematic form, the relations between [the laws of nature] and the constitution of Man; which must, nevertheless, be done...The great object of the following Essay is to exhibit these relations, with a view to the improvement of education, and the regulation of individual conduct.\\" He explains his use of Phrenology in the work by saying, \\"Phrenology appears to me to be the clearest, most complete, and best supported system of Human Nature.\\" Combe aims to use Phrenology to develop a concept of the relationship between human nature and the external world. === Chapter I: On Natural Laws === In Chapter I, Combe defines the Natural Laws, categorizes them, and identifies principles concerning the Natural Laws. For Combe, \\"A law...denotes a rule of action; its existence indicates an established and constant mode, or process, according to which phenomena take place.\\" Natural Laws refer to \\"the rules of action impressed on objects and beings by their natural constitution\\" Combe presents the relationship between God, Nature, and the Natural Laws: \\"If, then, the reader keep in view that God is the creator; that Nature, in the general sense, means the world which He has made; and, in a more limited sense, the particular constitution which he has bestowed on any special object...and that a Law of Nature means the established mode in which that constitution acts, and the obligation thereby imposed on intelligent beings to attend to it, he will be in no danger of misunderstanding my meaning\\" Combe identifies three categories for the Natural Laws: Physical, Organic, and Intelligent. The Physical Laws \\"embrace all the phenomena of mere matter,\\" the Organic Laws [indicate] that \\"every phenomenon connected with the production, health, growth, decay, and death of vegetables and animals, takes place with undeviating regularity.\\" Combe defines Intelligent beings as \\"all animals that have a distinct consciousness,\\" and the Intelligent Laws concern the makeup of the mental capacities of Intelligent beings. He then identifies four principles concerning the Natural Laws: 1) the Laws are independent 2) obeying the Laws brings rewards and disobedience brings punishment 3) the Laws are fixed and universal, and 4) the laws are harmonious with the constitution of man. At the end of this chapter Combe once again presents the purpose of the work: \\"My object, I repeat, is to investigate the natural constitution of the human body and mind, their relations to external objects and beings in this world, and the courses of action that...appear to be beneficial or hurtful.\\" === Chapter II: Of the Constitution of Man, and its Relations to External Objects === In the first section, Combe discusses \\"Man Considered as a Physical Being,\\" and asserts that man has been created by God to both understand and obey the laws of nature in both mental and physical capacities. In section two, \\"Man Considered as an Organised Being,\\" Combe argues that man is an organized being, subject to growth, decay, and eating food to survive; man must exercise these systems in some form of work if they are to enjoy pleasure. In section three, \\"Man Considered as an Animal–Moral–and Intellectual Being,\\" Combe introduces Phrenology as the best way to understand the \\"animal, moral, and intellectual powers\\" of man, and proceeds to list the 'Human Faculties' according to Phrenology: * Order I. Feelings ** Genus I. Propensities (Amativeness, Philoprogrenitiveness, Concentrativeness, Adhesiveness, Comrativeness, Destructiveness, Constructiveness, Acquisitiveness, Secretiveness) ** Genus II. Sentiments *** Common to Man with Lower Animals: Self-Esteem, Love of Approbation, Cautiousness, Benevolence *** Proper to Man: Veneration, Hope, Ideality, Wonder, Consciousness, Firmness * Order II. Intellectual Faculties ** Genus I. External Senses (Touch, Taste, Hearing, Smell, Light) ** Genus II. Intellectual Faculties–which perceive existence (Individuality, Form, Size, Weight, Colouring) ** Genus III. Intellectual Faculties –which perceive the relations of external objects (Locality, Order, Time, Number, Tune, Language) ** Genus IV. Reflecting Faculties (Comparison, Causality, Wit, Imitation) In Section four, \\"The Faculties of Man Compared With Each Other; or the Supremacy of the Moral Sentiments and Intellect,\\" Combe goes on to argue that the moral sentiments are superior to those that men share with animals, and that the faculties \\"are right only when directed by enlightened intellect and moral sentiment...they must be illuminated by knowledge of science and of moral and religious duty,\\" or else the result is evil. A delicate balance of the expression of the faculties is required for man's happiness. In Section five, \\"The Faculties of Man Compared with External Objects,\\" Combe identifies specific faculties and their effects on the eternal world. For example, with Philoprogenitiveness, the love of offspring, results in producing children. Section six, \\"On the Sources of Human Happiness, and the Conditions Requisite for Maintaining it,\\" Combe argues that man is born with no knowledge of the Natural Laws and must gain knowledge throughout life. Man must satisfy all of their faculties in harmony if one wishes to attain happiness. Combe believes that the 'Creator' has equipped man with the capacity to live an enjoyable life. In Section seven, \\"Application of the Natural Laws to the Practical Arrangements,\\" Combe expands upon his previous argument that Moral Sentiments and Intellect are the superior, and adds that the Intellect is nothing without emotion. Combe concludes the chapter by asserting once again that Phrenology offers revelations into the nature of man, and can be used to support his argument that happiness comes with moral and intellectual growth. === Chapter III: To What Extent are the Miseries of Mankind Referable to Infringements of the Laws of Nature === In Section one \\"Calamities Arising from Infringements of the Physical Laws,\\" Combe lists numerous organic and physical laws, and illustrates how their obedience results in happiness, and their disobedience in punishment. If one obeys the physical laws of nature, their likelihood of suffering is decreased. In Section two, \\"On the Evils that Befall Mankind, from Infringement of the Organic Laws,\\" Combe begins by reiterating his view that obedience to the moral laws and increasing ones knowledge through education beings happiness and livelihood. Education allows man to realize the relationship between the obedience of the Natural Laws and happiness. Combe also emphasizes that theoretical and practical knowledge should be combined through the integration of scientific and religious teachings. Later in section two, Combe begins his discussion of Phrenology and the inheritance of human traits. He states, \\"Mental talents and dispositions are determined by the size and constitution of the brain. The brain is a portion of our organized system, and as such, is subject to the organic laws, by one of which its qualities are transmitted by hereditary descent.\\" Combe extends this argument to nations of people: \\"The differences of national character are equally conspicuous as those of national brains, and it is surprising how permanently both endure\\" citing the perceived contemporary differences in the \\"Hindoo, Chinese, New Hollander, Negro, and Charib\\" skulls. He then investigates the contemporary notions of trait inheritance in 'lower animals' like sheep and dogs and claims that the inheritance patterns observed in animals, children acquiring habits from the parent, resembles that of humans. Combe presents a hierarchy of human minds by human groups: \\"Europeans...possess a favourable development of the moral and intellectual organs,\\" and Hindoos, and Native American \\"brains are inferior.\\" He goes on to say that the child with two European parents has superior mental qualities to that of a child with one European parent and one non-European parent, and that the child with one European parent has superior mental qualities to the child with no European parents On the basis that intellectual and moral habits are inherited by offspring from parents, it is even more important to preserve and develop these faculties so that they may be ideal in offspring. Combe also proposes that the heredity of the capacities is limited to good and not evil, and despite the stratification of the races, each has the potential for improvement through generations up to an ideal limit of capacity. In Section three \\"Calamities Arising from Infringement of the Moral Law,\\" and section four \\"Moral Advantages of Punishment,\\" Combe argues that the development of human moral and intellectual capacities results in individual, religious, moral, and societal improvement. === Chapter IV: On the Combined Operation of the Natural Laws === In this chapter, Combe presents historical examples of the interactions of the natural laws, and how obedience to one does not necessarily imply obedience to the rest, and how punishment and reward for those laws disobeyed and obeyed, respectively, occurs in the lives of men. === Conclusion === Combe concludes by asserting that Phrenology provides an unprecedented science of the Mind. With Phrenology, one can understand the constitution of man, and this is essential for individual and societal happiness and improvement. By understanding the mind and relationship of the mind to the external world, Combe argues that politics, legislation, education, morals, religion, and pursuits of man have the potential to improve, if only the principles of Phrenology and the obedience of the natural laws are true, taught, and incorporated into the 'public mind.' == Reception == Initially, The Constitution of Man was indifferently received, selling in small numbers over a period of six years or so. Historian James A. Secord reports, \\"In Britain Constitution was initially a flop. Published in an edition of 1,500 the book sold slowly until 1835, about 100 copies a year and received almost no reviews. In 1832, two revised, expanded, and subsidized ‘Henderson’ editions in the same format…sold quickly\\" The Henderson edition was subsidized by William Ramsay Henderson with a donation of five-thousand pounds for the 'advancement of Phrenology.' In 1836, the Chambers edition sold at one fifth of the regular price sold “85,000 copies by 1850 making Constitution 'among the best-selling books of the nineteenth century.' In Combe's lifetime, there were five published editions of The Constitution, with 100,000 copies sold in the UK and 200,000 copies in the United States. With the financial help of the Henderson Bequest, an affordable edition of The Constitution was published, selling 59,00 copies in a 3 year period. There are at least nine unique published editions. === Controversy === Though in The Constitution Combe states: \\"I have endeavoured to avoid all religious controversy,\\" numerous contemporaries accused Combe of atheism, materialism, and determinism. Combe took particular care not to offend Christian beliefs, but many critics read The Constitution as anti-Christian. Critics feared that Combe threatened the role of God by championing the laws of nature, and Combe was accused of attempting to sway followers of the Christian faith. Historian Anthony Walsh comments, \\"As a work which denied to a certain extent Divine intervention in worldly happenings, [The Constitution] was condemned as an expression of infidelity.\\" Additionally, Combe's claim that the Phrenological understanding of the mind and his own philosophy were valuable to guiding religious education was met with criticism, as they believed Combe prioritized his understanding of the Natural Laws and the Phrenological understanding of the mind over the Bible. Historian James Secord notes, \\"Constitution maintained that understanding the laws of nature must be a preliminary to all religious instruction, so that the Bible needed to be interpreted in light of the Constitution rather than the other way around.\\" Numerous attacks made on The Constitution were met with responses in the Journal of the Phrenological Society of which Combe was a part. In later editions Combe attempted to reconcile Phrenology with Christianity in response to critics, and Combe tried attempted to confirm the existence of Christianity's compatibility with his outlined Natural Laws. Editions published after 1835 were notably different from the original version of The Constitution with additional sections and chapters added to address the religious controversy that surrounded Combe's book. ==Reference List== Category:1828 books Category:Phrenology Category:History of mental health in the United Kingdom Category:History of psychiatry ","title":"The Constitution of Man"},{"id":"3248459","text":"Prohibitionism is a legal philosophy and political theory often used in lobbying which holds that citizens will abstain from actions if the actions are typed as unlawful (i.e. prohibited) and the prohibitions are enforced by law enforcement.C Canty, A Sutton. Strategies for community-based drug law enforcement: From prohibition to harm reduction; in T Stockwell, PJ Gruenewald, JW Toumbourou, WLoxley W, eds. Preventing Harmful Substance Use: The Evidence Base for Policy and Practice. New York: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., 2005. pp. 225-236. This philosophy has been the basis for many acts of statutory law throughout history, most notably when a large group of a given population disapproves of and/or feels threatened by an activity in which a smaller group of that population engages, and seeks to render that activity legally prohibited. == Examples == Acts of prohibition have included prohibitions on types of clothing (and prohibitions on lack of clothing), prohibitions on gambling and exotic dancing, the prohibition of drugs (for example, alcohol prohibition and cannabis prohibition), prohibitions on tobacco smoking, and gun prohibition. Indeed, the period of Prohibition in the United States between 1920 and 1933 due to the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act often is referred to simply as \\"Prohibition\\", as is the \\"War on Drugs\\" that succeeded it. == Criticism == The success of a measure of prohibitionism has been criticized as often depending too much upon effective enforcement of the relevant legislation. Some people have argued this is because the majority of the targets of prohibitionism are in the category of victimless crime, where they claim the harm that comes from the crime is non- existent, questionable, or only to the person who performs the act and even then the magnitude of the harm being relatively small. Under this interpretation enforcement becomes a conflict between violation of statue and violation of free will. Since the acts prohibited often are enjoyable, enforcement is often the most harmful choice to the individual. This sometimes results in laws which rarely are enforced by anybody who does not have a financial or personal motivation to do so. The difficulty of enforcing prohibitionist laws also criticized as resulting in selective enforcement, wherein the enforcers select the people they wish to prosecute based on other criteria, resulting in discrimination based on races, culture, nationality, or financial status. For example, American philosopher Noam Chomsky has criticized drug prohibition as being a technique of social control of the \\"so- called dangerous classes\\".Noam Chomsky, \\"On the War on Drugs\\", Week Online, DRCNet, February 8, 2002 Prohibitionism based laws have the added problem of calling attention to the behavior that they are attempting to prohibit. This can make the behavior interesting and exciting, and cause its popularity to increase. This is essentially in relation with the Streisand effect. == See also == *Gambling *Gambling in the United States *Gun prohibition *Lobbying *Prohibition *Prohibition in the United States *Prohibition of alcohol *Prohibition of drugs *Prohibition Party *Prohibition Party (Canada) *Repugnancy costs *Scottish Prohibition Party *Smokeasy *Smoking ban *Speakeasy *Sumptuary law *Temperance movement == Notes == == External links == *Peter Cohen, Re-thinking drug control policy - Historical perspectives and conceptual tools, United Nations Research Institute for Social Development, 1993 *Simon Lenton, \\"Policy from a harm reduction perspective\\", Current Opinion in Psychiatry 16(3):271-277, May 2003 *Harry G.

A voracious reader, Baldwin read at a level beyond her years, and was often excused from English classes to read on her own or to write down her own stories. After earning a BA in Art and Design, Baldwin worked as a freelance artist for several years, designing models for toys while raising her children. During her early years of writing, Baldwin was able to have some of her nonfiction and poetry published, but continually received rejection notices for her fiction submissions. She quit her freelance work to concentrate on her writing and joined the Romance Writers of America. Finally, after 63 rejection notices, Baldwin found a receptive editor at Kensington Books who purchased her novel, Lady Fiasco, a \\"Regency Romantic Comedy\\". The editor requested several more novels, and Baldwin was given a deadline of less than a year to complete two more novels and a novella. Baldwin is married.

He succeeded to the title on the death of his father in 1904. His other titles included Earl of Donegall, Earl of Belfast, Viscount Chichester, and Baron Fisherwick, the last of which gave him a seat in the House of Lords. He was also the Hereditary Lord High Admiral of Lough Neagh.Obituary: The Times Monday, 26 May 1975 ==Biography== The son of the elderly George Chichester, 5th Marquess of Donegall (1822–1904), Chichester was educated at the École nouvelle de la Suisse romande, Eton, and Christ Church, Oxford, and took up a career in journalism. For many years he wrote a column in the Sunday Dispatch under the title \\"Almost in Confidence\\". He made regular contributions to the Sunday News and Sunday Graphic, and also held a staff position on the Daily Sketch. As a journalist, he travelled extensively, notably covering the winter sports in St Moritz, Switzerland. He was a passenger on the maiden voyage of the Queen Mary, returning on the Hindenburg. In 1924, by virtue of his barony of Fisherwick in the peerage of Great Britain, he was able to take a seat in the House of Lords on reaching the age of twenty-one. The Marquess of Donegall had a lifelong interest in aviation and owned his own aircraft, which he used for pursuing news stories. He covered the Spanish Civil War and was a distinguished war correspondent throughout the Second World War. His interest extended to cars and he was President of the Middlesex County Automobile Club from 1964 until his death in 1975. In 1949 he became a disc jockey with the BBC and in 1956 ran a Dixieland band and a jazz club in Kensington. He was also the owner of a record company. He was a long-time member of the Sherlock Holmes Society of London, and edited its magazine, the Sherlock Holmes Journal, for many years. In that context and others, he told friends and acquaintances not to stand on ceremony (\\"My Lord Marquess\\") but not to use his first names either: \\"Call me Don!\\" In 1943 he married Gladys Jean Combe, younger daughter of Captain Christian Combe. He parted from his wife after 10 years, and in 1962 moved to Switzerland.

The cyclone formed on August 23 from the monsoon trough across the western Pacific Ocean. Moving westward, Omar slowly intensified into a tropical storm, although another tropical cyclone nearby initially impeded further strengthening. After the two storms became more distant, Omar quickly strengthened into a powerful typhoon. On August 28, it made landfall on Guam with winds of 195 km/h (120 mph). The typhoon reached its peak intensity the next day, with estimated 1‑minute winds of 240 km/h (150 mph), making it a \\"super typhoon\\" according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). Omar weakened significantly before striking eastern Taiwan on September 4, proceeding into eastern China the next day and dissipating on September 9\\\\. On Guam, Omar caused one death and $457 million (1992 USD) in damage. Strong gusts up to 248 km/h (154 mph) left nearly the entire island without power for several days. The outages disrupted the water system and prevented the island- based JTWC from issuing advisories for 11 days. Omar damaged or destroyed 2,158 houses, leaving 3,000 people homeless. In response to the destruction, the island's building codes were updated to withstand winds of 250 km/h (155 mph), and insurance companies discontinued new policies for structures not made of concrete. While passing well north of the Philippines, the typhoon killed 11 people and wrought ₱903 million ($35.4 million) worth of damage to 538 houses. Omar then brushed the southern islands of Japan with strong gusts and light rainfall, causing ¥476 million JPY (US$3.8 million) in crop losses. In Taiwan, scattered flooding caused three deaths and $65 million in damage, mostly to agriculture. ==Meteorological history== Typhoon Omar originated from a tropical disturbance that was first noted on August 20 over the open Pacific Ocean, which exhibited persistent convection, or thunderstorms. During this early phase, two tropical cyclones dissipated and another became extratropical across the western Pacific basin; this caused the monsoon trough, which spawned most of the storms in the basin, to realign in a more climatologically appropriate manner. According to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), Omar developed into a tropical depression at 1800 UTC on August 23. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed a slower pace of strengthening, issuing a tropical cyclone formation alert at 2100 UTC before initiating advisories on Tropical Depression 15W on August 24. As the depression traveled generally westward, the JTWC upgraded it to Tropical Storm Omar on August 25, and the JMA followed suit on the next day. Omar began to slow as it tracked westward. Outflow from nearby Tropical Storm Polly to the west produced a stream of strong wind shear over Omar, slowing intensification. The JTWC noted that the shear could decouple Omar's wind circulation from its convection, possibly weakening the storm. However, as Omar and Polly moved farther apart, a high- pressure ridge developed between the storms. This caused Omar to drift northward and then west-northwestward into a region with decreased shear, which allowed it to resume strengthening. Early on August 27, the JTWC upgraded the system to a typhoon, and an eye began to appear around 23:00 UTC that day. Omar entered a phase of rapid intensification on August 28, at which point the JMA also classified it as a typhoon. The typhoon made landfall on Guam soon after, with 1‑minute sustained winds of about 195 km/h (120 mph). The eye, 37 km (23 mi) in diameter, slowly crossed the northern portion of the small island over a period of 2.5 hours. At 1800 UTC on August 29, Omar reached its peak intensity with 10‑minute sustained winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 920 mbar (hPa; 27.17 inHg) as estimated by the JMA; this intensity was maintained for 24 hours before a steady weakening trend began. The JTWC estimated higher 1‑minute winds of around 240 km/h (150 mph), making Omar a super typhoon. Two days later, the typhoon came close enough to the Philippines to warrant monitoring from PAGASA, who named the storm Lusing. By 1500 UTC on September 3, the JMA downgraded Omar to a tropical storm, although the JTWC maintained its typhoon intensity through the next day. Heading generally westward, the storm made landfall on the east coast of Taiwan near Hualien City on September 4. After traversing the island in seven hours, Omar exited the coast of Yunlin County and emerged into the Taiwan Strait. The storm crossed the body of water and moved ashore in eastern China near Xiamen, Fujian, on September 5. Inland, Omar quickly degenerated into a tropical depression before turning west- southwest. It proceeded across southern China while heavily weakening, and completely dissipated over northern Vietnam on September 9. ==Preparations and impact== alt=Elevated black and white photograph of businesses surrounding a shoreline road. Though the waves and sea can be seen in the background, floodwaters and strewn debris are visible in the foreground. ===Guam=== Ahead of the storm on August 25, the United States Department of Defense set the Condition of Readiness (COR) at stage 3 on Guam, indicating destructive winds were possible within 48 hours. A day later, the COR was raised to stage 2; all but two United States Navy ships were sortied from the harbor to prevent damage, and the remainder rode out the storm southwest of Guam. On August 28, COR 1 was declared, the highest level. In response, all fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters on the island were moved into hangars or transported to Japan or the Philippines. All schools were closed for the duration of Omar's passage over Guam. Flight operations were suspended for at least two days, stranding 5,000 passengers on the island. About 3,100 people rode out the storm in emergency shelters. Omar was the strongest and most damaging typhoon to hit Guam since Typhoon Pamela in 1976. The typhoon was felt on all parts of Guam; tropical-storm-force winds affected the island for 16 hours, and wind gusts were estimated to have reached 248 km/h (154 mph) in areas beneath the western eyewall. However, the high winds caused the anemometer at Hagåtña to fail during the eye's passage, and the radar at Andersen Air Force Base was lost, preventing accurate wind speed assessments. The lowest barometric pressure was at Apra Harbor. Omar's slow movement resulted in prolonged heavy rainfall, peaking at at the Guam National Weather Service Office in Tiyan and reaching 417 mm (16.41 in) at Andersen AFB. Damage on Guam was heaviest from the central region to the northern coast, in particular to tourist areas and military bases. The Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station was shut down due to power outages and water damage to the generators. Two US Navy ships, the USS Niagara Falls (AFS-3) and the USS White Plains (AFS-4)—both naval supply ships—went aground due to rough seas and strong winds, and the dry dock at Apra Harbor was washed ashore. Omar destroyed dozens of businesses on the island. High winds knocked a crane into an apartment building and downed 400 wooden and 20 concrete power poles across Tumon, leaving 70% of the island without power. Throughout Guam, Omar disrupted transportation and communication systems, and led to the failure of water pumping systems. Landslides covered roads, and low-lying areas were flooded. About 2,000 homes were destroyed and another 2,200 were damaged to varying degrees, displacing nearly 3,000 people. Destruction was heaviest to wooden structures; buildings made of concrete fared relatively well during the storm. Island-wide, damage totaled $457 million, split nearly evenly between the military bases and civilian damage. One person died on Guam, and more than 200 people required emergency treatment--including about 80 injured by flying debris. ===Elsewhere=== While over the open Pacific Ocean, Omar passed well northeast of the Philippines just days after Tropical Storm Polly caused flooding and deaths in the country. The nation's chief weather specialist noted that Omar was \\"more powerful than Polly and [able to] induce monsoon rains over a wide area.\\" Omar ultimately affected northern Luzon, primarily the Cordillera Administrative Region, Ilocos Region, and the Cagayan Valley. Across the country, the storm killed 11 people. The typhoon destroyed 393 houses and damaged another 145, leaving 1,965 people homeless. Damage was estimated at ₱903 million ($35.4 million), much of it to agriculture. After its destructive landfall in Guam, Omar struck Wuqi District in Taiwan with maximum winds of 78 km/h (49 mph). The worst effects in the country were from widespread rain; the strongest rainfall rates remained concentrated in southern regions, peaking at in Kaohsiung. The storm flooded five counties and left 766,000 people without power. High waves washed ashore four ships in Kaohsiung, and farmland and fisheries there, as well as in Yunlin, Chiayi City, and Pingtung County, suffered heavy damage. Throughout Taiwan, Omar resulted in three deaths (two of which drownings), twelve injuries, and more than $65 million (USD) in damage. The fringes of the typhoon dropped light rainfall in the outer regions of Japan, peaking at on Iriomote-jima. The highest wind gust was 72 km/h (45 mph) on Yonaguni. Omar damaged the sugar cane and okra in the southern Japanese islands, leading to crop losses of ¥476 million JPY (US$3.8 million). In addition, traffic was disrupted and 38 flights were canceled. Later, Omar spread rainfall along its path through southern China, flooding parts of northwestern Hong Kong on September 7. ==Aftermath== alt=Black and white satellite image of Typhoon Omar depicting the storm's well-defined eye and expansive cyclonic cloud cover. Immediately after Omar's landfall in Guam, former Governor Joseph Franklin Ada declared a state of emergency, and former U.S. President George H. W. Bush declared the island a federal disaster area. In the wake of the storm, several people were arrested for looting. The Federal Emergency Management Agency opened up disaster assistance centers where residents were able to apply for federal aid; it ultimately provided about $18.4 million in assistance, including disaster housing, storm-related unemployment benefits, and grant programs for families or businesses, helping over 11,000 people. The federal government paid for 100% of the debris removal, emergency work, and reconstruction of uninsured public buildings, although it usually only provides 75% of the cost for typical disasters. This was due to the sequence of three significant tropical cyclones affecting the United States in three weeks; in addition to Omar, Hurricane Andrew struck Florida in August and Hurricane Iniki hit Hawaii in September. The Department of Defense assisted the affected areas with 27 members of the Guam National Guard and 700 members of the military. The military provided temporary housing, generators, and construction supplies, at a cost of $5.75 million, though most of the disaster needs were handled by the government. The local Red Cross provided $6 million in assistance after the storm. Due to the combined damages from Andrew, Iniki, and Omar, the United States Congress passed the Dire Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1992, which provided additional funding for the agencies responding to the disasters through the fiscal year ending on September 30. For 11 days, the JTWC on Guam was unable to continue operations, relying on a backup agency. The damage to the airport radar prompted the NEXRAD--a network of high- resolution weather radars--to be installed earlier than scheduled, in February 1993, and limited incoming and outgoing flights to the daytime. On August 30, a naval ship docked at Apra Harbor to provide a temporary mobile radar. By September 15, both ships that had been washed ashore were refloated. In the aftermath of the destruction, insurance companies decided to stop issuing new policies for structures not made of concrete. In January 1996, former Governor Carl Gutierrez issued an executive order, mandating that homes or storm shutters on the island withstand winds of at least 250 m/h (155 mph). The citizens left homeless by Omar resided in a tent city nicknamed Camp Omar, consisting of 200 tents holding more than 1,000 people. Volunteers and military efforts cleaned most of the debris on the island within a few weeks. Many important roads were reopened by three days after the storm. The power took four weeks to be restored island-wide, disrupting schools and businesses, although water access was expected to be restored within a few days of the storm. Schools reopened on September 14, and most businesses resumed their work by the end of the month. The United States military ceased relief operations on September 19, though complete recovery was disrupted by the passage of several subsequent typhoons. These storms caused less damage than normal after Omar wrecked the more vulnerable structures. As a result, it became difficult to discern the damage between Omar and Typhoon Gay in December 1992. A 1993 study in the medical journal Anxiety found that 7.2% of 320 participants affected by Omar developed acute stress reaction, and another 15% developed early traumatic stress response, especially those affected by the later typhoons. About 5.9% of the participants displayed symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, similar to the levels shown after Hurricane Hugo in 1989.

It is a solitary, nocturnal, terrestrial animal that feeds on arthropods and other invertebrates, usually living in the vicinity of streams and swamps. One of the larger species of armadillo, it measures in total length and generally weighing , though it can reach as much as . Spurs on its hind legs allow it to crawl on its knees into narrow tunnels. == Subspecies == Two subspecies are recognised; D. k. kappleri Krauss, 1862, from southeastern Colombia, southern Venezuela, The Guianas and the lower part of the Amazon Basin in Brazil; D. k. pastasae Thomas, 1901, from eastern Ecuador, eastern Peru, northeastern Bolivia and the upper part of the Amazon basin in Brazil. ==Description== The greater long-nose armadillo is the largest armadillo in its genus. Its head-and-body length is between and its tail between , with a weight usually varying between . Like other armadillos, the forequarters and the hindquarters are each protected by an armoured shield, and in this species, there are seven or eight ossified rings between the two. A distinguishing characteristic of this species is the transverse rows of large projecting scales on the hind side of the rear legs. ==Distribution and habitat== This armadillo is native to tropical northeastern South America. Its range includes Guyana, Surinam, French Guiana, Colombia to the east of the Andes, Venezuela to the south of the Orinoco River, and the Amazon Basin of Brazil, Ecuador, Peru and northeastern Bolivia. It is a mammal of humid lowland forest in the basins of the Orinoco and Amazon. It also occurs in patches of forest in savannah areas. It is common in forested areas in the uplands where less hunting takes place, and forages on floodplains near headwater streams, in palm swamps, on hill sides and hill tops. ==Ecology== The species has been little studied by researchers and its natural history is poorly known. However, the Matsés people, an indigenous tribe from the upper Amazon basin, were able to tell researchers a great deal about the animals. This armadillo is solitary and nocturnal. It spends the day in a burrow dug in the bank of a gully or beside a stream on the flood plain. The burrow has a single entrance, a pungent, leaf-lined sleeping chamber and a long retreat tunnel, often sloppy with a little water. Each animal has several burrows which it occupies on different days. Small white flies live in association with this armadillo. They are present by day at the entrance of active burrows, and are more numerous when an armadillo is in residence. This armadillo is hunted for food by the Matsés people and is much esteemed, especially in April and May when it is at its fattest. It is usually caught by flooding its burrow and digging it out. When disturbed it makes a rumbling growl, and when attacked, growls more loudly. Before dusk the armadillo starts to stir. When it is fully dark it rushes out of the burrow and sets off along one of its paths; these run along hill tops and across foraging areas. The armadillo stops at intervals to hunt around for beetles and their larvae, millipedes and centipedes, digging in soft ground for earthworms, and also consuming fallen fruit. It is very fond of the fruits of the Oenocarpus bataua palm, and also eats the ants that climb on these fruits, as well as any other invertebrates it may chance upon. It may swim across streams and wallow in mud holes. When dawn is approaching it finds its path and follows it to one of its burrows. Here it gathers some leaf litter to add to its resting chamber and retires underground. It moves around, compressing its bed for a while before settling down. It sometimes emerges from its burrow by day during heavy rain. Mating may take place when two animals encounter each other at night. The female usually has two offspring which are born in the burrow, and follow her around when they are old enough to do so. When out at night, jaguars (Panthera onca) and pumas (Puma concolor) are the greatest danger to the armadillo. When it crosses streams, the armadillo may be seized by a black caiman (Melanosuchus niger) or an anaconda (Eunectes murinus). It can also be killed by tayras (Eira barbara) when several hunt together. During the day, bush dogs (Speothos venaticus) sometimes enter the burrow and pull the armadillo out, eating it beside the entrance. ==Status== D. kappleri has a very wide range and is present in a number of protected areas. The chief threat it faces is from deforestation as it is unable to live in open countryside. It is hunted for meat in some areas but no other significant threats have been identified. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". In the Llanos region of Colombia, the organisation Fundación Omacha is undertaking an education and awareness campaign among local people featuring this species. ==See also== * ==ReferencesCategory:Armadillos Armadillo, Greater long-nosed Armadillo, Greater long-nosed Armadillo, Greater long-nosed Armadillo, Greater long-nosed Armadillo, Greater long-nosed Armadillo, Greater long-nosed Armadillo, Greater long-nosed Armadillo, Greater long-nosed Armadillo, Greater long-nosed Armadillo, Greater long-nosed Armadillo, Greater long-nosed Category:Mammals described in 1862 Category:Taxa named by Christian Ferdinand Friedrich Krauss ","title":"Greater long-nosed armadillo"},{"id":"3248516","text":"Jemo Island Atoll (Marshallese: ' or ', Marshallese-English Dictionary - Place Name Index) is an uninhabited coral island in the Pacific Ocean, in the Ratak Chain of the Marshall Islands north-east of Likiep Atoll.

This book was released in February 2005. Drowned Wednesday is afflicted with the deadly sin of gluttony. ==Plot summary== Drowned Wednesday is the first Trustee among the Morrow Days who is on Arthur's side and wishes the Will to be fulfilled. She appears as a leviathan/whale and suffers from Gluttony. The book begins when Leaf is visiting Arthur and they are discussing the invitation that Drowned Wednesday sent him. Arthur had been admitted to hospital because of the damage done to his leg when he attempted to enter Tuesday's Treasure Tower. Suddenly, the hospital room becomes flooded with water as the two are transported to the Border Sea of the House. Leaf is snatched away by a large ship with green sails, known as the Flying Mantis, while Arthur remains in his bed. When the Medallion given him by the immortal called the Mariner apparently fails to summon help, Arthur is without hope. Eventually, a buoy marking the pirate Elishar Feverfew's treasure floats toward him. As soon as Arthur opens it, his hand is marked with a bloody red color. Arthur now has the Red Hand, by which Feverfew marks whoever has found his treasure, so that he can identify them later. Not long after, a scavenging ship called the Moth rescues Arthur. On board, Arthur (going by the name of Arth) is introduced to Sunscorch, the First Mate, and to Captain Catapillow. Their journey brings them through the Line of Storms and into the Border Sea, where they are later pursued by Feverfew's ghostly ship, the Shiver. The damage inflicted on the Moth is serious; therefore Sunscorch commands an Upper House Sorcerer, Dr. Scamandros, to open a transfer portal to elsewhere in the Secondary Realms. Scamandros claims that Arthur is carrying something that interfered with his magic, and tells Sunscorch to throw him overboard. As a last resort, Arthur shows them the Mariner's Medallion, which stops Scamandros saying that they must get rid of Arthur. After going through the transfer portal (with Arthur's help), the ship is grounded on a beach. When Arthur wished to learn what happened to Leaf, Dr. Scamandros applies his sorcery to make it possible. She is revealed to be aboard the ship Flying Mantis. Arthur joins Catapillow for supper, later to reveal his identity. At first, Propaganda issued by Dame Primus (Arthur's Steward) makes them skeptical of this, but they eventually become convinced. A few days later, Wednesday's Dawn takes Arthur to meet Wednesday for her 'luncheon of seventeen removes'. As they approach, Wednesday shrinks into her human form to meet Arthur. During their lunch, Wednesday tells Arthur that after Part 3 of the Will has been released, she will surrender the Third Key to Arthur. Arthur is then taken by Wednesday's Dawn to a place called the triangle in search of his friend Leaf. He learns that Leaf has been forced to work on the Mantis, but is otherwise intact. Arthur later makes a deal with the Raised Rats, a group of anthropomorphic rats brought to the House by the Piper, to take him to Feverfew's hideout, which they believe is inside a miniature world located within Drowned Wednesday's stomach. On the Raised Rats' ship, Arthur opens a gift from Dr. Scamandros, which proves to be a golden transfer watch. With this, he communicates with and rescues Dr. Scamandros. He then uses a scrying mirror Dr. Scamandros gave him to watch Leaf. A rat watches him during the scry, and later saves him from a battle with Feverfew. Later, the Rats bring Arthur onto their submarine, where he meets with Suzy Turquiose Blue. In contrast to Suzy's former cockney attitude, she has assumed a more \\"ladylike and proper\\" demeanor on the orders of Dame Primus. Only when they are no longer on the Border Sea, but under it, does she resume her customary ways of speech and dress. They are, with navigational difficulty, able to enter the stomach of Lady Wednesday and the worldlet therein. There, Arthur and Suzy, disguised as rats, find escaped slaves, professed followers of the Carp. These exiles take them to the Carp, who is the third part of the Will. They are halted in their attempt to escape by Feverfew, who proposes that each of them will try to kill the other by means of one strike only. Arthur fails his first try, then dodges Feverfew and severs his head. Leaf, who is Feverfew's prisoner, then kicks it into a mud puddle containing Nothing, which consumes it. Upon his death, the worldlet begins to collapse. Via the Moth, Arthur and all his friends (with the exception of the reluctant Catapillow) are able to escape. Lady Wednesday recovers from her gluttony, then dies as a result of being poisoned by the worldlet, which had opened a void to Nothing. Arthur, now Duke of the Border Sea, appoints Sunscorch as his Noon and Scamandros as his Dusk. == External links == * Category:2005 novels *3 Category:Novels by Garth Nix Category:Children's fantasy novels Category:2005 fantasy novels Category:Aurealis Award-winning works Category:HarperCollins books Category:Allen & Unwin books ","title":"Drowned Wednesday"},{"id":"3248538","text":"Charlotte is the largest parish of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, situated on the eastern coast of the island of Saint Vincent.

Radio-carbon evidence suggests the Yayoi period began between 1,000 and 800 BCE.Silberman et al., 154–155.Schirokauer et al., 133–143. They interacted, killed off and/or mixed with the remaining Jōmon people to form the modern Japanese people. Most modern Japanese people have primarily Yayoi ancestry (more than 90% on average, with their remaining ancestry deriving from the Jōmon). ==Origin== The terms Yayoi and Wajin can be used interchangeably, though \\"Wajin\\" (倭人) refers to the people of Wa and \\"Wajin\\" (和人) is another name for the modern Yamato people.David Blake Willis and Stephen Murphy-Shigematsu: Transcultural Japan: At the Borderlands of Race, Gender and Identity, , p. 272: \\"“Wajin,” which is written with Chinese characters that can also be read “Yamato no hito” (Yamato person)\\". There are several hypotheses about the origin of the Yayoi people: * The most popular theory is that they were the people who brought wet rice cultivation to Japan from the Korean peninsula and Jiangnan near the Yangtze River Delta in ancient China.崎谷満『DNA・考古・言語の学際研究が示す新・日本列島史』(勉誠出版 2009年)(in Japanese) This is supported by archeological researches and bones found in modern southeastern China. * Another view is that they are from the northern part of the Korean peninsula. This is because the human bones of the Doigahama ruins resemble the ancient human bones of the northern part of the Korean peninsula, and pottery is similar to the \\"Engraved band sentence pottery\\", that is widely used during the Yayoi period and was also discovered in the Sini-Gai culture in the southwestern coastal province of Primorskaya Oblast.ロシア極東新石器時代研究の新展開 (in Japanese) * The theory that Yayoi people have multiple origins has also been suggested and is influential.徳永勝士 (2003)「HLA と人類の移動」『Science of humanity Bensei 』(42), 4-9, 東京：勉誠出版 (in Japanese)岡正雄『異人その他 日本民族=文化の源流と日本国家の形成』 言叢社 1979 (in Japanese) * The historian Ann Kumar presented genetic and linguistic evidence that some of the Yayoi people were of Austronesian origin. *According to several Japanese historians, the Yayoi and their ancestors, the Wajin, originated in the today Yunnan province in southern China.鳥越憲三郎『原弥生人の渡来 』(角川書店,1982)、『倭族から日本人へ』(弘文堂 ,1985)、『古代朝鮮と倭族』(中公新書,1992)、『倭族トラジャ』(若林弘子との共著、大修館書店,1995)、『弥生文化の源流考』(若林弘子との共著、大修館書店,1998)、『古代中国と倭族』(中公新書,2000)、『中国正史倭人・倭国伝全釈』(中央公論新社,2004) Suwa Haruo considered Wa-zoku (Wajin) to be part of the Baiyue (百越).諏訪春雄編『倭族と古代日本』(雄山閣出版、1993)また諏訪春雄通信100 The Yayoi were present on large parts of the Korean Peninsula before they were displaced and assimilated by arriving proto-Koreans.Vovin, Alexander (2013). \\"From Koguryo to Tamna: Slowly riding to the South with speakers of Proto-Korean\\". Korean Linguistics. 15 (2): 222–240. Similarly Whitman (2012) suggests that the Yayoi are not related to the proto-Koreans but that they were present on the Korean peninsula during the Mumun pottery period. According to him, Japonic arrived in the Korean peninsula around 1500 BCE and was brought to the Japanese archipelago by the Yayoi at around 950 BCE. The language family associated with both Mumun and Yayoi culture is Japonic. Koreanic arrived later from Manchuria to the Korean peninsula at around 300 BCE and coexist with the descendants of the Japonic Mumun cultivators (or assimilated them). Both had influence on each other and a later founder effect diminished the internal variety of both language families. === Genetics === It is estimated that Yayoi people mainly belonged to Haplogroup O-M176 (O1b2) (today ~36%), Haplogroup O-M122 (O2, formerly O3) (today ~23%) and Haplogroup O-M119 (O1) (today ~4%), which are typical for East- and Southeast-Asians. Mitsuru Sakitani suggests that haplogroup O1b2, which is common in today Koreans, Japanese and some Manchu, and O1 are one of the carriers of Yangtze civilization. As the Yangtze civilization declined several tribes crossed westward and northerly, to the Shandong peninsula, the Korean Peninsula and the Japanese archipelago.崎谷満『DNA・考古・言語の学際研究が示す新・日本列島史』(勉誠出版 2009年 One study calls haplogroup O1b1 as a major Austroasiatic paternal lineage and the haplogroup O1b2 (of Koreans and Japanese) as a \\"para-Austroasiatic\\" paternal lineage. The modern Yamato people are predominantly descendants of the Yayoi people and closely related to other modern East Asians, particularly Koreans and Han Chinese. It is estimated that the majority of Japanese people around Tokyo have about 12% Jōmon ancestry or less. A genome research (Takashi et al. 2019) confirmed that modern Japanese (Yamato) descend mostly from the Yayoi people. Mitochondrial DNA analysis of Jōmon and modern Japanese samples show that there is a discontinuity between the mtDNAs of people from the Jōmon period and people from the Kofun and Heian periods. This finding implies that the genetic conversion of the Japanese people may have occurred during or before the Kofun era, at least at the Shomyoji site.David Blake Willis and Stephen Murphy-Shigematsu: Transcultural Japan: At the Borderlands of Race, Gender and Identity, , p. 272: \\"“Wajin,” which is written with Chinese characters that can also be read “Yamato no hito” (Yamato person)\\".Another genetic study (2019) estimated that modern Japanese (Yamato) share more than 90% of their genome with the Yayoi people and less than 10% with the Jomon. A more recent study by Gakihari et al. 2019 estimates that modern Japanese people have on average about 92% Yayoi ancestry (with the remainder being from the Jomon) and cluster closely with other East Asians but are clearly distinct from the Ainu people. A geneflow estimation by Gakuhari et al. suggests only 3,3% Jōmon ancestry in modern Japanese. == Language == ==See also== *Japanese people *Yayoi culture ==References== ==Notes== Category:Ancient Japan Category:Archaeology of Japan Category:Tribes of ancient Japan Category:Yayoi period ","title":"Yayoi people"},{"id":"3248543","text":"ULTRACOM -- or Telecomunicaciones Ultramarinas de Puerto Rico (TUPR) in Spanish-- is a telecommunications corporation that manages satellite and submarine communications cable systems connected to Puerto Rico.

However, very little geographical variation has been reported in many of these previous studies (e.g. Ogata, 1981; Dodo, 1982; Yamaguchi, 1982; Hanihara and Uchida, 1985; Mouri, 1988; Kondo, 1993, 1994). This has led researchers to regard the Jōmon as a morphologically homogeneous population. Tsunehiko Hanihara of the Department of Anatomy at Jichi Medical School suggests that the inhabitants of Aogashima and Okinawa, Minatogawa Man, the Jōmon and the modern Ainu are most likely directly descended from Proto-Mongoloids of Late Pleistocene Sundaland.Hanihara, Tsunehiko.

Brace (1990) said that the Jōmon people share many physical characteristics with Caucasians, but form a separate genetic lineage than that of modern Europeans. A craniometric study by Brace et al. (2001) shows a closer morphological relation of the Jōmon and Ainu people to prehistoric and modern Europeans rather than to other contemporary East Asians. The study concludes that the Jōmon people are descendants of a population (dubbed \\"Eurasians\\" by Brace et al.) that moved into northern Eurasia (and also the Americas) in the Late Pleistocene, which significantly predates the expansion of the modern core population of East Asia. Other studies suggest that the Jōmon people were not a homogenous group and rather heterogeneous. According to Ishida et al. 2009, the majority of Jōmon appear similar to Bronze Age southern Siberians. There is evidence that the Jōmon retained features of Paleolithic populations from the western half of Eurasia (Europe), Central Asia and or southern Siberia. On the other hand Jomon groups on Kyushu, Shikoku and parts of southern Honshu show similarities to East-Asian (Mongoloid) phenotypes.上田正昭他『日本古代史の謎再考（エコール・ド・ロイヤル 古代日本を考える１）』 学生社 1983年 pp.52より According to “Jōmon culture and the peopling of the Japanese archipelago” by Schmidt and Seguchi (2014), the prehistoric Jōmon people descended from a paleolithic population of Siberia (Altai mountains region). Other cited scholars point out similarities between the Jōmon and various paleolithic and Bronze Age Siberians. Nevertheless there were likely multiple migrations into Jōmon-period Japan. == Languages == It is not known what language or languages were spoken during the Jōmon period. Suggested languages are: The Ainu language, Japonic languages, Tungusic languages, Austronesian languages, Paleosiberian languages or unknown and today extinct languages.小泉保（1998）『縄文語の発見』青土社 (in Japanese)『古代に真実を求めて 第七集（古田史学論集）』2004年、古田史学の会（編集） (in Japanese) While the most supported view is to equate the Ainu language with the Jōmon language, this view is not unproblematic as at least four tribes in central- and western-Japan are believed to have spoken a Tungusic language, at least three tribes in Kyushu and Okinawa an Austronesian language and it is not known if there were other groups with different languages too. ==Culture== The culture of the Jōmon people is known as \\"Jōmon culture\\". It was largely based on food collection and hunting but it is also suggested that the Jōmon people practiced early agriculture. They gathered tree nuts and shellfish, laid the foundations for living such as hunting and fishing, and also made some cultivation. They used stoneware and pottery, and lived in a pit dwelling. Some elements of modern Japanese culture may have come from Jomon groups. Among these elements are the precursors to Shinto, some marriage customs, some architectural styles, and possibly some technological developments such as lacquerware, laminated yumi, metalworking, and glass making. === Pottery === The Jōmon pottery style used by the Jōmon is a “cord-marked” style and is the name contributor for the Jōmon period. The pottery style characteristic of the first phases of Jōmon culture was decorated by impressing cords into the surface of wet clay and is generally accepted to be among the oldest in East Asia and the world.Kuzmin, Y.V. (2006). \\"Chronology of the Earliest Pottery in East Asia: Progress and Pitfalls\\". Antiquity. 80 (308): 362–371. doi:10.1017/s0003598x00093686. Next to clay pots and vessels, the Jōmon also made many highly stylized statues (Dogū), clay masks, stone batons or rods and swords. === Craftsmanship === There is evidence that the Jōmon people built ships out of big trees and used them for fishing and traveling. There is no agreement if they used sails or paddles.堤隆は旧石器時代の神津島での黒曜石採取については、丸木舟を建造出来るような石器が存在しなかったことから考えて、カヤックのようなスキンボートを使用したのではないかと指摘している（堤隆『黒曜石3万年の旅』NHKブックス、2004年、93ページ） The Jomon also used Obsidian, Jade and different kinds of wood.本節の典拠は橋口、前掲書、158-172ページ The Jōmon created many jewelry and ornamental items. The Magatama was likely invented by one of the Jōmon tribes and is commonly found in Japan. === Religion === The religion of, at least some, Jōmon people was similar to early Shintoism (see Ko-Shintō). It was largely based on animism and possibly shamanism. Other likely similar religions are the Ryukyuan and Ainu religion.Richard Pilgrim, Robert Ellwood (1985). Japanese Religion (1st ed.). Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall Inc. pp. 18–19. . == Descendants == This section deals with the suggested descendants of the people during the Jōmon period. === Ainu people === Historical extent of the Ainu people It is generally agreed that the Ainu people are the direct descendants of the Jōmon people. Although the Ainu show some influence from the Okhotsk people, a genetic study shows that the Hokkaido Ainu share most of their genome with ancient Jomon samples from northern Honshu and Hokkaido. === Emishi === The Emishi, a former non-Yamato group in Honshu, are often linked to the Ainu people, but several historians suggest that they were their own Jōmon group and did not share close cultural connections to the Ainu. The Satsumon Culture of northern Honshu, one of the cultures that merged to originate the Ainu culture, is often speculated to be related to the Emishi culture. === Siberian populations === Some ethnic groups in southeastern Siberia, such as the Ulch people, the Nivkh people and the Itelmens, show some Ainu-like genome informations. It is suggested that ancient Jōmon people migrated to parts of Siberia and mixed with the local population. === Yamato people === The Yamato Japanese are mostly descended from the Yayoi people but also have admixture from the Jōmon people. It is estimated that the Jōmon ancestry is less than 20%. Another study estimates the Jōmon ancestry in people from Tokyo at approximately 15%. One study estimates less than 15% of Jōmon ancestry in modern Yamato people. Recent studies suggest that the Japanese people descend mostly from the Yayoi people, and that the Yayoi largely displaced the local Jōmon. Another genome research (Takahashi et al. 2019) further confirms that modern Japanese (Yamato) descend mostly from the Yayoi people. Mitochondrial DNA analysis of Jōmon and modern Japanese samples show that there is a discontinuity between the mtDNAs of people from the Jōmon period and people from the Kofun and Heian periods. This finding implies that the genetic conversion of the Japanese people may have occurred during or before the Kofun era, at least at the Shomyoji site. === Ryukyuan people === According to several studies, the Ryukyuan people share more alleles with the Jōmon period (16,000–3,000 years ago) hunter-gatherers and Ainu people than the Yamato Japanese, have smaller genetic contributions from Asian continental populations, which supports the dual-structure model of K. Hanihara (1991), a widely accepted theory which suggests that the Yamato Japanese are more admixed with Asian agricultural continental people (from the Korean Peninsula) than the Ainu and the Ryukyuans, with major admixture occurring in and after the Yayoi period (3,000-1,700 years ago). Within the Japanese population, the Ryukyuans make a separate and one of the two genome-wide clusters along the main-island Honshu. The Jomon ancestry is estimated at approximately 28% or 50-60%, depending on various studies. The admixture event which formed the admixed Ryukyuans was estimated at least 1100–1075 years ago, which corresponds to the Gusuku period, and is considered to be related to the arrival of migrants from Japan. Thus, the Ryukyuans appear to be genetically closest to the Ainu from the Ainu viewpoint, whereas it is exactly the opposite from the Ryukyuans' viewpoint, who are closest to the Yamato Japanese. According to recent genome studies, Ryukyuans and especially Okinawans are closest to other East Asians but are also relative homogenous on a genetic level. The study did not find much evidence for a strong Jōmon influence on Ryukyuans. On average, the Okinawans were found to share 80.8% admixture with Japanese and 19.2% admixture with Chinese. Individual admixture estimates were quite variable and ranged from 5.84% to 57.82% Chinese admixture, which likely coincides with historical migrations of Chinese people to Okinawa. == Genetics == === Proposed Origin === There are several theories about their origin. Some suggested Southeast Asia or Northeast Asia as possible place of origin, while other theories supported an origin in East Asia itself. The newest genetic studies conclude that the Jōmon were part of a population from continental Eurasia. The Jōmon, when compared with worldwide populations, are relative closest to East Asians compared with African, European, Sahulian (Australo-Melanesian) and Native American groups. The comparison with the genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data of HGDP (Human Genome Diversity Panel) populations also showed the unique status of the Sanganji Jomon, who was positioned far apart from all modern East Eurasians. The uniqueness of the Sanganji Jomon within East Eurasians is consistent with the results including Europeans and Africans. When the Ainu, the mainland Japanese and the Ryukyuans from the Japanese Archipelago and CHB28 (Chinese from Beijing) were compared with Sanganji Jōmon, PC1 separated the Ainu and Sanganji Jōmon from the other populations. The population closest to the Sanganji Jōmon was the Ainu, followed by the Ryukyuan and then the mainland Japanese. Most scientists today suggest that the Jōmon are descendants of an ancient continental Eurasian population. The Jōmon cluster as own clade, distinct from other human population groups including East Asians, but share some relations to coastal people of East Asia, including modern Japanese, Ulchi, Koreans and native Taiwanese. According to Mitsuru Sakitani the Jōmon people are an admixture of two distinct ethnic groups: A more ancient group from Central Asia (carriers of Y chromosome D-M55), that were present since more than 30,000 years in Japan and a more recent group (carriers of Y chromosome C1a) that migrated to Japan about 13,000 years ago. Haplogroup D1 arrived from Central Asia to northern Kyushu via the Altai Mountains and the Korean Peninsula more than 40,000 years before present, and Haplogroup D-M55 (D1a2) was born in Japanese archipelago. D-M55 is distinct from other D-branches since more than 53,000 years and has five unique mutations not found the others.崎谷満『DNA・考古・言語の学際研究が示す新・日本列島史』（勉誠出版 2009年）(in Japanese)Mondal, Mayukh & Bergström, Anders & Xue, Yali & Calafell, Francesc & Laayouni, Hafid & Casals, Ferran & Majumder, Partha & Tyler-Smith, Chris & Bertranpetit, Jaume. (2017). Y-chromosomal sequences of diverse Indian populations and the ancestry of the Andamanese. Human Genetics. 136. 10.1007/s00439-017-1800-0. C1a1's ancestral type reached Japan over the Korean Peninsula via the Altai Mountains from Western Asia. Although its age of arrival is unknown, the spread of the existing subgroup is about 12,000 years ago, which is almost consistent with the start of the Jōmon period. The next relative C1a2 was common in ancient European and West Asian samples and is still found in small numbers of modern Europeans, Armenians, Algerians (Kabyle Berbers), and Nepalis. In an overview article of recent genetic and morphological studies, Schmidt & Seguchi (2014) also suggest multiple origins for the Jōmon populations. ===Paternal lineages=== It is thought that the haplogroups D-M55 (D1a2) and C1a1 were frequent in Jōmon people. One Jōmon man excavated from Rebun Island was found to belong to Haplogroup D1a2b1(D-CTS 220).神澤ほか(2016)「礼文島船泊縄文人の核ゲノム解析」第70回日本人類学大会 (in Japanese) Haplogroup D-M55 is found in about 35%Mayukh Monda Anders BergströmYali XueFrancesc CalafellHafid LaayouniFerran CasalsPartha P. MajumderChris Tyler-SmithEmail authorJaume Bertranpetit (2008)Genetics May 2017, Volume 136, Issue 5, pp 499–510-39% and haplogroup C1a1 in about 5% of modern Japanese people.Youichi Sato, Toshikatsu Shinka, Ashraf A. Ewis, Aiko Yamauchi, Teruaki Iwamoto, Yutaka Nakahori, et al., \\"Overview of genetic variation in the Y chromosome of modern Japanese males.\\" Anthropological Science Vol. 122(3), 131–136, 2014. In addition, it is assumed that the haplogroup C2 existed in a small amount of Jōmon people.崎谷満 (2009)『DNA・考古・言語の学際研究が示す新・日本列島史』勉誠出版 (in Japanese) D-M55 is only found in Japanese (Ainu, Ryukyuans, and Yamato). Haplogroup C1a has been found in modern Japanese, Paleolithic and Neolithic Europe, and in very few samples of modern Europeans, Armenians, Algerians, Nepalis, Koreans, and northeast Chinese. Recently it was confirmed that the Japanese branch of haplogroup D-M55 is distinct and isolated from other D-branches since more than 53,000 years. The split between D1a2-M55 and D1a-F6251 (the latter of which is common in Tibet and has a moderate distribution in the rest of East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Central Asia) may have occurred in Central Asia, while some others suggest an instant split during the origin of haplogroup D itself, as the Japanese branch has five unique mutations not found in any other D-branch. A recent DNA study in 2019 suggests that haplogroup D-M55 was carried by about 70% and haplogroup C1a1 by about 30% of the ancient Jōmon people. A specific Japanese-Jōmon clade is only found in ancient Jōmon and modern Japanese. No other population was found to carry this specific clade, which supports the distinct position of the Jōmon population. ===Maternal lineages=== MtDNA Haplogroup Jōmon people is characterized by the presence of haplogroups M7a and N9b. Studies published in 2004 and 2007 show the combined frequency of M7a and N9b observed in modern Japanese to be from 12~15% to 17% in mainstream Japanese.M. Tanaka, V. M. Cabrera, A. M. González et al. (2004), \\"Mitochondrial Genome Variation in Eastern Asia and the Peopling of Japan\\" N9b is frequently found in the Hokkaido Jomons while M7a is found frequently in the Tohoku Jomons.Ancient mitochondrial DNA sequences of Jomon teeth samples from Sanganji, Tohoku district, Japan. M7a is estimated to share a most recent common ancestor with M7b'c, a clade whose members are found mainly in Japan (including Jōmon people), other parts of East Asia, and Southeast Asia, 33,500 (95% CI 26,300 <-> 42,000) years before present.YFull MTree 1.01.5902 as of April 20, 2019 All extant members of haplogroup M7a are estimated to share a most recent common ancestor 20,500 (95% CI 14,700 <-> 27,800) years before present. Haplogroup M7a now has its highest frequency in Okinawa. Haplogroup N9b is estimated to share a most recent common ancestor with N9a and Y, two clades that are widespread in eastern Asia, 37,700 (95% CI 29,600 <-> 47,300) years before present. All extant members of haplogroup N9b are estimated to share a most recent common ancestor 21,100 (95% CI 16,700 <-> 26,200) years before present. Haplogroup N9b now has its highest frequency among Tungusic peoples in southeastern Siberia (especially Udeges), but it has been found to be very common in skeletal remains of Jōmon people of northern Japan (Tōhoku and Hokkaidō). In addition, haplogroups D4, D5, M7b, M8, M9a, M10, G, A, B, and F have been found in Jōmon people as well.2017 度第４回日本海学講座 2018年1月13日（土）富山県民会館611号室 14:00～15:30 「日本海地域における日本人の歴史－小竹貝塚出土人骨を中心として－」 国立科学博物館 研究主幹 坂上和弘氏篠田謙一『日本人になった祖先たち—DNAから解明するその多元的構造』日本放送出版協会・NHKブックス、2007年 (in Japanese)Genetic structure of the Japanese and the formation of the Ainu population These latter haplogroups are all distributed widely among populations of East Asia (including modern Japanese, Ryukyuans, and Ainus) and Southeast Asia, but some of their subclades are distributed almost exclusively in Japan. ===ATL retrovirus === A gene common in Jōmon people is a retrovirus of ATL (human T lymphotropic virus, HTVL-I). This virus was discovered as a cause of adult T cell leukemia (ATL), and research was advanced by Takuo Hinuma of Kyoto University Virus Research Institute. Although it was known that many virus carriers existed in Japan, it was not found at all in neighboring countries of East Asia. Meanwhile, it has been found in many Africans, Native Americans, Tibetans, Siberians, Burmese people, Indigenous people of New Guinea, Polynesians, etc. Looking at distribution in Japan, it is seen particularly frequently in southern Kyushu, Nagasaki Prefecture, Okinawa and among the Ainu. And it is seen at medium frequency in the southern part of Shikoku, southern part of the Kii Peninsula, the Pacific side of the Tōhoku region (Sanriku) and Oki Islands. Overall, carriers of the ATL retrovirus were found to be more common in remote areas and remote islands. When examining the well-developed areas of ATL in each region of Kyushu, Shikoku, and Tōhoku in detail, carriers are preserved at high rates in small settlements that were isolated from the surroundings and inconvenient for traffic. The path of natural infection of this virus is limited to vertical infection between women and children (most often through breastfeeding) and horizontal infection between males and females (most often from males to females through sexual intercourse).Coffin JM, Hughes SH, Varmus HE, editors. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 1997. Based on the above, Hinuma concluded that the high frequency area of this virus indicates the high density remain of Jōmon people. === Ikawazu Jōmon studies (2018~) === In the current study, a analysis of partial genome sequences of Sanganji, Ikawazu, and Funadomari Jomon were found to share a common lineage, although the data were not sufficient to identify geographical variations. Based on craniometric data, Kondo et al. (2017).Late Jomon male and female genome sequences from the Funadomari site in Hokkaido, Japan A partial genome analysis in 2018 about the prehistoric peopling of Southeast Asia analysed 26 ancient samples from Southeast Asia spanning from the late Neolithic to the Iron Age. They analysed an Ikawazu Jōmon (named IK002) sample from southeast Honshu, and a draft sequence of the Jomon genome was determined from IK002. The Jomon female skeleton which was analyzed shows typical Jōmon morphology. This Jōmon individual partially shares some ancestry with prehistoric Hoabinhians, who also share some ancestry with Onge, Jehai (Peninsular Malaysia) in mainland Southeast Asia along with Indian groups and Papua New Guineans, which represents possible gene flow from that group into the Jōmon population. On the 'Admixture graphs fitting ancient Southeast Asian genomes' Using qpGraph, present-day East Asians can be modeled as a mixture of an Önge-like population and a population related to the Tiányuán individual. While The Jōmon individual is modeled as a mix of Hòabìnhian (La368) and East Asian ancestry.Fig. 3 Admixture graphs fitting ancient Southeast Asian genomes However, there is still lack of ancient genome data to understand the peopling history of East Eurasians. It is required to analyze more ancient genome data, if there found appropriate skeletons, in order to fill the gap and to prove the speculation.https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/03/15/579177.full.pdf Her mitochondrial mtDNA is Haplogroup N9b which is typical of Northeast Siberian populations, this haplogroups in present-day Japaneses people (< 2.0%), but typically found in previous studies of Jomon mtDNAJomon genome sheds light on East Asian population history N9b 4% in Okinawans, 6.9% in modern Ulchi 8% in Modern Ainu, 32.3% in the Udegey, People of the Amur-Ussuri where the region carry high frequencies of N9b.Investigating the Prehistory of Tungusic Peoples of Siberia and the Amur-Ussuri Region with Complete mtDNA Genome Sequences and Y-chromosomal Markers Additional analysis in 2019 of the IK002 show that she clusters as an outgroup with other East Eurasian populations. Using principal component analysis (PCA) IK002 clusters basal to present-day Southeast and East Asians and the Upper-Paleolithic human remain (40 kya) from Tiányuán Cave (ancestors to modern East Asians and Native Americas). However If IK002 were a true outgroup to later East Asian groups, this statistic is expected to be zero for any test population X. However, it find that together with Japanese, present-day Taiwan aborigines (Ami and Atayal), as well as minorities in the Okhotsk-Primorye region (Ulchi and Nivhk) also showed a significant excess of alleles haring with IK002. The highest IK002-related contributions is 41% in the Taiwanese aborigine Amis people. IK002 shows extra genetic affinity with the indigenous Taiwanese aborigines as well as with the Ulch people, which may also support the hypothesis of gene flow of Jomon-ancestry through migration. The Jomon female IK002 clusters closely with the Hokkaido Ainu, which is supporting previous findings that they are direct descendants of the Jomon people. The PCA plot showed the Jomon female sample IK002 is only slightly different from present- day people in East Eurasia and Japan with exception of Hokkaido Ainu. An ancestral component unique to IK002 is the most prevalent in the Hokkaido Ainu (average 79.3%). This component is also found at a minor percentage in mainland Japanese as well as East Siberian groups such as Ulchi (9.8% and 6.0%, respectively) who are natives in the Ulchsky District of Khabarovsk Krai. IK002 can be modelled as a basal lineage relative closer to East Asians, Northeast Asia/East Siberians, and Native Americans. The authors concluded that the ancestral Jōmon population may have arrived to East Asia and Japan through the southern Himalayas and Southeast Asia but say that more ancient genome data is needed to recreate their origin and migration. === Funadomari Jōmon study (2019) === A full genome analysis (Kanzawa-Kiriyama et al. 2019),Late Jomon male and female genome sequences from the Funadomari site in Hokkaido, Japan - Hideaki Kanzawa-Kiriyama, Department of Anthropology, National Museum of Nature and Science 2018/2019en using high-confidence SNPs and functional SNP assessments to assign possible phenotypic characteristics as well as Y-chromosome polymorphisms, analysed a male and a female Jomon sample. The Funadomari archaeological site is located on a sandbar separating Lake Kushu from Funadomari Bay on the north coast of Rebun Island, a small island off the northwestern tip of Hokkaidō. The study results suggest that the Jōmon are their own distinct population and not closely related to other populations. The Funadomari Jōmon are not related to Australo-Melanesians (including Andamanese) or Africans. The Jōmon are closer to Eurasian populations and form a cluster near the “Basal East Asians”. Modern Japanese share about 9% to 13% of their genome with the Jōmon. Jōmon specific genome is also found in minor percentage in populations of Northeast Asia and Southeast Asia, suggesting gene-flow from Jōmon related groups. Additionally, the Jōmon share specific gene alleles with populations in the Arctic regions of Eurasia and northern America. Tests using phylogenetic relationship suggests that the Funadomari Jōmon have about 86% East Asian related ancestry and about 14% West Asian/European related ancestry. According to the authors, more data is needed to explain these results and possible consequences. === Rebun Jōmon study (2019) === Another full genome analysis of a 3,800 year old Jōmon woman shows that this sample shared gene variants which are found only in Arctic populations of Eurasia, but are absent elsewhere. According to the authors this provides evidence that the Jomon fished and hunted fatty sea and land animals. The sample also showed a higher alcohol tolerance than other Eastern Eurasian populations. Further analysis suggest that the Jōmon sample was at high risk of developing liver spots if she spent to much time in the sun. The Jōmon sample had wet earwax, which is rare among modern East Asian populations. Despite the strong differences, the Rebun Jōmon sample is relative closest to modern Japanese. Additionally the Rebun Jōmon sample is also relative closer to coastal groups such as Ulchi in Russia and some aboriginal Taiwanese than to Han-Chinese. A facial reconstruction in 2018 based on genome information of a 3,800 year old Jomon women from Rebun Island in Hokkaido showed that the color of the woman's skin was slightly darker than that of modern Japanese, her hair was thin and fine, and that the color of her eyes was light brown. Additionally, analysis revealed that the woman had blood type A+. === Full genome analysis (Boer et al. 2020) === A full genome analysis published in the Cambridge University Press in 2020, analysed for the first time the complete genome of several Jōmon samples. The results were \\"rather surprising\\" and complicate the peopling of Asia. The Jōmon people were found to be genetically distinct and not related to \\"Basal-Asians\\" (such as the Tianyuan and Hoabhinians). This disproves the hypothese of a possible Southeast Asian origin for the Jōmon which was proposed by a small amount of scholars. The Jōmon share relatively most genome with Paleolithic Siberians, as well as with modern people in Japan and various groups around the Sea of Okhotsk. == In popular culture == Aspects of the Jōmon culture were used in the video game “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild”. Nintendo's art director Takizawa Satoru said that the Jōmon culture was the inspiration for the “Sheikah slates, shrines and other ancient objects” in the game. A recreated Jōmon village in the form of an experience park (Sarashina no Sato), which offers different activities, can be visited in Chikuma, Nagano. == See also == * History of Japan * Yayoi people * Okhotsk culture *Satsumon culture *Emishi ==References== Category:Ancient Japan Category:Archaeology of Japan Category:Jōmon period Category:Tribes of ancient Japan ","title":"Jōmon people"},{"id":"3248546","text":"Saint George is an administrative parish of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, situated in the most southerly portion of the island of Saint Vincent.

The \\"magic words\\" he uses are \\"R-A-G-G M-O-P-P\\". Allan Sherman parodied this song in 1963 for his album My Son, the Nut. He renamed it \\"Rat Fink\\". Sherman's parody was covered in 1979 by American punk rock band The Misfits, which in turn has since been covered by other punk rock bands. According to numerous biographies, \\"Rag Mop\\" was also one of the first songs Elvis Presley tried out at his first Sun Records recording session in 1954, although no actual recording of him performing the song has to date surfaced. \\"Rag Mop\\" was performed by a group of dancing mops on The Muppet Show. \\"Rag Mop\\" by the Ames Brothers was the last single release to hit #1 on the popular charts (Billboard) that was released only on 78 rpm speed at the time of its popularity. After this point in popular music history, every song to hit #1 was released on a 45 rpm record. In the 1970s a version of \\"Rag Mop,\\" with lyrics appropriately altered, was used as a commercial jingle for the Canadian soda pop distributor Pop Shoppe. In 1975 the German Rentnerband made a German cover called Rollmops. In 2019 popular Australian comedian and television host Shaun Micallef performed this song as a gag on the game show Talkin' 'Bout Your Generation. ==References== Category:1949 songs Category:Number-one singles in the United States Category:Ames Brothers songs Category:Johnnie Lee Wills songs ","title":"Rag Mop"},{"id":"3248568","text":"Nevada Industrial Switch is an active private railroad in Nevada.

Basic Brown 1, is a diazo dye with the idealized formula [(H2N)2C6H3N2]2C6H4. The dye is a mixture of closely related compounds. It was one of the earliest azo dyes, being described in 1863 by German chemist Carl Alexander von Martius. It is used in histology for staining tissues. ==Synthesis== The dye is simple to prepare because the diamine serves both as a source of the diazonium cation and as the coupling partner in the azo coupling reaction. The synthesis is thought to start with double diazotization of 1,3-phenylenediamine: :(H2N)2C6H4 \\\\+ 2 H+ \\\\+ 2 HNO2 → [C6H4(N2)2]2+ \\\\+ 2 H2O It is assumed that this bis(diazonium) ion subsequently attacks two equivalents of 1,3-phenylenediamine: :2 (H2N)2C6H4 \\\\+ [C6H4(N2)2]2+ → 2 H+ \\\\+ [(H2N)2C6H3N2]2C6H4 In some cases, toluenediamines are used in addition to the phenylenediamine. Furthermore the resulting dye is thought to consist of oligomers with three or more diazo groups. ==Uses== Bismarck brown Y stains acid mucins to yellow color. It also stains mast cell granules brown. It can be used with live cells. It is also used to stain cartilage in bone specimens, as one of Kasten's Schiff-type reagents in the periodic acid-Schiff stain to stain cellulose, and in Feulgen stain to stain DNA. It was more common in the past; today it is partially replaced by other stains. It has also been used to give soap an amber color in the past. Bismarck brown Y is a constituent of Papanicolaou stain. It can also be used as a counterstain for Victoria blue R for staining of acid-fast microorganisms. ==References== Category:Azo dyes Category:Vital stains ","title":"Bismarck brown Y"},{"id":"3248572","text":"Events in the year 1819 in Art. ==Events== * November - The Museo del Prado opens to the public as the Royal Museum of Paintings and Sculptures in Madrid. * Francisco Goya begins the series of \\"Black Paintings\\", working directly onto the walls of his dining and sitting rooms at his home, Quinta del Sordo, near Madrid. * The Liverpool Royal Institution in England acquires 37 paintings from the collection of William Roscoe, who has to sell his collection following the failure of his banking business, nucleus of what becomes the Walker Art Gallery collection. ==Works== Théodore Géricault, The Raft of the Medusa, 1818–1819, Musée du Louvre, Paris * Washington Allston – Florimell's Flight * John Constable – The Gathering Storm * Marie Ellenrieder – Self- portrait as a painter * Caspar David Friedrich – On a Sailing Ship * Théodore Géricault – The Raft of the Medusa (Le Radeau de la Méduse) * Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson – Pygmalion and Galatea * Francisco Goya ** The Madhouse ** A Procession of Flagellants * Jean-Baptiste Paulin Guérin – Christ on the Knees of the Virgin * Louis Hersent – Abdication of Gustavus Vasa (destroyed in 1848) * Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres – Gianciotto Discovers Paolo and Francesca * John Martin – The Fall of Babylon * Joseph Paelinck – William I of the Netherlands * Henry Raeburn – Francis MacNab, The MacNab * Bertel Thorvaldsen – Christ and the Twelve Apostles * John Trumbull – Declaration of Independence * J.

The conflict posed a threat to the newly established British authority on the British Columbia mainland (which had only just been declared a colony the previous summer), at the onset of the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush. It was called Ned McGowan's War after one of the conflict's main antagonists. Ned McGowan was one of a group of associated miners at Hill's Bar, the richest and first gold-bearing bar of the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush, at which a ramshackle \\"town\\" had sprung up, 5 miles below Yale. Hill's Bar was under the control of McGowan's party of former San Franciscan firemen associated with the Law and Order Party, who had flourished from the claim they had named \\"The Boatmen of San Francisco\\". Yale, on the other hand, had fallen into the sway of members of the notorious San Francisco Vigilance Committee, which had ruled San Francisco through summary execution of suspected criminals.Donald J. Hauka, McGowan's War, Vancouver: 2003, New Star Books, p. 56 They were also the arch- enemies of the Law and Order Party – and of Ned McGowan especially. The tragedy of judicial errors took on great importance to colonial authorities as soon as it was known that Ned McGowan was a part of the conflict between the leaders of the two mining communities. McGowan's reputation in the San Francisco papers had preceded him to British Columbia – so much so that when he first arrived in Victoria he was summoned by Governor James Douglas, who instructed him to conduct himself accordingly in the Queen's domains. It seems that Mr. McGowan, a US miner, had fled California in somewhat of a hurry. After a respectable career as Philadelphia lawyer and erstwhile state politician in Pennsylvania, which ended in a scandal from which he was later absolved, McGowan moved to California and became a judge of the Barbary Court, an Associate of the Court of Sessions, and other juridical positions. But California being the way it was in those days his associates there were gamblers, thugs and worse. McGowan and his friends became involved with the Law and Order Party and he ran afoul of the powerful and even more dangerous Vigilance Committee. ==Precursors to conflict on the Lower Fraser River== In San Francisco, McGowan had a violent personal quarrel with a member of the Vigilance Committee which precipitated a meeting in the fire hall, the Law and Order group's headquarters, at which they chose to make their sudden departure to the newly found Fraser River gold fields in what was then called New Caledonia. They were among the first San Franciscan parties to reach the river, and their claim at Hill's Bar proved to be one of the richest. However, the great mass movement of men from California to the Fraser brought many members of the Vigilance Committee, including the individual McGowan had had the violent personal conflict with in San Francisco (a Danish doctor and dentist, Dr. Fifer). Just as the Law and Order Party had brought Magistrate Perrier under their sway, Perrier being Governor Douglas' appointee to the bench in Hill's Bar, in Yale the Vigilance Committee did what they could to subvert civil authority and dominate the corrupt local officials who administered the township. ==Racism behind yuletide fracas== The incident that provoked the war took place when one of the men from Hill's Bar assaulted Isaac \\"Ikey\\" Dixon, Yale's American black barber, at the Christmas Dance in 1858. Some of the American miners took exception to the fact that the Christmas Dance was open to persons of all races.Hauka, p. 138 Dixon was a voluble wag and wit, and in time would become a familiar newspaper columnist in the British Columbia newspapers.Hauka, p. 219 Dixon, from Yale, laid a complaint before Yale's Justice of the Peace, Peter Brunton Whannell; and was promptly placed in \\"protective custody\\" at Yale.Hauka, p. 137 In the meantime, the matter was also being investigated by George Perrier, Justice of the Peace for Hill's Bar. Perrier, with the assistance of Ned McGowan, a friend of the two suspects,Hauka, p. 138 was of the opinion that in the interests of a fair hearing he needed to hear evidence from the victim Dixon, before proceeding to deal with the persons who had committed the assault. Perrier accordingly sent his constable, Henry Hickson, with an order to pick up Dixon and bring him back to Hill's Bar.Hauka, p. 138 ==Duelling Magistrates== Meanwhile, Magistrate Whannell, induced by the men of the Vigilance Committee, issued a warrant for the arrest of the Hill's Bar man and ordered that it be served in Hill's Bar. Magistrate Perrier took exception to this and issued a warrant for the arrest of Isaac Dixon in Yale. Constable Hickson, in serving the warrant on Dixon, interrupted Whannell's court. Whannell promptly arrested and jailed Hickson for contempt of court when he refused to acknowledge Whannell as his superior.Hauka, p. 139 The jail at Yale was already full as a result of Whannell's 'law and order' agenda, a condition which prompted British Columbia's first judge, Matthew Begbie to later comment, \\"the gaol at Yale, which, being circumscribed in its limits, must when thus containing prosecutor, witnesses, and constable—everybody but the accused persons—have been rather inconveniently crowded.\\"cited in Hauka, p. 139 The angry Hill's Bar miners, headed by McGowan, set out with a warrant issued by the Hill's Bar magistrate Perrier to arrest the Yale magistrate Whannell for contempt of court for imprisoning his constable Hickson. The American flag flew on the flotilla sent up from Hill's Bar, causing Whannell to remark that it seemed as if McGowan was going to make a national affair of the matter.Hauka, p. 143 McGowan, given the status of special constable by Perrier, threw open the jail and set all the prisoners freeHauka, p. 143 and brought magistrate Whannell back to Hill's Bar by boat. The unpopular Whannell was convicted of contempt of court by Perrier, and released after the $50 fine was paid.Hauka, p. 144 ==Whannell appeals to the Governor== Whannell hastily penned a note to Governor James Douglas, playing on Douglas' fears of the intentions of the Americans: \\"The town and district are in a state bordering on anarchy. My own and the lives of the citizens are in imminent peril ... An effective blow must at once be struck on the operations of these outlaws, else I tremble for the welfare of the colony.\\"Whannell to Douglas, December 31, 1858, quoted in Hauka p. 145 The story, as relayed to Victoria by Vigilance Committee messengers, was that Ned McGowan had launched an attempt to overthrow the British authority in the new colony and declare the gold fields to be part of the United States. Given McGowan's unsavoury reputation, the combative nature of the incident which had the two communities up in arms caused significant alarm in the colonial capital of Victoria. ==Moody's Royal Engineers to the rescue== Richard Clement Moody had arrived in British Columbia in December 1858, in command of the Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment, to found the British Empire's \\"bulwark in the farthest west\\" Donald J. Hauka, McGowan's War, Vancouver: 2003, New Star Books, p.146 and \\"found a second England on the shores of the Pacific\\".Jean Barman p.71 Moody had hoped to begin immediately the foundation of a capital city, but upon his arrival at Fort Langley he learned of the violence at the settlement of Hill's Bar. Moody describes the incident thus: > The notorious Ned McGowan, of Californian celebrity at the head of a band of > Yankee Rowdies defying the law! Every peaceable citizen frightened out of > his wits!—Summons & warrants laughed to scorn! A Magistrate seized while on > the Bench, & brought to the Rebel’s camp, tried, condemned, & heavily fined! > A man shot dead shortly before! Such a tale to welcome me at the close of a > day of great enjoyment. Moody and the Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment, accompanied by Justice Matthew Baillie Begbie, made the arduous trip to Yale, where Moody and the Engineers prevented violence and Begbie convened court. Another group of Marines remained stationed at Fort Langley to resist any action by the nearby troops of the US Border Commission stationed in nearby Whatcom County. On hearing the tangled web of cases and charges resulting from the misconduct of both justices Perrier and Whannell, McGowan was fined for assault and both magistrates were dismissed from their posts, thus ending the bloodless war, which afterward became well known as Ned McGowan's War. Moody enjoyed a warm reception for his success that he describes thus: > They gave me a Salute, firing off their loaded Revolvers over my > head—Pleasant—Balls whistling over one’s head! as a compliment! Suppose a > hand had dropped by accident! I stood up, & raised my cap & thanked them in > the Queen’s name for their loyal reception of me. == See also == *Fraser Canyon War *Fraser Canyon Gold Rush ==References== ==Bibliography== *McGowan's War, Donald J.

Located at the intersection of 242nd Street and Broadway (US Route 9) in the Bronx, it is served by the 1 train at all times. It is adjacent to Van Cortlandt Park to the east, Manhattan College, and the 240th Street Yard of the subway system, along with the affluent neighborhoods of Fieldston and Riverdale to the west. It was built from a design by subway architects Heins and Lafarge. Today it is the only remaining Victorian Gothic elevated terminal station on the subway, and contains the subway's only remaining scrolled station sign among its decorative flourishes. In 2005, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. ==Station layout== There are three components to the station: the platforms, a control house perpendicular to the tracks at the north end, and a crew quarters building spanning the platform at the south end. From the northeast corner an overpass crosses the through-traffic lanes of Broadway. Two stairs descend in either direction from its end, matching the two stairs that descend to the sidewalk from the west of the control house. Just south of the station, the line widens to three tracks, which is the configuration up to just before Dyckman Street. ===Location=== The station is located above the west side of the street, where parking is located on either side of where West 242nd Street intersects from the west. On that side of the street are commercial buildings, including a large parking garage on the southwest corner; the east side has the track, football field, tennis courts, swimming pools and other athletic facilities of Van Cortlandt Park. Also in the park nearby, to the northeast, is the Van Cortlandt House Museum, a National Historic Landmark. The 240th Street Yard is beyond the parking garage to the southwest, next to the campus of Manhattan College, a few blocks west of the station. ===Platforms=== Track 1, with the island platform on the left and a side platform on the right There is one island platform and two side platforms. The station was formerly set up as a Spanish solution with alighting passengers using the side platforms and boarding passengers using the island platform. Now, only the center island platform is open to the public for boarding and disembarking from trains. They are floored in concrete and sheltered with a wooden roof covered in standing-seam metal supported by trussed steel T-frames on the side platforms and timber in the center. Rounded rafter tails project from the eaves. The sides, except for the open southernmost section, have had metal windscreen added. Under the canopies are modern fluorescent lights. On the eastern platform, the original iron railings support original lights, with dish-shaped downlights on a curved stem. At the south end is the only scrolled station sign remaining anywhere in the subway system. The western platform has its original railing and modern lights. ===Control house=== Control house The control house is the dominant architectural feature of the station. The copper-clad timber frame exterior is painted in a vertical, batten seam pattern. It is topped with a low hipped roof clad in sheet metal and pierced by two ventilating dormer windows on the east and west side. A fleur-de-lis–patterned group of finials at the peak. On the north facade, narrow casement windows are echoed by recessed panels below. The groups of five in the section on either side of the projecting central bay window are flanked by blind openings. The bay is supported by corbeled brackets and topped with a fan gable above the overhanging eaves at the roofline. Its tripartite narrow windows are surrounded by recessed panels with inset circles on the sides and above. At both sides are steel frame parapets with wooden decks. These connect the western stairs and overpass to the control house. The stairs combine structural steel and decorative cast iron. Their supports are braced steel Tuscan columns. Gabled standing-seam metal canopies with box fluorescent lighting over the stairs are on narrow supports with slightly fluted capitals. At street level are gabled entries whose support columns are decorated with a geometric pattern similar to that on the control house's projecting bay window. C-shaped brackets support the original signage, now painted over. alt=An elevated railroad track above a city street in winter, with two buildings. The smaller one, on the left, is pale yellow and narrow. The larger one at right, gray with a red stripe, is box-shaped and elevated over the tracks The steel-framed overpass is an architecturally sympathetic addition. Railings are a more restrained version of the original railings found on the platform. It is floored in wood plank and roofed with slats covered by standing seam metal. At its west end is a covered veranda leading into the control house. On the inside, the control house is floored in wood plank as well. The walls are finished in a mix of solid and tongue and groove wood paneling. Tall riveted steel arches support the ceiling. The main waiting area has niches where modern heaters have replaced the original pot- bellied stoves. There is a modern steel and glass token booth and turnstile bank, along with MetroCard vending machines. Former restrooms have been converted into utility and storage rooms. ===Crew quarters=== The crew quarters building is located at the south end of the platforms. It is a one- story building sided in corrugated metal with a flat roof, elevated over the tracks and platforms at that end. The siding has been given the appearance of clapboard and painted gray. A belt course corresponding to the top of the windows has been painted red, the color of the Broadway–Seventh Avenue trunk line, on both side elevations; it is augmented with a series of blocks in the same color descending towards the tracks on the north end. At the south end, a series of projecting nested bays descends to an entrance to track level. To its south is an old signal house also sided in metal. The crew quarters can also be entered from the center platform. Its interior is given over to employee-related functions and is not open to the public. ===Exits=== Street stair West side of the station, with white windscreens; the station exit is visible in the background At the north end of the station, past fare control, there are four stairs that lead down to Broadway. Two go to the west side of Broadway, and two go to the east side. These are the station's only exits. ==History== The station was built as part of the Contract 1 system erected from 1904–1908, connecting Lower Manhattan to the Bronx. Originally the northern terminus was intended to be Bailey Avenue and 230th Street, a block southeast of the current station at 231st Street. After the completion of the Harlem River Ship Canal at the end of the 19th century, the line was rerouted to a new terminus at 242nd Street. Like many of the other terminal stations in the outer boroughs, it was located near a park. Heins and LaFarge, who had already designed the Cathedral of St. John the Divine near Columbia University and the Astor Court at the Bronx Zoo, were commissioned to design the stations. In the early 1890s the city's transit commissioners had recommended that subway stations be painted and decorated in order to make the experience of using the system pleasant. They took further inspiration from the contemporary City Beautiful movement, which called for beautiful public architecture in the hope that it would inspire citizens to act virtuously. Their use of the Victorian Gothic architectural style reflected its popularity at that time for train stations. The six elevated stations they built in that style on the Contract 1 are extensively decorated on their exterior surfaces, complementing the corresponding tilework and mosaics in the underground stations. 242nd Street, which opened on August 1, 1908, is the only elevated terminal station left in that style from Contract 1. Within a few years of the station's opening, ridership on the line north of 157th Street increased sharply. In 1913 3.1 million tickets were sold at the Van Cortlandt Park station. Undeveloped lots along Broadway to the city's northern limit were quickly bought by builders hoping to profit from the boom in luxury houses, which could reach the subway through streetcar lines as well. At that time, it was expected that the line would be extended to 262nd Street. The Horace Mann School was built to serve this population. In 1947, Jack Kerouac passed through the station, then a busy trolley hub, at the end of the first leg of his escape from the city in what became On the Road. His goal was to reach U.S. Route 6 at the Bear Mountain Bridge and use it as a route along which to go West to Denver. The attempt failed when he found very little traffic on Route 6 to hitch rides from, and he returned to the city to take a bus instead. In 2019, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced that this station would become ADA-accessible as part of the agency's 2020–2024 Capital Program. ==See also== *List of New York City Subway terminals *National Register of Historic Places listings in Bronx County, New York ==Notes== == References == == External links == * * nycsubway.org — Unknown Artwork From 2007 at Van Cortlandt Park — 242nd Street * Station Reporter — 1 Train * The Subway Nut — 242nd Street–Van Cortlandt Park Pictures * 242nd Street entrance from Google Maps Street View * Platforms from Google Maps Street View Category:IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line stations Category:Broadway (Manhattan) Category:Railway and subway stations on the National Register of Historic Places in New York City Category:National Register of Historic Places in the Bronx Category:New York City Subway stations in the Bronx Category:New York City Subway stations Category:New York City Subway stations located aboveground Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1908 Category:U.S. Route 9 Category:Riverdale, Bronx Category:New York City Subway stations at university and college campuses Category:1908 establishments in New York (state) Category:Heins and LaFarge buildings Category:New York City Subway terminals ","title":"Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street station"},{"id":"3248590","text":"The southern naked-tailed armadillo (Cabassous unicinctus) is a species of small armadillo from South America. ==Description== Smaller than some other armadillos, males measure an average of in head-body length, and weigh around , while females are larger, measuring and weighing . The tail measures around in both sexes, and has only tiny scales in its skin, unlike the larger scutes found in most other armadillo species. The upper body is covered by a dark grey bony carapace of squarish scutes. In the mid part of the body, this carapace is divided into a series of ten to thirteen mobile rings, giving the animal some degree of flexibility. Although there are some bristly hairs around the margins of the scutes, the tail and underside of the animal are hairless. The armour covers the back of the neck and extends onto the head between the ears. Smaller and thinner scales are also found on the cheeks and the outer surface of the ears. The snout is relatively short, and the ears large and funnel-like. There are five clawed toes on each foot, with the middle claws on the forefeet being particularly large. ==Distribution and habitat== Southern naked-tailed armadillos are found throughout northern South America east of the Andes, as far south as northern Paraguay and southern Brazil. They inhabit a range of habitats across this region, from tropical rain forest to swamp, cerrado, and open grasslands. Two subspecies are recognised: *Cabassous unicinctus squamicaudis Lund, 1845 \\\\- south of the Amazon River *Cabassous unicinctus unicinctus Linnaeus, 1758 \\\\- north of the Amazon ==Biology and behaviour== Southern naked-tailed armadillos are solitary, and are said to be nocturnal in the tropics but have been reported to be diurnal further south. As are many armadillos, it is an insectivore, feeding almost entirely on ants and termites. Reproduction occurs year-round, and animals have lived up to seven years in captivity. The armadillos spend much of their time burrowing, digging burrows about in diameter. The outer parts of the burrow are rounded, since the animal initially rotates its body as it digs, but they become flatter about in from the entrance. They are typically located in termite mounds. ==References== Category:Armadillos Armadillo, Southern Naked-tailed Armadillo, Southern Naked-tailed Armadillo, Southern Naked-tailed Armadillo, Southern Naked-tailed Armadillo, Southern Naked-tailed Armadillo, Southern Naked-tailed Armadillo, Southern Naked-tailed Armadillo, Southern Naked-tailed Armadillo, Southern Naked-tailed Armadillo, Southern Naked-tailed Armadillo, Southern Naked-tailed Armadillo, Southern Naked-tailed Category:Mammals described in 1758 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Southern naked-tailed armadillo"},{"id":"3248605","text":"The Governors' Cup or Governor's Cup can refer to: ==Professional sports== * Governors' Cup, the baseball trophy awarded to the champion club of the International League * Governor's Cup (Florida), awarded to the victor of the season series between the Tampa Bay Lightning and Florida Panthers hockey teams * Governor's Cup Stakes, a Standardbred horse race alternating between racetracks in the United States and Canada * Governor's Cup (Missouri), awarded to the victor of the Kansas City Chiefs and St. Louis Rams of the National Football League * Governor's Cup (Texas), awarded to the victor of the Houston Texans and Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League * Governor's Cup, the original name of the Nigerian FA Cup, the national football (soccer) cup in Nigeria * Governor's Cup, an International Junior Match Racing Regatta in Newport Beach, California hosted by the Balboa Yacht Club * Governor's Cup, an off-shore yacht race (and the first prize) between Cape Town and Saint Helena island * PBA Governors' Cup, a basketball tournament held in the Philippines islands ==College sports== * Governor's Cup, the name of the Mississippi State–Ole Miss baseball rivalry since 2007 * Governor's Cup (Alaska), an ice hockey series hosted annually by Alaska and Alaska Anchorage * Governor's Cup (Kansas), awarded to the victor of the football game between the Kansas State Wildcats and University of Kansas clubs * Governor's Cup (Kentucky), awarded to the victor of the football game between the Kentucky Wildcats and University of Louisville clubs * Governor's Cup (Massachusetts), awarded to the victor of the Commonwealth Classic basketball game between the Boston College and University of Massachusetts Amherst teams * Governor's Cup (New York), an ice hockey tournament hosted annually by Union College and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute * Governor's Cup (Rhode Island), awarded to the victor of the football game between the Brown University and University of Rhode Island teams * Governor's Cup, awarded to the victor of the football game nicknamed Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate between Georgia Institute of Technology and the University of Georgia * Governor's Cup, awarded to the victor of the men's soccer game between University of Wisconsin–Madison and University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee * Indiana National Guard Governor's Cup, for several varsity sports between Indiana University and Purdue University ==Other== * Governor's Cup (academics), an academic tournament in the state of Kentucky * Governor's Cup, awarded to the team cooking the best cuisine at the International Bar-B-Q Festival in Owensboro, Kentucky ","title":"Governor's Cup"},{"id":"3248621","text":"Antonis Migiakis (; born 23 October 1911 – 19 November 1999) was a star forward for Greek football team Panathinaikos in the 1930s.

It is a solitary nocturnal, terrestrial animal, living mostly in dry habitats, outside of rainforest regions. ==Description== Long-nosed armadillos have a broad, depressed body, an obtusely pointed rostrum, long, pointed ears and short legs. The carapace consists of two immobile plates, separated by six or seven movable bands, which are connected to each other by a fold of hairless skin. The carapace is mostly blackish, hairless and with the scales of the anterior edge of the movable bands not notably different in colour from the rest of the dorsum. Lateral scutes have dark blackish-pink centres only slightly discernible from the rest of the carapace, but never as obviously pale as in the nine-banded armadillo. Scutes on the movable bands are triangular in shape, but those on the main plates are rounded. The number of scutes present on the fourth movable band varies from 44 to 52, with a mean of 48.4. ==Reproduction== Females give birth to seven to nine genetically identical offspring.Esquivel.

The major town on the lake is Aquitania, located on its eastern side. Other nearby villages include Tota, Iza and Cuítiva. Lake Tota was an important religious center for the Muisca culture. The name Tota comes from the Chibcha language of the Muisca and according to linguist Mariana Escribano its main name refers to \\"Astronomic Observatory\\", relating to its sacred uses for that culture. There are legends which relate to the way the lake was formed by the hands of ancient ancestors. The area around Lake Tota is one of the major onion producing regions of Colombia. The western shore of the lake is a popular tourist destination for Colombians. The average water temperature of 13 °C allowed for the introduction of rainbow trout (Onchorynchus mykiss) which created a valuable wild fishery (a mounted specimen in Restaurante Lucho, Aquitania, reportedly early in the 1990s, weighed 7 kg) and cage culture aquaculture, but predation on native fish species as led to the now accepted extinction of the pez graso or grease fish (Rhizosomichthys totae) believed native to only this lake. Lake Tota is a breeding ground for several threatened or endangered bird species, including the least bittern (Ixobrychus exilis bogotensis), the Colombian ruddy duck (Oxyura jamaicensis andina), the Bogotá rail (Rallus semiplumbeus) and Apolinar's wren (Cistothorus apolinari).

He has served as chancellor of the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, provost of Rice University, and Science Advisor to the President (Assistant to the President for Science and Technology and Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) during the Bill Clinton Administration). Lane lectures and writes on matters of science and technology policy. == Biography == === Early life === Lane was born in Oklahoma City in 1938, graduated from Southeast High School, and earned his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. in physics from the University of Oklahoma. His thesis advisor was Professor Chun C. Lin, who later joined the Department of Physics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. === Research, teaching and administration === Initially pursuing a career in teaching and research, Lane carried out post-doctoral studies in the Department of Applied Mathematics at Queen's University Belfast in Belfast, Northern Ireland, studying with Professor Alexander Dalgarno, and as a visiting fellow at the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics (currently JILA), working with Dr. Sydney Geltman. He joined Rice University as an assistant professor in 1966 and was promoted to full professor of physics, space physics, and astronomy in 1972. His research contributions were all in the area of theoretical, atomic, and molecular physics, with an emphasis on electronic and atomic collision phenomena. On leave from Rice for the academic year 1979-1980, Lane served as Director of the Division of Physics at the National Science Foundation (NSF). In 1984 he became chancellor of the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, which was developing new graduate programs in science and engineering in response to the growing technology industry in the Pikes Peak region. Returning to Rice as provost in 1986, Lane served in this role until 1993, when he joined the Bill Clinton Administration as Director of the NSF and ex officio member of the National Science Board. === National Science Foundation === As Director of the NSF from 1993-1998, Lane focused on preserving the agency's emphasis on supporting fundamental research in all fields of science, mathematics and engineering. During Lane's tenure, the NSF was required to develop a formal long-range strategic plan in accordance with the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993. The NSF plan avoided prescriptive quantitative metrics and retained a discipline- based organization focused on funding excellent basic research, with expert peer review evaluation as the main criterion for success. On the programmatic side, the agency realigned and re-competed the NSF Supercomputer Centers, in response to rapid changes in scientific computing, and the NSF Science and Technology Centers. NSF also established the CAREER program for young investigators and began implementation of the first federal agency electronic system for proposal submission and review. During Lane's tenure, the NSF created the major research equipment budget line, which supported several construction projects, including the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO), the first GEMINI telescope, and the new Amundsen-Scott South Pole Research Station, part of the U.S. Antarctic Program. In response to employee needs, NSF established the first child-development center for its personnel. In April 1998, at one of Lane's last Congressional hearings as NSF Director, when asked to speculate on the future, he said: \\"If I were asked for an area of science and engineering that will most likely produce the breakthroughs of tomorrow I would point to nanoscale science and engineering, often called simply 'nanotechnology'.\\"\\"Research Areas.\\" OLPA. National Science Foundation, 1998. Web. 17 Mar. 2016. <https://www.nsf.gov/about/congress/105/nlane498.jsp>. === White House Office of Science and Technology Policy === In August 1998, Lane was appointed President Bill Clinton's science advisor, a dual position as Assistant to the President for Science and Technology and Director of the White House OSTP, the latter requiring Senate confirmation.

The revolution was initially aimed at overthrowing King Farouk. According to Miles Copeland Jr. and Kermit Roosevelt Jr. It was part of Operation Fat Fucker, aimed at changing to political leadership in Egypt to a more progressive pro- american leadership. However, the movement had more political ambitions, and soon moved to abolish the constitutional monarchy and aristocracy of Egypt and Sudan, establish a republic, end the British occupation of the country, and secure the independence of Sudan (previously governed as an Anglo-Egyptian condominium). The revolutionary government adopted a staunchly nationalist, anti-imperialist agenda, which came to be expressed chiefly through Arab nationalism, and international non-alignment. The revolution was faced with immediate threats from Western imperial powers, particularly the United Kingdom, which had occupied Egypt since 1882, and France, both of whom were wary of rising nationalist sentiment in territories under their control throughout Africa and the Arab world. The ongoing state of war with Israel also posed a serious challenge, as the Free Officers increased Egypt's already strong support of the Palestinians. These two issues conflated four years after the revolution when Egypt was invaded by Britain, France, and Israel in the Suez Crisis of 1956. Despite enormous military losses, the war was seen as a political victory for Egypt, especially as it left the Suez Canal in uncontested Egyptian control for the first time since 1875, erasing what was seen as a mark of national humiliation. This strengthened the appeal of the revolution in other Arab and African countries. Wholesale agrarian reform, and huge industrialisation programmes were initiated in the first decade and half of the revolution, leading to an unprecedented period of infrastructure building, and urbanisation. By the 1960s, Arab socialism had become a dominant theme, transforming Egypt into a centrally planned economy. Official fear of a Western-sponsored counter-revolution, domestic religious extremism, potential communist infiltration, and the conflict with Israel were all cited as reasons compelling severe and longstanding restrictions on political opposition, and the prohibition of a multi-party system. These restrictions on political activity would remain in place until the presidency of Anwar Sadat from 1970 onwards, during which many of the policies of the revolution were scaled back or reversed. The early successes of the revolution encouraged numerous other nationalist movements in other Arab, and African countries, such as Algeria where there were anti-colonial rebellions against European empires. It also inspired the toppling of existing pro-Western monarchies and governments in the region and the continent. The revolution is commemorated each year on 23 July. ==Causes== In 1882, British forces intervened in Egypt during the Anglo- Egyptian War. In 1888 at the Convention of Constantinople, Britain won the right to protect the Suez Canal with military force, giving Britain a base to dominate Egyptian politics. Though nominally still an Ottoman vassal, Egypt became a British protectorate. After World War I, Britain placed a reliable member of Muhammad Ali's dynasty on the throne and declared Egypt a protectorate. During World War II, Egypt was a major Allied base for the North African campaign. After the war, British policy continued to focus on control of the Suez Canal, which was vital for imperial trade. However, during World War II, Egyptian nationalists within the armed forces gained influence. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War humiliated these nationalists, who blamed the British- backed king, King Farouk. The loss of the 1948 war with Israel led to the Free Officers' accusations of corruption towards the King and his court and the promotion of that feeling among the Egyptian people. The Free Officers Movement (or sometimes referred to as the Young Officers Movement) was formed by a group of reform-minded officers which, backed by the Soviet Union and the United States coalesced around a young officer named Gamal Abdel Nasser. They used an army general, Muhammad Naguib, as its head to show their seriousness and attract more army followers. In the warning that General Naguib conveyed to King Farouk on 26 July upon the king's abdication, he provided a summary of the reasons for the Coup: > In view of what the country has suffered in the recent past, the complete > vacuity prevailing in all corners as a result of your bad behavior, your > toying with the constitution, and your disdain for the wants of the people, > no one rests assured of life, livelihood, and honor. Egypt's reputation > among the peoples of the world has been debased as a result of your excesses > in these areas to the extent that traitors and bribe-takers find protection > beneath your shadow in addition to security, excessive wealth, and many > extravagances at the expense of the hungry and impoverished people. You > manifested this during and after the Palestine War in the corrupt arms > scandals and your open interference in the courts to try to falsify the > facts of the case, thus shaking faith in justice. Therefore, the army, > representing the power of the people, has empowered me to demand that Your > Majesty abdicate the throne to His Highness Crown Prince Ahmed Fuad, > provided that this is accomplished at the fixed time of 12 o'clock noon > today (Saturday, 26 July 1952, the 4th of Zul Qa'ada, 1371), and that you > depart the country before 6 o'clock in the evening of the same day. The army > places upon Your Majesty the burden of everything that may result from your > failure to abdicate according to the wishes of the people.The Long Struggle: > The Seeds of the Muslim World's Frustration by Amil Khan (2010), p. 58 The Egyptian monarchy was seen as both corrupt and pro-British, with its lavish lifestyle that seemed provocative to the free officers movement who lived in poverty. Its policies completed the image of the Egyptian government being a puppet-figure in the hands of the British government. Promoting the feeling of corruption of several Egyptian institutions such as the police, the palace and even the political parties by the free officers. Despite allegations of anti-British sentiment, a CIA document dated 23 July 1952 stated that the dissatisfaction within the army over corruption in high command began in 1948 after the discovery of an arms scandal during the Palestine conflict.https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA- RDP91T01172R000200280003-8.pdf It's important to note that the document does not specifically list a reasoning of an arms scandal, yet that becomes a most logical theory. The loss of the 1948 war with Israel led to the free officers' blame of the King and their promotion of that feeling among the Egyptian people. Tensions between the military and the monarchy resulted in the removal and arrest of Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces Haidar Pasha, Chief of Staff Harid Pasha and other high-ranking officers. However, scandal subsided over time and the King was able to eventually reappoint Haidar and Harid to their old positions. ==Prelude== During the winter of 1951–1952 nationalist police officers began protecting and promoting fedayeen (the Egyptian resistance) attacks on British authorities in Cairo, Alexandria, and the Suez Canal. After repelling a particularly devastating attack on British shipping and facilities near Ismailia which resulted in the death of several British soldiers, British troops tracked the fedayeen into the city. On 25 January 1952, British troops discovered the fedayeen had retreated into the local police barracks. When the police refused to surrender the fedayeen, the British officer attempted to negotiate the surrender of the police and the fedayeen. When their negotiator was killed in the parley by the fedayeen, the British force attacked the Egyptian police barracks in Ismailia. Fifty Egyptian police officers were killed and one hundred were wounded. Egypt erupted in fury. Subsequently, Free Officer Movement cells initiated riots in Cairo which led to arsons. Without suppression from local fire brigades, these arson attacks further inflamed more rioting. American and Soviet newspapers promoted the incident on global wire outlets as the \\"Cairo Fires\\" and suggested they were seen as further evidence of the beginning of the end of the monarchy. The next day, 26 January 1952 (\\"Black Saturday\\"), what many Egyptians call \\"the second revolution\\" broke out (the first being the Egyptian revolution of 1919). King Farouk dismissed Mustafa el-Nahhas's government and declared martial law on the same day.Hilton Proctor Goss and Charles Marion Thomas. American Foreign Policy in Growth and Action, 3rd ed. Documentary Research Division, Research Studies Institute, Air University, 1959. p. 273. In the months that followed, three politicians were instructed to form governments, each proving short-lived: Ali Maher (27 January – 1 March), Ahmed Naguib El-Hilali (2 March – 29 June, and 22–23 July) and Hussein Sirri (2–20 July). These \\"salvation ministries\\", as they were called, failed to halt the country's downward spiral. Corruption remained ubiquitous despite attempts by successive prime ministers to put their political houses in order. Stirrings of discontent were felt in the army, and in January 1952 opposition officers supported by the Free Officers gained control of the governing board of the Officers Club. On 16 July, the King annulled these elections, appointing his own supporters instead in an attempt to regain control of the army. A coup d'état had originally been planned for 5 August, but the coup leaders advanced their plans to the night of 22 July, after General Naguib—one of the Free Officers and General Pasha's temporary replacement as Commander and Chief of the Armed Forces— informed that group on 19 July that the Egyptian Royal Army high command had a list of their names. == Military coup == Members of the Free Officers gathered after the coup d'état. From left to right: Zakaria Mohieddin, Abdel Latif Boghdadi, Kamel el-Din Hussein, Gamal Abdel Nasser (seated), Abdel Hakim Amer, Muhammad Naguib, Youssef Seddik and Ahmed Shawki While the Free Officers planned to overthrow the monarchy on 2–3 August, they decided to make their move earlier after their official leader, Muhammad Naguib, gained knowledge, leaked from the Egyptian cabinet on 19 July, that King Farouk acquired a list of the dissenting officers and was set to arrest them. The officers thus decided to launch a preemptive strike and after finalizing their plans in meeting at the home of Khaled Mohieddin, they began their coup on the night of 22 July. Mohieddin stayed in his home and Anwar Sadat went to the cinema.Alexander, 2005, p. 41. Meanwhile, the chairman of the Free Officers, Gamal Abdel Nasser, contacted the Muslim Brotherhood and the communist Democratic Movement for National Liberation to assure their support. On the morning of 23 July, he and Abdel Hakim Amer left Mohieddin's home in civilian clothes and drove around Cairo in Nasser's automobile to collect men to arrest key royalist commanders before they reached their barracks and gain control over their soldiers. As they approached the el-Qoba Bridge, an artillery unit led by Youssef Seddik met with them before he led his battalion to take control the Military General Headquarters to arrest the royalist army chief of staff, Hussein Sirri Amer and all the other commanders who were present in the building. At 6:00 am the Free Officers air force units began circling Cairo's skies.Alexander, p. 42. ===Declaration of revolution=== At 7:30 a.m., a broadcasting station issued the first communiqué of the coup d'état in the name of Gen. Naguib to the Egyptian people. It attempted to justify the coup, which was also known as the \\"Blessed Movement\\". The person reading the message was Free Officer and future president of Egypt Anwar Sadat.Ibrahim, Sammar. 'Profile: Anwar Al-Sadat' , Egypt State Information Service, Retrieved on 2008-07-20. The coup was conducted by less than a hundred officers - almost all of which were drawn from junior ranks — and prompted scenes of celebration in the streets by cheering mobs.Egypt on the Brink by Tarek Osman, Yale University Press, 2010, p. 40 > Egypt has passed through a critical period in her recent history > characterized by bribery, mischief, and the absence of governmental > stability.

May God grant us success [lit. \\"God > is the guardian of success\\"]. With his British support network now neutralized, King Farouk sought the intervention of the United States, which was unresponsive. By the 25th, the army had occupied Alexandria, where the king was in residence at the Montaza Palace. Terrified, Farouk abandoned Montaza and fled to Ras Al-Teen Palace on the waterfront. Naguib ordered the captain of Farouk's yacht, al-Mahrusa, not to sail without orders from the army. Debate broke out among the Free Officers concerning the fate of the deposed king. While some (including Gen. Naguib and Nasser) thought that the best course of action was to send him into exile, others argued that he should be put on trial or executed. Finally, the order came for Farouk to abdicate in favour of his son, Crown Prince Ahmed Fuad - who was acceded to the throne as King Fuad II \\\\- and a three-man Regency Council was appointed. The former king's departure into exile came on Saturday, 26 July 1952 and at 6 o'clock that evening he set sail for Italy with protection from the Egyptian army. On 28 July 1953, Muhammad Naguib became the first President of Egypt, which marked the beginning of modern Egyptian governance. ==Consolidation== Members of the Free Officers welcomed by crowds in Cairo in January 1953. Standing in the automobile, from left to right: Youssef Seddik, Salah Salem, Gamal Abdel Nasser and Abdel Latif Boghdadi The Revolution Command Council (RCC), made up of the previous nine- member command committee of the Free Officers in addition to five more members, chaired by Naguib, was formed. Ali Maher was asked to form a civilian government. When the Free Officers started isolating elements sympathizing with the Soviet Union, communist cadres led workers riots in Kafr Dawar on 12 August 1952, which resulted in two death sentences. Ali Maher who still sympathised with the British resigned on 7 September following differences with the officers, principally over proposed land reform. Naguib became prime minister, with Nasser as deputy prime minister. On 9 September, the Agrarian Reform Law was passed, which immediately seized any European-owned, especially British owned property in Egypt. This was followed by signaling a major land redistribution programme among peasant farmers which gained most of the seized land. In a bid to stop concentration of land ownership, the regime placed a ceiling of 200 feddans on land ownership. On 9 December, the RCC without due process decreed that the 1923 Constitution of Egypt was abrogated \\"in the name of the people.\\" On 16 January 1953 the officers of the RCC dissolved and banned all political parties, declaring a three-year transitional period during which the RCC would rule. A provisional Constitutional Charter, written by the close circle of usurpers, was written with the intention of giving a veneer of legitimacy to the RCC. This new Constitution was proclaimed on 10 February, and the Liberation Rally — the first of three political organisations linked to the July regime — was launched soon afterwards with the aim of mobilising popular support. The Rally was headed by Nasser and included other Free Officers as secretaries-general. On 18 June, the RCC declared Egypt a republic abolishing the monarchy (the infant son of Farouk had been reigning as King Fuad II) and appointing General Naguib, aged 52, as first president and prime minister. Gamal Abdel Nasser, 35, was appointed deputy premier and minister of the interior. A \\"Revolutionary Tribunal\\" consisting of RCC members Abdel Latif Boghdadi, Sadat and Hassan Ibrahim, was set up to try politicians of the ancien régime. In opposition to the Constitution with its overt secularism was the Muslim Brotherhood. Additionally, contrary to orders issued by the Council, members of the Liberation Rally accumulated much of the seized non-Muslim property and distributed amongst their closed networks. Angered at being left out of the political and economic spoils and seeing a continuation of secularism and modernity within the Free Officers Movement such as had existed under the King, the Muslim Brotherhood organized its street elements. From June 1953 into the following year, Egypt was wracked by street riots, clashes, arson, and civil tumult as the regime and the Muslim Brotherhood battled for popular support. ===1954=== In January, the Muslim Brotherhood was outlawed. It remained an illegal political organization until the revolution of 2011. The move came in the wake of clashes between members of the Brotherhood and Liberation Rally student demonstrators on 12 January 1954. March witnessed clashes within the RCC, symbolized in the attempt, ultimately successful, to oust Naguib. The move faced opposition from within the army, and some members of the RCC, especially Khaled Mohieddin, favored a return to constitutional government. On 26 October, an assassination attempt suspected by the Brotherhood was directed at Nasser during a rally in Alexandria. This led to the regime acting against the Brotherhood, executing Brotherhood leaders on 9 December. Nasser subsequently cemented power, first becoming chairman of the RCC, and finally prime minister, with Naguib's constitutional position remaining vague until 14 November, when he was dismissed from office and placed under house arrest. Meanwhile, the RCC managed to remain united in its opposition to the British and French, specifically in regard to the Suez Canal. Despite continued calls from the RCC, in debates in the United Nations, and pressure from both the U.S. and USSR, the British refused to transfer control of the Canal to the new regime. The RCC began funding and coordinating ever greater attacks on the British and French in the Suez Canal Zone, and Damietta. Finally, on 19 October, Nasser signed a treaty for the evacuation of British troops from Egypt, to be completed over the following 20 months. Two years later, on 18 June 1956, Nasser raised the Egyptian flag over the Canal Zone, announcing the complete evacuation of British troops. ===1956=== President Nasser announced a new Constitution on 16 January at a popular rally, setting up a presidential system of government in which the president has the power to appoint and dismiss ministers. An elections law was passed on 3 March granting women the right to vote for the first time in Egyptian history. Nasser was elected as the second president of the Republic on 23 June. In 1957, Nasser announced the formation of the National Union (Al- Ittihad Al-Qawmi), paving the way to July elections for the National Assembly, the first parliament since 1952. ==Commemoration== The anniversary of the coup d'état is commemorated on Revolution Day, an annual public holiday in Egypt, on 23 July. ==See also== * Nasserism * Egyptian revolution of 1919 * Egyptian revolution of 2011 * June 2013 Egyptian protests * History of modern Egypt * List of modern conflicts in the Middle East * List of Chiefs of the General Staff of Egypt ==References== * Watry, David M.

Hypotrophied salivary acinus filled with amorphous masses of pinkstaining (=Feulgen positive) material (arrows). Scale bar = 10 µm. Feulgen stain is a staining technique discovered by Robert Feulgen and used in histology to identify chromosomal material or DNA in cell specimens. It is darkly stained. It depends on acid hydrolysis of DNA, therefore fixating agents using strong acids should be avoided. The specimen is subjected to warm (60 °C) hydrochloric acid, then to Schiff reagent. In the past, a sulfite rinse followed, but this is now considered unnecessary. Optionally, the sample can be counterstained with Light Green SF yellowish. Finally, it is dehydrated with ethanol, cleared with xylene, and mounted in a resinous medium. DNA should be stained red. The background, if counterstained, is green. The Feulgen reaction is a semi-quantitative technique. If the only aldehydes remaining in the cell are those produced from the hydrolysis of DNA, then the technique is quantitative for DNA. It is possible to use an instrument known as a microdensitometer or microspectrophotometer to actually measure the intensity of the pink Feulgen reaction for a given organelle. Using this procedure, it was early determined that interphase cells were composed of two populations, those with diploid DNA and those with tetraploid DNA (two complete genomes). The nuclei looked identical, but one contained twice as much DNA. This gave rise to the division of the interphase period of the cell cycle to G1, S, and G2 phases based on the synthesis of that extra DNA.The Feulgen Procedure for DNA, Adolphus College ==References== Category:Microscopy Category:Microbiology techniques Category:Laboratory techniques Category:Staining Category:Histotechnology Category:Staining dyes ","title":"Feulgen stain"},{"id":"3248775","text":":For the 19th-century New York politician, see Edward M.

When the writers get wind of this, they kill off Joey's character, Dr. Drake Ramoray, by having him fall to his death down an elevator shaft. Joey is devastated, and his friends rush to his apartment to comfort him as he mulls over losing the greatest opportunity he ever had. Chandler is having trouble bonding with his new roommate Eddie as he spends most of his time in his room. Phoebe tricks them into spending time drinking beers and talking to each other about their ex-girlfriends. Later, Eddie's ex-girlfriend Tilly stops by the apartment to drop off Eddie's fish tank and meets Chandler briefly before Eddie walks out to greet her. Despite their meeting only being brief, Eddie accuses Chandler of sleeping with Tilly and killing his goldfish, especially since the tank was already empty, and steals Chandler's insoles in retaliation. After comforting Joey, Chandler comes home to find Eddie serving him weird \\"raisin\\" cookies and having replaced the goldfish with a goldfish cracker, and then goes to bed, dumbfounded. After playing at Central Perk while Monica and Richard are on a double date with Rachel and Ross, Phoebe claims that Monica has had sex with many boyfriends, leaving Richard curious about the number. They take the argument back to Monica and Rachel's apartment while Ross and Rachel retreat to Rachel's bedroom. Monica is stunned when Richard says he has only been with two women – her and his ex-wife Barbara – and those two women he has been in love with. Touched, Monica admits she loves him, too. Meanwhile, Ross asks Rachel to list her own sexual conquests, but when she mentions Paolo as meaningless animal sex, Ross gets upset at her. Rachel manages to assuage him by telling him that their own relationship is so much better as they have tenderness and intimacy, and they connect. When Rachel claims he is the best sex she has ever had, Ross promptly decides to up the ante with animal sex of his own. Monica and Rachel head to the bathroom to celebrate but argue with each other when they find out they have only one condom, while Ross and Richard awkwardly talk to each other in the living room. Rachel gets the condom after she wins a game of rock, paper, scissors against Monica and promptly has animal sex with Ross, forcing Monica and Richard to delay their plans. On another night, Ross, wearing Rachel's bathrobe, sneaks toward the bathroom to retrieve a condom. Richard then appears from Monica's room with the same objective, while wearing her robe. They have a brief, awkward exchange before agreeing never to speak of it. == Reception == This episode forms the basis of a study published in Pediatrics on \\"the impact of condom- efficacy messages in an episode of Friends on teens\\".Collins, et al (November 2003). \\"Entertainment Television as a Healthy Sex Educator: The Impact of Condom-Efficacy Information in an Episode of Friends\\". Pediatrics 112 (5): pp. 1115–1121. During a discussion about v-chips, Connecticut senator Joseph Lieberman told series co-creator Marta Kauffman that he was appalled by the scene where Monica and Rachel fight over the last condom and turned off his television. Kauffman dismissed Lieberman's comments because he misunderstood the scene; the characters were advocating safe sex by agreeing that whoever did not have the condom could not have sex.Wild, David (2004).

Boilo is a variation of a traditional Lithuanian liqueur called \\"Krupnik\\", or \\"Krupnikas\\". Characteristically boilo has a standard recipe including citrus fruits (such as oranges and lemons), herbs and spices (such as nutmeg, cloves, caraway seed, and anise seed), and other ingredients such as honey and ginger ale. The traditional base ingredient in boilo is moonshine. Many modern recipes have replaced home-brewed moonshine with blended whiskey, rye or grain alcohol, and may be made on a stove top or in a slow cooker. Some recipes specify Four Queens whiskey. Variations on the traditional recipe include honeyberry boilo, \\"tomata\\" boilo, blueberry boilo, and apple pie boilo. Some traditions recommend that holiday music and decorating accompany the cooking process, to add to the festive effect of the beverage. As with krupnik, some believe it to have curative properties for the onset of fall/winter related ailments such as a cold or influenza. There are many boilo taste test contests held annually in the Coal Region of Pennsylvania where home brewers compete over whose recipe is most authentic and whose boilo is the most easy drinking. The Annual Pfeiffenberger Boilo Contest is among the most prestigious and intense of such contests. Dozens of family boilo recipes are judged and a series of voting parameters and rounds of taste-testing decide the winner. ==Commercial Products== * In 2016 Jabberwocky Candles of Frackville, PA released a Boilo Scented Candle. * As of December 2012 an \\"instant\\" version of the drink is available commercially.

The red line shows the first bridge crossing of the bay, Hangzhou Bay Bridge. Zhoushan Islands is the archipelago, off Ningbo, at the southeast edge of the Bay (lower right). Hangzhou Bay, or the Bay of Hangzhou (), is a funnel-shaped inlet of the East China Sea, bordered by the province of Zhejiang and the municipality of Shanghai, which lies north of the Bay. The Bay extends from the East China Sea to its head at the city of Hangzhou, from which its name is derived. At Hangzhou, the Qiantang River flows into this Bay, providing freshwater from the West while seawater comes in from the East. Thus, Hangzhou Bay, especially its western end, is sometimes called in the scientific literature as the Qiantang River Estuary. At the southeast end of Hangzhou Bay, off Ningbo, are many small islands that are collectively called the \\"Zhoushan Islands.\\" This archipelago of islands is urbanized with the administrative status of a prefecture-level city in the province of Zhejiang. At less than 15 meters in depth, the entire Bay is relatively shallow. Consequently, the main port in the Bay area is the one in Ningbo and Zhoushan, at the southeast end of the Bay on the coast of East China Sea. == Qiantang River tidal bore == Yanguan tidal bore (2017) The Bay is known for hosting the world's largest tidal bore, up to 9 meters (30 ft) high, and traveling up to per hour. Yanguan Town Tide Viewing Park (观潮胜地公园 Guān cháo shèngdì gōngyuán), on the north shore of Hangzhou Bay some 50 km east of the city of Hangzhou, is regarded as one of the best place to watch the Qiantang River Tidal Bore, especially on the 18th day of the eighth lunar month. == Bay bridges == Hangzhou Bay Bridge: northern cable-stayed span Service center with lookout tower at midpoint of Hangzhou Bay Bridge The Bay was first spanned by the Hangzhou Bay Bridge, which was linked up on June 14, 2007 and opened on May 1, 2008. It is a long 35.7 km (22.2 mi) bridge carrying expressway, three lanes each way, with two separate cable-stayed portions and a service center at the bridge midpoint. It runs across the mouth of Hangzhou Bay connecting the municipalities of Jiaxing and Ningbo in Zhejiang province. One of the longest bridges in the world, it cuts the trip between eastern Zhejiang and Shanghai from 400 to 80 kilometers (250 to 50 miles). The Jiashao Bridge with six consecutive cable-stayed spans The second bridge crossing of the Bay is the Jiashao Bridge, located west of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge, and completed in 2013. It stretches 10.14 km (6.3 mi) across the Qiantang River estuary and carries the expressway, four lanes each way, over six consecutive cable-stayed spans supported by six tall pylons. The Jiashao Bridge connects Shaoxing on the south shore of the Bay to a point on the north shore of the Bay due south of Jiaxing and provides a more direct route for vehicle traffic between Shaoxing and Shanghai. == Hangzhou Great Bay Area == In 2018, the Zhejiang provincial government, following in Guangdong's footsteps, released ambitious plans for the Hangzhou Great Bay Area, aiming for a mega urban re-development schema that would double the economic output of the region by 2022 and develop a “world class” bay area in Zhejiang by 2035. The Great Bay Area, an economic and industrial belt centered around Hangzhou Bay, is home to about 40 million people and, as of 2017, accounts for 87 percent of the province's economic output. The challenge to Zhejiang's vision may be its interaction with Shanghai. == See also== * Qiantang River * Tidal bore * Port of Ningbo- Zhoushan * Yangtze River Delta == References == Category:Bays of China Category:Bodies of water of Zhejiang ","title":"Hangzhou Bay"},{"id":"3248886","text":"MacX is an obsolete display server implementation supporting the X11 display server protocol that ran on System 7, Mac OS 8, and Mac OS 9. It also ran under A/UX. Prior to X11R4 and the introduction of the PowerPC-based Power Macintosh, this server was developed internally by Apple Inc. for the Motorola 68000 based Macintoshes. MacX was initially developed within the Networking and Communications organization as one component of the Apple DEC Alliance suite of products, but later was moved to Apple's A/UX group since X11 was (and is) an important part of UNIX user interfaces. Versions supporting X11R4 and X11R5 were developed for Apple by a small team of engineers at AGE Logic, Inc., a San Diego, California company. AGE also OEMed the MacX software under the trade name XoftWare for Macintosh. Apple provided early versions of the Power Macintosh to AGE Logic, and the result was a binary that supported both the Power Macintosh as well as earlier, 68000-based systems. AGE Logic was later acquired by a Silicon Valley company named NetManage in the mid-1990s. NetManage was headquartered directly across the street from Apple in Cupertino, California. XoftWare for Macintosh was merged into NetManage's product offering for the Macintosh, which included a wide variety of standalone Internet desktop applications (e.g., telnet, archie search engine, gopher protocol, FTP), along with various software titles, mainly terminal emulators that were acquired by AGE Logic when it purchased Pacer Software earlier in the decade. By 1998, Apple had discontinued MacX as it transitioned from the classic Mac OS to the Unix-like Mac OS X, which had ample support for X11 (earlier versions of Mac OS X did not directly support X11, but as of Mac OS X v10.3, X11.app has been made available directly from Apple). NetManage disbanded its Macintosh group earlier, around 1996, and as a result, discontinued support of XoftWare for Macintosh. ==References== Category:X servers ","title":"MacX"},{"id":"3248889","text":"Kellie Shirley is an English actress who works in film, television, theatre and radio.

The journal, originally based in Boston and now operated from the editor's home in Costa Rica, publishes new and newly discovered writings from American and international writers. The magazine appears twice a year at widely varying intervals; subscribers purchase one issue at a time or a subscription for four issues. It first appeared in 1997 in newsprint; issues between 2003 and 2008 were published in bound edition; with the publication of No. 19 by the London- based publisher Sylph Editions, the journal has returned to broadsheet format. The contents of TRoL fall into several categories. TEXTS are Works of fiction or non-fiction, of varying length, written in English or translated into English from any language. LIVES are memoirs, correspondence, biography and autobiography. ARIAS, a unique category, are personal statements and brief essays without restriction of subject. MUSIC, ART, BOOKS comprise intelligent work on any aspect of the arts. Works in the ARCHIVES are selected by the Editor to introduce readers to undeservedly lesser known writers from previous generations. POETRY includes both original verse and work from translation. Reviews and critical essays appear under NEW FICTION and as a part of P.B.'s NOTEBOOK, a column written by Mr. Botsford in the spirit of Enlightenment philosopher and writer Pierre Bayle. In 1684 Bayle began the publication of his Nouvelles de la république des lettres, after which TRoL takes its name. Another unique feature has been the inclusion in newsprint issues of French- style pamphlets, which readers tear from the other pages and fold and cut themselves into small booklets. \\"Salido\\" by Louis Guilloux appears in this form in No.2, as does \\"O Brother!\\" by Mr. Botsford in No.3. TRoL is distinguished by its international character and the publication of unknown authors alongside those already accomplished. The name of the magazine references the network of literary and political correspondence which united prominent thinkers across Europe during the Enlightenment: ::The Republic of Letters is of very ancient origin ... It embraces the whole world and is composed of all nationalities, all social classes, all ages and both sexes ... All languages, ancient as well as modern, are spoken. The arts are joined to letters, and artisans have their place in it; but its religion is not uniform, and its manners (as in all republics) are a mixture of good and bad. Piety and licentiousness are both to be found ... Praise and honor are awarded by popular acclaim. (M. de Vigneul-Marville, 1699) In a 1999 interview with The New York Times Mr. Bellow explained his motivation for the magazine: ::One early reader wrote that our paper, \\"with its contents so fresh, person-to- person\\", was \\"real, non-synthetic, undistracting.\\" Noting that there were no ads, she asked, \\"Is it possible, can it last?\\" and called it \\"an antidote to the shrinking of the human being in every one of us.\\" And toward the end of her letter our correspondent added, \\"It behooves the elder generation to come up with reminders of who we used to be and need to be.\\" This is what Keith Botsford and I had hoped that our \\"tabloid for literates\\" would be. And for two years it has been just that. We are a pair of utopian codgers who feel we have a duty to literature., ==List of contributors== { align=\\"left\\" summary=\\"first column is left column\\" -  align=\\"left\\"  * Martin Amis * Alfred Andersch * Aharon Appelfeld * Roberto Arlt * John Auerbach * Murray Bail * Joshua Barkan * Janis Freedman Bellow * Saul Bellow * François Bondy * Keith Botsford * Yuri Buida * Cevat Capan * John Randolf Carter * Peter Coleman * Julia Copeland * Prudence Crowther * Régis Debray * G.V.

Founded in 1568 as a seminary, then a boys' school, it is the oldest continuously operating and oldest post-Reformation Catholic school in the country. Today it caters for boys and girls aged 3 to 18. ==History== ===Douai: 1568–1793=== St Edmund's College is a continuation on English soil of the English College that was founded by William Cardinal Allen at Douai in Flanders, France in 1568. Originally intended as a seminary to prepare priests to work in England to keep Catholicism alive, it soon also became a boys' school for Catholics, who were debarred from running such institutions in England. Many of its students, both priests and laymen, returned to England to be put to death under the anti-Catholic laws. The college includes amongst its former alumni 20 canonised and 138 beatified martyrs. ===Silkstead, Twyford, Standon and Old Hall Green: 1662–1793=== A small Catholic school was started in Hampshire in the second half of the 17th century. It was opened by a priest at Silkstead some time before 1662, and transferred to Twyford, near Winchester. It was conducted in great secrecy, and was for boys of preparatory-school age who intended to proceed to the English College to complete more advanced studies. The poet Alexander Pope was a student at the school, although he did not proceed to Douay. Twyford was closed in 1745 on account of anti-Catholic feeling caused by the Jacobite rising, but Bishop Richard Challoner re- established the school in Hertfordshire at Standon Lordship in 1753, in a property owned by the Aston family. In 1769, Bishop James Talbot moved the school to its current site at Old Hall Green, near Puckeridge, and it became known as Old Hall Green Academy.Ward, Bernard. A History of St. Edmund's College, London. Kegan Paul. 1893 ===Old Hall Green: 1793 – present=== The work of the English College in Douay was brought to an end by the French Revolution, and in October 1793 the college property was confiscated. Professors and students came back to England, where Relief Acts had considerably relaxed the penal laws against Catholics. John Douglass, Vicar Apostolic of the London District, realised that the time had come to replace the English College, and the earliest refugees joined the students at Old Hall Green Academy. On 16 November 1793 – the feast of Edmund Rich, Archbishop of Canterbury – a new college was instituted.Burton, Edwin. \\"Old Hall (St. Edmund's College).\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 13 January 2019 This was the beginning of a restoration of Catholic colleges and seminaries throughout England. Students from the North had established a separate foundation, which is now Ushaw College, near Durham by the time that the remaining staff and students arrived from Douay by 1795 to join St Edmund's College. A gift of £10,000 from John Sone, a Hampshire Catholic, enabled St Edmund's to be established in new buildings, designed by James Taylor of Islington, who had himself been a student at the Old Hall Green Academy. A chapel and refectory were added in 1805 by Bishop Poynter, who succeeded Dr. Stapleton as president in 1801. Thomas Griffiths, Vicar Apostolic of the London District, was the college's president from 1818 until 1834, and did much to give the college a sound financial basis, culminating in a project for a large Gothic chapel designed by Pugin, completed in 1853. Nevertheless, the fortunes of the college varied throughout the 19th century and at times it seemed as if it might have to close. It was the seminary for the \\"London district\\" until 1850, when it became the joint property of the Sees of Westminster. The era of Vicars Apostolic ended in 1850 with the restoration of the Hierarchy. Strachey, in his Eminent Victorians, portrays the College as the scene of a dispute between Henry Edward Manning and Dr Errington over whether a recusant or an ultramontane style should prevail there, and ultimately over who was to succeed Wiseman as second Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster.Lytton Strachey, 1918, Eminent Victorians, Folio Society edition 1979 pp. 70 ff. In 1869, Manning, now Archbishop, set up a seminary in Hammersmith, and for the first time St Edmund's ceased to be a theological college. In 1874, the junior boys were separated from the rest of the college into St Hugh's Preparatory School, in a house originally built by Pugin for the Oxford convert W. G. Ward. The prep school has since been renamed St Edmund's Preparatory School. In 1893, Bernard Ward, was appointed president and started a scheme of rebuilding and improvements. Numbers in the school increased significantly, and in 1904 Archbishop Francis Bourne decided to return the seminarians to the college. A new wing was built to house them, and this part of the college eventually became known as Allen Hall, after Cardinal Allen, founder of the English College at Douay. The college became considerably run down during the First World War. On the walls leading up to the Chapel there are memorials to eighty-two former students who fell during World War I. A legacy became available to Cardinal Bourne, which was used to carry out badly needed repairs and additions. The college celebrated the 400th anniversary of its foundation in 1968. In 1975 the seminarians departed for the second time, moving to Chelsea but retaining the name of Allen Hall. The school expanded considerably in the 1970s. In 1974, girls from the nearby Poles Convent and elsewhere were admitted into the sixth form as the first step towards complete coeducation, which was accomplished with the closure of Poles Convent in 1986. In 1996, an infants' department was added to the junior school, meaning that St Edmund's would now educate pupils aged 3–18. St Edmund's College celebrated its 450th anniversary in 2018. ==Houses== Heads of house, assisted by a team of tutors, provide continuity of care throughout students' time at the college and are the normal means of contact between the college and parents. House spirit is encouraged through various inter-house competitions, sporting and cultural, and through house celebrations, ranging from formal dinners to summer barbecues. There are five houses (years of foundation in brackets): *Challoner (1922) *Douglass (1922) *Pole (1990) *Poynter (1970) *Talbot (1922) There are five former houses (years of existence in brackets): *Allen Hall (1922–1975) *Griffiths (1972–1984) *Junior House (1945–1953 and 1961–1993) *Margaret Pole (1975–1990) *Stapleton (1975–1996) ==Boarding== Pupils may choose to board full time or on certain days of the week. There are two main boarding houses: Allen Hall (boys) and Garvey's (girls). The accommodation areas are supervised by residential staff. ==O Beate mi Edmunde== The college anthem was composed by Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman for the solemn enshrinement of the Relic of St Edmund in the college chapel. The song has a total of 30 verses arranged into three decades, the first and third decades are each preceded and concluded with the following chorus, and the second decade with a variation of it. It is sung every year on the three days before 16 November, St Edmund's Day, when St Edmund is remembered. Ten verses are sung each day in chapel of what is called the Triduum. :O Beate mi Edmunde x2, :Sic pro me ad Filium Dei, :Cum Maria preces funde x2, :Ut per vos sim placens Ei. ==The Edmundian Association== The Edmundian Association was founded in 1853 and has members throughout the world. Its aim is to maintain a bond between the college and its alumni, and among members. Membership is available to past pupils of the college and their parents, parents of current pupils, and current and past members of staff. ===Notable former pupils=== ====Lay persons==== *Chizzy Akudolu (born 1973) – actress on BBC drama Holby City *Nicholas Bannister (1960-1964) - associate editor The Guardian * *Francis Barraud (1856–1924) – painter of Nipper, the HMV trademark dog *Alan Burns (1887–1980) – diplomat *Michel Jean Cazabon (1813–1888) – artist *Siobhan Daly (living) – producer and artistic director *Sikhanyiso Dlamini (born 1987) – Princess of Swaziland *Simon Geoghegan (born 1968) – Irish international rugby player *Everard Green (1844–1926) – Rouge Dragon Pursuivant and Somerset Herald, College of Arms *Edward Henry (1850–1931) – pioneer of fingerprint usage in crime investigations *Tommie Hoban (born 1994) – professional footballer *Javier Iturriaga (born 1983) – professional footballer *James Lynam Molloy (1837–1909) – poet *Laurence Meynell (1899–1989) – novelist and children's writer *Nick Nieland (born 1972) – Commonwealth Games javelin gold medallist *Mervyn O'Gorman (1871–1958) – aeronautical engineer *Joseph O'Sullivan (1897–1922) – Irish nationalist *Henry Oxenham (1829–1888) – controversialist and poet *Everard Phillipps VC (1835–1857) – hero of the Indian Mutiny *William Scholl (1882–1968) – footwear designer and businessman *Neville Stack (1896–1949) – test pilot, air racer and aviation pioneer *Aiden Turner (born 1977) – actor *Paul Alexander Zino (1916–2004) – ornithologist, after whom Zino's petrel is named ====Clergy==== *Francis Bourne (1861–1935) – Archbishop of Westminster, also buried here *Adrian Fortescue (1874–1923) – priest, scholar and adventurer *Reginald C.

The said poor children shall wear on their upper garment the cognisance or crest of me, John Roan.\\" The stag's head badge – derived from John Roan's personal coat-of-arms – has been worn by Roan school children ever since. The first chairman of the governors of the school was Dr Thomas Plume, the vicar of Greenwich. For much of the 18th century, the school was in the charge of the Herringham family who provided four successive headmasters from 1702 to 1785. The first headmaster of the boys' school from 1877, when it opened in Eastney Street, was Mr C.M. Ridger who held the post for 33 years. He was succeeded by Mr T.R.N. Crofts (1911–1919), Mr A.H. Hope (1919–1930), Mr W.J. Potter (1931–1938), Mr H.W. Gilbert (1938–1958), Mr W.L. Garstang (1959–1974) and Dr A J Taylor (1974 to turning comprehensive) all of whom made significant contributions to the grammar school. The Hope Memorial Camp at Braithwaite, near Keswick, Cumbria was established in Mr Hope's memory shortly after his death in 1930. The first headmistress of the Roan Girls' School was Miss M.M. Blackmore (until 1895) followed by Miss M.S. Walker (1895–1919), Miss M.K. Higgs (1919–1944), Miss M.E. Barnsdale (1944–1962), Miss M.S. Chamberlain (1962–1968) and Mrs M.J. Barber (1968–1980). ===Comprehensive=== It became a comprehensive in 1983, when Roan Grammar School for Boys and Roan School for Girls merged with Charlton Boys School. ===Potential relocation=== John Roan School sign and school, Westcombe Park Road (2015) During the first decade of the 21st century, the local council proposed to relocate the school to the Greenwich Peninsula, but, facing growing local opposition, it eventually scrapped the plans. Critics among parents and local residents argued that the current sites were good, and that money should instead be invested to refurbish the current sites. The proposed site was also near to an old gasometer, which would need to be dismantled at considerable cost for safety reasons, and alongside the busy A102 Blackwall Tunnel southern approach road. With relocation ruled out, the Westcombe Park buildings were demolished in the summer of 2012 prior to construction of replacement buildings (completed in 2014), and the Maze Hill site was refurbished and remodelled; both phases used funding originally granted when the school was due to move to the Peninsula. === Academisation === The John Roan School was inspected by Ofsted in March 2018; the resulting report, published on 8 June 2018, rated the school \\"Inadequate\\" and said it had \\"serious weaknesses\\". On 12 June 2018, the school was issued with an Academy Order. The following day, parents and staff received a letter from the University Schools Trust stating that the Regional Schools Commissioner had nominated UST to be the preferred sponsor. Some parents organised protests, seeking to get the Ofsted report withdrawn and to halt the academisation process. Teachers also organised a series of strikes (eight up to 7 November 2018) in protest at the academisation process; over 1,000 people signed a petition and 300 families raised concerns about UST finances and suitability with the school's chair of governors; but more than 100 signed a separate letter supporting the improvement plans and criticising the teachers' industrial action. On 14 November, a Greenwich Council decision about academisation of John Roan was deferred to a meeting in December 2018. On 30 August 2019, the academy plan was finally forced through, John Roan, the voluntary controlled school was closed and it was refactored as The John Roan School, a converter academy sponsored by the United Learning Trust. == Location == Since 1928 the school has been located east of Greenwich Park and south-east of Greenwich town centre, having moved there from Victorian purpose-built premises in Eastney Street (now Feathers Place). The school is currently split over two campuses — Maze Hill, where the 1920s grade II listed neo-Georgian building (architects Percy Boothroyd Dannatt and Sir Banister Fletcher) stands, and Westcombe Park — named after the roads on which they lie (respectively Maze Hill and Westcombe Park Road). The foundation stone of the Maze Hill buildings was laid by Sir George Hopwood Hume MP, local politician and chairman of London County Council, in 1926. The school had two opening ceremonies: one in 1927, by Herbert Fisher MP, and another following completion in 1928. The John Roan Playing Fields are located approximately two miles (3 km) to the south, in Kidbrooke Park Road, west of Sutcliffe Park. == Motto and house teams == The school's motto is \\"With honour and hard work\\" (). The John Roan had four house teams, named after people of historic significance: Seacole, Da Vinci, Darwin and Stopes, named after Mary Seacole, Leonardo da Vinci, Charles Darwin and Marie Stopes. Two tutor groups per year were in the same house team. There were also house leaders and competitions amongst the four houses. The house system was scrapped in September 2017, and the colour ties now correspond to year group. In the 1950s and 1960s, the houses were named after four British naval or military figures, all connected with Greenwich, viz. Drake (house colour: green), Nelson (red), Rodney (Blue) and Wolfe (yellow). In his ‘History of the Roan School and its Founder’ [1929] Mr J W Kirby lists eight houses: School House, Drake, Collingwood, Grenville, Nelson, Raleigh, Rodney, Wolfe. ==Notable former pupils== :See also :Category:People educated at the John Roan School. * Asad Ahmad, London BBC news presenter * Dave Berry, former MTV presenter * David Hillier, former Arsenal Footballer ===Roan Boys' Grammar School=== * Rt Rev Ralph Dean, Archbishop of Cariboo from 1971–73 (Bishop from 1957) * Harry Denford (born 1968), comedian, playwright and actor * Sir Jack Drummond, biochemist who separated Vitamin A, and declared the chemicals that are now known as Vitamins A, B & C, and was murdered in France in 1952 * Norman Haggett (1926-2018), RAF officer, member of the RAF Falcons display team and first-class cricketer * Peter Guy Ottewill, RAF pilot awarded George Medal for bravery * Hugh Phillips, orthopaedic surgeon and President from 2004–5 of the Royal College of Surgeons of England and of the British Orthopaedic Association from 1999–2000 * John Regis, athlete * Rt Rev Gavin Hunter Reid, Bishop of Maidstone from 1992–2001 * Ian Rickson, Artistic Director, Royal Court Theatre, London 1998–2006.

Announces Contract Extension with Cleopatra Records Retrieved February 27, 2012 is a Los Angeles-based independent record label founded in 1992 by entrepreneur and music fan Brian Perera. It has since grown into a family of labels, including Hypnotic Records, Purple Pyramid Records, Deadline Music Records; and X-Ray Records, encompassing a variety of genres with emphasis on unique and experimental artists. ==History and notable artists== Cleopatra Records has been primarily known for ushering in the second wave of gothic and industrial music with an eclectic roster of artists including Christian Death, Nosferatu, Rosetta Stone, Switchblade Symphony, Leæther Strip, Birmingham 6, The Electric Hellfire Club, Razed in Black, X Marks the Pedwalk, Spahn Ranch, Genitorturers, Download (featuring members of Skinny Puppy), Pagandom and others as well as new wave artists Gary Numan, Missing Persons, Information Society and others. Cleopatra has also been a vital force in promoting underground and British punk rock bands such as The Vibrators, U.K. Subs, and The Damned, as well as dozens of lesser known bands that had never before been released in the U.S. market. When the revival of 1980s Hollywood Metal exploded around the turn of the century, the company started a subsidiary label Deadline Music to handle releases by Quiet Riot, White Lion, Warrant, Cinderella, Poison’s Bret Michaels and L.A. Guns. Partnering with European labels such as Lifted Music and Hard Records, Cleopatra established the Hypnotic imprint for a series of electronic music compilations as well as full-length albums by The Future Sound of London, Paul Oakenfold, Superstar DJ Keoki, and Talla 2XLC as well as the first ever feature-length documentary on rave culture Better Living Through Circuitry. Most recently, Hypnotic has been the home of high profile, and highly prolific, metal-turned-electronic music act Blackburner. Hip hop acts have also found a home at Cleopatra Records on the X-Ray imprint, which has released albums by SX-10 (featuring Sen Dog of Cypress Hill), KRS-One, Brokencyde, Westside Connection, and DMX. X-Ray Records achieved a first for the Cleopatra family in 2005 when the album It's Not A Game by Bone Thugs-n-Harmony member Layzie Bone landed on the Billboard Top 100 chart. The Purple Pyramid imprint, focusing on progressive rock and Psychedelic music has produced releases by Yes, Rick Wakeman, Steve Howe, Santana, Amon Düül II, Nektar, Brainticket, Tangerine Dream, and Quicksilver Messenger Service as well as projects by producer/musician Billy Sherwood dubbed The Prog Collective, (featuring members of Asia, King Crimson, Mahavishnu Orchestra, and Gong), and The Fusion Syndicate (featuring Rick Wakeman, Steve Stevens, Billy Cobham, and Steve Morse). In 2011, the label partnered with Prog Rock band Nektar for a 2CD collection called Retrospektive, followed by the covers album Spoonful Of Time in 2012 and the new album, Time Machine, in 2013 alongside reissues of the band's older albums. ==Recent activity== The Cleopatra label group has expanded in a variety of directions, working with iconic artists such as Sly Stone and William Shatner. R&B; singer-songwriter and guitar hero Shuggie Otis released a live concert DVD, CD & LP Live In Williamsburg through Cleopatra in 2014, as well as the 2018 instrumental studio album Inter-Fusion featuring drummer Carmine Appice and bassist Tony Franklin. Judy Collins released a duets album in 2015 via Cleopatra called Strangers Again featuring Willie Nelson, Jackson Browne, Jeff Bridges, Glen Hansard (of The Swell Season), Jimmy Buffett, Michael McDonald, and Don McLean as well as 2016's Silver Skies Blue album, which earned her a Grammy nomination for Best Folk Album, plus 2017's critically acclaimed Everybody Knows album with Stephen Stills. The label has also become home to producer/songwriter Todd Rundgren, starting in 2016 with a 3-CD box set of unreleased vintage live material called Box O’ Todd and a new concert CD/DVD called An Evening with Todd Rundgren Live at the Ridgefield. That was followed by Todd's newest studio album White Knight, released in 2017 and featuring a host of guest appearances by artists including Trent Reznor, Robyn, Dâm-Funk, Daryl Hall, Donald Fagen, Joe Walsh, Joe Satriani and more. Cleopatra has released high-profile live and studio albums by some of the biggest country artists in music including The Oak Ridge Boys, T. G. Sheppard, Collin Raye, Sammy Kershaw, Little Texas, Doug Kershaw, and a quickly ascending newcomer Mary Sarah. The company also established a blues imprint, Cleopatra Blues, that produced releases by Junior Wells, Kenny Neal (whose Cleopatra Blues album Bloodline was nominated for a Grammy for Best Contemporary Blues Album), Arthur Adams, Big Jay McNeely, Popa Chubby, Eric Gales, Leo Welch and others. Cleopatra remains a strong champion of avant garde, underground music such as psychedelic groove band Brainticket who re- released their catalog through Cleopatra, and was even brought over for their first US tour in 2011. A new Brainticket album titled Past, Present and Future was released in 2015. San Francisco noise-art band Chrome also saw Cleopatra release numerous reissues of the band's late ‘70s and early ‘80s output on both vinyl and CD over the last few years, culminating in the massive 7 LP vinyl box set, a reissue and expanded version of the historic Chrome Box. Amon Düül II, one of the most influential German experimental bands of all-time, partnered with Cleopatra in 2014 for a series of deluxe, limited edition vinyl reissues of such albums as Yeti, Phallus Dei, Wolf City, and others, along with the group's newest effort Düülirium, released in June 2014. Cleopatra owner Brian Perera has also been well known as a longtime champion of British Space Rock legends Hawkwind. Cleopatra released the final album by original Hawkwind guitarist Huw Lloyd-Langton, a 2CD collection of rare tracks and new recordings, before his passing in late 2012. And reviving a relationship that first began in the mid ‘90s with the release of several of his solo albums, the label is once again working Hawkwind alum Nik Turner. Turner's newest solo efforts, the most critically acclaimed of his career, were released through Cleopatra including 2013's Space Gypsy and 2015's Space Fusion Odyssey. Both albums were supported with U.S. tours alongside neo-Krautrock band Hedersleben (featuring Nicky Garratt of UK Subs) whose catalog was also recently picked up by Cleopatra. 2015 also saw publication of The Spirit Of Hawkwind 1969–1976, Turner's definitive account of his years in Hawkwind told through the words of music journalist Dave Thompson as well as numerous rare and unpublished photos. Expanding its interest in punk, Cleopatra acquired the entire catalog of releases by esteemed San Francisco Bay Area punk label, New Red Archives, formerly owned by Nicky Garratt. The label was home to the debut album of politically charged punk band Anti-Flag, early ‘80s NY-based hardcore groups Kraut, and Reagan Youth, as well as an early project from Sunny Day Real Estate / Foo Fighters bassist Nate Mendel called Christ on a Crutch. Recent signings include UK legends Slaughter & the Dogs and Anti-Nowhere League plus hardcore icons The Casualties and Down By Law. That same year, an exclusive licensing deal for the hugely popular Kung Fu Records label brought bands such as The Vandals, The Ataris, Tsunami Bomb, and more into the Cleopatra family. In a nod to their gothic-industrial roots, the label acquired the complete Wax Trax! recordings of Ministry mastermind Al Jourgensen, including several unreleased Ministry songs as well as albums by Revolting Cocks, 1000 Homo DJs, PTP, Pailhead (with Ian MacKaye), and Acid Horse. This culminated in the release of the Ministry Trax! Box, a 7 CD plus bonus LP compendium of 101 tracks from the 1980-1985 period including 29 previously unreleased recordings all packaged in a patent leather, foil-stamped box with a 64-page book. The label also published a massive tome of unreleased photos and ephemera of gothic rock legends Bauhaus, Bahaus Undead, curated by founding member Kevin Haskins. That led to a record deal for Haskins’ project with Daniel Ash, Poptone, featuring newly recorded versions of songs by Bauhaus, Tones on Tail, and Love & Rockets. 2017 & 2018 saw the label partner with a number of underground and indie artists such as The Warlocks, Bestial Mouths, Magic Wands, Fantome (featuring Hanin Elias of Atari Teenage Riot), Gary Wilson, Egrets On Ergot, Descartes A Kant, Pastel Ghost, United Ghosts, Holygram, Whispering Sons as well as more familiar acts such as The Guess Who, Tom Keifer (of Cinderella), and Gin Blossoms plus live albums from Jane's Addiction, Culture Club and Sheryl Crow. Also in 2018, the label staged another major foray into the world of hip hop through the imprint X-Ray Records with releases by Gunplay, Riff Raff, Onyx, Luniz, Black Sheep, Brokencyde, Petey Pablo, and R&B; icon Case. The year culminated in one of the imprint's highest profile releases ever, the new studio album from Wu-Tang Clan member Ghostface Killah, The Lost Tapes, and two remix albums released simultaneously as The Ghost Files. Now Glenn Danzig — who recently unveiled his debut horror film, Verotika — has devoted an entire album to hailing the King. The long-in-the-works Danzig Sings Elvis, released April 24th, 2020, features Evil Elvis’ covers of iconic Presley numbers like “Always on My Mind,” “Baby, Let’s Play House,” and even the distinctly un-Danzig-like “Pocket Full of Rainbows.” What’s most surprising is how faithful his versions are to the originals. His take on “One Night” — Presley’s foot-stomping rockabilly barnburner, which made it up to Number Four in 1957 — retains all the lustful passion of the original with gently buzzing guitar and as much glorious slap-back reverb as Danzig could find. Never does it drift into metal territory; it’s simply a reverent tip of the pompadour to the King. A teaser for Powerman 5000's new single, \\"Black Lipstick\\", is available. The track is taken from the band's upcoming album, \\"The Noble Rot\\", due later in the year via Cleopatra Records. When Powerman 5000's new deal with Cleopatra Records was first announced, vocalist Spider One said: \\"We are incredibly excited to partner with Cleopatra Records for our latest release, 'The Noble Rot'. We feel like we have put together our most diverse and interesting record ever. All boxes have been checked in the strange universe that is Powerman 5000 with this one, and we can't wait for everyone to hear it.\\" Brian Perera, owner of Cleopatra Records, added: \\"We've been fans of Powerman 5000 for years, watching how they have stuck to their guns throughout their career and maintained a high level of creative ambition and risk. They are a rare breed of electronic/industrial metal bands who have crossed over and gained fans from multiple genres. This new album is really going to shock the world and we are honored to be releasing it.\\" ==Acquisitions== ;New Red Archives In 2012 Cleopatra acquired the entire catalog of releases by New Red Archives, formerly owned by Nicky Garratt of UK Subs. The label was home to first wave punk group U.K. Subs, the debut album of political punk group Anti-Flag, early 1980s New York hardcore groups Reagan Youth and Kraut the first independent group ever in rotation on MTV , as well as an early project from Sunny Day Real Estate / Foo Fighters bassist Nate Mendel called Christ On A Crutch. ;Wax Trax! The label acquired the complete Wax Trax! recordings of Al Jourgensen, including several unreleased Ministry songs as well as albums by Revolting Cocks, 1000 Homo DJs, PTP, Pailhead (with Ian MacKaye), and Acid Horse. A 7-CD box set of these recordings (entitled Trax! Box) was released in April 2015. Meanwhile, Cleopatra has continued to work with established artists such as Missing Persons’ Dale Bozzio, Thor, The Oak Ridge Boys, Shuggie Otis, and Popa Chubby and Eric Gales. ==Cleopatra Blues== When Los Angeles-based independent record label Cleopatra Records, Inc. began attracting talent from modern blues artists and purchased the estate of Junior Wells, the company decided to create a label dedicated to the genre. Cleopatra Blues was established in 2015, using a logo based on a well-known photo of Junior Wells smoking a cigarette. The label has become a home for modern blues acts as Popa Chubby, Eric Gales, James Montgomery, Leo Welch, and Lance Lopez as well as up-and- coming blues artists such as Eli Cook and British prodigy Tom Killner. Louisiana blues artist Kenny Neal raised the profile of the label considerably with the release of his solo album, 2016's Bloodline, which was nominated for a Grammy Nominees (Grammy Nominees#2016) in the category of Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album. Saxophone player Big Jay McNeely joined the label in 2016 for his release Blowin’ Down The House - Big Jay's Latest & Greatest and will also be releasing a live CD & DVD called Honkin’ & Jivin’ At The Palomino in 2017. A box set featuring unreleased tracks the label acquired in its purchasing of the Junior Wells estate is set to be released in 2017. Soulful blues phenom, and Blues Hall Of Fame inductee, Joe Louis Walker is joined by a host of talented friends and peers on his superb new studio album. Features guest performances by fellow blues icons Keb’ Mo’, Eric Gales, and Albert Lee PLUS Detroit soul singer Mitch Ryder, harmonica virtuoso Lee Oskar, Hot Tuna’s Jorma Kaukonen, punk rock vocalist Charlie Harper, legendary session player Waddy Wachtel, and so many more. This album explodes with the passionate playing and soulful melodies that have made Walker a favorite among true blues aficionados including The Rolling Stones. Word has already begun to spread all over the world that Blues royal, Shirley King, daughter of legend B.B. King, is about to release a new album that features an amazing cast of blues musicians. Anticipation for Blues For A King, the forthcoming album, is riding high, and now eager fans are about to get their first taste of what’s to come with the release of “I Did You Wrong.” One of the album’s smokin’ hot original tunes, “I Did You Wrong” features none other than Rock Hall Of Famer, Blues Hall Of Famer and founding member of the iconic Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Elvin Bishop! Together, Bishop and King create a quintessential blues ballad, kicking off with Bishop’s ultra sleek guitar that blends perfectly into King’s powerful vocals. For blues purists, it doesn’t get any better. The song is a highlight on King’s incredible new album, Blues For A King, which crosses musical genres from blues to rock to soul and back again. Even next to such high wattage guests as Joe Louis Walker, Robben Ford, Junior Wells, Pat Travers & Elvin Bishop, King absolutely shines as she performs spectacular version of the blues classics “Gallows Pole” and “Hoodoo Blues Man” as well as the soul hit “Johnny Porter” (originally by The Temptations) plus two songs by British rock band Traffic, “Can’t Find My Way Home” and “Feelin’ Alright?.” The album closes with a powerful version of Etta James’s unforgettable “At Last,” which signals that, at long last, Shirley King is finally getting the attention and recognition she so richly deserves. == X-Ray Records == X-Ray Records is an imprint under the Cleopatra Records, Inc. label group that focuses on hip hop and modern R&B.; The imprint began in 2000 just as the label was starting to diversify after predominantly focusing on gothic and industrial music throughout the late ‘90s. It made a start with SX-10, the hip hop/metal hybrid featuring Sen Dog of Cypress Hill. Releases from KRS-One, Mellow Man Ace, Gravediggaz, Junior M.A.F.I.A. and Westside Connection followed. The imprint achieved a first for the Cleopatra family in 2005 when the album It's Not a Game by Bone Thugs-n-Harmony member Layzie Bone landed on the Billboard Top 100 chart. That attracted more talent to the roster including notorious hip hop outlaw DMX, P. Diddy prodigy Loon, Pastor Troy, Coolio, Afroman, and Vanilla Ice. In 2018, X-Ray Records staged another major foray into the world of hip hop with releases by Gunplay, Riff Raff, Onyx, Luniz, Black Sheep, Petey Pablo, Lil Reese, Ca$his and R&B; icon Case. The year culminated in one of the imprint's highest profile releases ever, the new studio album from Wu-Tang Clan member Ghostface Killah, The Lost Tapes, and two remix albums released simultaneously as The Ghost Files. In addition to well-established artists, the label has begun to partner with new and up-and- coming acts such as Reggie Mills, Young Syrup, ITSOKTOCRY, Angela Mazzanti, as well as several artists from Chief Keef’s Glo Gang roster including Lil Flash, Ballout and others. == Cleopatra Entertainment == Cleopatra Entertainment is the film division of Cleopatra Records. Beginning in 2015, the company has distributed, developed, and produced several films most of which have a strong horror and/or music component. The company has focused primarily on the home video market through partnerships with NY-based film distributor The Orchard as well as AMPED Music Distribution, and MVD Entertainment Group. However, recent projects have shown that the company is capable of theatrical distribution as well. Cleopatra Entertainment officially began in 2015 with the U.S. release of the documentary/concert film about German heavy metal band Scorpions called Forever And A Day. This was followed in August of the same year by the company's first major production, Alleluia! The Devil's Carnival, the second installment of the cult horror musical franchise from director Darren Lynn Bousman (director of several installments in the Saw ) and writer Terrance Zdunich (of Repo! The Genetic Opera ). In addition to financing the film, Cleopatra produced the Blu-ray and DVD releases and also released the official CD soundtrack, which included all of the musical numbers from the film featuring likes of Paul Sorvino, Barry Bostwick, David Hasselhoff, Ted Neeley, rap icon Tech N9ne, Emilie Autumn, Adam Pascal, Butcher Babies, Nivek Ogre, and more! In 2016, Cleopatra Entertainment released its second music documentary to the home video market, this one about UK punk band The Damned, called Don’t You Wish That We Were Dead, which premiered a year earlier at the SXSW Film Festival. Cleopatra Entertainment also purchased the vampire thriller Blood Trap, starring Gianni Capaldi , Costas Mandylor, and Vinnie Jones, and released it to the home video market in October of that year. Also in October 2016, Cleopatra brought the twisted romantic comedy StalkHer starring Australia's John Jarratt (of Wolf Creek) and Kaarin Fairfax, to US audiences. Finally, the company will also see a theatrical release for the heartwarming, real-life story of a man and his cat, A Street Cat Named Bob, based on the best-selling book of the same name by James Bowen. Coming productions for the company include more thrillers such as The Devil's Domain (starring Michael Madsen), The Black Room (starring Lin Shaye), and The 27 Club (based on the well-known \\"27 Club\\" legend). 2017 will also bring dramatic offerings including, Steven, the biopic of Smiths frontman Morrissey and, \\"Street Survivors\\", the harrowing true story of the 1977 plane crash that forever changed southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, co-written by Skynyrd drummer Artimus Pyle, one of the few members who survived the plane crash. ==See also== * List of record labels * List of electronic music record labels ==References== ==External links== * Official website * Allrecordlabels.com * Cleopatra Records Bandcamp page * * Category:Electronic music record labels Category:American independent record labels Category:Record labels established in 1992 Category:Goth record labels Category:Industrial record labels Category:Heavy metal record labels ","title":"Cleopatra Records"},{"id":"3249032","text":"Jonatan Cerrada Moreno (born 12 September 1985) is a Belgian singer. He won the first season of Nouvelle Star (the French edition of Pop Idol) in 2003 and represented France in the Eurovision Song Contest 2004. ==Personal life== Jonatan Cerrada Moreno was born in Liège, Belgium, and grew up in Ans with his four siblings (Julien, Rafaël, Audrey and Rachel) and his Spanish parents María Victoria Moreno, a secretary, and Valentín Cerrada, a mechanical technician. He was eight years old when he entered the Opéra Royal de Wallonie in Liège where he stayed until age fourteen. He speaks fluent French, Spanish, English and basic Indonesian. He currently lives in Bali. ==Professional career== Cerrada won the first season of Nouvelle Star in 2003. Soon after winning the competition, he released his debut single \\"Je voulais te dire que je t'attends\\", a revival of a song originally by Michel Jonasz, and then \\"Rien ne me changera\\". His debut album, Siempre 23, was released after that and was successful across France and Belgium. Cerrada represented France in the Eurovision Song Contest 2004 singing a power ballad song, \\"À chaque pas\\", and came 15th out of 24 finalist countries. Cerrada was invited to star as a guest in the Spanish comedy/drama Un Paso Adelante, which also aired in France with French dubbing, and he dubbed his own lines. Cerrada sang the soundtrack for the French edition of the film Robots - \\"Mon Paradis\\". Soon after that, his second album La Preuve du contraire was released. In September 2005, \\"Libre comme l'air\\" was released only in Belgium. In March 2006, it was confirmed his next single was to be \\"Ne m'en veux pas\\" which appeared on La Preuve du contraire as a duet with Ophélie Cassy. A new solo version was recorded but was never released. In February 2007, a year after his latest single \\"Ruban noir\\" (from La Preuve du contraire) became a major download hit without any specific promotion. It is sung partly in Spanish and is about the 11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings. In June/July 2007, he took the title role of Arthur Rimbaud in the semi-staged comedy musical Rimbaud, written by Richard Charest & Arnaud Kerane () Cerrada is no longer signed by the major record label that released his first two French albums. Instead, he started working on a Spanish album as independently. In May 2007, he created a new MySpace site Tercero, showcasing songs, all sung in Spanish, with a distinct Latin and R&B; style. In July 2007, he signed up to the Sellaband website aiming to find \\"believers\\" willing to buy \\"parts\\" (funding) the recording of his third album. Regularly appearing in the top three of Sellaband's charts, he managed to collect $25,000 (half of the required $50,000), before deciding to leave the website in October 2007. He stated that even though he had written the lyrics, he was not the composer of his proposed songs. The composer did not wish to give a percentage of earnings to Sellaband and was unwilling to proceed. His Sellaband blog also revealed his disappointment at being dropped by a major record company. On Sellaband, his profile, blog, and updates were in English. In January 2018, Cerrada released an Indonesian single entitled \\"Lelaki Lain Di Hati\\", written by Valiant Budi Yogi or well known as Vabyo. He felt challenged after his friend offered him to sing Indonesian song. This song became popular in Indonesia because it is rare for a foreign singer to release an Indonesian single.

Brazil has one of the richest bird diversities in the world. The avifauna of Brazil include a total of 1823 confirmed species of which 238 are endemic. Five have been introduced by humans, 78 are rare or vagrants, and four are extinct or extirpated. An additional 21 species are hypothetical (see below). Brazil hosts about 60% of the bird species recorded for all of South America. These numbers are still increasing almost every year, due to new occurrences, new species being described, or splits of existing species. About 10% of the bird species found in Brazil are, nonetheless, threatened. In June 2013 a simultaneous discovery of fifteen bird species in Brazil was announced, the first such since 1871, when August von Pelzeln described forty new species. The birds were from the families Corvidae, Thamnophilidae, Dendrocolaptidae, Tyrannidae, and Polioptilidae. Eleven of the new species are endemics of Brazil and four also inhabit Peru and Bolivia. Except as an entry is cited otherwise, the list of species is that of the South American Classification Committee (SACC) of the American Ornithological Society. The list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families, and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) are also those of the SACC.Remsen, J. V., Jr., J. I.

Opened on 17 December 1975, along with Kuznetsky Most as the segment which linked the Zhdanovskaya and Krasnopresnenskaya Lines into one. Like its neighbour, the station was a column tri-vault type, which had not been seen in Moscow since the 1950s. Arguably the most beautiful station on the Line, the architects Vdovin and Bazhenov took every effort to make it appear to have a 'classical' 19th century setting. The central hall lighting is created with stylised 19th century chandeliers with two rows of plafonds appearing like candles, while the side platforms have candlesticks with similar plafonds. The columns, covered with 'Koelga' white marble are decorated with palm leaf reliefs and the grey marble walls are decorated with brass measured insertions based on the works of the great Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. The grey granite floor completes the appearance of the masterpiece. Architecturally the station put the final stop to the functionality economy design of the 1960s and went against Nikita Khrushchev's policy of struggle to avoid decorative 'extras', which left the stations of 1958–59 greatly altered in their design. The station's original vestibule, with its magnificent cessoned ceiling from anodized aluminium (architects Demchinskiy and Kollesnikov) is situated under Pushkinskaya Square of the Boulevard ring, the centre of Moscow's nightlife, and is linked with subways to the square and to Tverskaya Street. In 1979 it was combined with the Gorkovskaya (now Tverskaya) station of the Zamoskvoretskaya Line. The opposite end was decorated with a bust of the great poet himself (architect — Shumakov), however in 1987 a pathway was opened to the underground vestibule of the two escalator cascades of the Chekhovskaya station of the Serpukhovsko-Timiryazevskaya Line. The bust was moved into a combined vestibule built into the office building of the newspaper Izvestia on the Strastnoi Boulevard of the Boulevard ring. When transferring between the stations it is possible to bypass the vestibule via the lyre fenced stairs leading from the middle of the columns. The transfer point, was originally named for the three writers and poets (Alexander Pushkin, Maxim Gorky, Anton Chekhov). In 1991, the original street Ulitsa Gorkova was renamed Tverskaya, and hence the station was also given this name. The transfer point is one of the busiest in Moscow; Pushkinskaya receives a daily load of 46,770 via the vestibules, 170,000 to Tverskaya and 212,000 to the Chekhovskaya station. ==External links== * Yuriy Gridchin's site * mymetro.ru * KartaMetro.info -- Station location and exits on Moscow map (English/Russian) Category:Moscow Metro stations Category:Railway stations in Russia opened in 1975 Category:Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya Line Category:Railway stations located underground in Russia ","title":"Pushkinskaya (Moscow Metro)"},{"id":"3249089","text":"The 218th Battalion, CEF, was a unit in the Canadian Expeditionary Force during the First World War.

A Court Order was enforced against the college for non-payment of rent, and the contents of the college were sold by auction, and the premises vacated.\\"Brief History of the Diocese of Clifton\\", Clifton Diocese Two years later, Henry Edward Manning was appointed Provost of Westminster and he established in Bayswater his community of the Oblates of St Charles. Errington was dubious of what he regarded as Manning's plan to create a clergy independent of the ordinary. His reservations were shared by the Cathedral Chapter and the Vicar General Canon Maguire. Wiseman did not appreciate such opposition. The estrangement was largely a matter of temperament. However it was grave enough for Errington to be deprived by Pope Pius IX of his coadjutorship with right of succession in July 1860.James, Serenhedd. George Erringtom and Roman Catholic Identity in Nineteent-Century England. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016 In 1860, and again in 1863, the Vatican offered him the archbishopric of Port of Spain, Trinidad, which he declined. When Wiseman died in 1865, the Chapter of Westminster proposed him as the first on the list of three candidates they sent to Rome, but Manning was appointed. Meanwhile he had been helping both Bishop Goss of Liverpool and Archbishop Cullen of Dublin with various administrative matters and ordinations. Goss asked him to take charge of the mission to the Isle of Man, and from 1865 to 1868 he was Parish Priest in Douglas. Manning recommended that the Vatican ask Errington to take on the task of preparing for the restoration of the hierarchy in Scotland,McClelland, Vincent Alan. \\"A Hierarchy for Scotland, 1868-1878\\", The Catholic Historical Review, vol. 56, no. 3, 1970, pp. 474–500. JSTOR but after considerable hesitation he declined. He took part in the First Vatican Council, where he opposed the Neo-ultramontanism of Manning. After that he was asked by Bishop Clifford of Clifton to teach at Prior Park, near Bath, where he died of severe bronchitis, still teaching on his deathbed, on 19 January 1886. In August 1856, Dr Errington founded St Boniface's Catholic College, Plymouth. In 1995, the school named one of their houses after him. ==References== ==Sources== * Paul Mould, ‘Errington, George (1804–1886)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 3 Jan 2008 ==Further reading== *James, Serenhedd.

The 219th recruited personnel from the counties of Halifax, Lunenburg, Queens, Shelburne, Yarmouth, Digby, Annapolis and Kings. The 85th Battalion, the first - and senior - unit of the Brigade, solicited enlistments from the entire province.

The 185th Battalion raised its complement of soldiers on Cape Breton Island, while the 193rd Battalion canvassed the six counties of northeastern Nova Scotia. The Brigade's four battalions trained at Camp Aldershot, near Kentville, throughout the summer of 1916. After sailing from Halifax on October 13, 1916, to England on RMS Olympic, the 219th Battalion was based at Witley Camp and later relocated to Bramshott. The battalion was absorbed into the 17th Reserve Battalion on January 23, 1917, although a number of men were transferred to the 85th around the same time.

Retrieved 27 December 2018) – drums and singer ==Career== The group was founded in November 1963 as an amateur band founded by Martin Murray. Its members were Murray (a hairdresser), his salon assistant Honey Lantree, her brother John, and two friends. Originally they called themselves the Sheratons.See the Honeycombs fan site; other sources, such as May & Phillips, call them The Sherabons. The group played dates in the West End of London, and at the Mildmay Tavern,The pub, once located at 130 Balls Pond Road, Islington, was closed in 2000. The address is now a supermarket. a North London pub. Among those attending an appearance of the band in February 1964 were aspiring songwriters Ken Howard and Alan Blaikley. Howard and Blaikley would become a prolific British songwriting team, but in 1964 they had just started their career. They got into conversation with the group, which appeared interested in a few songs the duo had just written. The group had already arranged an audition with indie record producer Joe Meek. The audition resulted in a recording of Howard and Blaikley's \\"Have I the Right?\\" Meek himself provided the B-side, \\"Please Don't Pretend Again\\". Meek used his apartment at 304 Holloway Road, Islington, as a recording studio. Three UK No. 1 hits were produced there: \\"Johnny Remember Me\\" by John Leyton, \\"Telstar\\" by The Tornados and \\"Have I the Right?\\" Conspicuous in \\"Have I the Right?\\" is the prominence of the drums, whose effect was enhanced by members of the group stamping their feet on the wooden stairs to the studio. Meek recorded the effect with five microphones he had fixed to the banisters with bicycle clips. For the finishing touch someone beat a tambourine directly onto a microphone. The recording was also somewhat sped up. \\"Have I the Right?\\" was released on 26 June 1964 on the Pye record label. Louis Benjamin (1922–1994), Pye's later chairman, renamed the group as \\"The Honeycombs\\", a pun on the drummer's name and her job as a hairdresser's assistant.New Musical Express, \\"Lifelines of the Chart Toppers: The Honeycombs\\", 28 August 1964, p. 9. The sales started slowly, but by the end of July the record started to climb the UK Singles Chart. Honey Lantree's status as a female drummer in a top band was as unusual then as it is now, and some questioned whether she was just a visual novelty, despite her genuine drumming ability. At the end of August the record reached No. 1. \\"Have I the Right?\\" was also a big success outside the UK, hitting No. 1 in Australia and Canada, No. 3 in Ireland, No. 5 in the US, and No. 2 in the Netherlands. Overall sales of the record reached a million. The Honeycombs also recorded a German version of the song: \\"Hab ich das Recht?\\" Both the English and the German versions reached No 21 in the German charts: the English one in October, the German one in November 1964. From then on Howard and Blaikley acted as the group's managers and also wrote their next singles, \\"Is It Because\\" and \\"Eyes\\". These records did not sell well. This also applied to their fourth single, \\"Something Better Beginning\\", written by Ray Davies from the Kinks. Soon after their first record had become a hit, the Honeycombs went on tour to the Far East and Australia, and were not able to promote their new records at home. The tour gained them a long-lasting popularity in Japan, however. Especially for the Japanese market the group produced a live album and a single, \\"Love in Tokyo\\". The group also made a lasting impression in Sweden, where they scored two No. 1 singles. The Honeycombs made many appearances on music television shows such as Top of the Pops, Ready Steady Go! (UK), Shindig! (US), and Beat-Club (Germany). The group also appeared in the 1965 film Pop Gear, miming \\"Have I the Right?\\" and \\"Eyes\\". In July 1965, British music magazine NME reported that it had been agreed in the London High Court that \\"Have I The Right?\\" was the work of Howard and Blaikley. Composer Geoff Goddard agreed to drop allegations that he, not they, had written the song. In August 1965 the group released, \\"That's the Way\\", with Honey Lantree sharing vocals with D'Ell (when on tour, Viv Prince of The Pretty Things took over the drumming). This record became their fourth British hit and reached No. 12\\\\. Its successor, \\"This Year Next Year\\", again with Lantree and D'Ell sharing vocals, did not reach the UK chart. D'Ell sang on all but the last single the group recorded. \\"Who Is Sylvia?\\" was an adaptation of Franz Schubert's song \\"An Sylvia\\".But Schubert's text is a translation from Shakespeare, while the Honeycombs' text is by Howard and Blaikley. \\"It's So Hard\\" was also recorded by Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich as \\"Hard to Love You\\". In April 1966 Denis D'Ell, Allan Ward and Peter Pye left the group. ==The (new) Honeycombs and afterwards== The group went on, with new lead singer, guitarist and keyboardist: *Colin Boyd (born Colin Nicholas Nicol, 4 June 1946, Combe, near Bath, Somerset) – Guitar and vocals. Later he formed Honeybus and changed his name to Colin Hare. *Rod Butler (born Rodney Butler, 27 May 1944, Mill Hill, London) – Lead guitar and vocals. Later he played with the Lemmings and subsequently the College Boys, formed by ex-Honeycomb Martin Murray. Butler later joined forces with D'Ell and formed Zarabanda and later still played in Violinski, with Mik Kaminski of the ELO *Eddy Spence – Keyboards and vocals *John Lantree – Bass guitar *Honey Lantree – Drums and vocals This line-up released the group's last single, \\"That Loving Feeling\\", a group original penned by the new lead singer Colin Boyd. It failed to chart. Late in the year the Honeycombs toured Japan where a live LP was recorded in Tokyo. The original vinyl LP is hard to locate these days, as is the CD re- issue by Repertiore Records in the 1990s (Rep 4180-WZ). The full tracklist is - 1\\\\. Colour Slide, 2. I'll Go Crazy, 3. She's About A Mover, 4. There's Always Me, 5. Wipe Out, 6. Lucille, 7. If You Should, 8. Have I The Right, 9. Goldfinger, 10. Kansas City, 11. My Prayer, 12. What'd I Say. A few of these tracks have made their way onto video streaming sites, including an extremely rare Japanese-only \\"Christmas\\" single recorded during their tour of that country, coupling \\"Santa Clause Is Back In Town\\" with \\"Silent Night\\". On 3rd February 1967, the Honeycombs record producer Joe Meek committed suicide at his recording studios / flat on the Holloway Road after an altercation with his landlady who also died. After this, the Honeycombs had no more records issued and the band broke up. In 1972 Peter Pye, using a little alteration of his middlename Frank, started a brief solo career as Peter Franc with a single for Blue Mountain label, both compositions were actually credited to Peter F. Pye. It was followed by two albums and three singles for the Dawn label, the latest being a 1975 single not available on his albums. In the 1990s founding member Martin Murray toured the cabaret circuit with a group called 'Martin Murray's Honeycombs'. Another line-up including Honey Lantree, Peter Pye and Denis D'Ell also successfully toured from 1991 onwards. John Lantree later rejoined this line-up. In 1999 record producer Russell C. Brennan asked D'Ell, Honey and John Lantree and Pye to record \\"Live and Let Die\\", on the Future Legend Records compilation, Cult Themes from the '70s Vol. 2. This compilation also featured Glenda Collins, another Joe Meek artist. Singer Dennis D’Ell died on 6 July 2005 at the age of 61 and drummer Honey Lantree died on 23 December 2018, aged 75. ==Discography== ===Singles=== ====UK==== *\\"Have I the Right?\\" (Ken Howard/Alan Blaikley) b/w \\"Please Don't Pretend Again\\" (Joe Meek/Peter Lawrence) (26 June 1964) – UK No. 1 *\\"Is It Because\\" (Ken Howard/Alan Blaikley) b/w \\"I'll Cry Tomorrow\\" (Joe Meek) (9 October 1964) – UK No. 38 *\\"Eyes\\" (Ken Howard/Alan Blaikley) b/w \\"If You've Got To Pick a Baby\\" (Joe Meek) (27 November 1964) *\\"Something Better Beginning\\" (Ray Davies) b/w \\"I'll See You Tomorrow\\" (Ken Howard/Alan Blaikley) (19 March 1965) – UK No. 39 *\\"That's the Way\\" (Ken Howard/Alan Blaikley) b/w \\"Can't Get Through to You\\" (Joe Meek) (9 July 1965) – UK No. 12 *\\"This Year Next Year\\" (Ken Howard/Alan Blaikley) b/w \\"Not Sleeping Too Well Lately\\"(Joe Meek) (12 November 1965) *\\"Who Is Sylvia\\" (Howard/Blaikley) b/w \\"How Will I Know\\" (Joe Meek) (18 February 1966) *\\"It's So Hard\\" (Ken Howard/Alan Blaikley) b/w \\"I Fell in Love\\" (Joe Meek) (15 July 1966) *\\"That Loving Feeling\\" (Colin Boyd) b/w \\"Should a Man Cry\\" (Joe Meek) (23 September 1966) ====US==== *\\"Have I the Right?\\" b/w \\"Please Don't Pretend Again\\" – Interphon 7707 1964 – US No. 5 *\\"I Can't Stop\\" b/w \\"I'll Cry Tomorrow\\" – Interphon 7713 1964 – US No. 48 *\\"That's the Way\\" b/w \\"Color Slide\\" – Interphon 7716 1965 *\\"Something Better Beginning\\" b/w \\"I'll See You Tomorrow\\" – Warner Bros. 5634 1965 *\\"I Can't Get Through to You\\" b/w \\"That's the Way\\" – Warner Bros. 5655 1965 *\\"Who Is Sylvia\\" b/w \\"How Will I Know\\" – Warner Bros. 5803 1966 ===Albums=== *The Honeycombs (Released in the US as Here Are the Honeycombs) (UK Pye NPL 18097 / US Interphon IN-88001, 25 September 1964) – US No. 147 **\\"Colour Slide\\" / \\"Once You Know\\" / \\"Without You It Is Night\\" / \\"That's the Way\\" / \\"I Want to Be Free\\" / \\"How the Mighty Have Fallen\\" / \\"Have I the Right?\\" / \\"Just a Face in the Crowd\\" / \\"Nice While It Lasted\\" / \\"Me from You\\" / \\"Leslie Anne\\" / \\"She's Too Way Out\\" / \\"It Ain't Necessarily So\\" / \\"This Too Shall Pass Away\\" *All Systems – Go!

Based in Toronto, Ontario, the unit began recruiting in early 1916 in York County, Ontario. After sailing to England in April 1917, the battalion was absorbed into the 3rd Reserve Battalion on May 18, 1917. The 220th (12th York Rangers) Battalion, CEF had one officer commanding: Lieutenant-Colonel B. H. Brown. A newspaper report entitled \\"Active Campaign to Fill York Battalion / Energetic Measures to Secure Young Men Who Are Still Eligible\\" appeared in the Toronto World on 05 April 1916 discussed the recruiting efforts to date: \\"Practically every business and professional man in Newmarket yesterday pledged his hearty support to the work of raising recruits for the 220th York Overseas Battalion, and today an active campaign will be undertaken to raise the Newmarket end of it in record time. Following the campaign put up by Lieut.-Col. Clarke, it was at one time feared that difficulty would be experienced in getting the men, but latest reports are reassuring. Scarboro has been one of the most active of the municipalities in the county in raising recruits, but at least 40 young unmarried men are still eligible for active service and can be spared without working any hardship on the farmers themselves. These figures, it is said, can be easily duplicated in every other municipality in the county. Lieut.-Col.

At Aurora, nine recruits signed up and seven at Newmarket. The end of the week will see 50 men enlisted at Newmarket in the 220th York Rangers.\\" Recruiting had slowed according to another report appearing in the Toronto World on April 21st: \\"At a meeting of the headquarters staff of the 220th York Rangers' Overseas Battalion held last night in St. Paul's Hall reports indicated that recruiting in the country districts is proceeding slowly. About 200 have enlisted in the 220th to date, and unseasonable weather is blamed for the poor showing. Newsmarket, Runnymede and Stouffville are the best recruiting points.\\" A recruiting rally was held on May 30th, 1916, as reported by the Toronto Star the following day: \\"The 220th York Rangers held a recruiting rally in Ramsden Park last night, Capt. C. F. Mills and Lieut. Pickup delivered addresses. The former was very fair, and complimented the married men on what they had done, but claimed that the unmarried men spent their time in the pool rooms and evaded recruiting officers. The bugle band supplied music.\\" In 1920 the perpetuation of the 220th Battalion was assigned to the York Rangers. Because of amalgamations, the perpetuation is now carried on by the York Rangers' successor, the Queen's York Rangers (1st American Regiment) (RCAC). ==References== *Meek, John F. Over the Top!

He was the leading all-rounder for Derbyshire between the wars and at his peak probably the most deadly bowler on a sticky wicket Derbyshire ever produced, owing to his perfect length and ability to turn the ball back from the off. His pace was almost medium and even the most fleet-footed of batsmen could not hit him easily on a bad pitch; however, his lack of flight and variety made him less effective on good pitches. Townsend was also an enterprising middle order batsman, who set a longstanding record for most centuries for Derbyshire in a season in 1933. ==Career for Derbyshire== Townsend was born at Long Eaton, Derbyshire. He did not play cricket in his youth and was only attracted to the game by watching Nottinghamshire's star batsman George Gunn. Townsend first played for his native county Derbyshire in the 1922 season and obtained a regular place in the 1924 season. In the 1925 season Townsend scored over 800 runs at an average of 18. These modest figures, with 59 as his best score, placed Townsend fourth in the county's averages. In the 1926 season after a very slow start Townsend developed as a bowler in August on a number of treacherous pitches. He took 6 for 32 against Nottinghamshire at Ilkeston and 9 for 36 for two innings against Northamptonshire at Chesterfield. In the 1927 season, with Derbyshire rising to fifth in the Championship, Townsend's medium pace off-break bowling was close to the top of the averages. He took 5 for 29 on a sticky wicket against the formidable Lancashire side and 5 for 42 against Warwickshire. In the 1928 season, his deadliness on sticky wickets was so pronounced he topped the county bowling table with 101 wickets, including 13 against Sussex, and his batting developed so much he edged past 1000 runs with a best score of 98. In the 1929 season, despite only one five-wicket return, he again managed 100 wickets. He was chosen for a second-string tour of the West Indies but did nothing of note. The 1930s saw Townsend's batting bloom due to improved technique. Having not scored a century before the 1930 season, he hit four alone this year, and after a decline in the 1931 season, did even better as a batsman in the 1932 season. At the same, time, so deadly was his bowling on the many sticky wickets than he was in the top ten of the 1931 national bowling averages and took 117 wickets in 1932. In the 1933 season, Townsend's batting was so successful that he scored over 2,000 runs, including innings of 233 against Leicestershire at Loughborough, 172 not out against Warwickshire at Derby, and 151 against Essex at Leyton. He took 100 wickets for 18.71 each and was second only to Verity in deadliness on the sticky wickets of May and June. His best performances were 9 for 82 against Somerset at Ilkeston, 10 for 54 against Hampshire at Portsmouth and 14 for 90 against Gloucestershire at Chesterfield. However, his limitations on the hard pitches in July and August meant he only reached the rare \\"double\\" of 2000 runs and 100 wickets in the last match. Nonetheless, he was named as a Cricketer of the Year by Wisden and toured India, though again meeting with little success. He played in three of the Tests but did not show the skill required. In the following three years, as Derbyshire attained the greatest heights they ever have in the County Championship. Townsend's bowling declined steadily. By the 1935 season he was rarely given substantial spells of bowling but still could do well on a sticky pitch, as at Edgbaston in the 1936 season when he took twelve Warwickshire wickets. Along with Dennis Smith he was the indispensable backbone of the batting, which was that year still very weak for a champion county. His best score that year was 182 not out against Sussex at Chesterfield. Townsend played a season with Auckland in 1934/1935, and after his batting declined so badly in 1939 that he scored fewer than 700 runs for an average of only 19, Townsend settled in New Zealand permanently. ==Career in New Zealand== Townsend went to New Zealand to work as a joiner and cabinet- maker. In 1954 a group of cricket enthusiasts in Nelson asked him to coach there, and he became the driving force behind the development of cricket in the district.Wisden 1994, p. 1354. Nelson held the Hawke Cup for 28 defences from 1958 to 1965. Most observers during his later years as a coach there saw Townsend as the reason why the city produced an unusual proportion of New Zealand's Test cricketers in the latter part of the twentieth century. Leslie Townsend died in Nelson in February 1993 at the age of 89. ==References* First-class batting * First-class bowling Category:1903 births Category:1993 deaths Category:English cricketers Category:England Test cricketers Category:Auckland cricketers Category:Derbyshire cricketers Category:Wisden Cricketers of the Year Category:People from Long Eaton Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:Players cricketers Category:North v South cricketers Category:Northumberland cricketers Category:English cricketers of 1919 to 1945 Category:H.

The plot centres on a 13-year-old farm boy named Tom who lives in the countryside of The county, loosely based on the English county of Lancashire, where the author residesBBC with his large family. As Tom is the seventh son of a seventh son he is able to see things others cannot, such as boggarts, ghasts, ghosts and others. ==Plot== Tom Ward has lived his whole life in the county (loosely based on the English county of Lancashire). Because he is the seventh son of a seventh son and thus has the ability to see ghosts and fight other supernatural beings, his parents have apprenticed him to the Spook, a cloaked man named John Gregory. The Spook travels the County fighting troublesome creatures such as boggarts, ghosts, ghasts and witches for the people who need these things gone. Tom will have to learn how the Spook fights \\"The Dark\\", so that he may one day become a Spook as well. The Spook tells Tom that most of his other apprentices have failed due to them being cowardly, disobedient, or deceased. It is revealed that one of the deceased was Billy Bradley, who had his finger bitten off and died from loss of blood while fighting a particularly dangerous boggart . Tom goes to live in the Spook's house in Chipenden. This house is protected from unwanted visitors by a boggart, with whom the Spook has made a contract which states that as long as the house is standing, the boggart must guard it (as well as cook and clean for the Spook and his apprentices). Tom is sent out on an errand to pick up some food for the house. He is given a strict warning by the Spook: Do not talk to women wearing pointy shoes. On his way home, some boys about the same age as Tom threaten to beat him unless he gives them some food. Tom refuses and the boys are about to beat him when suddenly a girl in pointy shoes shows up and scares them away by telling them a certain person is back. The mysterious girl's name is Alice, and she is a relative of some of the most dangerous witches in the county: Mother Malkin and Bony Lizzie. == Characters == * Thomas Ward, apprentice to John Gregory and the seventh son of the seventh son. * John Gregory, the Spook for the County who mentors Thomas.

Adams Media Corp 1992, 1996, 2010 Verbal abuse is a maladaptive mechanism that anyone can display occasionally, such as during times of high stress or physical discomfort. For some people, it is a pattern of behaviors used intentionally to control or manipulate others or to get revenge. ==Types== In schools and in everyday life, a person may engage in verbal abuse—bullying (which often has a physical component)—to gain status as superior to the person targeted and to bond with others against the target. Usually, the bully knows no other way to connect emotionally with others.Controlling People: How to Recognize, Understand, and Deal with People Who Try to Control You, Patricia Evans pg. 191. 2002 by Adams Media Corp In romantic relationships, the verbal abuser may be responding to the partner's \\"separateness\\", i.e., independent thoughts, views, desires, feelings, expressions (even of happiness) which the abuser views as a threat, irritant or attack.Controlling People: How to Recognize, Understand, and Deal with People Who Try to Control You, Patricia Evans, Adams Media Corp 2002 Some people believe the abuser has low self-esteem and then so, attempts to place their victim in a similar position, i.e., to believe negative things about themselves. Because of the abuser's need for dominance and unwillingness to accept their partner as an equal, the verbal abuser is compelled to negate the perceptions of the partner, about the abuse, which causes more psychological pain to the victim. This is also known as gas- lighting or Jekyll and Hyde-like behavior, because the abuser keeps the target of abuse off-balance with their hot-and-cold unpredictable behavior. This confusion adds to the pain caused by psychological abuse and keeps the victim off-balance.Men Who Hate Women and the Women Who Love Them, Susan Foreword, Bantam, 2002 Anyone can experience verbal abuse. Typically, in romantic or family relationships, verbal abuse increases in intensity and frequency over time. After exposure to verbal abuse, victims may develop clinical depression. The person targeted by verbal abuse over time may succumb to any stress- related illness. Verbal abuse creates emotional pain and mental anguish in its target.

However, the first Bluebell Railway trains had run on the last day of the 1962 season using the disused eastern side (electrified services only used Platform 2). Between 1960 and 1962 Bluebell Railway services had terminated at Bluebell Halt - a temporary station about half mile to the south. As a junction station it was the busiest station on the line in terms of services but arguably one of the quieter for passengers. The station lies about from the village of Horsted Keynes itself. 1930s ambience of Platform 5 Since being taken over by the Bluebell the station has become one of the most popular stations in UK preservation, and has won many awards. It has been restored under a 1930s theme with period newspaper headlines on boards by the buffet and adverts of the period. With five platforms it is the largest preserved heritage railway station in the UK. It is the crossing place for services when two trains are operating and hosts many events each year for steam enthusiasts. It is also the home of the line's Carriage and Wagon department. The Bluebell Railway plans to eventually make this station a junction once again if plans to extend toward Ardingly are realised, creating something rare within UK preservation, a junction station where both lines are operated by preservationists. ==Listed buildings== The main station building, the signal box and an engine house to the south of the station are all Grade II Listed buildings.

This is the version in Hong Kong. The Schindler Group is a Swiss multinational company which manufactures escalators, moving walkways, and elevators worldwide, founded in Switzerland in 1874. Schindler produces, installs, maintains and modernizes elevators and escalators in many types of buildings including residential, commercial and high-rise buildings. The company is present in more than 140 countries and employs more than 58,000 persons worldwide. The production facilities are located in Brazil, China, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland, India and the United States. All operations and subsidiaries of Schindler Group are organised into Schindler Holding Ltd. (, ), which is publicly traded on SIX Swiss Exchange. ==Company history== The company was founded in Switzerland in 1874, by Robert Schindler and Eduard Villiger who established the collective joint partnership Schindler & Villiger. Shortly thereafter, a mechanical engineering workshop was built on an island in the river Reuss in Lucerne, Switzerland, for the production of lifting equipment and machines of all types. Schindler founded the first foreign subsidiary in Berlin (Germany) in 1906. Thereafter, the company expanded continuously and mainly throughout Europe. In 1980 Schindler founded the first Western industrial joint venture in the People's Republic of China. With the takeover of Atlas in Brazil in 1999 Schindler became a major market player in South America. Schindler entered the North American elevator market with the purchase of Toledo-based Haughton Elevator Company in 1979 - briefly branding their products as Schindler-Haughton. In 1989, the company dramatically increased its presence in the United States after acquiring the Elevator/Escalator division of Westinghouse, one of the largest producers of elevators and escalators at the time. Currently, Schindler Elevator Corporation, the United States operations of Schindler Group, is based in Morristown, New Jersey. In February 2007, Schindler, along with competitors Otis Elevator Co., ThyssenKrupp, Kone, and Mitsubishi Elevator Europe were fined by the European Union for a price-fixing cartel. Schindler was fined 144 million euros, or about $189.3 million US dollars. Since 2011, Schindler have sponsored Solar Impulse, a solar-powered aircraft. Schindler have also developed the technology solution Schindler Ahead, which uses big data analysis to predict maintenance needs. In 2019, Schindler was awarded a multi- year contract to replace and install escalators in four downtown stations, for the Market Street Escalators Renovation Project of the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District . ==Destination control systems== ===Schindler's Miconic 10=== The company's name for their proprietary control system, was introduced in 1995. It was the industry's first example of control system now known as \\"hall call\\" destination system. The system features keypads and LED screens instead of hall button stations whereby riders enter their desired floor before entering an elevator car. The system then directs the rider to a specific elevator car, while grouping riders traveling to nearby floors together. Schindler claims this minimizes the number of stops, and decreases congestion and travel time—especially during peak traffic periods. The system was continuously further developed and new functions were amended, eventually evolving in systems which guarantee highly efficient and energy-saving traffic management. Especially in high rise buildings, traffic-management systems like Miconic 10 allow building designers to maximize rentable space and transportation efficiency. Moreover, access control becomes feasible. ==Accidents== * On November 29, 2004, a Schindler elevator in Nagoya descended while the door was still open. Nobody was injured in this incident. Investigation found that elevator's firmware \\"TV60 v1.1\\" had a bug that opens the door when elevator starts moving. * On April 22, 2006, three passengers were trapped in the elevator in Hachioji, Tokyo, after the elevator's door opened while it was ascending.

A meristic (countable trait) can be used to describe a particular species of fish, or used to identify an unknown species. Meristic traits are often described in a shorthand notation called a meristic formula. Meristic characters are the countable structures occurring in series (e.g. myomeres, vertebrae, fin rays) in fish. These characters are among the characters most commonly used for differentiation of species and populations. In the salmonids, scale counts have been most widely used for the differentiation of populations within species. In rainbow and steelhead trout the most notable differences among populations occur in counts of scales. Meristic characters are used in many other fields, such as in botany or in zoology. Meristic comparison is used in phenetic and cladistic analysis. ==Meristic analysis== A meristic study is often a difficult task, as counting the features of a fish is not as easy as it may appear. Many meristic analyses are performed on dead fish that have been preserved in alcohol. Meristic traits are less easily observed on living fish, though it is possible. On very small fish, a microscope may be required. Ichthyologists follow a basic set of rules when performing a meristic analysis, to remove as much ambiguity as possible. The specific practice, however, may vary depending on the type of fish. The methodology for counting meristic traits should be described by the specialist who performs the analysis. ==Meristic formula== This a shorthand method of describing the way the bones (rays) of a bony fish's fins are arranged, comparable to the floral formula for flowers. Spine counts are given in Roman numerals, e.g. XI-XIV. Ray counts are given in Arabic numerals, e.g. 11-14. The meristic formula of the dusky spinefoot (Siganus luridus) is: D, XIV+10; A, VII+8-9; P, 16-17; V, I+3+I; GR, 18-22 This means the fish has 14 spiny rays (bones) in the first part of its dorsal fin (D), followed by 10 soft rays. A means the Anal fin, P means Pectoral (fins near the gills and eyes where 'arms' would be), V are the ventral or pelvic fins (equivalent to 'legs') C represents the caudal (tail), not indicated in this example. GR is gill raker count (see below) ==Vertebral counts== The number of bones in the backbone is a feature which can also be used to classify fish species. Usually all the vertebrae are counted. Vertebral counts may be split into abdominal (those associated with the body cavity) and caudal (tail) vertebrae. If there are sutures in the urostyle, components are counted, otherwise the urostyle is usually counted as one vertebra. ==Gill raker counts== The number of gill rakers on the first gill arch can also be used to identify a fish species. Rakers are counted for the upper and lower limbs of the gill arch, and a raker at the joint of the upper and lower limbs is counted as of the lower. Counts for the upper and lower limbs are separated by a + sign and ranges are bracketed, e.g., GR: 3 + (4-5). ==See also== *Morphometrics ==References== ==External links== * Chase, P. D.

He did the hat-trick twice in 1937, and was picked to play for England in 1938. He bowled well on a dusty wicket at Headingley, although his figures were hurt by fielding errors, and that winter went to South Africa. In 1939, Wright advanced so much that he was named one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year and produced two sensational performances: sixteen for 80 against Somerset, and nine for 47 on a dusty wicket at Bristol, against Gloucestershire. Wright also batted well enough to score 490 runs, and had made 103 for once out in 1936 against Warwickshire, but his batting declined after World War II. Though he became fixed amongst the tail order, he did make 66 at number 11 in 1955 against Warwickshire. He served in the Army during World War II, and the loss of several of England's dry-wicket bowlers to the War meant he became an automatic choice for the 1946–47 Ashes series. == Australia 1946–47 == Wright was seen as England's trump card when he arrived in Australia, but had trouble with his no balls due to his odd run up \\"He waves his arms widely, and rocks on his legs like a small ship pitching and tossing in a fairly heavy sea. Whenever he bowls in Australia there are people who whistle and cat-call as he goes through his strange approach to the stumps.\\"O'Reilly, p. 28 Jack Fingleton called the no- ball \\"Wright's curse...He's probably bowled more of these than any other spinner in history\\",Fingleton, p. 67 \\"On at least four occasions he was convinced he had Bradman in his bag but it was not to be. Wright, I believe was very keen to secure such a verdict over Bradman, who only once has been dismissed l.b.w. during his Anglo-Australian Test career\\".Cary, p. 63 In the end he was overbowled and expensive. Of particular note is that Wright was the biggest wicket-taker on either side with 23 wickets – five more than any other bowler – but with the high average of 43.04. He was also the chief first–class wicket-taker of the 1946–47 season – 51 wickets (33.31) – and bowled just over a third of England's overs in the Tests; 246.3 compared to 240.2 by Alec Bedser and 246.5 by the rest.Cary, p. 57 In the First Test at Brisbane he took 5/167 on a flat wicket in Australia's 645 and suffered in this and the next three Tests as the England captain Wally Hammond set stereotyped defensive fields and was loath to take advice. In the Second Test at Sydney Wright (1/169) “bowled beautifully with the most wretched luck”, in one over \\"On four occasions Hammond, usually most undemonstrative, threw his hands in the air as the ball beat Bradman and shaved the stumps, and in between these near dismissals there was a confident appeal for leg before wicket.Cary, p. 60 \\"He continually rapped the pads with his straight one, and when the decision went against him, his face clouded with puzzled dismay.\\" In the Third Test at Melbourne Bradman tried to hit a straight ball to leg, but missed and was hit on the top of his pads plumb in front of the stumps. Wright and Evans appealed, but Bradman was given not out. However, a cameraman took a series of photographs of the delivery and \\"the camera appears to give a different verdict\\".Cary, p. 1 Finally in the Fifth Test at Sydney Wright found things turning his way. The new captain Norman Yardley was keen to discuss field placings with his professional cricketers.Cary, p. 84 He changed them as each batsmen came in and gave Wright a field of close catchers instead of trying to save runs.Ray Lindwall (1954) Flying Stumps, Marlin Books. p. 44. At the start of each Test, Wright would receive telegrams and letters from well-wishers who had lamented his bad luck \\"Never a match went by in which he did not hopelessly defeat the defences of the leading run-getters. Times out of number he had Barnes, Bradman, Hassett and their like groping forward hypnotised by the magic of his spinning witchcraft\\". Wright bowled unchanged for nearly two hours and took the wickets of Don Bradman, who came down the wicket, misjudged the spin and bowled for 12, and Keith Miller taken by Jack Ikin at slip. Australia started the fourth day on 189/4 and Wright bowled unchanged for 11 overs. Alec Bedser shut up his end and conceded only 15 runs while Wright span his way through the Australian batting with a spell of 5/42 with Lindsay Hassett, Colin McCool, Don Tallon, Ray Lindwall and George Tribe all falling to catches close to the wicket. Wright finished with 7/105 and only Ron Hamence (31 not out) could play him. Australia were dismissed for 253, but England still lost the Test. The turning point was when Bill Edrich dropped Bradman off Wright in the second innings for 2, the Australian captain made 63, Wright was hit for 2/93 and Australia won by 5 wickets.Wisden – ENGLAND v AUSTRALIA 1946–47. Espncricinfo.com. Retrieved on 8 July 2018. == England 1947–50 == In 1947, with the dry pitches suiting him, proved Wright's best season as he took 177 wickets, including 10/175 against South Africa at Lord's. However, the following two years were plagued by injury and Wright did little in the Tests, but he showed many times that he was still the most dangerous English bowler in dry weather – especially in terms of ability to dismiss top batsmen. == Australia 1950–51 == Wright toured Australia again for the 1950-51 Ashes series, but still suffered from bad luck and no balls. In the First Test at Brisbane He bowled a typical over to Neil Harvey, with two long hops, which Harvey cracked into the square-leg fence, but then had him groping at a googly that turned so fiercely that it missed both bat and stumps, \\"a real pearl that morally bowled Harvey all the way\\".O'Reilly, p. 26 The following ball had Wright appealing for lbw, but it was turned down as it turned so much that it would have missed the stumps. In the final innings Wright was last man in at 77/9 with England needing another 115 runs to win. He helped Len Hutton add 45 runs for the last wicket, managing to hold a straight bat up to the few balls he was left to face until the last four balls from Jack Iverson before lunch. He kept out the first three, but spooned the last to Ray Lindwall at square leg and was out for 2. Batting again in the Third Test at Sydney Wright was run out for a duck by his Kent team-mate Godfrey Evans, tripping over his bat and pulling a muscle as he rushed home. As a result, he fielded only for a few overs before he had to retire from the game on the only spinning wicket of the series. With Trevor Bailey's thumb broken by Ray Lindwall England were reduced to three bowlers and lost by an innings.Fingleton, pp. 141–146O'Reilly, pp. 74–83 Wright recovered for the Fourth Test at Adelaide and took 4/99 with only Arthur Morris, a noted player of spin, able to master him.Fingleton, pp. 174–178O'Reilly, pp. 103–107 In the England innings he joined Len Hutton at 219/9 and made 14 of their last wicket stand of 53 as the Yorkshire batsman carried his bat for 156 not out. == Later Career 1951–57 == Wright ended the series with 11 wickets (45.45) and his Test career came to an end with 7 further wickets in New Zealand (25.57). In order to regain supremacy in international cricket, England captains began to change to tactics that emphasised reducing the ability for batsmen to score. In this context, Wright was an expensive luxury. In 1951 Wright was never at his best in a damp summer, and on the hard wickets of 1952 his wickets cost six runs more than in 1947 or 1949. However, in August 1953, Wright became Kent's first professional captain, and in contrast to Eric Hollies the job seemed to help his bowling, for in 1954 with pitches totally unsuited he took 105 wickets and in 1955 he had one of his best seasons. At the Oval he led Kent to an unexpected victory over Surrey when that county appeared certain to win. In 1956, however Wright did not take fifty wickets, though once against Middlesex he bowled at his best: Wisden commented, \\"most of his eight victims had not been born when Wright entered first-class cricket twenty-four years ago and they had no answer to his whipping leg-breaks and googlies\\". At the beginning of 1957, Wright said he did not wish to be considered for the captaincy in his second benefit year, and in mid-July he decided to retire. A review of his career was provided in the article \\"Googly Bowlers and Captains Retire\\" in the 1958 Wisden. After retiring as a player, he became coach at Charterhouse School until 1971. ==References== ==Cited sources== * Clif Cary (1948) Cricket Controversy, Test matches in Australia 1946–47, T.

It is about a beastly, unthinking laborer known as Yank, the protagonist of the play, as he searches for a sense of belonging in a world controlled by the rich. At first, Yank feels secure as he stokes the engines of an ocean liner, and is highly confident in his physical power over the ship's engines and his men. However, when the rich daughter of an industrialist in the steel business refers to him as a \\"filthy beast\\", Yank undergoes a crisis of identity and so starts his mental and physical deterioration. He leaves the ship and wanders into Manhattan, only to find he does not belong anywhere—neither with the socialites on Fifth Avenue, nor with the labor organizers on the waterfront. In a fight for social belonging, Yank's mental state disintegrates into animalistic, and in the end he is defeated by an ape in which Yank's character has been reflected. The Hairy Ape is a portrayal of the impact industrialization and social class has on the dynamic character Yank. ==Characters== * Bob \\"Yank\\" Smith — Man who works on a ship. He is a leader among the other workers and finds himself rebelling against the authoritarian upper class he feels does not appreciate his hard work. * Paddy — An aged ship worker. He is able to see the monotony of the work and is seemingly aware of the hierarchy of capitalist society. He could be seen as symbolizing the voice of reason and disappears midway through the play as Yank begins his rebellious quest. * Long — Another ship worker who accompanies Yank to Fifth Avenue where his initial act of rebelling against the upper class takes place. * Mildred Douglas— A young, wealthy socialite who faints at the sight of Yank working in the ship. Terrified of his behavior and appearance, she calls him a “filthy beast” inciting his rebellion against the upper class. * A Secretary of an Organization — Works in a Labor Union and dismisses Yank’s ideas of violent rebellion in favor of peaceful strikes and the passing out of pamphlets. ==Plot== The play is divided into eight scenes. * Scene 1: In the firemen's forecastle of a cruise ship that has just sailed from New York for a trip across the Atlantic Ocean. Off-duty men are talking and singing drunkenly. Yank, portrayed as a leader among the men, is confident in his strength to fuel the machinery of the ship and the world. He shows particular contempt toward two other firemen: Long, an Englishman with socialist leanings, and Paddy, an old Irishman who reflects wistfully on the days of wind-powered sailing ships. * Scene 2: Mildred Douglas (a steel tycoon's daughter) and her aunt are talking above deck on the ship whilst sunbathing. They argue over Mildred's desire to do social work, ending only when two officers come to escort her below decks for her planned visit to the ship's stokehole. Her aunt does not understand why Mildred desires to help the poor. She ends up going below deck regardless. * Scene 3: In the stokehole, Yank and the other firemen take pride in their daily work. Yank does not notice Mildred when she enters, and instead shouts threats toward the unseen engineer ordering the men to keep coaling the engines. The men stop to turn when she enters. Confused as to why they have stopped working, he turns to see Mildred; she is so shocked by his attitude and appearance that she calls him a filthy beast and faints. * Scene 4: In the firemen's forecastle yet again. Yank is mulling over the incident in the stokehole. The other men try to understand his fury by questioning him and asking if he is in love. Yank is infuriated at Mildred for claiming that he resembles a hairy ape. He becomes enraged and tries to charge after Mildred in revenge. However, his men wrestle him to the ground before he can even reach the door. * Scene 5: Three weeks later, on Fifth Avenue in New York, the ship has returned from its cruise. Yank and Long argue over how best to attack the upper class while admiring how clean the city is. Still obsessing with avenging himself against Mildred, Yank rudely accosts several churchgoers that come out into the streets as Long flees the scene. Yank punches a gentleman in the face and is arrested shortly thereafter. * Scene 6: The following night at the prison on Blackwell's Island, Yank has begun serving a 30-day sentence. Seeing the prison as a zoo, he tells the other inmates of how he wound up there. One of them tells him about the Industrial Workers of the World and suggests that he think about joining. Enraged by the thought of Mildred and her father again, Yank starts to bend the bars of his cell in an attempt to escape, but the guards retaliate in force. * Scene 7: A month later, Yank visits the local IWW office upon his release from prison and joins the group. The local members are happy to have him in their ranks at first because not many ship's firemen have joined. However, when he expresses his desire to blow up the Steel Trust, they suspect him of working for the government and throw him out. In the streets, Yank comes in contact with a policeman, who shows no interest in arresting him and tells him to move along. * Scene 8: The following evening, Yank visits the zoo. He sympathizes with a gorilla, thinking they are one and the same. He releases the animal from his cage and approaches it to introduce himself as if they were friends. The gorilla attacks Yank, fatally crushing his ribs, and throws Yank into the cage where he dies. ==Existentialism== One common analysis of the play reads it as an Existentialist piece in reference to the protagonist himself experiencing an existential crisis. Yank believed himself to be the sole provider for the ocean liner; he was content because he believed his work was worth something. When he is called a “filthy beast” by Mildred in scene three, he begins to rebel against the upper class that he believes relies solely on him. After the insult, it became evident to Yank just what little worth he was to them, thus inciting his rebellion against them. However, he soon finds that most of the people he rebels against do not give him a second thought. His entire existence is so minuscule to them, as seen on Fifth Avenue is scene five, that his act of rebellion goes unnoticed. Yank finds that it is impossible to rebel against the entirety of the upper class because there is no actual tangible thing for him to rebel against. His struggle fails before it even begins. This aspect of the story qualifies Yank as the existential, or absurd, hero of the play in that he ends up devoting his entire existence to a meaningless rebellion that accomplishes nothing at all.Camus, Albert. \\"The Myth of Sisyphus\\" , Web. 13 Nov. 2016. He gives the ultimate sacrifice, his life, to nothing. However, by the end of the play, when it becomes evident that his struggle collapsed, Yank experiences remorseful acceptance. He is able to make light of the situation and finally accepts his position in the world, his liberation derives from the futility of his existence. The liberation is seen in the final scene with the gorilla. Yank goes and meets his symbolic equal in that to the upper class, they are nothing but beasts to exploit. Yank comes to terms with his position in the world again and dies knowing that he belongs somewhere. ==Masculinity== Not only does O’Neill explore the depths of the existential crisis, but he also delves into the primitive nature of Man. He presents his readers with a protagonist that exhibits almost every facet of what it means to be masculine. He is strong, brutish, and hard working. In almost every description, Yank is shown as a Neanderthal that barges around yelling orders and swearing. In some instances he hunches over as if he is Rodin’s The Thinker contemplating his brutish existence.Wilkins, Frederick, ed. \\"The Hairy Ape as Existential Allegory\\", Eugene O'Neill Newsletter May 1979: n. pag. Web. 13 Nov. 2016. Yank’s world changes when he meets Mildred because suddenly his world got a lot bigger than he thought it was. He is exposed to an entire class of people that did not see him for his worth and appalled at the sight of him. Mildred comes to symbolize the upper class that he devotes himself to rebelling against. O’Neill pairs this origin-type man with the seemingly inferior upper-class modern man. The foil not only allows for audience sympathy towards Yank, the protagonist, but also forces the audience to consider what they have become as modern Man. This was a time when the “idealization of lower-class masculinity was rampant” and at their helm came Yank, the epitome of that lower-class, masculine Man.Robinson, James A. “The Masculine Primitive and The Hairy Ape”, The Eugene O’Neill Review Web. 14 Nov. 2016. Yank’s heroism lies in his inherent ability to be the best at everything physical, he lives and dies by the work he does with his hands. The affinity with the masculine has always been an important part of storytelling, but it becomes particularly interesting in the twentieth century when women gained more and more freedom and became increasingly active in the world. It seems as if the more women did for themselves, the more men receded into that prehistoric mindset of what it means to be successful. ==Themes== ===Social recession by industrialization=== The Hairy Ape displays oppression of the industrial working class. Despite demonstrating in The Hairy Ape O'Neill's clear belief that the capitalist system persecutes the working man, he is critical of a socialist movement that can't fulfill individual needs or solve unique problems. The industrial environment is presented as toxic and dehumanizing; the world of the rich, superficial and manipulative. Yank has also been interpreted as representative of the human condition, alienated from nature by his isolated consciousness, unable to find belonging in any social group or environment. This is a result from the industrialization of both the ship and New York. ===Racial degeneration=== Many critics often argued over O’Neill’s conception of race in The Hairy Ape. Yank, who often worked with coal, is said to have “blackface” through the play.Nickels, J. \\"Racial Degeneration and 'The Hairy Ape'\\", The Eugene O’Neill Review Vol. 22(1/2), 33-40. This interpretation of “blackface” has led to a debate about Yank’s race. The coal combined with an unshaven face has covered the whiteness of his face, discarding his nationality. These characteristics combined contribute to his physical and psychological downfall throughout the play. His emotional detriment reflects his physical deterioration as well, where finally at the end of the play he has taken on animalistic qualities. In the last scene, Yank tries to explain to the ape that they are the same; his efforts to show their similar qualities end in Yank’s death. Yank’s defeat by the ape is degenerating to his mental state as well as his race and social class. ==Production timeline== 1922: The Hairy Ape was first produced by the Provincetown Players. The production, directed and designed by Robert Edmond Jones, was praised for its use of expressionistic set design and staging techniques, and was transferred to the Plymouth Theatre on Broadway. Actor Louis Wolheim became famous for his interpretation of Yank. 1930: A London production featuring African American actor Paul Robeson playing the lead white role, was a critical success, despite having only five performances.Duberman, Martin,Paul Robeson 1989.Othello 1930-1931pg148-149 1944: A low-budget film version produced by Jules Levey, released by United Artists, starred William Bendix, Susan Hayward, Dorothy Comingore, and John Loder. According to a review in the New York Sun it had a \\"happy ending\\" and generally \\"made the story lighter and less loaded with social significance\\". 1987: Later notable productions by Peter Stein's revival 1996: A postmodern multimedia interpretation by the Wooster Group with Willem Dafoe playing the protagonist. 2004: The Hairy Ape received positive reviews at the San Pedro Playhouse, Cellar Theatre in San Antonio, Texas. Deborah Martin of the San Antonio Express News said of Brad Milne \\"His Yank is raw and hard to forget.\\" 2006: The Hairy Ape was staged to positive reviews by the Irish Repertory Theatre in New York City. The Irish Voice declared, \\"O'Neill's spirit still resonates. [This] new production of The Hairy Ape reminds us why O'Neill is considered the first Irish-American playwright.\\" 2009: Director Sean Graney of the Hypocrites Theatre Company staged a production of The Hairy Ape at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago. BBC Radio 3 broadcast a radio adaptation of The Hairy Ape directed by Toby Swift later that year. 2012: The first major London revival in 25 years at the Southwark Playhouse in London Bridge. Director Philip Boehm of Upstream Theater staged an acclaimed production of The Hairy Ape in St. Louis, Missouri later on that year. It is staged in London's Old Vic in October and November 2015. 2017 The Park Avenue Armory staged a production of The Hairy Ape starring Bobby Cannavale, directed by Richard Jones, and designed by Stewart Laing.Ben Brantley, \\"Review: A Mesmerizing 'Hairy Ape' Brings Existentialism to Park Ave\\", The New York Times, MArch 31st, 2017. Cannavale received a 2017 Obie Award for his performance presented by the American Theatre Wing.Obie Awards, 2017 Winners. ==Reception== The Hairy Ape's reception: the audience, and especially critics, were perplexed. Critics deemed the play as showing “excessive use of monologues, the confusion or slowness of certain scenes, and the depressing monotony which follows all the pathetic 'moments.Falb, L. \\"The Critical Reception of Eugene O'Neill on the French Stage\\", Educational Theatre Journal doi:10.2307/3205420 O’Neill has been criticized for the play's issues with social class and racial fabrications. However, he was also praised for his \\"emotional and dramatic forcefulness of his writing\\" in The Hairy Ape. He was well known for handling these challenging ideas and thought-provoking plays. The play was admired for its originality and robustness, which only The Hairy Ape and All God's Chillen were stated for. Contradictory to that statement, other critics find the end of The Hairy Ape too simple and predictable. An overall positive criticism surrounds the play, but many critics picked at the flaws of the plot to critique O'Neill's judgment in playwriting. However, the themes were the most resounding aspects of The Hairy Ape and upheld O'Neill's standard of novel drama genius. ==References== ==External links== * The Hairy Ape at Standard Ebooks * * * Category:1922 plays Category:Plays by Eugene O'Neill Category:Expressionist plays Category:Industrial Workers of the World in fiction Category:Mass media portrayals of the working class Category:Plays set in New York City ","title":"The Hairy Ape"},{"id":"3249291","text":"Elisabeth \\"Elli\\" Maria Erl (born 25 May 1979) is a German singer-songwriter. She came to fame as the winner of the second season of the television show Deutschland sucht den Superstar, the German Idol series adaptation. With DSDS, Erl appeared on the collaborative top ten single \\"Believe in Miracles\\", while her coronation song and debut single \\"This Is My Life\\" peaked at number three on the German Singles Chart and reached the top ten in Austria. Erl's pop rock–influenced debut studio album, Shout It Out (2003), reached the top forty of the German Albums Chart but was significantly less successful than previous DSDS releases. Erl has since released three further albums, including Moving On (2007), Neue Generation (2008) and her latest effort Human (2009). While none of the singles released from these albums became major hit singles on the pop charts, songs such as \\"In My Dream\\", \\"Not My Type\\", \\"Get Up\\" and \\"Can't Deny It\\" entered the German Singles Chart. In 2005, Erl graduated in music and sports from University of Regensburg and is since working as a teacher at a secondary school in Düsseldorf. In 2011, she released the autobiography Gecastet. ==Early life== Erl was born on 25 May 1979, in Straubing, Germany. She is the daughter of Renate and Ludwig Erl and has two brothers named Josef and Ludwig Jr. In elementary school she started learning the trumpet, piano and the guitar opposite expanding interests in tennis, cycling and skiing. In her late teenage years she became the lead singer of several soul and rock bands, including The Gong FM Band, LOP and the more popular Panta Rei. After her high school graduation at Anton-Bruckner-Gymnasium Straubing, Elli decided to become a student teacher and began studying Music and Sports at Regensburg University. ==Career== In 2003, Erl participated in second season of the television show Deutschland sucht den Superstar, the German Idol series adaptation. Due to her massive stage experience, raspy voice and unconventional looks she was seen as an early favourite by the judges and also by the audience, who enabled her to sing against comrade-in-arms Denise Tillmanns during the final show in March 2004. However, in the end she beat out runner-up Tillmanns by a margin of 11 percent. Erl would remain the show's only female winner for nine years until its tenth season when Swiss singer Beatrice Egli won DSDS as the second female winner. Erl in June 2005 Erl's coronation song and debut single \\"This Is My Life, written and produced by DSDS judge Dieter Bohlen, was released in March 2004 on Hansa Records and BMG. The song peaked at number three on the German Singles Chart and reached number six in Austria and number 11 in Switzerland, but was less successful than \\"Take Me Tonight\\", the first single by DSDSs first season winner Alexander Klaws. Subsequently, Erl decided not to collaborate with Bohlen on her debut album, citing personal and musical differences with the judge. She eventually released her self-composed second single \\"In My Dreams\\", but neither the single nor her debut album Shout It Out could reach the top 30 once again. As a consequence she went on tour with her band Panta Rei for some time. In winter 2006, Erl's previously unreleased record \\"Better Than the Best\\" was chosen to become the corporate song for DHL. After her 2007 album Moving On failed to make an impact she chose to get full creative control over her subsequent work and founded her own record label 1773 Records. Erl's third album Human was released in May 2009 through 1773 and was preceded by the single \\"Shadows\\". == Private life == Nowadays, Erl is working as a teacher at a Realschule in Düsseldorf.http://www.superillu.de/kino-tv/DSDS- Siegerin_Elli_Erl_2020664.htmlhttp://www.focus.de/schule/schule/medien/tid-22047/dsds- star-elli-elli-vorsingen_aid_608614.html Her father is headmaster in a Realschule in Regenstauf in Bavaria.http://www.mittelbayerische.de/index.cfm?pid=10070&pk;=291243&p;=1 Erl is bisexual and prefers to have relationships with women.http://www.queer.de/detail.php?article_id=2136 ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" border=\\"1\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:14em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\" Album details ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\" Peak positions - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" GER ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" AUT ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" SWI - ! scope=\\"row\\" Shout It Out  * Released: 4 October 2004 * Label: Hansa, SonyBMG * Formats: CD, digital download  33  —  — - ! scope=\\"row\\" Moving On  * Released: 7 December 2007 * Label: 313, Seven Days, Hitch * Formats: CD, digital download  —  —  — - ! scope=\\"row\\" Human  * Released: 15 May 2009 * Label: 1773 * Formats: Digital download  —  —  — } ===Singles=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ! align=\\"center\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:14em;\\" Title ! align=\\"center\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" width=\\"10\\" Year ! align=\\"center\\" colspan=\\"3\\" width=\\"20\\" Peak positions ! align=\\"center\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" width=\\"120\\" Album - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" GER ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" AUT ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" SWI - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"This Is My Life\\" align=\\"center\\" rowspan=\\"3\\"2004 align=\\"center\\"3 align=\\"center\\"6 align=\\"center\\"11 rowspan=\\"3\\"Shout It Out - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"In My Dream\\" align=\\"center\\" 40 align=\\"center\\" — align=\\"center\\" — - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Not My Type\\" align=\\"center\\" 90 align=\\"center\\" — align=\\"center\\" — - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Get Up\\" align=\\"center\\" rowspan=\\"1\\"2006 align=\\"center\\" 71 align=\\"center\\" — align=\\"center\\" — rowspan=\\"3\\"Moving On - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Moving On\\" align=\\"center\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"2007 align=\\"center\\" — align=\\"center\\" — align=\\"center\\" — - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Can't Deny It\\" align=\\"center\\" 75 align=\\"center\\" — align=\\"center\\" — - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Shadows\\" align=\\"center\\" rowspan=\\"1\\"2009 align=\\"center\\" — align=\\"center\\" — align=\\"center\\" — rowspan=\\"1\\"Human - } ==References== ==External links== * http://www.elli-e.com/ Official site Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Bisexual musicians Category:Bisexual women Category:Female rock singers Category:People from Straubing Category:German female singers Category:German female guitarists Category:Deutschland sucht den Superstar winners Category:LGBT musicians from Germany Category:LGBT singers Category:University of Regensburg alumni Category:21st-century women singers Category:21st-century German singers Category:21st-century guitarists ","title":"Elli Erl"},{"id":"3249301","text":"The 226th Battalion, CEF was a unit in the Canadian Expeditionary Force during the First World War.

He was born at Tonge Moor, Bolton, Lancashire, England. Tattersall had an unusual style, quite different from the orthodox Jim Laker, who kept him out of a Test place for most of his career. Tattersall held his index finger around the seam of the ball and this allowed him to bowl a carefully disguised away-swinger to supplement his sharp off-break. He was rather faster than Laker, and this served to increase his penetration on the many wet wickets of his home county. Of small account as a batsman, he did nonetheless help Reg Simpson in a tenth wicket stand of 74 which helped to give England its first victory over Australia since their record win at The Oval in 1938. ==Early career== Tattersall, a late developer, began his first- class cricket career in 1948, at a time when English bowling was weak because World War II had decimated their pre-war pace attack. He first played for Lancashire in 1948 as a medium fast bowler, taking 66 Second XI wickets. He did not establish himself until 1950 after Roberts, Price and Nutter had left the staff and he changed to bowling mainly off-breaks, something he developed in Minor County cricket. That year, largely as a result of groundsmen at Old Trafford deciding to eliminate watering of the pitch, Tattersall consistently had pitches tailor-made for him and he did not disappoint, being the leading wicket-taker in first-class cricket with 193 victims for under 14 apiece. This won him the inaugural Cricket Writers' Club Young Cricketer of the Year award. Although he was not risked in the Tests against a powerful West Indian batting line-up, Tattersall was chosen as a reinforcement for the 1950–51 Ashes series that winter. He did modestly in Australia, but bowled well enough on the more helpful New Zealand pitches to establish himself in the Test team for fourteen consecutive matches. ==Test career== Tattersall held his place throughout the 1951 Test series against South Africa, taking 12 for 101 on his home pitch. In addition, he claimed eight for 51 for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against them. Tattersall went to India that winter, and on a \\"biting\\" pitch at Kanpur, he took eight wickets for 125 runs and helped England gain their only victory of the series. However, his being used as a stock bowler delivering 246 subcontinent overs in eight innings, affected his performances, and Tattersall was never the same bowler again. Returning home he found that Jim Laker, Johnny Wardle and Roly Jenkins were ahead of him in the selectors' eyes, despite taking over 100 wickets every year until 1957. Tattersall made only two further appearances in Test cricket: in 1953 against Australia and in 1954 against Pakistan. ==County cricket== Tattersall, however, bowled in excellent form for Lancashire right up to 1957; taking 100 County Championship wickets every year except 1956, when after an irresistible start, he unaccountably lost form. In the wet summer of 1958. he failed to reach 100 wickets for the first time since 1949. The eminent Lancashire cricket writer, John Kay,Cricketer Spring Annual 1959 felt Tattersall the victim of inconsistent policy at Old Trafford. In 1956, he was left out in mid-season, a move that probably cost the County the championship.Cricketer Winter Annual 1956 Nonetheless, it was a surprise to see Tattersall and Malcolm Hilton dropped at the beginning of 1959, for the leg-spinner Tommy Greenhough. Although Tattersall was recalled at the beginning of the 1960 season, he did not do well enough to keep his place after May. He and Hilton, however, were rewarded for their service to the county in the 1950s, with a remarkably productive joint benefit with Hilton in a Roses match at Old Trafford that was watched by over seventy four thousand spectators, with 34,000 on the first day alone. Neither however played in the game, but were consigned to Lancashire's simultaneous 2nd XI match by Cyril Washbrook. Tattersall was not re-engaged by the county for 1961, but did play for the MCC against his former county (in Lancashire's Centenary Match) with remarkable success, taking six for 63 in the first innings on an unhelpful wicket. In 1961, TattersallCricketer 1961 endured a poor season as a professional for Kidderminster in the Birmingham League, but was engaged by Worcestershire for 1962. Aged over forty, Tattersall was only modestly successful for their Second XI.Preston, Norman (editor); Wisden, 1963; p. 776 He played his last match in 1963. == See also == * List of Lancashire County Cricket Club players ==References== ==External links== * Test Bowling * First-Class Bowling * Category:1922 births Category:2011 deaths Category:English cricketers Category:England Test cricketers Category:Lancashire cricketers Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:Players cricketers Category:North v South cricketers Category:Sportspeople from Bolton Category:T.

Bosworth, The Encyclopedia of Islam, Vol.IX, 169.Andrew C. S. Peacock, Nomadic Society and the Seljūq Campaigns in Caucasia, 216. From 1047 to 1057, the Shaddadids were engaged in several wars against the Byzantine army. The area between the rivers Kura and Araxes was ruled by a Shaddadid dynasty. ==History== === Shaddadids of Ganja === In 951, Muhammad established himself at Dvin. Unable to hold Dvin against Musafirid incursion, he fled to the Armenian Kingdom of Vaspurakan. His son, Lashkari I, ended Musafirid influence in Arran by taking Ganja in 971. He later expanded into Transcaucasia as far north as Shamkor and as far east as Barda (present-day Azerbaijan). The reign of his brother, Marzuban, also lasted only a few years. Muhammad's third son, Fadl I, expanded his territory during his lengthy reign. He took Dvin from Armenian Bagratids in 1022, and his campaigns against them met with varying degrees of success. He also raided the Khazars in 1030, while holding parts of Arran (present-day Azerbaijan).Shabankara, C.E. Bosworth and V.F.Buchner, The Encyclopedia of Islam, Vol.IX, Ed. C.E.Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P.Heinrichs and G.Lecomte, (Brill, 1997), 157. Later that year, while returning from a successful campaign in Georgia, his army encountered Georgian and Armenian forces and was decisively defeated. Following Fadl I's defeat, the entire region became chaotic, with the Byzantine Empire pressuring Armenian princes and the Seljuq Turks gaining influence over Arran after a resurgent Seljuq attack on Dvin. Abu'l-Fath Musa succeeded Fadl I in 1031, and reigned until his murder by his son and successor Lashkari II in 1034. The poet Qatran Tabrizi praised Lashkari II for his victory over Armenian and Georgian princes during his stay in Ganja. Lashkari II ruled Arran for fifteen years in what is described by the Ottoman historian Münejjim Bashi as a troubled reign. When he died in 1049, Anushirvan succeeded him, but he was still underage, and real power lay with the chamberlain (hajib) Abu Mansur, who served as regent. The new regime was quickly opposed by a large faction among the populace. Münejjim Bashi, summarizing a now lost local chronicle, reports that this was because Abu Mansur immediately agreed to surrender several frontier fortresses to the Kakhetians, the Georgians and Byzantines, in order \\"to restrain their greed for Arran\\". This decision provoked the leading men to revolt under the leadership of al-Haytham, chief of the tanners in Shamkor. According to Vladimir Minorsky, this movement represented an uprising of the town notables against the senior bureaucratic caste. Abu Mansur, then residing at Shamkor, attempted to arrest al-Haytham, but al-Haytham and his ghilman (servants) \\"drew their daggers\\" and declared for Anushirvan's great-uncle Abu'l-Aswar Shavur, ruler of Dvin. Abu'l-Aswar occupied Shamkor, settled the troubled situation there, and went on to take up his residence in the capital, Ganja. He arrested Anushirvan, whose reign ended abruptly after two months, as well as Abu Mansur and his relations. Abu'l-Aswar's long reign (1049–67) would prove to be the zenith of the Shaddadids. He was the last independent ruling Shaddadid emir, when Tughril I arrived at Ganja and demanded his vassalage. On July, 1068 Abu'l-Aswar Shavur's son, Fadl II invaded Georgia with 33,000 men and ravaged its countryside. Bagrat IV of Georgia defeated him and forced the Shaddadid troops to flight. On the road through Kakheti, Fadl was taken prisoner by the local ruler Aghsartan. At the price of conceding several fortresses on the Iori River, Bagrat ransomed Fadl and received from him the surrender of Tbilisi where he reinstated a local emir on the terms of vassalage.V. Minorsky, \\"Tiflis\\", p. 754. In: M. Th. Houtsma, E. van Donzel (1993), E. J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913–1936. Brill, . During the captivity of Al-Fadl II, his older brother Ashot ruled Arran for eight months (August 1068 – April 1069), even minting coins in his own name and that of his overlord, the Seljuk Sultan Alp Arslan. In 1075 Alp Arslan annexed the last of the Shaddadid territories. A cadet branch of Shaddadids continued to rule in Ani and TbilisiCaucasica in the History of Mayyāfāriqīn, V. Minorsky, 29. as vassals of the Seljuq Empire until 1175, when Malik-Shah I deposed Fadl III.Surveyor versus Epigrapher, Sheila S. Blair, Muqarnas, Vol. 8, 1991, Brill, 68.Shaddadids, C.E. Bosworth, The Encyclopedia of Islam, Vol.IX, 170. In 1085, Fadl III instigated a revolt and gained possession of Ganja.The Political and Dynastic History of the Iranic World, C.E. Bosworth, The Cambridge History of Iran:The Saljuq and Mongol Period, Vol. 5, ed. J.A. Boyle, (Cambridge University Press, 1968), 95. Malik-Shah launched a campaign in 1086 and removed Fadl from power again. A collateral line of Shaddadids, through Manuchihr, continued to rule in Ani. === Shaddadids of Ani === In 1072, the Seljuks sold Ani to the Shaddadid emir of Manuchihr. Manuchihr repaired and enlarged the walls of Ani. The Shaddadids generally pursued a conciliatory policy towards the city's overwhelmingly Armenian and Christian population and actually married several members of the Bagratid nobility. A son and successor of Manuchihr, Abu'l-Aswar was accused by the contemporary Armenian historian Vardan Areveltsi of persecuting Christians and attempting to sell Ani to the emir of Kars. His rule was terminated by the resurgent King David IV of Georgia, whom Ani surrendered without a fight in 1124. Abu'l-Aswar Shavur ended his days as a captive of the Georgians, while Ani was given by David IV to his general, Abuleti. Abu'l-Aswar Shavur's son Fadl IV would be able to resume the Shaddadid reign in Ani in 1125. In 1130 Georgia was attacked by the Sultan of Ahlat, Shah-Armen Sökmen II (1128-1183). This war was started by the passage of Ani into the hands of the Georgians; Demetrius I had to compromise and give up Ani to Fadl IV on terms of vassalage and inviolability of the Christian churches. Fadl extended his rule to Dvin and Ganja, but failed to maintain these cities. He was murdered by his courtiers following the fall of Dvin to the Turkish emir Qurti c. 1030. His brothers, Mahmud and Khushchikr, ruled briefly in quick succession until the emirate was taken over by Fadl's nephew, Fakr al-Din Shaddad. In 1139, Demetrius raided the city of Ganja in Arran. He brought the iron gate of the defeated city to Georgia and donated it to Gelati Monastery at Kutaisi. Despite this brilliant victory, Demetrius could hold Ganja only for a few years. In reply to this, the sultan of Eldiguzids attacked Ganja several times, and in 1143 the town again jell to the sultan who appointed his own emir to rule it. Fakr al-Din Shaddad asked for Saltuk II's daughter's hand, however Saltuk refused him. This caused a deep hatred in Shaddad towards Saltuk. In 1154 he planned a plot and formed a secret alliance with the Demetrius I. While a Georgian army waited in ambush, he offered tribute to Saltukids, ruler of Erzerum and asked the latter to accept him as a vassal. In 1153-1154 Emir Saltuk II marched on Ani, but Shaddad informed his suzerain, the King of Georgia, of this. Demetrius marched to Ani, defeated and captured the emir. At the request of neighbouring Muslim rulers and released him for a ransom of 100,000 dinars, paid by Saltuk's sons in law and Saltuk swore not to fight against the Georgians he returned home.Prof. Yaşar Yüce-Prof. Ali Sevim: Türkiye tarihi Cilt I, AKDTYKTTK Yayınları, İstanbul, 1991, p 149-150 In 1156 the Ani's Christian population rose against the emir Fakr al-Din Shaddad, and turned the town over to his brother Fadl V. But Fadl, too, apparently could not satisfy the people of Ani, and this time the town was offered to the George III of Georgia, who took advantage of this offer and subjugated Ani, appointing his general Ivane Orbeli as its ruler in 1161. A coalition of Muslim rulers led by Shams al-Din Eldiguz, ruler of Adarbadagan and some other regions, embarked upon a campaign against Georgia in early 1163. He was joined by the Shah-Armen Sökmen II, Ak-Sunkur, ruler of Maragha, and others. With an army of 50,000 troops they marched on Georgia. The Georgian army was defeated. George had no choice but to make peace. Eldiguz, a resurgent atabeg of Azerbaijan handed the city over to Shahanshah on terms of vassalage. The Shaddadids, ruled the town for about 10 years, but in 1174 King George took the Shahanshah as a prisoner and occupied Ani once again. Ivane Orbeli, was appointed governor of the town. In 1175 the southern provinces of Georgia were again overrun by a united Muslim host. This marked the beginning of another long struggle for Ani. The chronicles do not allow the reconstruction of any coherent picture of this struggle, but we can assume that the town and region frequently changed hands. The Georgians captured Ani four times between 1124 and 1199:13x13px Chisholm, Hugh, ed. (1911), \\"Ani\\", Encyclopædia Britannica, 2 (11th ed.), Cambridge University Press, p. 47 in 1124, 1161, 1174 and 1199. The first three times, it was recaptured by the Shaddadids. In the year 1199, Georgia's Queen Tamar captured Ani, the latter granted the city in possession to her loyal subjects of the Armeno–Georgian Mkhargrzeli family. ==Shaddadid rulers== === Emirs in Dvin and Ganja === * Muhammad (951–54) * Lashkari I (971–78) * Marzuban (978–85) * Fadl I (985–1031) * Abu'l-Fath Musa (1031–34) * Lashkari II (1034–49) * Anushirvan (1049) * Abu'l-Aswar Shavur I (1049–67) * Fadl II (1067–73) *Ashot (1068–69) * Fadl III (1073–75) === Emirs in Ani === The ruins of Manuchihr Mosque, an 11th-century Shaddadid mosque built among the ruins of Ani * Manuchihr (1072–1118) * Abu'l-Aswar Shavur II (1118–24) * Fadl IV (1125–?) * Mahmud (?–1131) * Khushchikr (1131–?) *Fakr al-Din Shaddad (?–1155) * Fadl V (1155–61) * Shahanshah (1164–74) * Sultan ibn Mahmud (?–ca. 1198/9) ==See also== * List of Sunni Muslim dynasties * List of Kurdish dynasties and countries ==Notes== ==References== * Diplomacy gone to seed: a history of Byzantine foreign relations, A.D. 1047-57, By Paul A.

Marais (bapt. 11 October 1665, Paris-21 June 1737, Paris) was a French jurist and lawyer at the Parlement of Paris. He is later known by the edition of his Journal and Memoirs by Mathurin de Lescures. ==Life== Mathieu Marais was born in Paris, in the rue du Bouloi. His baptismal certificate is dated of October 11, 1665 at the Church of St Eustache of Paris. Because of the high infant mortality, infants were baptized the same day or a few days after their birth, so his date of birth was conjectured to be October 10. His father is Renault Marais, prosecutor at the Grand Châtelet, and his mother is Catherine-Françoise Billon. He have Mathieu Billon, Parisian bourgeois, and Claude Billon, daughter of Guillaume Billon, the King's cirier, for godparents.Mathieu Marais, Journal and Memoirs, vol.1, 1863. He spent twelve years with the Jesuits, then became a lawyer the November 22, 1688 before retiring in 1736. It was long thought that he had ended his career as bâtonnier, but it was actually Jean Marais (or Marays).Mathieu Marais, in a letter to president Bouhier dated of September 5, 1724, said that Jean Marais sometimes printed his name \\"Marays\\" or \\"Marais\\". J. Marais wrote Memoirs, and a Discours sur la détractation sur la légitime entre les enfants (Discourse on the Detraction on Legitimacy Between Children) in 1693. Mathieu didn't like this man, of whom he was \\"neither his relative nor his ally\\". (Cf. Correspondance littéraire du président Bouhier n°8 : Lettres de Mathieu Marais (1724-1737), vol.1, 1974.) His nickname was \\"the lawyer of the women\\" (l'avocat des dames), because he pleaded for a lot of them. He aspired to French Academy. He was very fond of Jean de La Fontaine, and the wrote an Histoire de la vie et des ouvrages de M. de La Fontaine (History of The Life and Works of Mr. de La Fontaine) published in 1811 by Simon Chardon de La Rochette. He was in contact with several personalities of his time, including Nicolas Boileau, the Chancellor d'Aguesseau, the Cardinal Polignac, the Viscount Charles-Henri-Gaspard de Saulx of Tavannes, and also the financier Samuel Bernard. His greatest friend remains to be the president Bouhier to whom he sends, sick and dying, a letter on February 1, 1737, where are written journals of his hand; he recommends keeping them in his library of manuscripts so that they do not fall into the wrong hands. He would have contributed to the Mercure galant for the criticism of Madame de Lambert about Mr. de Sacy's translation of Panegyric of Trajan by Pliny the Younger. As a friend of Pierre Bayle, he collaborated at the Historical and Critical Dictionary by writing the articles Henry III, Henry, Duke of Guise and Margaret, Queen of Navarre among others.Pierre and Firmin Didot, Nouvelle biographie générale, vol.33, 1860. His funeral took place at the same St Eustache Church where he was baptized.Louis Gabriel Michaud, Biographie universelle ancienne et moderne, vol.26, 1860. ==Notes== Category:1665 births Category:1737 deaths Category:17th-century French writers Category:17th-century male writers Category:18th-century French writers Category:18th-century male writers Category:French letter writers Category:French diarists Category:French literary critics Category:French memoirists Category:French male non-fiction writers ","title":"Mathieu Marais"},{"id":"3249373","text":"Chris Old (born Christopher Middleton Old, 22 December 1948) is a former English cricketer, who played 46 Tests and 32 ODIs from 1972 to 1981. A right- arm fast-medium bowler and lower order left-handed batsman, Old was a key feature of the Yorkshire side between 1969 and 1983, before finishing his career at Warwickshire in 1985. As a Test bowler for England he took 143 wickets, and scored useful runs in the famous 1981 Ashes series' Headingley victory. ==Early life== The youngest of three brothers, Chris Old first made his mark in school cricket as a left-handed batsman playing for Middlesbrough, Durham and England Schools. In 1962 he was recommended to Yorkshire, thus following in the footsteps of his older brothers Alan and Malcolm, who had already preceded him. He made his debut, aged 15, for Yorkshire 2nd XI against Lincolnshire at Grimsby in August 1964 as a batsman, scoring 26 in the first innings and 8 not out in the second, but he was subsequently encouraged by resident coach Arthur Mitchell to develop his bowling. He was still predominantly a batsman when he made his debut for the Yorkshire first team as a 17-year-old against Hampshire in 1966, scoring 3 runs and conceding 8 runs from 3 overs without taking a wicket. That was the start of a first-class cricket career lasting 20 years from 1966 to 1986. ==First-class career== He was mentored by the resident Yorkshire opening bowlers, Fred Trueman and Tony Nicholson, who took over 2800 wickets between them for the county and following Fred Truemans retirement in 1968 he became Nicholsons opening new ball bowling partner. He won his Yorkshire cap in 1969, and was named as the Cricket Writer's Club Young Cricketer of the Year in 1970. Old hit the 3rd fastest century of all time at Edgbaston in 1977, with 100 runs from 72 balls in 37 minutes, with the second 50 taking just 9 minutes. This feat won him the Walter Lawrence Trophy for the fastest century of the year. He was also nominated as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of 1979. 'Chilly' (so known because he appeared on the scorecard as \\"C.Old\\") subsequently took the Yorkshire captaincy in 1981, but it was not a happy period. The next season, suffering from personal problems, he was ousted from the role to allow the 50-year-old, Ray Illingworth, to take charge on the field. He then moved on to Warwickshire for three seasons (1983–1985) and he also appeared for Northern Transvaal in South Africa between 1981 and 1983. His valedictory first-class cricket appearance was for a Brian Close XI against the touring New Zealand side at Scarborough in September 1986. In 379 first-class matches he took 1,070 first-class wickets at the average of 23.48 and scored 7,756 first-class runs with six centuries. He finished off his domestic cricket career with a season of minor counties cricket, playing 8 matches for Northumberland in 1987, with the highlight being 6 - 98 against Durham at Chester-le-Street in July. ==Test cricketer== Chris Old batting in Wellington vs NZ, February 1978 He made his Test debut in the Second Test against India at Calcutta in December 1972. His first victim was the great Sunil Gavaskar whom he caught off the bowling of Derek Underwood as the first Indian wicket to fall. He produced a notable all-round performance scoring 33 and 17 not out and taking 2 for 72 and 4 for 43 but still finished on the losing side as India won by 28 runs. Over the next 9 years he played in 46 Test matches taking 143 wickets and scoring 845 runs. One of his most notable performances was taking four wickets in five balls on the opening day of the Test Match against Pakistan at Edgbaston in June 1978, the wicketless third ball being a no-ball. Bowling at pace from the City End, the second ball of his nineteenth over was top-edged by Wasim Raja to wicket-keeper Bob Taylor before his third ball nipped back through the gate to remove Wasim Bari's off stump. Old's fourth ball, the no- ball, was edged by Iqbal Qasim into the ground but Qasim nicked a late outswinger to the keeper off the next legitimate delivery, before Sikander Bakht found the safe hands of Graham Roope at second slip. Old thus equalled the record of four wickets in five balls set by Maurice Allom on his Test debut at Lancaster Park, Christchurch in 1929–30, a feat which has since been repeated by Pakistan's Wasim Akram. When India under A. Wadekar toured England in 1974, England swept the series 3–0. In the 2nd test, England batted first and made 629, India were then bowled out for 302 and followed on, and in the Indian second innings Chris Old took 5-21 and Arnold took 4–19, and together they bowled India out for 42, their lowest-ever test score. However, he is probably best remembered for one of the key second-innings batting partnerships with Ian Botham during the famous Headingley Ashes game of 1981, where they put on 67 crucial runs for the 9th wicket. He followed this up by taking the key wicket of Allan Border who he clean bowled for a duck in the Australian second innings. He was the only England cricketer to play in both Centenary Test Matches against Australia in 1977 at Melbourne and 1980 at Lord's, alongside Greg Chappell, Dennis Lillee and Rodney Marsh for Australia. Old turned down an invitation from Tony Greig to play in Kerry Packer's rebel World Series Cricket, fearing the withdrawal of the traditional benefit season offered by Yorkshire. He subsequently joined the rebel South African Breweries English touring side in South Africa during 1982 effectively ending his Test career with the resulting 3-year ban from international cricket. He subsequently went to Australia to play in a veterans three-match series, Old Australia XI v Old England XI in 1988, and five years later made a final appearance for an England XI v an Australian XI in a 36 over per side game for Derek Randall's Testimonial at Trent Bridge in June 1993. None of these later matches had first-class status. ==Injury problems== There is little doubt that he would have played more Test cricket had he not been so prone to injuries. He already had surgery on both of his knees during 1970 and 1971 before making his England debut in 1972. He became a regular member of the England squad for almost a decade. A skilful and accurate right-arm swing bowler and powerful late order left-handed hitter, he was once described by his England captain Mike Brearley as a talent to rival Ian Botham. Despite being a fine natural athlete, and possessing a natural sideways on action, he was continually hampered by regular injury problems and had a tendency to fall prey to 'niggles' in his back and legs, to such an extent that the first bowling machine installed at Lord's was nicknamed Chris Old, due to a propensity for breaking down so often. His departure from the field later in his career to the physiotherapist's table became part of cricket folklore. He never completed any of the ten series that he played abroad, and his only ever- present home series was against India and Pakistan in 1974, when in six Tests he took twenty-five wickets at twenty-two apiece, just emphasising what might have been under different circumstances. ==Post cricket== After struggling to cope with retirement for several years, Old acquired and managed his 'Clipper Fish Restaurant' in Praa Sands, Cornwall, with his second wife Letitia, in 2002. Subsequently, he sold the restaurant amid the economic recession in 2009 and it was revealed in the press, during 2012, that he was working at Sainsbury's. He still coaches a local cricket club in Falmouth and tutors cricket coaching courses. His brother, Alan Old, is a former England rugby union international, who played one first-class match for Warwickshire against Cambridge University in 1969, and also played Minor Counties cricket for Durham in the 1970s. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:English cricketers Category:England Test cricketers Category:English cricketers of 1969 to 2000 Category:England One Day International cricketers Category:Northerns cricketers Category:Cricketers from Middlesbrough Category:Warwickshire cricketers Category:Yorkshire cricketers Category:Yorkshire cricket captains Category:International Cavaliers cricketers Category:Cricketers at the 1975 Cricket World Cup Category:Cricketers at the 1979 Cricket World Cup Category:Wisden Cricketers of the Year Category:Northumberland cricketers Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:D.

Born in Pindamonhangaba, São Paulo De Oliveira won two Olympic bronze medals. His personal best of 17.89 metres, set on October 15, 1975 in Pan American Games, stood as the world record until 1985. As of today, it is still in the top twenty of all-time best results in the event. In 1981, he was in a car accident near São Paulo in which he lost one leg.

There exists some doubt on the judging of the 1980 Olympic men's triple jump final. Several jumps of winning distance by both Oliveira and Ian Campbell of Australia were adjudged as fouls by the all- Soviet judging panel, despite video replays showing this was not the case. One of Oliveira's jumps was estimated to be a new world record beyond eighteen metres. These decisions resulted in Soviet athletes Jaak Uudmäe and Viktor Saneev winning the competition with performances in the low 17-metre area.

The leftist parties represented the numerically small urban working class and the larger rural working class concentrated in the plantations and mines. Partly because these parties operated through the medium of trade unionism, they lacked the wider mass appeal needed at the national level to provide an effective extra-parliamentary challenge to the central government. Nonetheless, because the leftists occasionally formed temporary political coalitions before national elections, they posed more than just a mere \\"parliamentary nuisance factor.\\" In 1953 it was the left who summoned the 'Hartal' of 1953 which led to the resignation of the Prime minister, Dudley Senanayake. The first important leftist party was the Ceylon Labour Party, founded in 1931 by A.E. Goonesinha, but this had drifted into communalist strike-breaking action by 1937. ===Marxist oriented parties=== Three Marxist oriented parties—the Ceylon Equal Society Party (Lanka Sama Samaja Party—LSSP), the Bolshevik-Leninist Party, and the Communist Party of Sri Lanka (CPSL)--represented the Left proper. They grew out of the Youth League movement, the struggle to get funds for Sri Lankan ex-servicemen, volunteer work during the Malaria Epidemic and the anti-colonial struggle of the 1930s, which culminated in the call for full independence (eschewed by D.S. Senanayake and others of the elite). All three were divided on both ideological and personal grounds. The Soviet Union's expulsion of Leon Trotsky from the Communist Party after Lenin's death in 1924 exacerbated these differences, dividing the Communists into Trotskyists and Stalinists. ====Lanka Sama Samaja Party—LSSP==== The Lanka Sama Samaja Party−LSSP, formed in 1935 and the oldest of the Sri Lankan Marxist parties, indeed of all existing Sri Lankan parties, took a stance independent of the Soviet Union, becoming affiliated with the Trotskyist Fourth International, which was a rival of the Comintern. Its two representatives in the State Council, Philip Gunawardena and Dr N.M. Perera, were a thorn in the side of the British colonial administration. Most LSSP leaders were arrested during World War II for their opposition to what they considered to be an \\"imperialist war.\\" However, they managed to escape and the LSSP's underground work continued throughout the war. The party's propaganda was a vital element in the mutiny of the Ceylon Garrison Artillery on the Cocos Islands in 1942. It was the main opposition party after the general elections of 1936, 1947 and 1956, the second largest party in Parliament after the general elections of 1947, 1956 and 1970. Although in more recent years, the LSSP has been considered a politically spent force, gaining, for example less than 1% of the vote in the 1982 presidential elections, it has nevertheless been touted as the world's only successful Trotskyist party. This was because it participated in Government and because it has played a role far larger than its electoral success would suggest, having been ideologically hegemonic in the period 1936-1977. The 1972 Republican Constitution was drafted by Dr Colvin R. de Silva, an LSSP Minister and the country's leading lawyer. ====Bolshevik- Leninist Party==== The Bolshevik-Leninist Party was formed in 1945 as a breakaway group of the LSSP, which reunited with its parent in 1950. ====Communist Party of Sri Lanka−CPSL==== The Communist Party of Sri Lanka−CPSL, which began as a Stalinist faction of the LSSP that was later expelled, formed its own party in 1943, remaining faithful to the dictates of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. ====The Socialist Party of Sri Lanka==== The Socialist Party of Sri Lanka is the first left-wing party in Sri Lanka to nominate a female presidential candidate. Dr. Ajantha Perera, an environmental scientist, who has over 30 years of experience advising multiple Ministries in Sri Lanka and Fiji, will be contesting in the Presidential elections of December 2019. Dr. Ajantha Perera is also the first female Presidential candidate of Sri Lanka this millennium (since 1999). ==See also== * * * ==References== Category:1930s in Ceylon Category:1940s in Ceylon Category:Communism in Sri Lanka Category:Political history of Sri Lanka Category:Political parties in Sri Lanka Category:Socialist parties in Sri Lanka Category:Sri Lankan independence movement Category:Trotskyist organisations in Sri Lanka ","title":"Sri Lanka leftist parties"},{"id":"3249415","text":"Baptism of desire () is a teaching of the Anglican Communion, Lutheran Church and Roman Catholic Church explaining that those who desire baptism, but are not baptized with water through the Christian Sacrament because of death, nevertheless receive the fruits of Baptism at the moment of death if their grace of conversion included \\"divine and catholic faith\\", an internal act of perfect charity, and perfect contrition by which their soul was cleansed of all sin. Hence, the Catechism of the Catholic Church observes, \\"For catechumens [those instructed in the Catholic faith who are preparing to be baptized into the Catholic Church] who die before their Baptism, their explicit desire to receive it, together with repentance for their sins, and charity, assures them the salvation that they were not able to receive through the sacrament\\" (CCC 1259). Baptism of blood is a similar doctrine, for unbaptized martyrs. ==Denominational positions== ===Roman Catholicism=== The Catholic Church teaches that \\"baptism is necessary for salvation.\\" (Catechism of the Catholic Church, ss. 1257). It moreover teaches that baptism confers the forgiveness of sins by virtue of the enactment of the sacrament itself: \\"(b)y Baptism all sins are forgiven, original sin and all personal sins, as well as all punishment for sin.\\" (ss. 1263). For Catholics, baptism is a unique, unrepeatable act; no one who has been baptized validly can receive the full pardon conferred by the sacrament a second time. (ss. 1272) Given these doctrines, it is a matter of serious concern for the Catholic Church if a believing Christian does not receive a valid baptism. The doctrine of baptism of desire seeks to address some of the implications of these teachings. It holds that those who, as adults, come to faith in Christ and become catechumens but who die before receiving baptism nevertheless are admitted to Justification even though the Church teaches that baptism is necessary for salvation. Doctor of the Church, the Venerable Bede's 731 Ecclesiastical History of the English People states of Saint Alban, who substituted himself and was martyred as a new convert, that though he was not washed with the water of baptism, he was cleansed by the washing with his blood. Catholic apologist Jimmy Akin points to one of several canons in the Council of Trent that define baptism of desire: > If anyone shall say that the sacraments of the New Law are not necessary for > salvation, but are superfluous, and that, although all are not necessary for > every individual, _without them or without the desire of them_ through faith > alone men obtain from God the grace of justification; let him be anathema. The Catholic 1582 Rheims New Testament, the first published tome of the Douay- Rheims Bible, specifically notes in its annotations to John 3:5 both the necessity of Baptism and the availability of Baptism of Desire and Baptism of Blood. The Catholic Church had been expelled from England at the time of the production of the Bible and many annotations were designed to assist lay Catholics to keep to their faith in the absence of clergy.[citation needed] Pius IX's Singulari Quadam condemns extremist positions which deny the reality of invincible ignorance(see also Canon 5 from the Council of Trent). Fr. Leonard Feeney was condemned in the 1940s for holding similar extreme positions against Baptism of Desire, being excommunicated for disobedience as a result. ===Eastern Orthodoxy=== Among Eastern Orthodox Christians, the basic doctrine of baptism of desire is accepted, although it is not so rigorously defined. ===Protestantism=== Both the Augsburg Confession of Lutheranism and the Book of Common Prayer of Anglicanism affirm that \\"Baptism is normally necessary for salvation\\" in accordance with Sacred Scripture: , , , and . Citing the teaching of the early Church Fathers, Lutherans and Anglicans acknowledge a baptism of desire \\"where opportunity does not present itself\\" and a baptism of blood (martyrdom) in \\"the circumstances of persecution\\". The question of baptism of desire often does not arise among Baptists, because their underlying theology of baptism is different. For them, baptism is an ordinance undertaken in obedience to the teaching of Jesus and to follow the example he set. The rite of baptism, however, in their view does not confer forgiveness of sins by its performance, nor is it thought to be necessary to salvation, which comes from faith alone and is not contingent upon any ritual or form of words. They point to passages such as Acts , in which various Gentiles who heard Peter preaching were converted and received the Holy Spirit prior to baptism; if baptism were necessary for salvation, these people would not have believed and received the Holy Spirit, it is argued. Lutherans, Orthodox and Roman Catholics would respond that in verses 47-48, baptism was in fact necessary, even though they had received the Holy Spirit, as Peter said, \\"'Can any man forbid water, that these would not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?' And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.\\" ==Related theological views== Karl Rahner taught a very inclusive view called anonymous Christian, which holds that there may be an unlimited number of people who secretly long for Christ in spite of their non-Christian background. This view, which has influenced the official Church doctrine, is theologically close to Christian universalism, the teaching that all may be saved by divine grace. On the other hand, Leonard Feeney was a U.S. Jesuit priest who defended the strict interpretation of the Roman Catholic doctrine, extra Ecclesiam nulla salus (\\"outside The Church there is no salvation\\"), arguing that baptism of blood and baptism of desire are unavailing and that therefore no non-Catholics will be saved. Feeney held to a strict reading of John 3:5, that being \\"born again\\" of water baptism is necessary for salvation. Also, Feeney's position was that the love and providence of God would not permit a soul to die in such a state. He held with Catholic tradition that the Apostles literally followed Christ's commands to preach to all nations, and he pointed to archaeological evidence that he said suggests the presence of Christians in the Americas in the first millennium, a view not supported by the archeological profession. He argued, and gave examples from his own ministry to support it, that any non believer who was sincerely interested in Catholicism would be provided with a priest when the moment of death came. Speaking directly about Baptism of desire, Fr. Feeney wrote in his book Bread of Life: > But imagine priests in the Holy Roman Catholic Church, ordained by the > successors to the Apostles — dedicated to the Name and purpose and Blood and > robes of Jesus — sitting at Harvard College week after week and listening to > religion being lectured about in invisible terms. And imagine their going > back, then, to their people and talking about the \\"soul of the Church,\\" of > \\"salvation outside the Church through sincerity\\" — apart from the teachings > and Sacraments of Jesus Christ; and calling this arrangement \\"Baptism of > Desire\\" and expecting men to be members of the Catholic Church without even > knowing they are members. What kind of teaching is that? That is Christmas > without any manger; Good Friday without any God bleeding; Easter Sunday > without any Flesh and Blood coming out of the tomb. That is the Christian > Faith without any Pope, — the most visible religious leader in the world!Fr. > Leonard Feeney S.J., Bread of Life, 1952 (1st edition), page 33. Father Feeney was excommunicated \\"on account of grave disobedience to Church Authority, being unmoved by repeated warnings\\"; however this excommunication was annulled in 1972 without significant recantation. The doctrines associated with Feeney's position, known as Feeneyism, were officially condemned by the Catholic Church.Feeneyism ==Christian martyrdom== The Christian Martyrs' Last Prayer, by Jean-Léon Gérôme (1883) Similarly, those who die as Christian martyrs in a persecution of Christians are also judged by Anabaptists, Lutherans, Roman Catholic and Anglicans to have acquired the benefits of baptism without actually undergoing the ritual; this is the \\"baptism of blood\\" (baptismum sanguinis) (ss. 1258). Because the Anglican Communion, Catholic Church and Lutheran Church practice infant baptism, these issues seldom arise except for adult converts to the Church who were not baptized as children. The Catholic Church officially professes uncertainty about the fate in the afterlife of infants who die before baptism, observing that \\"the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God\\" (ss. 1261). One theory is that these infant souls exist in a natural state of supreme happiness, called Limbo, although deprived eternally of the vision of God. ==References== Category:Catholic theology and doctrine Category:Catholic doctrines Category:Christian terminology Category:Baptism ","title":"Baptism of desire"},{"id":"3249427","text":"Hampton Cove is a master-planned community located in Huntsville, Alabama. Situated in the foothills and valleys of North Alabama's Cumberland Plateau, the community lies in the coves between Monte Sano Mountain and Green Mountain to the west, and Keel Mountain to the east. Hampton Cove has 2,000 homes in twenty one different subdivisions ranging from patio homes and townhomes to family homes and multimillion-dollar estates. The community has 28 stocked lakes, 3 golf courses, and of sidewalks and paths. Hampton Cove now is expanding at an incredible rate in the smaller communities. Hampton Cove is adjacent to the Hays Nature Preserve and the Big Cove Creek Greenway. Hampton Cove is a subdivision and not a city/town. It is unincorporated and shares land with Huntsville, Gurley, Owens Cross Roads, and Big Cove. They currently do not have a high school or their own zip code. ==History== Development of Hampton Cove began in 1992, in a partnership between brothers John and Jimmy Hays and nephew Jeff Enfinger. The partners purchased the acreage just over Monte Sano Mountain from several different landowners including Burritt and Whitaker to develop a golf course and subdivision in what was then open countryside between the city of Huntsville and the rural communities of Big Cove, Gurley and Owens Cross Roads. Additional land was purchased from Robert L. Sublett, a local farmer in the Little Cove area. The addition of three Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail courses encouraged further development in the area. Much of the golf course is on the former Burritt property. Formerly a rural community, the area was once known as Horse Cove, because local residents hid their horses there to prevent them being seized by the Union Army during the Civil War. The land was originally occupied by the Cherokee and Chickasaw tribes before becoming part of the Mississippi Territory in 1806. According to A History of Madison County and Incidentally of North Alabama, 1732–1840 by Judge Thomas Jones Taylor, \\"The lands of old Madison being the first offered for sale were eagerly sought for and rapidly taken up and occupied by a class of settlers who were in intellect, enterprise and energy, the prize of any continent.\\" Settlers were drawn to the area for its fertile soil and the natural beauty of the mountains and adjacent Flint River. All services are provided by Huntsville. The community shares a zip code (35763) with Owens Cross Roads, a nearby town. Big Cove, an unincorporated community, is near Hampton Cove. ==Neighborhoods and schools== Hampton Cove consists of 20 neighborhoods: * Arbor Woods * Cobblestone Cove * Cumberland Cove * Deford Mill * Deford Mill Estates * Eastern Shore * Flint Mill * Glen Eagles * Grande Highlands *Grande Highlands Estates * Hampton Cove Estates * Lake Pointe * Mallard's Landing * Providence Island * Stoneleigh Terrace * Sussex Quarter * Tammerack Lakes * Tammerack Links * Treyburne * Twelve Stones Hampton Cove contains two elementary schools and one middle school. Hampton Cove Elementary was first built in the 1990s in order to accommodate the growing population of the area. Because of the rapid growth of the region, a second elementary school, Goldsmith-Schiffman Elementary School was opened in 2011. Both schools advance to Hampton Cove Middle School, which shares its campus with Hampton Cove Elementary School. Hampton Cove students advance to Huntsville High School which sits away. All four schools fall within the Huntsville City Schools system. ==Recreation and media== Hampton Cove hosts one of ten stops on the Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail. Hampton Cove's , three- course, 54-hole facility is open year-round and includes a club house with a pro shop, meeting rooms, bar, and restaurant. Hampton Cove is also home to 28 stocked lakes for fishing, miles of walking and biking trails and horse riding paths, and a city park with baseball, softball, and soccer fields. The area including Flint River, Hays Nature Preserve, and Goldsmith Schiffman Wildlife Sanctuary offer additional recreational opportunities. In addition to the Huntsville radio, television, and print media outlets, Hampton Cove maintains its own magazine, LIFE in Hampton Cove, and a website which features local events. The Hampton House is located in the Hampton Cove Community, with amenities that include six clay tennis courts with lights for night play, and an Olympic size pool. ==Notable people== * Michael Luwoye – actor and singer, known for playing the title role in the musical Hamilton, in its national touring company (2017) and on Broadway (2018) * Jonathan \\"Rudy\\" Ford – cornerback for the Arizona Cardinals (2017–present), starting defensive back for the Auburn Tigers (2013–2017) Johnathan Ford went to New Hope High School ==References== ==External links== *The Hampton House *Hampton Cove Community Site Category:Geography of Huntsville, Alabama Category:Neighborhoods in Alabama Category:Populated places established in 1992 Category:Neighborhoods in Huntsville, Alabama ","title":"Hampton Cove, Huntsville"},{"id":"3249434","text":"John Nicholas Udall usually called Nick Udall (July 23, 1913 - June 15, 2005) was mayor of Phoenix, Arizona from 1948-52\\\\.

Original plans were for the bonds on the Turnpike to be retired in 1995; however, the bonds were retired in 1977 (17 years ahead of schedule) and tolls were then removed from the road, which the next year was officially designated as Interstate 30 (I-30). Construction began on NTTA's oldest existing toll road, the Dallas North Tollway, in 1966, and its first segment (from I-35E to I-635) was opened in 1968. The Tollway (as it is popularly known) has (along with general Dallas-area growth) expanded continually northward, opening extensions in 1987, 1994, and most recently in 2007. TTA started construction in 1977 on its first toll bridge, the Mountain Creek Lake Bridge, which opened in 1979. The bridge spans Mountain Creek Lake in the southwestern Dallas County city of Grand Prairie. Construction was started on TTA's only project outside the area, the Jesse Jones Memorial Bridge across the Houston Ship Channel, in 1979, with the bridge opening in 1982. TTA sold the bridge to the newly created Harris County Toll Road Authority in 1994, leaving all of TTA's assets in the area in which NTTA was later established. === NTTA establishment === The North Texas Tollway Authority (NTTA) was established in 1997 by Texas Senate Bill 370.http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/75R/billtext/html/SB00370F.htm The legislation abolished the TTA, which was an independent state agency, and established the Texas Turnpike Authority division of the Texas Department of Transportation. The bill established the NTTA and made it the successor agency to TTA, assuming the prior agencies assets and liabilities. The bill authorized the establishment of other regional tollway authorities and established the laws by which they are governed. ==Criticism== In August 2010, the NTTA faced criticism by replacing the only minority member of the board—making the nine-member board all white and all male.\\"NTTA board's only minority member replaced by white man\\" A multi-year audit released in October 2011 stated that the NTTA had inappropriate discussions with consultants while they were in the midst of bidding on lucrative Tollway contracts, as well as not having a firmly defined code of corporate ethics.\\"Audit Finds NTTA Practices Create Distrust\\" ==TollTag== TollTag logo TollTag is the electronic toll collection system used by the NTTA in the Dallas / Fort Worth metro area. It was North America’s first electronic toll collection system when it was installed on the Dallas North Tollway in 1989. There are currently over 4 million TollTags in operation in the North Texas area. The NTTA offers reduced toll rates for TollTag users at all toll points. TollTags can be used on all of the roadways of the NTTA, and they can also be used on any other toll road in the state of Texas as well as for some parking lots in downtown Dallas for parking or toll payment at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), and at Dallas Love Field Airport (DAL). Current TollTags are small stickers, similar to those used for state inspections and auto registrations, but cannot be moved between vehicles. The previous TollTag was a hard case tag which was affixed to the windshield using velcro tags; these tags are still valid and can be moved between vehicles, but they are not true portable devices—they must be assigned to one vehicle only and, if moved to a different vehicle, require re-registration on the TollTag account. ===Interoperability=== # 2003 - Texas Department of Transportation (TxTag), Harris County Toll Road Authority and Fort Bend County Toll Road Authority (EZ Tag). # August 10, 2014 - Oklahoma Turnpike Authority (Pike Pass). # May 17, 2017 - Kansas Turnpike Authority (K-TAG). # Possible future systems interoperability: (Peach Pass) in Georgia, (NC Quick Pass) in North Carolina, (Palmetto Pass) in South Carolina,(SunPass) in Florida. . == See also == * EZ TAG * E-ZPass used in 14 states, mostly in the East, as well as in Ontario * Fastrak used in California * GeauxPass used in Louisiana * I-Pass used in Illinois * K-Tag used in Kansas * NationalPass provides interoperability with TransCore systems outside of Texas * Peach Pass used in Georgia * Pikepass used in Oklahoma * Sunpass used in Florida * TxTag * Texas tollways ==References== ==External links== *North Texas Tollway Authority Category:Toll road authorities of the United States Category:Transportation in Dallas Category:Toll roads in Texas ","title":"North Texas Tollway Authority"},{"id":"3249465","text":"William Purington Cole Jr. (May 11, 1889 – September 22, 1957) was an American jurist and politician.

The Grave Creek Stone is a small sandstone disk inscribed on one side with some twenty-five characters, purportedly discovered in 1838 at Grave Creek Mound in Moundsville, West Virginia. If genuine, it could provide evidence of a primitive alphabet, but the discovery that the characters can be found in a 1752 book suggests that it is probably a fraud. The only known image of the actual stone is a photograph of items in the E.H. Davis collection (circa 1878) before the majority of the collection was sold to the Blackmore Museum (now part of the British Museum). ==Discovery== In 1838, an archaeological excavation of Grave Creek Mound, led by Jesse and Abelard Tomlinson, uncovered the ruins of two large vaults, one situated directly below the other. The vaults contained several human skeletons and a considerable amount of jewelry and other artifacts. According to Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, a renowned geologist who visited the site in 1843, the Grave Creek Stone was discovered in the upper vault, along with seventeen hundred beads, five hundred sea shells, five copper bracelets, and one hundred and fifty plates of mica. It was \\"a small flat stone, of an ovate shape, containing an inscription in unknown characters\\".Schoolcraft, Henry R. (1845). \\"Observations respecting the Grave Creek Mound\\". Transactions of the American Ethnological Society 1. pp. 368-420. Schoolcraft was the first to subject the stone to a critical examination, five years after its discovery; he found it \\"lying unprotected among broken implements of stone, pieces of antique pottery, and other like articles\\", suggesting that those who found it had not recognised the potential significance of the artifact.Reid, M.C. (1879). \\"Inscribed Stone of Grave Creek Mound\\". The American Antiquarian 1(3). pp. 139-149. Grave Creek Mound The first published account of the find, along with a woodcut of the inscription, occupied the front page of the Cincinnati Chronicle of February 2, 1839, in an article written by Thomas Townsend.Kelley, David H. (1994). \\"Epigraphy and Other Fantasies\\". The Review of Archaeology 15(2). Another drawing of the stone, \\"differing essentially in its characters\\", was published in The American Pioneer in May 1843, accompanied by Abelard Tomlinson's eyewitness account of the stone's discovery. He says that the stone was discovered on June 9, 1838, about two feet from the skeleton in the upper vault. It had \\"no engraving on it, except for on one side\\". In a later statement, Tomlinson asserts that \\"I removed it with my own hands ... from its ancient bed\\". A letter dated April 10, 1839, written by James Clemens, who spent two weeks at the Grave Creek site collecting data in the summer of 1838, appears to corroborate Tomlinson's version of events. Clemens writes that \\"Abelard Tomlinson, Thomas Biggs, myself, and others were present when the stone was discovered with the copper bracelets and the shell necklace\\". Peter Catlett, one of the workers involved in the excavation, offers a conflicting account: \\"I was the man who found the stone ... The engraved stone was found on the inside of a stone arch\\". His testimony was supported by Colonel Wharton, who claims to have spotted the stone amongst the loose dirt and debris being wheeled out of the mound that day. Stephen Williams, author of Fantastic Archaeology, considers Catlett's story to be the most credible, explaining that \\"Tomlinson's description of the way the shaft and drift were dug does not accord with any of the statements made by any of the observers of the excavations\\".Williams, Stephen (1991). Fantastic Archaeology: The Wild Side of North American Prehistory. The same view was expressed by M.C. Reid, in his 1878 report, published in The American Antiquarian. Reid also pointed out numerous factual errors in Tomlinson's statement, concluding that \\"it is very certain that Mr. Tomlinson is mistaken and that he did not find the inscribed stone\\". ==Artifact== The sandstone disk is about wide, and high. One side of the stone is inscribed with 23 alphabetical / pseudo-alphabetical characters arranged in three lines with a final non-alphabetical symbol on the lower portion. There are no inscriptions on the reverse side. The stone passed through various collections, but its current location is unknown. While it was in E.H. Davis's collection in the late 1800s, he made a cast of it which he deposited to the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. The Smithsonian now has four casts of the stone. The National Anthropological Association also has a wax impression of the stone made by Davis. 6 facsmilie drawings were also made of the stone.[https://books.google.com/books?id=-SVKAQAAMAAJ&pg;=PA761&dq;=Grave+Creek+stone&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwi3lsvw2_3iAhXBct8KHaxvDOoQ6AEIWzAJ#v=onepage&q;=Grave%20Creek%20stone&f;=false Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology to the Secretary of the ... By Smithsonian Institution. Bureau of American Ethnology 1893-pp.761-762] ==Inscription== The 23 alphabetical / pseudo-alphabetical symbols inscribed on the Grave Creek Stone have been the object of much controversy. Henry Rowe Schoolcraft was the first to study this aspect of the stone. He strove to determine whether or not the symbols were alphabetical by consulting experts on the subject. His correspondence with \\"noted antiquarians\\" led him to the conclusion that inscription contains \\"four characters corresponding to the Ancient Greek; four Etruscan; five Runic; six ancient Gallic; seven old Erse; ten Phoenician; fourteen old British; sixteen Celtiberic, with some resemblance to the Hebrew\\". However, he was \\"inclined to regard the whole inscription as Celtiberic\\". M.C. Reid performed an experiment in the late 1870s in which he asked four people: a teacher and law student, a schoolgirl, a pharmacist, and a college professor, to create for him \\"twenty or more arbitrary characters not resembling any figures or alphabetical characters known to them\\". Since the Grave Creek Stone was inscribed using only straight lines (which is quite common, since straight lines are much easier to inscribe than those with curve), Reid instructed the four participants to only use \\"straight lines or combinations of straight lines\\". To further simulate the actual inscribing of the stone, the individuals were not allowed to improve upon their first attempt (since one cannot erase all or part of a symbol once it is inscribed). Just like the inscription on the Grave Creek Stone, these symbols were found to resemble characters found in alphabets of the old world. Reid was \\"compelled to conclude that there is nothing in the form of the characters of the Grave Creek Stone which require us to decide that they are old, that they are alphabetical, or if alphabetical that they are derived from any known alphabet\\". ==Recent research== At a meeting of the West Virginia Archaeological Society in October 2008, the anthropologist David Oestreicher suggested that the inscription had been forged by James W. Clemens, a local physician who had financed the excavation through loans. Oestreicher claimed to have found the source of the inscription; an 18th-century book on unknown letters on Spanish coins and monuments. \\"Everything on the stone\\", including \\"impossible sequences of characters with the same mistakes\\", was copied directly from this book.Lepper, Bradley T.

He was a regular member of the Sussex county team from 1927 and scored 1,000 runs in every season except one up to 1939, when his first-class career ended with the Second World War. In 1935, he did the all-rounder's \\"double\\" of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets, but nothing in Parks' career suggested he was an out-of-the-ordinary county cricketer -- until 1937. In that year, by scoring 3,003 runs and taking 101 wickets in the season, he set a record that is all but certainly never to be equalled. Only 13 cricketers have scored more than 2,000 runs and taken 100 wickets in an English season; no other cricketer has ever taken 100 wickets while scoring 3,000 runs. His run total included 11 centuries and he also took 21 catches. Having earlier in his career been termed \\"solid\\", Parks revealed in 1937 a full range of previously unsuspected strokes and was praised by Wisden for his \\"enterprise\\".

Today, the beverage is most associated with Tongan cuisine, although similar versions of 'otai were made and enjoyed in other archipelagoes, including Uvea, Samoa, Futuna, Tokelau, Hawai'i, and Fiji. The original Samoan version as recorded by European colonists in the 1890s was made by mixing grated ambarella fruit (called vi in Samoan language and Tongan, wi in Hawaiian language) and young coconut meat with coconut milk and coconut water.The Samoa Islands, Volume 1. Kramer, Augustin. Polynesian Press The mixture was poured into large, empty coconut shells corked with coconut husk and allowed to chill in cold pools of water (or behind waterfalls) before serving. The modern Tongan recipe most well-known today is usually a blend of water, shredded coconut meat, and any variety of grated tropical fruits, most commonly watermelon, mango and pineapple, with watermelon being the most used in the Tongan Islands. Sugar is usually added to taste. Tongan historians have noted this version is a very modern take on the traditional Polynesian otai, especially since milk, refined sugar, watermelons, mangos, and pineapples are all introduced, foreign ingredients that were not native to Tonga. The original Tongan recipe was said to be identical to the Samoan recipe, except the preferred native fruit was not ambarella (vi), but the Tongan mountain apple, called fekika.

Walker } VMSK, for very minimum shift keying modulation, is one of several ultra-narrow-band modulation (UNBM) methods claimed to send high-speed digital data through very low bandwidth (or narrowband) channels. VMSK is a variant of phase-shift keying, not related to minimum shift keying. ==Claims versus analysis== VMSK was introduced in 1998 as a cellular telephone modulating method. Hardware was sent to and tested by Vodafone, Sprint and AT&T.; The method was reported on favorably by William C.Y. Lee, V.P. of Vodafone Airtouch, in \\"Lee's Essentials of Wireless Communications\\", McGraw Hill 2001. There have been individuals who have made an analysis based on 'positive' group delay filters that claim the method does not work; however, VMSK, like all Ultra Narrow Band modulation methods uses 'negative' or 'zero' delay filters. Walker claims that with VMSK, \\"Efficiencies up to 15 bits/s/Hz are now being achieved in usable hardware with C/N ratios better than that obtainable using FM, BPSK or QPSK.\\" Analysis by third parties (Karn and Tomasic) have concluded that \\"no ultra narrow band modulation (UNBM) method, which includes very minimum shift keying (VMSK) and VPSK, can have substantially greater efficiency than conventional methods.\\" On a spectrum analyzer, a VMSK signal looks narrow. However, the actual bandwidth required to avoid interference is much wider. One analyst says \\"the spectral efficiency claims being made for VMSK are hogwash\\", regardless of the filter used.Phil Karn. The VMSK Delusion. Phil Karn's analysis of ultra narrowband claims. ==Personalities== VMSK is promoted primarily by H. R. Walker, owner of the \\"Welcome to the Ultra Narrowband Club\\"\\"Welcome to the Ultra Narrowband Club\\" website website, and author of several papers and publications on the arguments. Mr. Walker has written about his ideas in telecommunications sector publications such as Microwaves & RF,H. R. Walker. \\"Experiments in Pulse Communication With Filtered Sidebands\\". High Frequency Electronics. as well as in a co-authored book chapter. ==Legal issues== It was reported in 2000 that \\"AlphaCom Communications holds patent rights to the non-Nyquist filters and other aspects of VMSK and VMSK/2 technology. The company claimed to have secured these rights as a result of a contract with H.R. Walker, doing business as Pegasus Data Systems, to purchase the patents and fund further R&D.; AlphaCom defaulted on the contract and a legal dispute over ownership arose. A 2003 Securities and Exchange Commission charge against AlphaCom and its principals alleges that \\"defendants raised these funds by falsely representing that AlphaCom owned exclusive rights to novel Internet technologies, Network Utilities (NU) and Very Minimal Shift Keying (VMSK), that were supposed to increase Internet downloading speeds and the speed of access to the Internet. Many of these claims could not be supported.\\" In order to avoid further legal costs, Walker agreed to surrender the ownership of the VMSK patents US 5,930,303 and US 6,748,022 to AlphaCom in return for AlphaCom making no further claims against Walker or Pegasus regarding any newer methods. The special near zero group delay filters required are claimed by Walker to be non patentable due to prior publication. In 2002, \\"Walker said the company (Pegasus Data Systems) was delayed when one of its financial backers (AlphaCom) went out of business in late 2000.

Food Red 9, Acid Red 27, Azorubin S, or C.I. 16185 is a modified red azo dye used as a food dye and to color cosmetics. The name was taken from amaranth grain, a plant distinguished by its red color and edible protein-rich seeds. Amaranth is an anionic dye. It can be applied to natural and synthetic fibers, leather, paper, and phenol- formaldehyde resins. As a food additive it has E number E123. Amaranth usually comes as a trisodium salt. It has the appearance of reddish-brown, dark red to purple water-soluble powder that decomposes at 120 °C without melting. Its water solution has absorption maximum at about 520 nm. Like all azo dyes, Amaranth was, during the middle of the 20th century, made from coal tar; modern synthetics are more likely to be made from petroleum byproducts. Since 1976 Amaranth dye has been banned in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a suspected carcinogen. Its use is still legal in some countries, notably in the United Kingdom where it is most commonly used to give Glacé cherries their distinctive color. ==History and health effects== After an incident in the 1950s involving Orange 1, the FDA retested food colors. In 1960, the FDA was given jurisdiction over color additives, limiting the amounts that could be added to foods and requiring producers of food color to ensure safety and proper labeling of colors. Permission to use food additives was given on a provisional basis, which could be withdrawn should safety issues arise. The FDA gave \\"generally recognized as safe\\" (GRAS) provisional status to substances already in use, and extended Red No. 2's provisional status 14 times. In 1971, a Soviet study linked the dye to cancer. By 1976, over of the dye worth $5 million was used as a colorant in $10 billion worth of foods, drugs and cosmetics. Consumer activists in the United States, perturbed by what they perceived as collusion between the FDA and food conglomerates, put pressure on the FDA to ban it. FDA Commissioner Alexander Schmidt defended the dye in spite of all the evidence, as he had earlier defended the FDA against collusion accusations in his 1975 book, stating that the FDA found \\"no evidence of a public health hazard\\". Testing by the FDA found a statistically significant increase in the incidence of malignant tumors in female rats given a high dosage of the dye, and concluded that since there could also no longer be a presumption of safety, that use of the dye should be discontinued. The FDA banned FD&C; Red No. 2 in 1976.

Jackson was running against incumbent John Quincy Adams. The campaign was very dirty, with multiple attacks on the character and personal history of both candidates. Many of the attacks were false. == First Handbill == \\"Some account of the bloody deeds of General Andrew Jackson\\", Andrew Jackson had a reputation as a national hero, because of his leadership during the Battle of New Orleans that was the final action of the War of 1812. His glory was turned against him when John Binns, editor and publisher of the Democratic Press in Philadelphia, published the first “coffin handbill”. The poster showcased six black coffins at the top of the pamphlet and claimed that Jackson had ordered the execution of six militiamen during the Creek War. Another twelve coffins were displayed further down the page to represent regular soldiers and Indians who were put to death under Jackson’s command. This refers to the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, when Jackson attacked the Red Stick fortification. Roughly 800 of the 1000 Red Stick warriors were killed in the battle.Heidler, p. 135 There also was a drawing of Jackson assaulting and stabbing Samuel Jackson “in the streets of Nashville.” == Accusations of bigamy == A pamphlet published at a later time accused Jackson of committing adultery with his wife. Jackson’s wife Rachel had applied for a divorce from a previous marriage in 1790. According to Jackson, he and his wife married in 1791 and they realized two years later that her divorce was not granted until 1793. This does mean that Jackson had been “married” to another man’s wife for a couple of years. January 1794, Jackson and Rachel were legally married in a ceremony.Meacham, p. 22 Jackson was furious about the attacks and got further involved by writing to newspaper editors giving them guidelines on how to counter the attacks. Jackson’s wife Rachel suffered a heart attack and died before Jackson’s inauguration. He blamed his political enemies and tensions for her death. == Accusations of cannibalism == A \\"Supplemental account of some of the bloody deeds of General Jackson,\\" attributed to Virginia Congressman John Taliaferro, accused Jackson of \\"atrocious and unnatural acts\\"; such acts including slaughtering 1,000 unarmed Native Americans, taking a nap in the midst of their corpses, and eating a dozen of them for breakfast. The author went on to speculate about how Jackson might similarly treat American governors and Congressmen were he elected President. == Background == Tensions between Jackson and Adams had started with the 1824 presidential election, which was a four-way race between Jackson, Adams, William H. Crawford, and Henry Clay. Jackson gained a plurality of both the popular vote and the electoral vote, but no candidate had an Electoral College majority. Adams eventually won the election in the House of Representatives by making a deal with Clay that Jackson supporters dubbed the \\"corrupt bargain.\\" As a result, the 1828 rematch between Jackson and Adams was unusually acrimonious. Newspaper articles and political cartoons was the center of the attacks against each man. After Jackson's victory, the bitterness of the campaign resonated for years. When Jackson arrived in Washington DC he was to pay the customary courtesy call on the outgoing president, but he refused to go. John Quincy Adams responded by refusing to go to the inauguration of Andrew Jackson. == Response == After the “Coffin Handbill” first appeared, Jackson had his “Nashville Committee” of supporters answer the charge. They accused John Quincy Adams of serving as the Czar’s pimp while he was the American ambassador to Russia. It claimed that he had procured an American girl to sexually serve the Russian Czar. John Quincy Adams was attacked for allegedly having charged the government to have a billiard table put in the White House. Adams did spend a fair amount of time playing billiards, but he paid for the table with his own funds. == Legacy == Twenty-seven different versions of the Coffin Handbills have been located to date. They all have different numbers of coffins and story configurations accusing Jackson of murder and violence. The result of allegations, the term \\"Coffin Handbill\\" became synonymous with a smear attack on political candidates. == See also == * Andrew Jackson presidential campaign, 1828 ==Notes== ==References== *Heidler, David Stephen and Heidler, Jeanne T. \\"Creek War,\\" in Encyclopedia of the War of 1812, Santa Barbara, Calif. : ABC-CLIO, 1997. *Meacham, Jon.

Auxiliaries are extremely important for navies of all sizes, as without them, the primary fleet vessels cannot be effective. Thus, nearly every navy maintains an extensive fleet of auxiliaries. However, the composition and size of these auxiliary fleets varies depending on the nature of each navy and its primary mission. Smaller coastal navies tend to have smaller auxiliary vessels focusing primarily on littoral and training support roles. Larger blue-water navies tend to have large auxiliary fleets comprising longer-range fleet support vessels designed to provide support far beyond territorial waters. ==Roles== Royal Canadian Navy auxiliary oiler during New York fleet week, 2009 Australian oiler refueling , June 2007 USNS Furman, 1981 American repair ship , June 1992 Wangerooge, 2005 Australian survey ship , December 2013 US Navy barracks ship APL-61 in 2003 ;Replenishment: One of the most direct ways that auxiliaries support the fleet is by providing underway replenishment to major fleet units. This allows the fleet to remain on station, with the replenishment vessels bringing up fuel, ammunition, food, and supplies from shore to the fleet wherever it is operating. Oilers (AO AOG) are vessels specifically designed to bring fuel oil to the fleet, while the earlier Colliers supplied coal burning steamships. Some replenishment vessels: Combat stores ship, Depot ship, General stores issue ship and Ammunition ship (AC, AE, AF, AFS, AKE, AOE, AOR). Tenders are specifically designed to support a type of smaller naval unit, like submarines, Destroyer and seaplanes, providing a mobile base of operations for these units. Tenders: Destroyer Tender (AD), Submarine tender (AS), Seaplane Tender (AV, AVB, AVP, AVS), Torpedo boat tender (AGP) and Miscellaneous Auxiliary (AG). ;Transport:Supporting forward operating bases requires immense transportation capacity. Transports are often converted merchant ships simply commissioned (APA, APD, APH, APV) into naval service. Tankers are transports specifically designed to ship fuel to forward locations. Transports are often employed not only carrying cargo for naval support, but in support of all forces of a nation's military (AK, AKA, AKN, AKR, AKS). In particular, troopships and attack transports are used to carry large number of soldiers to operational theatres. Some transport ships are highly specialized, like the ammunition ships employed by the US Navy. Large ocean tugs (AT, ATO, ATF, ATA, ATR) are used to tow large auxiliary ships, like: barges, floating repair dock and floating cranes in open sea, also disabled ships. ;Repair: Repairing ships at sea or in forward areas is important as it allows these units to return to service quicker, while also increasing the chance of survival for ships critically damaged in battle. Repair vessels (AR, ARB, ARC, ARG, ARH, ARL, ARV) range from small equipment ships to Auxiliary repair docks, and lager Auxiliary floating drydock. ;Harbor:Harbor support is a critical support role, with various types of vessels including tugboats, barges, lighters, derrick- crane vessels, and others, used to move ships and equipment around the port facilities, and depot ships and tenders to service ships currently in the harbor. These vessels also help maintain the harbor by dredging channels, maintaining jetties and buoys, and even providing floating platforms for port defense weapons. Tugboats are type YT, YTB, YTM, YTL or a Type V ship. Barges are classified as a Type B ship or YF, YFN YFR and YFRN. ;Support: Radar picket to increase the radar detection range around a force. Communications Relay Ships (AGMR) are floating communications stations. Tracking ship or Range Instrumentation Ship (AGM) are equipped with antennas and electronics to support the launching and tracking of missiles and rockets. Command ship (AGF) are flagships of the commander of a fleet. Wind-class icebreaker (AGB WAGB) are support ships. Rescue and salvage ship and Submarine rescue ship (ASR) for surface support ship for ship and submarine rescue. Barracks ship or Auxiliary Personal Living, (APL) are vessels-barges for service men to live on. ;Research:A wide variety of vessels are employed for research(AGTR) (AGM), Environmental Research Ships (AGER), Hydrofoil Research Ships (AGEH) and survey, primarily to provide a navy with a better understanding of its operating environment, or to assist in testing new technologies for employment in other vessels. ;Hospital: Hospital ship are able to provide care in remote locates. ==See also== *List of auxiliaries of the United States Navy *List of auxiliary ship classes in service == References == === Notes === === Bibliography === * * ==External links== * Category:Ship types ","title":"Auxiliary ship"},{"id":"3249598","text":"John Hemmings (also spelled Hemings) (1776 – 1833) was born into slavery at Thomas Jefferson's Monticello as a member of the large mixed-race Hemings family. He trained in the Monticello Joinery and became a highly skilled carpenter and woodworker, making furniture and crafting the fine woodwork of the interiors at Monticello and Poplar Forest. Hemmings also served as the master joiner to apprentices Beverley, Madison and Eston Hemings, Jefferson's sons by Sally Hemings. After decades of service, John Hemmings was freed in 1826 by Jefferson's will and given the tools to the joinery. He remained at Monticello until about 1831 and died in 1833. ==Early life and education== John Hemmings was born into slavery at Monticello on April 24, 1776. He was the youngest son of the mixed-race slave Betty Hemings and his father was Joseph Neilson, an Irish workman and Jefferson's chief carpenter at Monticello. Hemmings was the eleventh of Betty's children and half-brother to her six children by her late master John Wayles, including Sally Hemings, as well as to the oldest four by an unknown father. Because of a 1655 Virginia House of Burgesses law that determined an individual's slave or free status through the individual's mother, John Hemings was considered a slave despite his three-quarters European heritage. The Hemings family had come to Monticello through the Wayles family, when John Wayles's daughter Martha Wayles married Thomas Jefferson. A view of where the Mulberry Row slave cabins once stood. The vast majority of the Hemings family stayed within close proximity of each other for much of their lifetimes, as Thomas Jefferson's slave rolls at Monticello rarely changed. In fact, as many as 70 family members comprising five different generations of the family lived at Monticello. Due to this stability, the members of the Hemings family would have interacted with each other every day. Hemings children grew up with the understanding that the girls would become house servants and that the boys would become butlers or valets, or perhaps artisans who worked in the many outbuildings on Mulberry Row. Jefferson allowed the Hemings family members a greater amount of agency than was typical for the time period: the men were allowed to travel by themselves, learn trades, and hire themselves out on free days and keep the extra wages. The Hemings women were not responsible for any agricultural work, and instead performed chores and housework like childcare, sewing, and baking. As a child, Hemmings was a fieldworker. At age 14, Hemmings worked as an \\"out-carpenter\\" working in the woods and fields chopping trees and building fences, barns and three of the slave cabins on Mulberry Row at Monticello. At some point, Hemmings also learned how to read and write, although exactly when and who taught him is unclear; unlike the rest of his family, he spelled his name with a double m.Self, Robert L. and Susan R. Stein. \\"The Collaboration of Thomas Jefferson and John Hemings.\\" Winterthur Portfolio 33 no. 4 (1998): 233-248 ==Marriage and family== Although slave marriages were not recognized by Virginian law, John married Priscilla and had a lifelong partnership with her. Priscilla served as the nursemaid for Thomas Jefferson's daughter Martha Randolph's children, first at Edgehill three miles away from Monticello, but later Priscilla lived with John after Martha Randolph moved to Monticello. The Jefferson grandchildren were fond of Hemmings; they reportedly called him \\"Daddy\\" and asked him to make them little wooden presents when they visited his cabin on Mulberry Row, and he wrote letters to Jefferson's granddaughter Septimia Randolph. Priscilla and John were described as extremely devout, and they held religious services in their cabin. They had no children of their own, although they were close with Sally Hemings's three boys. When Priscilla died in 1830, Hemmings spent over a year carving her headstone himself. ==Career== In the Monticello Joinery, Thomas Jefferson hired white joiners to train and work side by side with enslaved joiners. John Hemmings received his first instructions at 17 years of age in 1793, when Thomas Jefferson wrote to his son-in-law Tom Randolph and asked Randolph to make sure Hemmings received training from the house joiner David Watson to fashion wheels and work with wood. The Monticello Joinery was well- stocked, as Jefferson was intensely engaged in refashioning his properties, and always had projects to complete. Hemmings therefore had the benefit of both materials and experience. Hemmings later worked as principal assistant to James Dinsmore, another Monticello joiner. Thomas Jefferson's Monticello. The green 'porticle' Hemmings crafted is visible on the right-hand side of the house. At the Monticello Joinery, Hemmings contributed to both the improvements Jefferson made to Monticello and the construction of Poplar Forest. At Monticello, Jefferson asked Hemings and Dinsmore to build 'porticles,' or small enclosures, at the south side of the building with louvered blinds that enclosed his living quarters and blocked outside views into his bedroom and study. Hemmings fashioned one of the porticles into an aviary, likely for Jefferson's mockingbirds. Hemmings independently completed the Chinese railing, Venetian blinds, cellar sashes, bedchamber closet, and window shutters at Monticello. Jefferson began construction of his octagonal house Poplar Forest in 1806 and finished around 1809. At Poplar Forest, Hemmings created the classical trim on the interior and completed work on the roof, including the decorative railing. He also installed a large central skylight and repaired it after a storm in 1819, installed plaster ornaments made by sculptor William Coffee, and made repairs to the house after a roof leak in 1819 and a fire in 1825. Hemmings took Jefferson's sons Beverley, Madison, and Eston Hemings to Poplar Forest to teach them the basics of carpentry and joining. In 1809, Hemmings assumed responsibility for the Monticello joinery. At this time, most of the exterior of Monticello was finished, but the interior was not yet complete, and most of the furniture was decades old. The joinery changed focus and began creating furniture, both for Monticello and for Jefferson's second home at Poplar Forest. The Monticello Joinery was responsible for desks, chairs, and tables, often created from Jefferson's own designs. Hemmings likely made much of the furniture and other woodwork created in the Monticello joinery after 1809, but only eight works are positively attributed to him through records: a \\"Campeachy\\" (campeche) chair, boxes made to hold books Jefferson sold to Congress, a desk for Jefferson's granddaughter Ellen Randolph Coolidge, a bedstead, a chess table, Pembroke tables, a hanging cabinet, and a dressing table. The boxes were destroyed, the desk was lost in a shipwreck, the Pembroke tables likely were destroyed in a fire at Poplar Forest, and the bedstead and dressing table remain unlocated. The hanging cabinet, made of walnut and poplar and meant to house the doll clothes of Jefferson' granddaughter Septimia Anne Randolph, was bequeathed to the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation in 1957. The mahogany Campeachy chair that Hemmings fashioned for Jefferson between 1809 and 1819 was sold to the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation in 1970. Hemmings created this chair for Jefferson after Jefferson, wanting a chair in this style made popular in New Orleans and unable to procure one, described the chair's design to Hemmings. Jefferson finally received a chair in 1818, after Hemmings had made his own version, but Hemmings quickly created at least two more chairs later with the actual chair as a model. At least one attributed to Hemmings still exists. Hemmings considered the writing desk he made for Ellen Randolph Coolidge as his masterpiece, and both he and Jefferson were devastated to learn that it had been lost in a shipwreck on its way to her. Among the other Hemmings projects lost to time is a four-person landau carriage that Hemmings fashioned in 1814 for an aging Thomas Jefferson, who became tired of making his thrice-yearly visits to Poplar Forest on horseback. Hemmings created all the necessary parts for the carriage; his relative Joseph Fossett completed the ironwork; and another relative Burwell Colbert painted the finished carriage. The finished product was a source of great pride for Jefferson. John Hemmings had some woodworking signatures that help distinguish his work from that of other workers at the Monticello Joinery. They include attaching shelves to the sides of a cupboard, using a double-bead moulding on the front of shelves, and curving the moulding on bed frames. After Hemmings became master craftsman of the Monticello Joinery, he trained other slaves, including Thomas Jefferson's three sons by Sally Hemings. At the age of 14, Beverley, Madison and Eston each became apprenticed to Hemmings and learned to be highly skilled carpenters.\\"1873 Madison Heming's Memoir\\", Jefferson's Blood, PBS Frontline, accessed 25 March 2011 Thomas Jefferson and John Hemmings developed a working relationship. They wrote letters to each other and shared drawings about woodworking and the work being done on both of Jefferson's houses; twelve of the letters survive. Hemmings also informed Jefferson when Nace, a Poplar Forest slave, stole produce from the house garden. Jefferson rewarded Hemmings with an annual bonus each year, beginning in 1811, of fifteen to twenty dollars, or about one month's wages. When Jefferson became ill, Hemmings nursed him for two months and helped him to walk. On April 16, 1826, an ailing Thomas Jefferson prepared his will. In it, he stipulated that John Hemmings would be freed as of a year after his death, given all the tools of his trade, and gifted a life estate in a house and an acre of land, provided that he stayed close to his wife Priscilla and his likely next place of employment, the new University of Virginia. Hemmings was one of five members of the Hemings family freed in Jefferson's will. Hemmings was also given the service of his two nephews and apprentices Madison and Eston Hemings until they turned twenty-one; as Madison was already of age when Jefferson penned his will, he was freed immediately upon Jefferson's death. Thomas Jefferson died on July 4, 1826. He was buried in a coffin that John Hemmings spent days, if not weeks, fashioning from wood he saved in the joinery for this purpose. Jefferson's death made John Hemmings a free man at fifty-one years old. Hemmings continued to live and work for wages at Monticello after Jefferson's death in 1826, until about 1831, when the house was sold. Jefferson's daughter Martha Randolph lived in the house until this time. In 1830, Hemmings lost his wife Priscilla, and he started drinking heavily and stopped working. The loss of his family and his craft caused him to sink into a depression. Although it was a stipulation of his freedom that he continue to live near the University of Virginia, it does not appear that Hemmings ever worked there. Little is known of Hemmings's whereabouts after 1831. The last trace of his existence is a court record of Hemmings registering with the county court on September 16, 1831, as all freedmen were required to do. This court registration gives the only surviving description of John Hemmings; according to the court records, he was just over five feet five inches tall, of a light complexion, and had a small scar on his right wrist. John Hemmings died in 1833. == Legacy == Monticello has recently begun rebuilding some of the slave cabins on Mulberry Row, which were torn down sometime in the 19th century. One of the slave cabins is a reconstructed and refurnished recreation of the cabin John Hemmings and his wife Priscilla shared. The interior furnishings of the cabin are taken from a description given by one of Jefferson's grandchildren in her diary. Monticello also offers a tour exploring the Hemings family experience at Monticello through seven of its members. The Joinery no longer stands, but the foundation and the chimney are still there. In 2012, Slavery at Jefferson’s Monticello: Paradox of Liberty, an exhibition co-presented by the National Museum of African American History and Culture and the Thomas Jefferson Foundation at Monticello, opened in the NMAAHC Gallery at the National Museum of American History. This exhibition highlighted Jefferson's paradoxical dual positions as the drafter of the Declaration of Independence and a slaveholder. Some of the objects on display were the \\"Campeachy\\" (campeche) chair Hemmings created for Jefferson, a copy of the French chairs at Monticello attributed to the joinery, and a hanging cabinet Hemmings created. The entrance to Slavery at Jefferson’s Monticello: Paradox of Liberty featured a large statue of Jefferson standing in front of stacks of bricks. Each of the bricks was stamped with the name of one of the 607 slaves Jefferson owned in his lifetime, including the name of John Hemmings. This statue is visible today in the Paradox of Liberty section of the National Museum of African American History and Culture. ==See also== *Sally Hemings *Jefferson DNA data *Monticello *Poplar Forest ==References== ==Further reading== * Gordon-Reed, Annette.

On 25 July 1942, German troops captured Rostov-on-Don, Russia, opening the Caucasus region of the southern Soviet Union, and the oil fields beyond at Maikop, Grozny, and ultimately Baku, to the Germans. Two days prior, Adolf Hitler issued a directive to launch such an operation into the Caucasus region, to be named Operation Edelweiß. German forces were compelled to withdraw from the area that winter as Operation Little Saturn threatened to cut them off. ==Order of battle== ===Red Army=== *North Caucasian Front (Marshal Semyon Budenny) - until September 1942 *Transcaucasian Front (General of the Army Ivan Tyulenev) *Black Sea Fleet (Vice Admiral Filipp Oktyabrsky) *Azov Sea Flotilla (Rear Admiral Sergey Gorshkov) ===Wehrmacht=== Army Group A - General Field Marshal (Generalfeldmarschall) Wilhelm List *1st Panzer Army- General Paul von Kleist *17th Army - Colonel-General (Generaloberst) Richard Ruoff *3rd Romanian Army - General Petre Dumitrescu ==German operations== Operation Edelweiss, named after the mountain flower, was a German plan to gain control over the Caucasus and capture the oil fields of Baku during the Soviet-German War. The operation was authorised by Hitler on 23 July 1942. The main forces included Army Group A commanded by Wilhelm List, 1st Panzer Army (Ewald von Kleist), 4th Panzer Army (Colonel-General Hermann Hoth), 17th Army (Colonel- General Richard Ruoff), part of the Luftflotte 4 (Generalfeldmarschall Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen) and the 3rd Romanian Army (General Petre Dumitrescu). Army Group A was supported to the east by Army Group B commanded by Fedor von Bock and by the remaining 4th Air Fleet aircraft (1,000 aircraft in all). The land forces, accompanied by 15,000 oil industry workers, included 167,000 troopers, 4,540 guns and 1,130 tanks. ===Preparations=== Several oil firms such as \\"German Oil on Caucasus\\", \\"Ost-Öl\\" and \\"Karpaten-Öl\\" had been established in Germany. They were awarded an exclusive 99-year lease to exploit the Caucasian oil fields. For this purpose, a large number of pipes—which later proved useful to Soviet oil industry workers—were delivered. A special economic inspection \\"A\\", headed by Lieutenant-General Nidenfuhr was created. Bombing of the oil fields was forbidden. To defend them from destruction by Soviet units under the command of Nikolai Baibakov and Semyon Budyonny, an SS guard regiment and a Cossack regiment were formed. The head of the Abwehr developed Operation Schamil, which called for landing in the Grozny, Malgobek and Maikop regions. They would be supported by the local fifth column. ===Events=== German soldiers in the Caucasus (1942) The front from July to November 1942 After neutralizing the Soviet counter-attack in the Izyum-Barvenkovsk direction the German Army Group A rapidly attacked towards the Caucasus. When Rostov-on-Don, nicknamed \\"The Gates of Caucasus,\\" fell on 23 July 1942, the tank units of Ewald von Kleist moved towards the Caucasian Mountain Range. The \\"Edelweiss\\" division commander, Hubert Lanz, decided to advance through the gorges of rivers of the Kuban River basin and by crossing the Marukhskiy Pass (Maly Zelenchuk River), Teberda, Uchkulan reach the Klukhorskiy Pass, and simultaneously through the Khotyu-tau Pass block the upper reaches of the Baksan River and the Donguz-Orun and Becho passes. Concurrently with the outflanking maneuvers, the Caucasian Mountain Range was supposed to be crossed through such passes as Sancharo, Klukhorskiy and Marukhskiy to reach Kutaisi, Zugdidi, Sukhumi and the Soviet Georgian capital city of Tbilisi. The units of the 4th German Mountain Division, manned with Tyroleans, were active in this thrust. They succeeded in advancing 30 km toward Sukhumi. To attack from the Kuban region, capture the passes that led to Elbrus, and cover the \\"Edelweiss\\" flank, a vanguard detachment of 150 men commanded by Captain (Hauptmann) Heinz Groth, was formed. From the Old Karachay through the Khurzuk aul and the Ullu-kam Gorge the detachment reached the Khotyu-tau Pass, which had not been defended by the Soviet troops. Khotyu- tau gained a new name — \\"The Pass of General Konrad\\". The starting point of the operation on the Krasnodar-Pyatigorsk-Maikop line was reached on 10 August 1942. On 16 August the battalion commanded by von Hirschfeld made a feint and reached the Kadar Gorge. On 21 August troops from the 1st Mountain Division planted the flag of Nazi Germany on the summit of Mount Elbrus, the highest peak in both the Caucasus and Europe. *3 August 1942 - Wehrmacht takes Stavropol *10 August 1942 - Wehrmacht takes Maykop *12 August 1942 - Wehrmacht takes Krasnodar *25 August 1942 - Wehrmacht takes Mozdok *11 September 1942 - Wehrmacht and Romanian Army take NovorossiyskRobert Forczyk, The Caucasus 1942–43: Kleist’s race for oil *End of September 1942 - Wehrmacht blitzkrieg stopped at Chechen-Ingush ASSR town Malgobek and North Ossetia city of Vladikavkaz ==Soviet operations== The front from December 1942 to February 1943 Some 870,000 Soviet personnel were awarded this Medal \\"For the Defence of the Caucasus\\" from 1 May 1944. ===1941=== There were no military operations in the region in 1941. But the region was affected by warfare elsewhere in the Soviet Union. In his memoirs, Soviet Transcaucasian Front commander Ivan Tiulenev recounts how thousands of civilians attempted to flee from Ukraine to the comparatively safe Caspian ports, such as Makhachkala and Baku. The Caucasus area became a new area of industry when 226 factories were evacuated there during the industrial evacuations undertaken by the Soviet Union in 1941. After the Grozny to Kiev line was captured during Axis advances, a new link between Moscow and Transcaucasia was established with the construction of the new railway line running from Baku to Orsk (via Astrakhan), bypassing the front line at Grozny, while a shipping line was maintained over the Caspian Sea through the town of Krasnovodsk in Turkmenistan. ===1942=== In 1942, the German Army launched Operation Edelweiss which was aimed at advancing to the oil field of Azerbaijan. The German offensive slowed as it entered the mountains in the southern Caucasus and did not reach all of its 1942 objectives. After the Soviet breakthroughs in the region around Stalingrad, the German forces in the Caucasus were put on the defensive. Soviet military operations included :Tikhoretsk-Stavropol Defensive Operation (25 July – 5 August 1942) :Armavir-Maikop Defensive Operation (6–17 August 1942) :Novorossiysk Defensive Operation (19 August – 26 September 1942) :Mozdok- Malgobek Defensive Operation (1–28 September 1942) :Tuapse Defensive Operation (25 September – 20 December 1942) :Nalckik-Ordzhonikidze Defensive Operation (25 October – 12 November 1942) ===1943=== Red Army units enter the reconquered city of Mozdok (January 1943). In early 1943, the Germans began to withdraw and consolidate their positions in the region due to setbacks elsewhere. They established a defensive line (Kuban bridgehead) in the Taman Peninsula from which they hoped to eventually launch new operations in the Caucasus. The fighting remained reasonably static until September 1943 when the Germans ordered fresh withdrawals which effectively ended the period of fighting in the Caucasus. Soviet Operations in 1943 consisted of the following. :Salsk-Rostov Offensive (1 January 1943 – 4 February 1943) :Mozdok- Stavropol Offensive (1 January 1943 – 24 January 1943) :Novorossiysk-Maikop Offensive (11 January 1943 – 4 February 1943) :Tikhoretsk-Eisk Offensive (24 January 1943 – 4 February 1943) :Novorossiysk-Taman Operation (10 September – 9 October 1943) The key military base of Novorossiysk was retaken in September, 1943. *3 January 1943 - Red Army retakes Mozdok *21 January 1943 - Red Army retakes Stavropol *23 January 1943 - Red Army retakes Armavir *29 January 1943 - Red Army retakes Maykop *4 February 1943 - Soviet marines repel a German attempt to land at Malaya Zemlya, an island fort that controlled access to the port at Novorossiysk.

Operations included: :Kerch-Eltingen Amphibious Offensive Operation (31 October 1943 – 11 December 1944) :Perekop–Sevastopol Offensive (8 April 1944 – 12 May 1944) :Kerch–Sevastopol Offensive (11 April 1944 – 12 May 1944) ==Anti- Soviet insurgency (1940–1944)== * 1940–1944 insurgency in Chechnya ==See also== *Army Group A action — Caucasus campaign *Baku Air Defence Army ==References== *Alexander Werth, The Battle of Stalingrad, Chapter 7, \\"Caucasus, there and back\\", P.648-651 *Ivan Tyulenev, \\"Cherez Tri Voyny\\" (Through Three Wars), Moscow, 1960, P.176. ==Bibliography== * Иван Тюленев.

His reign marks the apex of this feeble and short-lived dynasty, having ruled for 13 years – more than half of its entire duration. ==Reign== ===Struggle for the accession=== Hakor's accession and relationships with his predecessor Nepherites I were long debated. After Nepherites' death a dynastic struggle did seem to have occurred, and the throne was claimed by two or maybe three pretenders: Hakor, Psammuthes, and possibly a phantom figure called Muthis who was only mentioned in Eusebius' epitome of Manetho's Aegyptiaca. As a result, Hakor was alternately considered Nepherites' legitimate successor or an unrelated usurper. In 1986, John D. Ray suggested that Hakor was Nepherites' heir, who ruled undisturbed until his Year 2 when he was deposed by Psammuthes. After another year, Hakor managed to retake his legitimate throne by overthrowing the usurper, and continued to date his reign since his first coronation date, simply pretending that this gap never occurred. The third pretender, Muthis, could be inserted within this struggle, but his role – assuming that he really did exist – is unknown. Ray's hypothesis is accepted by other Egyptologists such as Alan B. Lloyd and Toby Wilkinson. Shortly after his death, Hakor was called an usurper by the founder of the subsequent dynasty, Nectanebo I. However, it has been suggested that Hakor and Nectanebo might have been relatives in some way, possibly both related to Nepherites I but rivals to each other. ===Activities in Egypt=== Hakor's chapel in Karnak Once re- established, Hakor made considerable exertions to affirm his legitimacy, putting emphasis on his – real or fictional – descent from Nepherites. His building activity was remarkable and he also extensively restored many monuments of his royal predecessors. In Karnak, Hakor finished the chapel for the sacred barque of Amun-Ra near the first pylon which was started by Psammuthes or possibly by Nepherites I; he also possibly began a temple complex in northern Saqqara which was later further developed under Nectanebo II. His building activity is well attested in various places in Upper Egypt (Luxor, Medinet Habu, El-Kab, El-Tod, Medamud, Elephantine), in the Temple of Hibis of Kharga Oasis, as well as other locations in Middle Egypt. ===Foreign relations=== Hakor apparently reprised Nepherites' foreign policy. In Aristophanes' comedy Plutus, which was performed in 388 BCE, an alliance between the Athenians and the Egyptians is mentioned, though it was more likely intended to refer to the Athenian support for the rebellion of Evagoras I of Cyprus – himself allied with Hakor – against the Achaemenids. Theopompus also reported an alliance between Hakor and the Pisidians. The peace of Antalcidas between the Persians and Greeks (387 BCE) was a turning point: after that, Egypt and Cyprus remained the only opponents of Artaxerxes II as reported by Theopompus and Orosius. The following years are quite obscure, but it seems that the Persians first attacked Egypt in 385 BCE and, after three years of war, the Egyptians managed to defeat the invaders. In 381 BCE, Hakor sent aid, money and 50 triremes (apparently without crew, though) to Evagoras in order to contribute to his resistance against the Great King who, after the unsuccessful campaign in Egypt, was now focusing on Cyprus. However, when, in 380 BCE, Evagoras travelled to Egypt to beg for further aid, Hakor saw no need to continue supporting him and sent him back to Cyprus with merely some more money. Evagoras surrendered to Artaxerxes soon after, but Hakor promptly joined a short-lived alliance with Sparta and with Glos, son of the Egyptian admiral, Tamos, who was a supporter of the pretender Cyrus the Younger against Artaxerxes II. Hakor managed to get the Athenian general Chabrias into his service, but the Persian general Pharnabazus II lobbied Athens seeking for them to repatriate him. ===Death and succession=== Hakor died in 379/8 BCE, leaving his throne to his son Nepherites II. However, the latter was able to keep it for just four months before being overthrown and replaced by an army general from Sebennytos, Nectanebo I. ==References== ==Bibliography== : : : : : : : ==External links== * Category:4th-century BC Pharaohs Category:Pharaohs of the Twenty-ninth Dynasty of Egypt Category:Year of birth unknown Category:370s BC deaths ","title":"Hakor"},{"id":"3249726","text":"James Steen was the head coach of the swim teams at Kenyon College from 1976 to 2012.

Although he is mentioned in three different epitomes of Manetho's Aegyptiaca (Africanus, Eusebius and the Armenian version of the latter) and in the Demotic Chronicle, the sequence of kings is different among these sources and it is unclear if Psammuthes succeeded Hakor, or vice versa. According to a hypothesis of the Egyptologist John D. Ray, upon the death of Nepherites I in 393 BC, the throne passed to his son and successor, which is likely to had been Hakor. However, it seems that in his Year 2 a usurper, Psammuthes (a hellenized form of the Egyptian name PasherienmutPeter Clayton, Chronicle of the Pharaohs, Thames and Hudson Ltd. 1994 p.203), seized power and deposed Hakor, while proclaiming himself pharaoh. Relief bearing part of Psammuthes' royal titulary, Metropolitan Museum of Art. Both Manetho and the Demotic Chronicle give to Psammuthes a reign length of a year, agreeing with the highest date given by archaeological records, a Mother of Apis stele recording his \\"Year 1, fourth month of Peret\\". Before the year 2 of Psammuthes, and thus before the \\"official\\" year 3 of Hakor, the latter in some way resumed power, and then continued to date his monuments since his first coronation date, simply pretending that the usurper never existed. Nevertheless, some archaeological records mentioning Psammuthes have survived: the Mother of Apis stele from the Serapeum of Saqqara, a block from Akhmim, and some other findings all from the Theban region. Psammuthes is generally credited to have ordered the construction of a chapel in Karnak, which was later usurped and finished by Hakor. It is also possible, however, that the chapel was started by Hakor before his deposition and further restored by him during his second reign. ==See also== *Muthis, a presumed claimant to the throne during his reign ==References== Category:4th-century BC Pharaohs Category:Pharaohs of the Twenty-ninth Dynasty of Egypt Category:5th- century BC births Category:Year of death missing ","title":"Psammuthes"},{"id":"3249739","text":"Bela Duarte is an artist from Cape Verde, Born in the island of São Vicente and was studied decorative arts in Lisbon, Portugal.

Sayyid Ali Milani, in the first volume of his condensed translation of ‘Abaqat into Arabic, quotes the statements of various scholars. Here we will confine ourselves to the opinion expressed by the great scholar ‘Allamah Aqa Buzurg Tehrani, the author of Al- Dhari'a ila tasanif al-Shi'a, says about Syed Hamid Hussain: من أكابر متكلمي الامامية وأعاظم علماء الشيعة المتبحرين في أوليات هذا القرن ، كان كثير التتبع ، واسع الاطلاع والإحاطة بالآثار والاخبار والتراث الإسلامي ، بلغ في ذلك مبلغا لم يبلغه أحد من معاصريه ولا المتأخرين عنه ، بل ولا كثير من أعلام القرون السابقة ، أفنى عمره الشريف في البحث عن اسرار الديانة والذب عن بيضة الإسلام وحوزة الدين الحنيف ، ولا أعهد في القرون المتأخرة من جاهد جهاده وبذل في سبيل الحقائق الراهنة طارفه وتلاده ، ولم تر عين الزمان في جميع الأمصار والاعصار مضاهيا له في تتبعه وكثرة اطلاعه ودقته وذكائه وشدة حفظه وضبطه. \\"(He is) one of the greatest of Imami theologians (mutakallimun) and one of the greatest and deeply learned of Shi’i scholars who lived in the early part of this century. He was profoundly learned, and had extensive knowledge and mastery over the Islamic traditions and heritage and attained such a station in it that none of his contemporaries or anyone of those who came after him, or even most of the celebrities of the preceding centuries, have been able to attain.

The Reformer covers all of Windham County, Vermont, as well as some towns in neighboring Cheshire County, New Hampshire. It is owned by New England Newspapers. It is the only newspaper in the United States called \\"Reformer.\\"States Newspaper List ==History from 19th to mid-20th century== The Reformer published its first issue, under the name Windham County Reformer, in 1876. Publisher Charles N. Davenport, a prominent lawyer and supporter of the Democratic Party. Davenport founded the paper in part due to dissatisfaction with what he saw as a Republican bias in the coverage by the Vermont Phoenix, the main political paper in the state. The presidential campaign at the time, between Republican Rutherford B. Hayes and Democrat Samuel J. Tilden prompted the Vermont Record and Farmer, the third paper in the state, to describe the new paper as dedicated to \\"Tilden and reform.\\" Some local historians believe that the original conception of the paper was for it to last only for the duration of the 1876 campaign. Davenport's son, Charles H. inherited the paper on his father's death, running the paper for twenty-five years until 1901. The paper went from a weekly to twice-weekly publication schedule in 1897. While the paper had financial troubles for many years, it managed to maintain a continuous publication schedule. Charles H sold the paper to G. Ullery, who then sold the paper to the Vermont Printing company in 1903. The new editors turned the paper away from its partisan Democrat emphasis. The Phoenix and Reformer were merged in March 1913 under the management of the newly formed Brattleboro Publishing Company, one half owned by Walter Hubbard and the other half by Ephraim Crane and Howard Crosby Rice. Rice became the publisher and editor in 1918. The Phoenix served as the Reformer's weekly companion. Moreover, the Reformer went to a daily publication schedule. The Phoenix weekly was discontinued in 1955. Howard Rice was publisher and editor of the Reformer until he handed over the editor post to his son-in-law, John Simpson Hooper, in 1950, and the publisher post in 1964. John Hooper was editor and publisher of the Reformer until he retired in 1971. He was instrumental in turning the paper from a Republican to an independent paper, described on its masthead as: \\"An independent newspaper, dedicated to conservation and progress in public and humane affairs\\". In 1971, Norman Runnion became managing editor until 1989.Brattleboro Daily Reformer, Tuesday November 6, 1984. The 1913 merger was considered by some to be the \\"true\\" founding date of the paper; according to an article in the March 4, 1925 issue, \\"Daily Reformer Now 15 Years Old\\": :The Brattleboro Daily Reformer celebrated yesterday its 15th anniversary as a daily. As a weekly publication The Reformer dates back to the dim and distant date of 1876, but its debut as a daily – with that word ‘Daily’ in emphatic black-face letter-spaced Gothic type on its first page – came on Monday, March 3, 1913. Records at the Brooks Memorial Library, the main library of Brattleboro, list the publication history of the paper in 2006 as :Windham County Reformer, 1876-1897 :Semi- weekly Windham County Reformer, 1897-1901 :Windham County Reformer, 1901-1912, :Brattleboro Daily Reformer (after merger with Vermont Phoenix), 1913-1955 :Brattleboro Daily Reformer and Vermont Phoenix, 1955-1973 :Brattleboro Reformer, 1973-present Much of the historical information in this section comes from a special 1981 section of the Reformer, published on the occasion of the paper's moving from downtown Brattleboro to its headquarters on Black Mountain Road. ==The Reformer in the late-20th and 21st centuries== By the time Howard Rice died, he wholly owned the Reformer, leaving it in his will to his three children, Howard, Eleanor and Marion (and her husband John Hooper). It was then sold to the Miller Group of Newspapers in Pittsfield, Mass. By January 2015, it was owned by New England Newspaper Incorporated, under corporate owner, Digital First Media, which at the time was trying to sell off its 76 daily and 160 weekly newspapers. By July 2015, the Reformer had only two reporters left and the editor post was shared with the Bennington Banner. New England Newspapers was sold to local owners in 2016. The Reformer was possibly the first newspaper in the United States to run same-sex union announcements in parallel to the usual wedding notices, beginning the practice in 1989, well before the state of Vermont legalized civil unions. In the past the paper has been controversial for running letters to the editor that many have found offensive;Poynter Online - Romenesko in 2003 it ran an anti-semitic letter whose publication the then–managing editor Kathryn Casa defended, saying that \\"only by bringing [bigoted opinions] into the open can we expose and eliminate them.\\" Casa was replaced by Kevin Moran, who was recruited from the North Adams Transcript in Massachusetts, which is also owned by MediaNews Group. Moran moved to work as managing editor at the Berkshire Eagle.Login In November 2005, the Reformer hired Sabina Haskell as the new editor. She had previously been assistant editor at the Rutland Herald and had also run the Bennington Banner. Haskell quit to take a PR job for Republican Vermont governor Jim Douglas in 2007. Then managing news editor Tom D'Errico was promoted to fill the editor position. The publisher of the Reformer, Martin Langeveld, resigned after two years on the job in April 2008. Ed Woods, publisher of the Bennington Banner, replaced him in the same month. ===Staff and union controversies=== The paper was involved in a number of controversies in the years 2003-2004. Union leaders and members of the public protested in 2003, when the management fired a reporter during a campaign to form a union at the Reformer. More than 1,000 people signed a petition that called on Media News to re-hire the union supporter.Union publication accessed March 18, 2008see Boston Globe article published May 22, 20035/18/03 Valley Advocate Valley Advocate Readers complained when the parent company fired managing editor Kathryn Casa without giving a reason in 2004.Managing Editor fired Critics asserted that the firing was in part connected to her liberal politics; on the other hand, Casa was accused of intimidating staff into voting against a union drive. Judith Gorman, a columnist for the paper, resigned in protest following Casa's dismissal; about 150 people protested Casa's dismissal outside the Reformer offices on April 25 of that year. == Footnotes == ==References== * Kevin O'Conner, “The Reformer: From a Campaign Sheet to a Daily Newspaper.” Brattleboro Reformer, 17 November 1981, supplement: \\"Then and Now: The Brattleboro Reformer,\\" pp. 18–21. ==External links== * Category:MediaNews Group publications Category:Newspapers published in Vermont Category:Windham County, Vermont Category:Brattleboro, Vermont Category:1876 establishments in Vermont Category:Publications established in 1876 ","title":"Brattleboro Reformer"},{"id":"3249822","text":"The Battle of Shimbra Kure (\\"chickpea swamp\\") was fought in March 1529 between the forces of Adal led by Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi, and the Ethiopian army, under Dawit II (Lebna Dengel).

Illegitimi is presumably the nominative plural of illegitimus meaning \\"unlawful\\" or \\"outlaw\\" in Latin, but interpreted as English \\"illegitimate\\" in the sense of \\"bastard\\", in this case, used as a generic insult.See the discussion in Hugh Rawson, Wicked Words (New York: Crown Publishing Group, 1989), pp. 36f Illegitimis may be intended as an ablative plural, but if carborundum is intended to resemble a gerundive, it is more likely intended as a dative plural, since the gerundive takes a dative of agent. The meaning, in either case, is \\"by the outlaws/bastards.\\" The second word non is a straightforward negation. The third word, carborundum, is an abrasive used for industrial grinding. It is not a Latin word, but resembles a Latin gerundive, so can be interpreted as \\"fit to be ground\\" or \\"to be ground\\". If carborere (3rd conjugation) were a Latin word meaning \\"to grind down\\", the phrase would be correct Latin for \\"(It/One) must not be ground down by the outlaws\\".

Most individuals with pancreas divisum remain without symptoms or complications. A minority of people with pancreatic divisum may develop episodes of abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting due to acute or chronic pancreatitis. The presence of pancreas divisum is usually identified with cross sectional diagnostic imaging, such as MRI or computed tomography (CT) imaging. In some cases, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is performed, revealing the diagnosis of pancreas divisum. If no symptoms or complications are present, then treatment is not necessary. However, if there is recurrent pancreatitis, then a sphincterotomy of the minor papilla may be necessary. ==Causes== The human embryo begins life with two ducts in the pancreas, the ventral duct and the dorsal duct. Normally, the two ducts will fuse together to form one main pancreatic duct; this occurs in more than 90% of embryos. In approximately 10% of embryos the ventral and dorsal ducts fail to fuse together, resulting in pancreas divisum. In utero, the majority of the pancreas is drained by the dorsal duct which opens up into the minor duodenal papilla. The ventral duct drains the minority of the pancreas and opens into the major duodenal papilla. In adults however, this situation is reversed whereby 70% of the pancreas is drained by the ventral duct. Therefore in pancreas divisum, where fusion of the ducts does not occur, the major drainage of the pancreas is done by the dorsal duct which opens up into the minor papilla. ==Diagnosis== MRCP image of pancreas divisum. The most common and accurate way of diagnosing an individual with this anomaly is by MRCP (Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography) or ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography). This test can demonstrate the presence of two separately draining ducts within the pancreas. Other tests can assist doctors with diagnosis, such as a CT scan and an MRI. ==Treatment== Pancreas divisum in individuals with no symptoms does not require treatment. For cases with mild and infrequent attacks, management may involve a low-fat diet, medications to reduce pain and gastrointestinal reactions, and pancreatic enzyme supplementation. A surgeon may attempt a sphincterotomy by cutting the minor papilla to enlarge the opening and allow pancreatic enzymes to flow normally. During surgery, a stent may be inserted into the duct to ensure that the duct will not close causing a blockage. This surgery can cause pancreatitis in patients, or in rare cases, kidney failure and death. Endoscopic approaches (ERCP) are sometimes used for symptomatic pancreas divisum, which offers the benefit of a less invasive approach compared with surgery. No large-scale clinical studies comparing surgical and endoscopoc approaches are available. == Occurrence == Studies involving autopsy and imaging series indicate that between 6% and 10% of the population have pancreas divisum, but it is asymptomatic in the majority (>95%) of cases. In those who develop symptoms, the symptoms seen in pancreas divisum and pancreatitis with typical anatomy are the same: abdominal pain is common, typically of sudden onset and located in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen and often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. ==References== == External links == * Category:Congenital disorders of digestive system ","title":"Pancreas divisum"},{"id":"3249860","text":"The following ships of the Indian Navy have been named INS Trishul: * was a Type 12, commissioned in 1960, which served in the Portuguese-Indian War and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 * is a , currently in active service with the Indian Navy Category:Indian Navy ship names ","title":"INS Trishul"},{"id":"3249868","text":"Sir Thomas More wearing the Collar of Esses, with the Tudor rose badge of Henry VIII, by Hans Holbein the Younger (1527). A livery collar or chain of office is a collar or heavy chain, usually of gold, worn as insignia of office or a mark of fealty or other association in Europe from the Middle Ages onwards. One of the oldest and best-known livery collars is the Collar of Esses, which has been in continuous use in England since the 14th century. ==History== ===Origins=== Various forms of livery were used in the Middle Ages to denote attachment to a great person by friends, servants, and political supporters. The collar, usually of precious metal, was the grandest form of these, usually given by the person the livery denoted to his closest or most important associates, but should not, in the early period, be seen as separate from the wider phenomenon of livery badges, clothes and other forms. From the collar hung a badge or device indicating the person the livery related to; the most important part of the ensemble for contemporaries. Equally gold collars that had no livery connotations were worn. Livery collars seem to be first recorded in the 14th century. Charles V of France in 1378 granted to his Chamberlain Geoffrey de Belleville the right of bearing in all feasts and in all companies the collar of the Cosse de Geneste or Broomcod, a collar which was accepted and worn even by the English kings, Charles VI sending such collars to Richard II and to his three uncles. Although he distributed \\"genet\\" badges much more widely, only about twenty collars per year were given out, and it was treated somewhat as the sign of a pseudo-chivalric order, although no such order formally existed.Crane, 19 The collar of Esses is first recorded earlier than this, as being given by John of Gaunt, and remained in use by the House of Lancaster throughout the Wars of the Roses.Collar of Esses This French type of collar, a chain of couples of broomcods linked by jewels, is seen in the contemporary Wilton Diptych portrait of Richard II, with Richard's own device of the white hart hanging below (the angels accompanying the Virgin also wear Richard's livery badges). The same collar was worn by Henry IV on the way to his crowning. During the sitting of the Parliament of England in 1394 the complaints of Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel against Richard II are recorded, one of his grievances being that the king had been wearing the livery collar of his uncle John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, and that people of the king's following wore the same livery. To which the king answered that soon after the return from Spain (in 1389) of his uncle, the duke, he himself took the collar from his uncle's neck, putting it on his own, which collar the king would wear and use for a sign of the good and whole- hearted love between them, even as he wore the liveries of his other uncles. Livery collars of the king of France, of Queen Anne and of the dukes of York and Lancaster are recorded amongst the royal plate and jewels which in the first year of Henry IV had come to the king's hands. The inventory shows that Queen Anne's collar, was made up of sprigs of rosemary garnished with pearls. The York collar had falcons and fetterlocks, and the Lancaster collar was doubtless that Collar of Esses used by the duke's son, Henry of Bolingbroke (Henry IV), as an earl, duke and king. ==Collar of Esses == This famous livery collar, which has never passed out of use, takes many forms, its Esses being sometimes linked together chainwise, and sometimes, in early examples, as the ornamental bosses of a garter-shaped strap-collar. The oldest effigy bearing it is that in Spratton church of Sir John Swynford, who died in 1371. Swynford was a follower of John of Gaunt, and the date of his death easily disposes of the theory that the Esses were devised by Henry IV to stand for his motto or \\"word\\" of Soverayne. Many explanations are given of the origin of these letters, but none has as yet been established. During the reigns of Henry IV,\\"Henry VIII-era chain up for sale\\", 5 October 2008, BBC.com his son (Henry V), and grandson (Henry VI), the collar of Esses was a royal badge of the Lancastrian house and party, the white swan, as in the Dunstable Swan Jewel, usually being its pendant. In one of Henry VI's own collars the S was joined to the broomcod of the French device, symbolizing the king's claim to the two kingdoms. The kings of the house of York and their chief followers wore the Yorkist collar of suns and roses, with the white lion of March, the Clare bull, or Richard's white boar for a pendant device. Henry VIII brought back the collar of Esses, a portcullis or a Tudor rose hanging from it, although in a portrait of him, in the Society of Antiquaries, he wears the rose en soleil alternating with knots, and his son (later Edward VI), when young, had a collar of red and white roses. It was presented to ministers and courtiers, and came to represent more a symbol of office by the time of Elizabeth I. In modern times the Collar of Esses is worn, on state occasions only, by the Kings and Heralds of Arms, by the Lord Chief Justice and by Serjeants-at- Arms.. The term \\"Collar of SS\\" was preferred by Victorian antiquaries.. Since World War II, as \\"SS\\" is usually associated with the Schutzstaffel, the term is less often used because of its Nazi connotation. ==Private livery collars== Drawing of detail of mermaid collar of Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley (d. 1417), from his monumental brass at Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire Besides these royal collars, the 14th and 15th centuries show many private devices. A monumental brass at Mildenhall shows a knight whose badge of a dog or wolf circled by a crown hangs from a collar with edges suggesting a pruned bough or the ragged staff. Thomas of Markenfield (d. c. 1415) on his brass at Ripon has a strange collar of park palings with a badge of a hart in a park, and Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley (d. 1417) wears one set with mermaids, the Berkeley family heraldic badge.Davis, C. T. The Monumental Brasses of Gloucestershire, London, 1899. Davis correctly states the date of death as 1417, yet incorrectly calls him 4th Lord in place of 5th. ==Renaissance chains== In the Renaissance, gold chains tended to replace collars, and portrait miniature of the donor tended to replace the earlier badges with symbolic devices, although \\"picture boxes\\" containing miniatures could be highly extravagant pieces of jewellery. The Elizabethan artist Nicholas Hilliard was both a goldsmith and miniaturist, and so produced the whole of pieces like the Armada Jewel, given by Queen Elizabeth I of England to a courtier. When the Earl of Rutland returned from an embassy to Denmark, sixteen members of his party were given chains of gold with the James I of England's picture, and others received just a picture.Strong 1975, pp. 16-17 During the sixteenth century collars became marks of a specific office or Order, and subsequently remained so. ===Mayoral collars=== Susan Fennell, then-mayor of Brampton, Ontario, Canada from 2000 to 2014, pictured wearing a modern mayoral collar. Most British and Irish mayors wear a collar/chain of office, and new ones are still designed for new municipalities. The mayor's spouse may have a much smaller version. These are worn over normal clothes when on official duties. Following British practice, most Canadian, Australian and New Zealand mayors also wear chains of office. The custom also spread outside the Commonwealth, to Germany (originally only Prussia) in 1808, to the Netherlands by royal decree in 1852 and to Norway after the mayor of Oslo received one as a gift in 1950, and most Norwegian mayors now have mayoral chains. ===Collars of orders of knighthood=== Schatzkammer in Vienna, Austria. Charles d'Amboise in the cockleshell collar of the Order of Saint Michael, 1507 The insignia of a knight of the Order of the Garter. Collars of various devices are worn by the knights of some of the European orders of knighthood. The custom was begun by Philip III, Duke of Burgundy, who gave his knights of the Golden Fleece, badges of a golden fleece hung from a collar of flints, steels and sparks. Following this new fashion, Louis XI of France, when instituting his order of St. Michael in 1469, gave the knights collars of scallop shells linked on a chain. The chain was doubled by Charles VIII, and the pattern suffered other changes before the order lapsed in 1830. At the end of the 18th century most of the European orders had only one rank—that of Knight—and although they usually had collars the cross or badge was now worn on a ribbon around the neck or over the right shoulder. When the orders became more democratic several ranks were introduced and only the highest grade, the Grand Commanders or Grand Crosses, wore collars. The Netherlands never had collars but several Belgian, most of the Austrian and Prussian orders and several Portuguese orders had collars. In Portugal all the members of these orders of knighthood wore a collar but the collars of the Grand-crosses were more elaborate. In England, until the reign of Henry VIII, the Order of the Garter, most ancient of the great knightly orders, had no collar. But the Tudor king must needs match in all things with continental sovereigns, and the present collar of the Garter knights, with its golden knots and its buckled garters enclosing white roses set on red roses, has its origin in the Tudor age. Knights of most of the British orders have collars which are worn on special occasions, but not the Knights Bachelor or holders of decorations such as the Distinguished Service Order, the Order of Merit, The Order of the Companions of Honour and the Imperial Service Order. The Royal Victorian Chain is a collar and there are no other insignia. In France, Emperor Napoleon I introduced the \\"Grand aigle\\", a collar, as the highest rank in his Légion d'honneur. It did not survive his downfall. Sometimes the collar is the insignia of office of the Grand Master of the order; the French president therefore wears the collar of the Order of the Légion d'honneur. In other countries such as Brazil the collar is a rank above that of a Grand Cross and it is reserved for the president and foreign heads of state. ===Collars of Freemasonry=== Collars also have a long history within Freemasonry. Collars are often worn by officers of high rank. Nearly all Grand Lodge officers wear collars as an emblem of their office. In history, many such collars are quite valuable, featuring gold and precious jewels. Collars vary widely among Masonic Grand Lodges. While those Lodges working under the Grand Lodge of England have fairly uniform designs, Grand Lodges in the United States vary widely, employing collars made from metal chains backed by velvet, to those made of velvet and embroidered with gold and silver bullion thread. Today, English lodge officers wear a cloth or fabric collar with a simple jewel of their office pendant to it. Each jewel represents a skill or virtue which he possesses and instructs the brothers of Masonry in. In some jurisdictions, these jewels are silver-plated for the Craft or Blue Lodges under 100 years old, or gold-plated for lodges older than 100 years.

Among his most famous songs are: Zoek de zon op' (Look for the sun), Schep vreugde in het leven (Put joy in life) and Louise zit niet op je nagels te bijten (Louise, don't bite your nails). ==Early life== Lodewijk Ferdinand Dieben was raised in a working-class family in The Hague. ==Career== Dieben worked as a piccolo, house servant, street singer and as a conscriptionist with the Navy before he started a serious career in variety in 1915. At first he performed together with his brother under the name The Bandy Brothers (Bandy being an Anglicisation of his last name Dieben with the syllables reversed.) Soon ts became apparent that the characters of the brothers were too different to work together; in contrast with Willy, Lou was known as a difficult person. Lou continued under the name Lou Bandy. In 1921 he married the pianist Eugenie Küch, a German officer's daughter who would have a great impact on his career: she taught him decent social skills, taught him the importance of speaking proper Dutch, and helped him get his first lucrative contracts. With her support, the young man from the Hague found himself within a few years working with the top artists and theater impresarios. Bandy was known by the public as a singer of happy lyrics, but to those who knew him better, he had a less upbeat image. He also married the much younger Sinia Franke in 1948, and in 1952 married 19-year-old girl Carla van den Hurk. He divorced Carla in 1958 and was getting lonely.

After executing the Inca Atahualpa in 26 July 1533, Francisco Pizarro marched his forces to Cusco, the capital of the Incan Empire. As the Spanish army approached Cusco, however, Pizarro sent his brother Juan Pizarro and Hernando de Soto ahead with forty men. The advance guard fought a pitched battle with Incan troops in front of the city, securing victory. The Incan army under the command of Quizquiz withdrew during the night. The next day, 15 November 1533, Pizarro entered Cusco, accompanied by Manco Inca Yupanqui, a young Inca prince who had survived the massacre that Quizquiz had done to the nobility in Cusco. The Spanish plundered Cusco, where they found much gold and silver. Manco was crowned as Sapa Inca and helped Pizarro to drive Quizquiz back to the North. Quizquiz was eventually killed, after being struck down by his own followers, leaving none to lead the Inca Empire, since his only equal commander, Chalkuchimac, had been burned in captivity.

Designed in 1960 by John H.D. Madin and Partners (partner in charge, D.V. Smith, project architects Ronald E. Cordin and Ramon K. Wood). It was one of the earliest buildings to follow the podium and slab block form of architecture inspired by Lever House in New York City and it became the oldest example of such architecture in the UK once the Castrol Building in London had been redeveloped. It was home to the Birmingham Post and Evening Mail newspapers following its completion in 1964. The tower had a concrete core surrounded by a steel structure designed by Structural Engineers (Roy Bolsover and Associates) who were also the engineers on many other landmark buildings in the Birmingham area during this period. The tower was clad in aluminium. The concrete beams in the podium were clad in black Argentine granite enclosing fillets of white Sicilian marble. At the time of completion, it was hailed as great achievement by Douglas Hickman in his book Birmingham published in 1970 on buildings in Birmingham. John H.D. Madin and Partners used it as their greatest achievement along with Birmingham Central Library which was completed ten years after the Post and Mail building. The entrance hall to the tower was located at the left hand end of the podium. To the left of the editorial block is the printing works with a composing room at top, a two-storey publishing area below it, and a machine hall in a deep basement. == Demolition and redevelopment == Phase 1 completed, 2015 During the building's lifetime, two attempts to give it listed status failed and demolition began. Demolition consisted of an excavator being placed on the top of the building and excavating through the building's core. It was deemed unsafe to destroy the building through explosives due to the listed buildings nearby and the disruption it would cause to transport links. The original building was demolished between 2005 and 2006. The new development is being undertaken by Chatham Billingham Investments and will incorporate a below ground 752-space car park, 31,600 sq.ft of retail space, 7-storeys of grade A office space (245,630 sq.ft), and 7-storeys of residential space including for 115 apartments and 10 penthouse apartments. The first phase of the redevelopment was undertaken by Balfour Beatty Construction, which included the below ground car park levels, and 3 above ground floors including for a new arcade and the retail spaces, as well as future shell and core entrances for the future offices and residential floors. The work was largely completed by summer 2015 with the car park open for business shortly thereafter. Planning approval for the future phases (phase 2) was granted by Birmingham City Council in July 2015. Construction work is expected to restart in 2016 with completion expected to be in 2018. ==See also== *List of tallest buildings and structures in Birmingham ==References== ==External links== *The Twentieth Century Society.org: Birmingham Post and Mail building *Emporis entry: Post and Mail building, Birmingham Category:Buildings and structures in Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Demolished buildings and structures in the West Midlands (county) Category:Newspaper headquarters in the United Kingdom Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1964 Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 2005 Category:John Madin Category:Modernist architecture in England ","title":"Post and Mail building, Birmingham"},{"id":"3249926","text":"Accessory pancreas is a rare condition in which small groups of pancreatic cells are separate from the pancreas. They may occur in the mesentery of the small intestine, the wall of the duodenum, the upper part of the jejunum, or more rarely, in the wall of the stomach, ileum, gallbladder or spleen. The condition was first described by Klob in 1859.Klob J. Pancreas accessorium. Zeitschrift der Kaiserl. Königl. Gesellschaft der Aerzte zu Wien 1859; 15:732. Accessory pancreas is a small cluster of pancreas cells detached from the pancreas and sometimes found in the wall of the stomach or intestines. ==Diagnosis== Pancreatic disorders are often accompanied by weakness and fatigue. The past Medical history may reveal previous disorders of the biliary tract or duodenum, abdominal trauma or surgery, and metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus. The medication history should be detailed and specifically include the use of thiazides, furosemide, estrogens, corticosteroids, sulfonamides, and opiates. Note a family history of pancreatic disorders. In the review of systems, obtain a complete description of any pain in the upper abdomen or epigastric area. Symptoms that may be important in relation to pancreatic disorders are pruritus, abdominal pain, dyspnea, nausea, and vomiting. The functional assessment includes data about the patient’s dietary habits and use of alcohol. Note any restlessness, flushing, or diaphoresis during the examination. Vital signs may disclose low- grade fever, tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypotension. Inspect the skin for jaundice. Assess the abdomen for distention, tenderness, discoloration, and diminished bowel sounds. Tests and procedures used to diagnose pancreatic disorders include laboratory analyses of blood, urine, stool, and pancreatic fluid, and imaging studies. Specific blood studies used to assess pancreatic function include measurements of serum amylase, lipase, glucose, calcium, and triglyceride levels. Urine amylase and renal amylase clearance tests may also be ordered. Stool specimens may be analyzed for fat content. The secretin stimulation test measures the bicarbonate concentration of pancreatic fluid after secretin is given intravenously to stimulate the production of pancreatic fluid. ==Treatment== Treatment of accessory pancreas depends on the location and extent of the injured tissue.

These enzymes require visible light (from the violet/blue end of the spectrum) both for their own activation and for the actual DNA repair. The DNA repair mechanism involving photolyases is called photoreactivation. They mainly convert pyrimidine dimers into a normal pair of pyrimidine bases. == Function == Photolyases bind complementary DNA strands and break certain types of pyrimidine dimers that arise when a pair of thymine or cytosine bases on the same strand of DNA become covalently linked. The bond length of this dimerization is shorter than the bond length of normal B-DNA structure which produces an incorrect template for replication and transcription. The more common covalent linkage involves the formation of a cyclobutane bridge. Photolyases have a high affinity for these lesions and reversibly bind and convert them back to the original bases. == Evolution == Photolyase is a phylogenetically old enzyme which is present and functional in many species, from the bacteria to the fungi to plants and to the animals. Photolyase is particularly important in repairing UV induced damage in plants. The photolyase mechanism is no longer working in humans and other placental mammals who instead rely on the less efficient nucleotide excision repair mechanism, although they do retain many cryptochromes. Photolyases are flavoproteins and contain two light-harvesting cofactors. Many photolyases have an N-terminal domain that binds a second cofactor. All photolyases contain the two-electron-reduced FADH−; they are divided into two main classes based on the second cofactor, which may be either the pterin methenyltetrahydrofolate (MTHF) in folate photolyases or the deazaflavin 8-hydroxy-7,8-didemethyl-5-deazariboflavin (8-HDF) in deazaflavin photolyases. Although only FAD is required for catalytic activity, the second cofactor significantly accelerates reaction rate in low-light conditions. The enzyme acts by electron transfer in which the reduced flavin FADH− is activated by light energy and acts as an electron donor to break the pyrimidine dimer. On the basis of sequence similarities DNA photolyases can be grouped into a few classes: {align=right +Cryptochrome/photolyase family (2015)  } * Class 1 CPD photolyases are enzymes that process cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) lesions from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, the halophilic archaea Halobacterium halobium. * Class 2 CPD photolyases also process CPD lesions. They are found in plants like the thale cress Arabidopsis thaliana and the rice. * The plant and fungi cryptochromes are similar to Class 1 CPDs. They are blue light photoreceptors that mediate blue light-induced gene expression and modulation of circadian rhythms. * Class 3 CPD lyases make up a sister group to the plant cryptochromes, which in turn are a sister group to class 1 CPDs. * The Cry-DASH group are CPD lyases highly specific for single-stranded DNA. Members include Vibrio cholerae, X1Cry from Xenopus laevis, and AtCry3 from Arabidopsis thaliana. DASH was initially named after Drosophila, Arabidopsis, Synechocystis, and Human, four taxa initially thought to carry this family of lyases. The categorization has since changed. The \\"Cry\\" part of their name was due to initial assumptions that they were cryptochromes. * Eukaryotic (6-4)DNA photolyases form a group with animal cryptochromes that control circadian rhythms. They are found in diverse species including Drosophila and humans. The cryptochromes have their own detailed grouping. * Bacterial 6-4 lyases (), also known as the FeS-BCP group, form their own outgroup relative to all photolyases. The non-class 2 branch of CPDs tend to be grouped into class 1 in some systems such as PRINTS (PR00147). Although the members of the smaller groups are agreed upon, the phylogeny can vary greatly among authors due to differences in methodology, leading to some confusion with authors who try to fit everything (sparing FeS-BCP) into a two-class classification. The cryptochromes form a polyphyletic group including photolyases that have lost their DNA repair activity and instead control circadian rhythms. == Application== Adding photolyase from a blue-green algae Anacystis nidulans, to HeLa cells partially reduced DNA damage from UVB exposure. ==Human proteins containing this domain == CRY1; CRY2; ==Nomenclature== The systematic name of this enzyme class is deoxyribocyclobutadipyrimidine pyrimidine-lyase. Other names in common use include photoreactivating enzyme, DNA photolyase, DNA-photoreactivating enzyme, DNA cyclobutane dipyrimidine photolyase, DNA photolyase, deoxyribonucleic photolyase, deoxyribodipyrimidine photolyase, photolyase, PRE, PhrB photolyase, deoxyribonucleic cyclobutane dipyrimidine photolyase, phr A photolyase, dipyrimidine photolyase (photosensitive), and deoxyribonucleate pyrimidine dimer lyase (photosensitive). This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically in the \\"catch-all\\" class of carbon- carbon lyases. ==References== == Further reading == * * * ==External links== * Category:EC 4.1.99 Category:DNA repair Category:Enzymes of known structure Category:Flavin enzymes ","title":"Photolyase"},{"id":"3249939","text":"Jamia Nazmia is one of the leading centres of Shia Islamic education in the city of Lucknow, India.

Unlike promiscuous mode, which is also used for packet sniffing, monitor mode allows packets to be captured without having to associate with an access point or ad hoc network first. Monitor mode only applies to wireless networks, while promiscuous mode can be used on both wired and wireless networks. Monitor mode is one of the eight modes that 802.11 wireless cards can operate in: Master (acting as an access point), Managed (client, also known as station), Ad hoc, Repeater, Mesh, Wi-Fi Direct, TDLS and Monitor mode. == Uses == Uses for monitor mode include: geographical packet analysis, observing of widespread traffic and acquiring knowledge of Wi-Fi technology through hands-on experience. It is especially useful for auditing unsecure channels (such as those protected with WEP). Monitor mode can also be used to help design Wi-Fi networks. For a given area and channel, the number of Wi-Fi devices currently being used can be discovered. This helps to create a better Wi-Fi network that reduces interference with other Wi-Fi devices by choosing the least used Wi-Fi channels. Software such as KisMAC or Kismet, in combination with packet analyzers that can read pcap files, provide a user interface for passive wireless network monitoring. == Limitations == Usually the wireless adapter is unable to transmit in monitor mode and is restricted to a single wireless channel, though this is dependent on the wireless adapter's driver, its firmware, and features of its chipset. Also, in monitor mode the adapter does not check to see if the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) values are correct for packets captured, so some captured packets may be corrupted. == Operating system support == The Microsoft Windows Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) API has supported extensions for monitor mode since NDIS version 6, first available in Windows Vista. NDIS 6 supports exposing 802.11 frames to the upper protocol levels, while previous versions only exposed fake Ethernet frames translated from the 802.11 frames. Monitor mode support in NDIS 6 is an optional feature and may or may not be implemented in the client adapter driver. The implementation details and compliance with the NDIS specifications vary from vendor to vendor. In many cases, monitor mode support is not properly implemented by the vendor. For example, Ralink drivers report incorrect dBm readings and Realtek drivers do not include trailing 4-byte CRC values. For versions of Windows prior to Windows Vista, some packet analyzer applications such as Wildpackets' OmniPeek and TamoSoft's CommView for WiFi provide their own device drivers to support monitor mode. Linux's interfaces for 802.11 drivers support monitor mode and many drivers offer that support.Aircrack/Aireplay-ng Under Packet Injection Monitor Mode in Windows retrieved September 11, 2007 STA drivers (Ralink, Broadcom) and every other manufacturer’s provided driver doesn’t support monitor mode. FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and DragonFly BSD also provide an interface for 802.11 drivers that supports monitor mode, and many drivers for those operating systems support monitor mode as well. In Mac OS X 10.4 and later releases, the drivers for AirPort Extreme network adapters allow the adapter to be put into monitor mode. Libpcap 1.0.0 and later provides an API to select monitor mode when capturing on those operating systems. == See also == * Promiscuous mode * Comparison of open-source wireless drivers == References == == External links == * * A List of Wi-Fi adapters supporting monitor mode on Linux Category:Network analyzers Category:Wireless networking ","title":"Monitor mode"},{"id":"3249945","text":"The Emin Valley () is located on the China-Kazakhstan border, in Central Asia.

The writer manipulates his brother, John, who is physically impaired with a limp, to help him dispose of the body. Making use of a sack, which is shared between the two men's households for loading and transporting firewood, they stuff the maid inside and dump her into the river. Days later, the sack and body float up and past Stephen's house. He goes onto the water and desperately tries to retrieve it, but fails. The police recover the bundle and, because John's initials have been stenciled on the sack, it is all traceable to him. An inquest is held and, to Stephen's great pleasure, a cloud of suspicion hangs over John, who is tortured by his role in the situation and contemplates suicide. He and Stephen's wife, Marjorie, harbor feelings for each other. Stephen, meanwhile, has used the maid's disappearance and death as publicity for his books. Looking to reap great financial gain, he begins writing a novel specifically about the crime; in it he implicates himself. The circumstances are resolved after Stephen resorts to deliberate attempts at murder. ==Cast== * Louis Hayward as Stephen Byrne * Jane Wyatt as Marjorie Byrne * Lee Bowman as John Byrne * Dorothy Patrick as Emily Gaunt * Ann Shoemaker as Mrs. Ambrose * Jody Gilbert as Flora Bantam * Peter Brocco as Harry – Coroner * Howland Chamberlain as District Attorney * Margaret Seddon as Mrs. Whittaker – Party Guest * Sarah Padden as Mrs. Beach * Kathleen Freeman as Effie Ferguson – Party Guest * Will Wright as Inspector Sarten * Leslie Kimmell as Mr. Gaunt * Effie Laird as Mrs. Gaunt == Production background == Director Fritz Lang wanted to make the character of the murdered maid an African American woman, but the Hays Office was against it as sexual desire between Blacks and Whites was seen as problematic. ==Reception== ===Critical response=== When the film was first released, film critic for The New York Times, Bosley Crowther, panned the film, writing, \\"... we fear that neither the enlightenment nor the excitement that a customer might expect in such a flickering melodrama is provided by this film ... the script by Mel Dinelli, based on a novel by A. P. Herbert, is shy on genuine melodrama, it provides little in the way of suspense (since you know that the killer is bound to get his) and it comes to a weak and cheerless end. It seems that the killer is a novelist and unconsciously writes an exposure in his new book. This is about as measly a way to catch a man as we know.\\"Crowther, Bosley.

More recently, film critic Tom Vick praised the film, writing, \\"Lang beautifully evokes the Victorian era with his customary attention to detail. Cinematographer Edward J. Cronjager's low-key lighting fills the Byrnes mansion with appropriately gloomy shadows, and the moonlit river scenes make it seem as if nature itself is offended by the crime. Avant-garde composer George Antheil's haunting score is the perfect accompaniment to this chilling and unconventional exercise in suspense.\\"Vick, Tom. All Movie Guide by Rovi, film review.

The Swedes, under Count Waldemar von Wrangel (stepbrother of Riksamiral Carl Gustaf Wrangel), had invaded and occupied parts of Brandenburg from their possessions in Pomerania, but were repelled by the forces of Frederick William, the Great Elector, under his Feldmarschall Georg von Derfflinger near the town of Fehrbellin. Along with the Battle of Warsaw (1656), Fehrbellin was crucial in establishing the prestige of Frederick William and Brandenburg- Prussia's army. == Prelude == Prior to the battle the Swedes and Brandenburg had been allies in various wars against the Kingdom of Poland. However, when Elector Frederick William during the Franco-Dutch War had joined an allied expedition with Emperor Leopold I to Alsace against the forces of King Louis XIV of France, the French persuaded Sweden, which had been increasingly isolated on the continent, to attack Brandenburg while her army was away. When Frederick William, encamping at Erstein, heard of the attack and occupation of a large part of his principality in December 1674, he immediately drew his army out of the coalition but had to take winter quarters at Marktbreit in Franconia. Leaving on 26 May 1675, he marched to Magdeburg in only two weeks. This feat was considered one of the great marches in military history. He did it by abandoning his supply wagons and leaving large parts of the infantry behind, having his army buy supplies from the locals, but forbidding pillaging. The Swedes did not expect him to arrive that early. Once he returned to Brandenburg, Frederick William realized that the Swedish forces, occupying the swampy Havelland region between Havelberg and the town of Brandenburg, were dispersed and ordered Derrflinger to take the central town of Rathenow in order to split them roughly down the middle. The elector bribed a local official loyal to him to hold a large and elaborate banquet for the Swedish officers of the fortress in order to get them drunk before the assault began in the night of June 14. This ruse, combined with the speed of the Elector's advance made the Swedes unaware of his arrival. Field Marshal Derfflinger then personally led an attack on Rathenow with 7,000 cavalry and 1,000 musketeers, his approach slowed but hidden by heavy rain. Derfflinger impersonated a Swedish officer and convinced the guards to open the gates of the town by claiming that a Brandenburg patrol was after him. Once the gates were opened for him, he led a charge of 1,000 dragoons against the city and the rest of the army soon followed. He was 69 years old at the time. Once Derfflinger had forced the Swedish garrison from Rathenow, Wrangel pulled back his troops toward Havelberg. His progress was greatly impeded by marshes that the summer rains had turned treacherous. On June 17, the Brandenburgian troops reached Nauen. Meanwhile, Frederick William's advance parties, under the command of Colonel Joachim Hennings and guided by locals, blocked the exits of the area. The Swedes, who had planned to cross the Elbe river in order to join forces with Brunswick troops, were forced back to their last position at Fehrbellin. == Battle == The Swedish commander, Wrangel, found himself hemmed in by a destroyed bridge over the Rhin river by the town of Fehrbellin. Impassable marshes on both flanks left Wrangel little choice but to give battle south of the nearby village of Hakenberg while his engineers repaired the span. Battle of Fehrbellin A total of 6,000–7,000 Brandenburgers with 13 cannons faced 7,000 Swedes with 28 guns. Wrangel omitted to secure the surrounding heights, and Frederick William and Derfflinger, by placing their guns on a series of low hills to his left while the Swedes had only swamps to their flanks and a river behind them, gained a decisive tactical advantage. These guns opened fire around noon on the 18th and caused heavy casualties on the Swedish right flank. Wrangel, now fully aware of the threat, attempted several times to wrest control of the hills but was stopped each time by the Brandenburgian cavalry. This continued for some hours until Frederick William had his main attack press the right flank of the Swedes, eventually causing their cavalry to flee, thereby exposing their Dalwig Guard infantry to a flank attack led by Prince Frederick II of Hesse-Homburg. The Brandenburgian cavalry then turned and routed a regiment of Swedish infantry. The Swedish right however had held up long enough though for the Fehrbellin bridge to be repaired and Wrangel was able to get a large portion of his army across before darkness fell. Frederick William rejected all his officers' suggestions to shell the town. The Brandenburg troops lost about 500 men. Wrangel's forces lost slightly more than the Brandenburgers but it is unclear exactly how many. The Swedish infantry under Delwig lost 300–400 men alone, with 200 additional losses mostly attributed to the cavalry. All in all, the Swedes had lost about 500–600 killed, wounded and captured in the battle Wrangel lost many more in the coming days' retreat due to the pursuit of Brandenburg troops and the wrath of local peasants, some of whom still remembered the Swedes' atrocities during the Thirty Years' War. Of the 1,200 Dalwig Guards, all but 20 were killed or captured. Near Wittstock alone, some 300 Swedes and their officers were slain by peasant raiders. Raiding parties, desertion, and starvation meant that, by July 2, every last Swedish soldier in the Mark had retreated or been killed or captured. Memorial in Hakenberg near Fehrbellin == Historical significance == At the day of battle, the Swedes had no intention to deliver battle beyond joining their forces and moving off, exactly what they accomplished, while the Brandenburgers intended to prevent this, which failed. Regardless the battle became a watershed moment. By established military tradition since classical antiquity, the side that controlled the battlefield at the end was the victor. That honour clearly lay with the Brandenburgers, who proceeded to announce it to the world in no uncertain terms. Upon the Brandenburgian victory, the Holy Roman Empire and Denmark finally met their obligations and declared war on Sweden. While Frederick William's forces invaded Swedish Pomerania, the Swedes did not enter the margraviate again until the 1679 Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, which—to the elector's great disappointment—largely restored the status quo ante bellum. The victory at Fehrbellin had an enormous psychological impact: the Swedes, long considered unbeatable, had been bested and Brandenburg alone had prevailed against Swedish and French power politics. The victory boosted the Prince-Elector, age 56 at the time, who took an active role in the fighting, apparently having to be cut out of an encirclement by his dragoons. Frederick William henceforth was known as the \\"Great Elector\\", and the army that he and Derfflinger had led to victory eventually became the core of the future Prussian Army vital for the country's development as a European great power. Glorified in the course of rising German nationalism under the rule of the House of Hohenzollern in the 19th century, June 18 was a holiday that would be celebrated in Germany up until 1914. In Sweden, the fiasco was one of the main accusation counts against the Privy Council aristocrats at the Riksdag of 1680, where the absolutism of Charles XI was declared. ==Reception== The Battle of Fehrbellin is the setting of Heinrich von Kleist's drama The Prince of Homburg written in 1809-10. However, the story of the prince's insubordination, later popularised by the Prussian king Frederick the Great, may be a legend. An observation tower on the Hakenberg hill with a Victoria statue on top similar to the Berlin Victory Column commemorates the battle. It was erected from 1875 on the initiative of Crown Prince Frederick III and inaugurated on September 2 (Sedantag), 1879. == See also == *Wars and battles involving Prussia *Swedish invasion of 1674/1675 ==Notes== == References == * Christopher C.

It was the first time Québec's defences were tested. Following the capture of Port Royal in Acadia, during King William's War, the New Englanders hoped to seize Québec itself, the capital of New France. The loss of the Acadian fort shocked the Canadiens, and Governor-General Louis de Buade de Frontenac ordered the immediate preparation of the city for siege. When the envoys delivered the terms of surrender, the Governor-General famously declared that his only reply would be by \\"the mouth of my cannons.\\" Major John Walley led the invading army, which landed at Beauport in the Basin of Québec. However, the militia on the shore were constantly harassed by Canadian militia until their retreat, while the expedition's ships, commanded by Sir William Phips, were nearly destroyed by cannon volley fire from the top of the city. Both sides learned from the battle: the French improved the city's defences, while the New Englanders realized they needed more artillery and better support from England to take the city. ==Background== The colony of New France claimed the largest area of North America, although by population it was numerically inferior to the neighbouring colonies of New England and New York. By 1689, there were only about 14,000 settlers in New France, but most of the population lived in towns protected by elaborate forts. In 1690, Sir William Phips was appointed the major-general of Massachusetts, to command an expedition against Acadia. In 1690, Sir William Phips was appointed major- general by Massachusetts to command an expedition against French Acadia. He sailed with seven vessels carrying a 450-strong provincial \\"Foot Regiment\\", and Port Royal surrendered on 21 May. Its governor, Louis-Alexandre des Friches de Menneval, had only about 70 men, and no guns mounted, and would have been unable to resist. On 22 May, Phips recorded \\"We cut down the cross, rifled the Church, pulled down the High-Altar, breaking their images\\"; and on 23 May, \\"kept gathering Plunder both by land and water, and also under ground in their Gardens\\". This shocked the French colonists, who feared that their capital city would be the next target. Québec did not have extensive fortifications in 1690, and the whole landward side of the city to the north and west was exposed, particularly at the Plains of Abraham. Count Frontenac returned to Canada for a second term as Governor-General, and ordered the construction of a wooden palisade to enclose the city from the fort at the Château Saint-Louis to the Saint-Charles River. Town Major Provost oversaw the construction of eleven small stone redoubts in this enceinte, which would have protected against cannon. Facing the plains on the west side was the strong point of the landward defences — a windmill called Mont-Carmel where a three- gun artillery battery was in place. The palisade line ended on the east side of the city, near the hospital. The batteries facing the river were also improved, with eight guns mounted beside the Château and six 18-pounders at the docksides. Temporary obstacles had also been put in place on the street leading up to the upper city. Meanwhile, a mobile war party of 150 Albany militia and Iroquois warriors under Captain John Schuyler marched and canoed overland to Montréal, imitating the petite guerre tactics (long-range expeditions into enemy territory) perfected by the French colonists. Schuyler's expedition was designed to seize Montréal and pin French forces south of Québec, allowing the Boston fleet to sail against the capital unopposed. Smallpox, lack of supplies, and disagreements among the officers caused most of the militia and Iroquois to turn back in disgust, leaving Schuyler with a fraction of the 855 men promised by the New England authorities. On 4 September the English raiders attacked settlements south of Montréal, killing some 50 habitants in the middle of their harvests. Too weak to risk a battle with the town's garrison, Schuyler wrapped up the New England invasion and turned home. Thus, when Phips was sighted off Tadoussac, Frontenac ordered the garrisons of Montréal and Trois-Rivières to make for the threatened capital with all haste. Four days later the Governor arrived in Québec with 200–300 troops freed-up by the failure of Schuyler's invasion, considerably lifting the capital's spirit of resistance. ==Arrival of Phips== While the New England colonies and New York dispatched a force overland against Montréal, which accomplished virtually nothing, Massachusetts launched a separate expedition against Québec. The whole operation had been financed by issuing paper bonds set against the expected booty to be taken from the city. The expedition consisted of about 32 ships (only four of which were of any size) and over 2,300 Massachusetts militiamen, and was under the overall command of Phips, the victor at Port Royal. Its departure was delayed until quite late in the summer because it was waiting (in vain) for the arrival of additional munitions from England. Consequently, when Phips' expedition set out from Hull, Massachusetts on 20 August, it was inadequately supplied with ammunition. Bad weather, contrary winds, and lack of pilots familiar with the Saint Lawrence River hampered progress, and Phips did not anchor in the Québec basin until 16 October. Phips reached Québec in October 1690. Frontenac, a shrewd and experienced officer, reached Québec from Montréal on 14 October. When all the militia whom he had summoned arrived, he had nearly 3,000 men to defend the place. The New Englanders had been \\"quite confident that the cowardly and effete French would be no match for their hardy men\\", but in fact the opposite was the case. Frontenac had reason for confidence, as he possessed a force of three battalions of colonial regulars that were certainly superior to Phips's amateur companies—in the event the regulars were not needed as the Canadien militia succeeded in repulsing Phips' landing parties. Furthermore, the city was \\"sited on the strongest natural position they [the English officers] had likely ever seen.\\" Not only did it have impressive cliffs and Cape Diamond, but the eastern shore was so shallow that ships could not approach and landing craft would be needed. On 16 October, Phips sent Major Thomas Savage as an envoy to deliver a summons of surrender to Frontenac. The encounter has been described as an application of psychological warfare. Before the fighting Frontenac led Phips' envoys blindfolded through roaring mobs in the streets of Québec in order to mask his numerical inferiority. Then, in the Château Saint-Louis, Frontenac and many of his officers in their best dress listened to the envoy as he demanded the city's surrender. Overawed by this \\"stately Hall full of Brave Martiall men\\", Savage did his best to deliver Phip's ultimatum. Drafted by Massachusetts Puritans, the document began severely: The New Englander told them they had one hour to comply, and then pulled out his watch. The proud and temperamental Frontenac was so enraged that he wanted to have the envoy hanged before the full view of the English fleet, and it was only because of the Bishop of Québec, François de Laval, that he was calmed. Asked for a written response, Frontenac shot back: Frontenac famously rebuffs the English envoys. Watercolour on commercial board. Savage accepted his blindfold with relief and was led back to his ship. Phips' council of war was extremely vexed by the reply, having expected to fall upon a defenceless and panicked city. That evening drums and fifes were heard approaching Québec, followed by heavy cheering from the town: Louis-Hector de Callière had arrived with the remaining Montréal militia, giving Frontenac a numerical advantage over the New Englanders. ==Battle== The New Englanders saw that the only possible place to crack the defences was on the city's northeastern side, where the walls were weakest. Their plan was to land their main force on the Beauport shore east of the Saint Charles River, and have it cross the river in the fleet's boats, along with the field guns. When the landing force was on the heights west of Québec, the fleet would attack the city and land a second force there. Frontenac had expected the land attack to come from Beauport, and the banks of the river had already been built up with field fortifications on the southwestern side. He proposed to fight only a skirmishing action there, holding his regulars in reserve for a European-style battle on the open ground west of Québec. However, the open battle never took place. The 1,200-strong English landing force under Major John Walley, Phips' second-in-command, never got across the Saint Charles. Frontenac had sent strong detachments of Canadian militiamen under Jacques Le Moyne de Sainte-Hélène, along with some First Nation warriors, into the wooded areas east of the river. When the English landed on 18 October, they were immediately harassed by Canadian militia, while the ships' boats mistakenly landed the field guns on the wrong side of the Saint Charles. Meanwhile, Phips's four large ships, quite contrary to the plan, anchored before Québec and began bombarding the city until 19 October,Note: Charlevoix's report that the bombardment took place on the 16th, immediately after Frontenac rejected Phips' ultimatum, is certainly inaccurate. at which point the English had shot away most of their ammunition. The French shore batteries had also proved to be much more than a match, and the ships were pounded until the rigging and hulls were badly damaged; the ensign of Phips' flagship the Six Friends was cut down and fell into the river, and under a hail of musket shots, a daring group of Canadians paddled a canoe up to the ships to capture it. They triumphantly brought the ensign back to the Governor unscathed. Map of skirmishing around Québec. During the bombardment, the land force under Walley remained inactive, suffering from cold and complaining of shortage of rum. After a couple of miserable days, they decided to carry the shore positions and try to overcome the French earthworks. They set out on 20 October \\"in the best European tradition, with drums beating and colors unfurled,\\" but there was a skirmish at the edge of the woods. The New Englanders could not cope with the maintained heavy Canadian fire, and the brass field guns fired into the woods had no effect. Although Sainte-Hélène was mortally wounded, 150 of the attackers had been killed in action, and were utterly discouraged. They made a retreat in a state of near panic on 22 October, even abandoning five field guns on the shore. ==Aftermath== On 23 and 24 October, an exchange of prisoners was negotiated and effected, and the ships set sail for Boston. Although Phips' own account of the expedition admitted only 30 dead in combat, smallpox and marine accident claimed about 1,000 more. James Lloyd of Boston wrote in the following January, \\"7 vessels yet wanting 3 more cast away & burnt.\\" Cotton Mather tells how one brigantine was wrecked on Anticosti; her crew maintained themselves on the island through the winter and were apparently rescued the following summer by a ship from Boston. Phips' defeat was complete and disastrous; fortunately for the French, since food was lacking to feed the large force assembled to defend Quebec in case of a prolonged siege. Phips himself had displayed no natural military talents to offset his lack of experience. It can be argued however that the absence of trained soldiers and adequate supplies had doomed the enterprise from the start. Governor of New York Henry Sloughter captured the mood in the English colonies when he wrote: Québec in 1700, after the new fortifications were completed. Although victorious, the French realized that the city's defences needed significant improvement. Canada exulted in its victory and survival; on 5 November the Te Deum was sung in Québec in the chapel of a new church that would be named Notre Dame de la Victoire, Our Lady of Victory. When news of the expedition reached Versailles, Louis XIV ordered a medal struck bearing the inscription: Kebeca liberata M.DC.XC–Francia in novo orbe victrix, or \\"Deliverance of Québec 1690–France victorious in the New World.\\" Jacques Le Moyne, who died soon after the battle, was mourned by the whole colony for his courtesy and valour. The Onondaga Iroquois sent a wampum collar as a token of sympathy, and released two captives to honour his memory. His brother, Charles Le Moyne, won fame for his part in the battle, and he later received an additional grant of land for his services and became the first Baron de Longueuil. Both sides learned from the battle. The French victory showed that to take Québec, the cannon of \\"Old England would have to be brought in\\". Similarly, Frontenac realised the defences needed significant improvement, and in 1692, he gave Ingénieur du Roi Josué Berthelot de Beaucours the task of designing a fortress that could withstand a European-style siege. This was delayed by the Canadian winter, and work commenced in the summer of 1693 on an earth rampart with large bastions to enclose the city, and pointed wooden stakes to top the walls. A complete shore battery, known as the \\"Royal battery\\", was built immediately after the siege. It was shaped like a small bastion, and featured 14 gun embrasures to cover both sides of the Saint Laurence and the river itself. Although another expedition was launched against Québec during Queen Anne's War, it failed to reach its target when transports wrecked with great loss of life in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The city's improved defences would not be tested until the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in 1759. ==Notes== ==References== * * ==External links== * Category:King William's War Category:Battles involving England Category:Battles involving Canada Category:Conflicts in Quebec Category:Conflicts in 1690 Category:1690 in Canada Category:1690 in the Thirteen Colonies Battle of (1690) Category:1690 in New France ","title":"Battle of Quebec (1690)"},{"id":"3250002","text":"Larry Zolf (July 19, 1934 – March 14, 2011)\\"CBC journalist Larry Zolf dies\\". cbc.ca, March 14, 2011. was a Canadian journalist and commentator.

Wojnowski, a retired ironworker, stands on Massachusetts Avenue during afternoon rush hour holding signs with slogans such as \\"My Life Was Ruined by a Catholic Pedophile Priest\\" and \\"Pedophilia: Catholic Clergy's Sordid 'Professional Secret'\\". ==Reaction== Washington Metro Red Line in 2007 Since thousands of commuters pass the traffic signal at the Vatican embassy each day, Wojnowski's protest is familiar to many Washington, DC and Maryland residents. The initial reaction to Wojnowski was somewhat hostile with many passing motorists yelling curses and some even physically threatening him. He reports that at one point his sign was ripped from his hands, thrown in the back of a pickup truck and stolen. However, media focus on the Catholic sex abuse scandal has sometimes led to a more supportive reaction. However, many remain angered at what they perceive as anti-Catholic bigotry. ==Background== Wojnowski's father was a librarian for a Catholic university in Italy. Wojnowski and his two younger brothers grew up in Italy and attended Catholic schools. When he was 14 or 15, he and his brothers spent a month camping alone in the mountains. According to Wojnowski, a village priest in the area offered to tutor him in Latin, and while he was visiting the rectory sexually molested him. He failed to finish school, and at age 18 left Italy for Canada, where he worked at odd jobs. He came to the United States in 1963, served in the army and worked as a laborer. He found a wife on a 1968 trip to Poland and had two children with her. Wojnowski says his wife left him after 30 years when ironworker jobs became scarce in the 1990s. He lists his past inability to keep a job as just one of many consequences of his alleged molestation. He says \\"It was so traumatizing. I repressed the memory of that moment, but I ruined my life. My temper changed, my appearance changed. I was avoiding people. I felt so insecure, I never talked to anyone.\\" In 1997, Wojnowski's memory of molestation was revived by newspaper accounts of Rudy Kos, an abusive priest from Texas, sentenced to life in prison and whose victims were awarded $119 million in damages. The case, and the huge damage award, got him thinking. He spoke to a priest in Maryland who helped him get church-paid therapy and advised him to seek financial compensation through the Archdiocese of Washington. According to Wojnowski, after some correspondence and long delays, the archdiocese informed him that the Italian priest was dead and that there would be no compensation.

As a young girl, she worked first as a housemaid and then as a salesgirl in a tobacco shop.\\"Heroes of the Holocaust:Austria\\", Catholic Heritage Curricula In 1913 she became a nurse at the municipal hospital in the Lainz neighborhood of the city. While working as a nurse, Kafka met members of the Franciscan Sisters of Christian Charity () and entered their congregation the following year, at the age of 20. She was given the religious name of Maria Restituta, after a 4th-century Christian martyr. After her completion of the novitiate and her profession of simple vows in the congregation, she returned to work at the Lainz Hospital, where she remained until 1919. While working there, she promoted the practice of holistic medicine for the patients. In 1919, after the First World War, Kafka was transferred to a hospital in the suburban town of Mödling, eventually becoming its leading surgical nurse. ===Conflict and martyrdom=== The Mödling hospital was not spared the effects of the 1938 Anschluss, in which Germany annexed Austria. Kafka was very vocal in her opposition to the new regime, which had immediately begun to implement the Nuremberg Laws established by the Nazi Party in Germany upon its acquisition of power. A Viennese cannot keep her mouth shut, she said.\\"Biographies of Blesseds, L'Osservatore Romano, June 24 1998 When a new hospital wing was constructed, Kafka kept to traditional Catholic practice and hung a crucifix in every room. The Nazi authorities demanded that the crosses be taken down, threatening her dismissal, but she refused. The crucifixes were not removed, nor was Kafka, since the Franciscan community said that they could not replace her. Kafka continued in her vocal criticism of the Nazi government and several years later was denounced by a doctor who strongly supported the regime. On Ash Wednesday 1942 (18 February of that year), while coming out of the operating theater, Kafka was arrested by the Gestapo and accused, not only of hanging the crucifixes, but also of having dictated a poem mocking Hitler. On 29 October 1942 she was sentenced to death by the guillotine by the Volksgerichtshof for \\"favouring the enemy and conspiracy to commit high treason\\". The authorities offered to release her if she would leave the convent, but she refused. When a request for clemency reached the desk of Martin Bormann, head of the Nazi Party Chancellery, he replied that her execution would provide \\"effective intimidation\\" for others who might want to resist the Nazis. Kafka spent the rest of her days in prison, where she was noted for caring for other prisoners. During this period, she wrote in a letter from the prison: > It does not matter how far we are separated from everything, no matter what > is taken from us: the faith that we carry in our hearts is something no one > can take from us. In this way we build an altar in our own hearts. Kafka was sent to the guillotine on 30 March 1943. She was 48 years old. ==Veneration== On 21 June 1998, on the occasion of Pope John Paul II's visit to Vienna, Kafka was beatified by him. She was the first female martyr of Vienna. Kafka, the only Religious Sister to be formally condemned to death under the Nazi regime, was commemorated in Rome on the evening of 4 March 2013, in the Basilica of San Bartolomeo all'Isola on Tiber Island, with a liturgy of the word at which Cardinal Christoph Schönborn presided. During the service, the Franciscan Sisters of Christian Charity gave to the basilica a small cross which Kafka had worn on the belt of her religious habit. The relic was placed in the chapel there which remembers the martyrs of Nationalist Socialism.\\"The Cross of Christ versus the swastika of Hitler\\" L'Osservatore Romano, March 6, 2103. In Kafka's honor, the western half of Weyprechtgasse, a lane running before Mödling Hospital, was renamed Schwester-Maria-Restituta- Gasse. Also there is a park named in her honor in her native Husovice: Park Marie Restituty. ==References== == External links == * Catholic Forum Page about Maria Restituta * Franziskaner Page about Maria Restituta * Katolsk Page about Maria Restituta * Santi Beati Page about Maria Restituta Category:1894 births Category:1943 deaths Category:Austrian Roman Catholic religious sisters and nuns Category:Czech Roman Catholic religious sisters and nuns Category:Austrian nurses Category:People condemned by Nazi courts Category:Executed Austrian people Category:Executed Czech people Category:People executed by guillotine by Nazi Germany Category:Beatifications by Pope John Paul II Category:Austrian beatified people Category:Czech beatified people Category:Franciscan beatified people Category:Franciscan martyrs Category:Catholic saints and blesseds of the Nazi era Category:Executed German Resistance members Category:19th-century venerated Christians Category:20th-century venerated Christians Category:20th-century Roman Catholic martyrs Category:People from the Margraviate of Moravia Category:Austrian people of Czech descent Category:People from Brno Category:People from Brigittenau ","title":"Maria Restituta Kafka"},{"id":"3250045","text":"Ponceau 6R, or Crystal ponceau 6R, Crystal scarlet, Brilliant crystal scarlet 6R, Acid Red 44, or C.I. 16250, is a red azo dye.

Later on, he also played more serious and varied roles; he has also starred in Huset på Christianshavn, Matador and as various minor characters in the Olsen-banden films. For almost thirty years Reichhardt was a leading Danish heroic charmer in movies and partly also on stage. His acting debut was in 1931 as an extra in the play Styrmand Karlsens flammer in Nørrebros Theater. Already during the 1930s he won himself a name, this was cemented during World War II and from 1945 he stood as the movie hero par excellence: the plain, regular, quick- witted, sometimes hot-tempered, but often humorous man playing in melodramas and comedies. His versatile talent of acting and singing created him a widespread area as an artist. Poul Reichhardt got a special popularity during his performing in the so-called Morten Korch movies in the 1950s based upon novels written by a just as popular Danish regionalist light literate – here he normally played the honest young farmer fighting for his happiness and for his love. Often criticised for playing in low quality products he always did his best even in poor roles and his temporary overplay and loudness was compensated by his engagement and self-irony. Perhaps his best movie roles were as a resistance man (De røde Enge - \\"The Red Meadows\\", 1945), and as the soldier in Soldaten og Jenny, (\\"The Soldier and Jenny\\", 1947. His ability as a singer even made him opera roles (Papageno in The Magic Flute) and though normally considered a typical \\"man of the people\\" he also mastered the role as a man of the world. Besides his many popular roles Reichhardt also, mostly on stage, emerged into a respected character actor (Biff and later Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman, Archie in Osborne's The Entertainer, several Shakespeare roles). He also dubbed the animated films Fantasia and The Sword in the Stone when they were released in Danish. Not leaving the heroic line until relatively late he won a new popularity in elder roles also on TV. Perhaps his most popular one was as the blustering and intolerant but yet sympathetic furniture remover Olsen in the series Huset på Christianshavn (\\"The House on Christianshavn\\").

The field of token coins is part of exonumia and token coins are token money. Tokens have a denomination either shown or implied by size, color or shape. \\"Tokens\\" are often made of cheaper metals: copper, pewter, aluminium, brass and tin were commonly used, while bakelite, leather, porcelain, and other less durable materials are also known. A key point of difference between a token coin and a legal tender coin is that the latter is issued by a governmental authority and is freely exchangeable for goods. However, a token coin typically has a much more limited use and is often issued by a private company, group, association or individual. In the case of \\"currency tokens\\" issued by a company but also recognized by the state there is a convergence between tokens and currency. ==Currency tokens== Currency tokens issued by a company sometimes ceased to be merely \\"trade\\" tokens when they were sanctioned by a local government authority: perhaps due to a severe shortage of money or the government's inability to issue its own coinage. In effect, the organization behind the tokens became the regional bank. A set of Strachan and Co tokens A classic example of this is the Strachan and Co trade tokens of East Griqualand in South Africa, which were used as currency by the indigenous people in the region from 1874. Their initial success resulted from the scarcity of small change in that remote region at that time. Similarly, in times of high inflation, tokens have sometimes taken on a currency role. Examples of this are Italian and Israeli telephone tokens, which were always good for the same service (i.e. one phone call) even as prices increased. New York City Subway tokens were also sometimes accepted in trade, or even in parking meters, since they had a set value. ==Trade tokens or barter tokens== A brothel token from the Red Dog Saloon. Coin-like objects from the Roman Empire called spintriae have been interpreted as an early form of token. Their functions are not documented, but they appear to have been brothel tokens or possibly gaming tokens.Thomas A. McGinn, The Economy of Prostitution in the Roman World (University of Michigan Press, 2004), p. 86. Medieval English monasteries issued tokens to pay for services from outsiders. These tokens circulated in nearby villages, where they were called \\"Abbot's money\\". Also, counters called jetons were used as small change without official blessing.British Tokens And Their Values, Peter Seaby et al, page 7 of the second edition. From the 17th to the early 19th century in the British Isles and North America, tokens were commonly issued by merchants in times of acute shortage of coins of the state. These tokens were in effect a pledge redeemable in goods, but not necessarily for currency. These tokens never received official sanction from government but were accepted and circulated quite widely. In England, the production of copper farthings was permitted by royal licence in the first few decades of the 17th century, but production ceased during the English Civil War and a great shortage of small change resulted. This shortage was felt more keenly because of the rapid growth of trade in the towns and cities, and this in turn prompted both local authorities and merchants to issue tokens. These tokens were most commonly made of copper or brass, but pewter, lead and occasionally leather tokens are also found. Most were not given a specific denomination and were intended to substitute for farthings, but there are also a large number of halfpenny and sometimes penny tokens. Halfpenny and penny tokens usually, but not always, bear the denomination on their face. Brass trade token from Fort Laramie, Dakota Territory Most such tokens show the issuer's full name or initials. Where initials were shown, it was common practice to show three initials: the first names of husband and wife and their surname. Tokens would also normally indicate the merchant establishment, either by name or by picture. Most were round, but they are also found in square, heart or octagonal shapes. Thousands of towns and merchants issued these tokens from 1648 until 1672, when official production of farthings resumed, and private production was suppressed. There were again coin shortages in the late 18th century, when the British Royal Mint almost ceased production. Merchants once again produced tokens, but they were now machine made and typically larger than their 17th century predecessors, with values of a halfpenny or more. While many were used in trade, they were also produced for advertising and political purposes, and some series were produced for the primary purpose of sale to collectors. These tokens are usually known as Conder tokens, after the writer of the first reference book on them. Show World Center token, New York City, c. 1990 These were issued by merchants in payment for goods with the agreement that they would be redeemed in goods to an equivalent value at the merchants' own outlets. The transaction is therefore one of barter, with the tokens playing a role of convenience, allowing the seller to receive his goods at a rate and time convenient to himself, and the merchant to tie the holder of the token coin to his shop. Trade tokens often gradually changed into barter tokens, as evidenced by the continued circulation of former trade tokens when the need for their use had passed. Aluminum trade token from Osage City, Kansas. In the United States of America, Hard times tokens issued from 1832 to 1844 and Civil War tokens issued in the 1860s made up for shortages of official money.A Guide Book of United States Coins, R. S. Yeoman and Kenneth Bresset, pages 372 and 376 of the 61st edition Because of weight, the U.S. Treasury Department does not ship coins to the Armed Forces serving overseas, so Army and Air Force Exchange Service officials chose to make pogs in denominations of 5, 10, and 25 cents. The pogs are about 38 mm (1.5816\\" to be exact) in diameter, and feature various military-themed graphics. The collecting of trade tokens is part of the field of exonumia, and includes other types of tokens, including transit tokens, encased cents, and many others. In a narrow sense, trade tokens are \\"good for\\" tokens, issued by merchants. Generally, they have a merchant's name or initials, sometimes a town and state, and a value legend (such as \\"good for 5¢\\" or other denomination) somewhere on the token. Merchants that issued tokens included general stores, grocers, department stores, dairies, meat markets, drug stores, saloons, bars, taverns, barbers, coal mines, lumber mills and many other businesses. The era of 1870 through 1920 marked the highest use of \\"trade tokens\\" in the United States, spurred by the proliferation of small stores in rural areas. There were thousands of small general and merchandise stores all over the United States, and many of them used trade tokens to promote trade and extend credit to customers. Aluminum tokens almost always date after 1890, when low-cost production began. ==Slot machine tokens== Token coins in an arcade game. Metal token coins are used in lieu of cash in some coin-operated arcade games and casino slot machines. Money is exchanged for the token coins or chips in a casino at the casino cage, at the gaming tables, or at a slot machine and at a cashier station for slot token coins. The tokens are interchangeable with money at the casino. They generally have no value outside of the casino. After the increase in the value of silver stopped the circulation of silver coins around 1964, casinos rushed to find a substitute, as most slot machines at that time used that particular coin. The Nevada State Gaming Control Board consulted with the U.S. Treasury, and casinos were soon allowed to start using their own tokens to operate their slot machines. The Franklin Mint was the main minter of casino tokens at that time. In 1971, many casinos adopted the Eisenhower Dollar for use in machines and on tables. When the dollar was replaced with the Susan B. Anthony dollar in 1979, most casinos reinstituted tokens, fearing confusion with quarters and not wishing to extensively retool their slot machines. Those casinos which still use tokens in slot machines still use Eisenhower-sized ones. In many jurisdictions, casinos are not permitted to use currency in slot machines, necessitating tokens for smaller denominations. Tokens are being phased out by many casinos in favor of coinless machines which accept banknotes and print receipts for payout. (These receipts - often nicknamed \\"TITOs\\" for Ticket-in, ticket-out, can also be inserted into the machines.) In video arcades, they are also being phased out in favor of magnetic cards, which can also count how many tickets one has, allowing arcades to also do away with paper tickets. ==Staff tokens== A de Beers 3d staff salary token given to employees and only usable at their stores. Staff tokens were issued to staff of businesses in lieu of coins. In the 19th century the argument supporting payment to staff was the shortage of coin in circulation, but in reality employees were forced to spend their wages in the company's stores at highly inflated prices—resulting in an effective dramatic lowering of their actual salary and disposable income. ==Other uses== Obverse and reverse of a Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) single-ride token (designed in 2006). With the arrival of the inter-regional Presto smart card, the TTC plans to phase them out by the end of 2019.Philadelphia Transportation Company transit tokens (1940-68) Railways and public transport agencies used fare tokens for years, to sell rides in advance at a discount, or to allow patrons to use turnstiles geared only to take tokens (as opposed to coins, currency, or fare cards).

This system was in effect in Brazil until 1997 when magnetic cards were introduced. The practice was also recently discontinued in Israel, leading to a trend of wearing the devalued tokens as necklaces. * Fast food restaurants – Often given to children to collect and redeem for prizes. * Commemorative coins have been produced with no monetary value to distribute by a company, country or organization. In North America tokens were originally issued by merchants from the 18th century in regions where national or local colonial governments did not issue enough small denomination coins for circulation. They were later used to create a monopoly; to pay labor; for discounts (pay in advance, get something free or discounted); or for a multitude of other reasons. In the United States, a well-known type is the wooden nickel, a five-cent piece distributed by cities to raise money for their anniversaries in the 1940s to 1960s. Local stores, saloons and mercantiles would issue their own tokens as well, usable only in their own shops. Railways and public transport agencies have used fare tokens for years to sell rides in advance at a discount. Many transport organizations still offer their own tokens for bus and subway services, toll bridges, tunnels, and highways, although the use of computer-readable tickets has replaced these in most areas. Churches used to give tokens to members passing a religious test prior to the day of communion, then required the token for entry. While mostly Scottish Protestant, some U.S. churches used communion tokens. Generally, these were pewter, often cast by the minister in church- owned molds. Replicas of these tokens have been made available for sale at some churches recently. ==See also== ==References and sources== ;References ;Sources * \\"Church Tokens\\", New York Times, 11 April 1993 ==Further reading== *Angus, Ian.

This portion of the pancreas can constrict the duodenum and block or impair the flow of food to the rest of the intestines. It is estimated to occur in 1 out of 12,000 to 15,000 newborns. The ambiguity arises from the fact that not all cases are symptomatic. == Signs and Symptoms == Early signs of abnormality include polyhydramnios (an excess of amniotic fluid), low birth weight, and feeding intolerance immediately after birth, in particular a tendency to epigastric distention associated with non-biliary vomiting (the obstruction is generally above the papilla of Vater, therefore superior than the junction with the bile ducts). Different chromosomal diseases (for example trisomy 21 and, with a minor frequency, trisomy 18 and trisomy 13) are present in about 33% of subjects affected by annular pancreas. In adults, the clinical picture is often dominated by the sensation of postprandial distension, abdominal pain in the epigastric region, nausea and vomiting that may be present for a long time (sometimes for years) before reaching a precise diagnosis. ==Causes== It is typically associated with abnormal embryological development, however adult cases can develop. It can result from growth of a bifid ventral pancreatic bud around the duodenum, where the parts of the bifid ventral bud fuse with the dorsal bud, forming a pancreatic ring. It can also result if the ventral pancreatic bud fails to fully rotate, so it remains on the right or if the dorsal bud rotates in the wrong direction, such that the duodenum is surrounded by pancreatic tissue. Blockage of the duodenum develops if inflammation (pancreatitis) develops in the annular pancreas. ==Diagnosis== Postnatal diagnostic procedures include abdominal x-ray and ultrasound, CT scan, and upper GI and small bowel series. Abdominal radiography can show the classic sign of the \\"double bubble\\": the presence of air in the stomach and duodenum. Unfortunately, this double-bubble sign is not pathognomonic for annular pancreas, as it can also be observed in other conditions, such as duodenal atresia and intestinal malrotation. Upper GI series may be suggestive of annular pancreas, especially if they show a duodenal narrowing of the second portion of the duodenum and the concomitant dilatation of the proximal duodenum. In some cases it is possible to have signs of inverse peristalsis of the duodenal tract which is proximal to the narrowing caused by the annular pancreas, and the dilatation of the duodenal portion distal to the anomaly. An abdominal CT scan or an MRI allows to highlight the narrowing of the descending duodenal tract and the ring of pancreatic tissue surrounding the duodenum: this ring can be complete or, in patients with an incomplete annular pancreas, extended in a postero-lateral or anterolateral direction with respect to the second part of the duodenum. ERCP or MRCP with secretin allow precise delineation of the anatomical structure and in particular a good visualization of pancreatic ducts, as well as a careful analysis of pancreatic secretion into the duodenum lumen. ==Treatment== In neonates, treatment for relief of obstruction usually is bypassing the obstructed segment of duodenum by duodeno-jejunostomy. In adults, due to the minor duodenal mobility, the approach is laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy or duodenojejunostomy. ==References== == External links == Category:Congenital disorders of digestive system ","title":"Annular pancreas"},{"id":"3250111","text":"Buddha statue in the Erdene Zuu Monastery, Karakorum Gilded stupa and a prajnaparamita, Mongolian from the 18th century CE Buddhism is the largest religion of Mongolia practiced by 53% of Mongolia's population, according to the 2010 Mongolia census.2010 Population and Housing Census of Mongolia.

Buddhism penetrated Mongolia from Nepal via Central Asia. Many Buddhist terms of Sanskrit origin were adopted via the Sogdian language. The rulers of the nomadic empires such as the Xiongnu (209 BC – 93 AD), Xianbei (93 AD - 234), Rouran Khaganate (late 4th c. - middle 6th c.) and the Göktürks (middle first mill. AD) received missionaries and built temples for them. Buddhism prevailed among aristocrats and was patronised by the monarchs of the Northern Wei (386 - 534) established by the Xianbei and of the Liao dynasty (907 - 1125) established by the Khitan people. The Khitan aristocracy regarded Buddhism as the culture of the Uyghur Khaganate that dominated the Mongolian steppes before the rise of the Khitans. The monarchs of the Jin (1115–1234) established by the Jurchen people also regarded Buddhism as part of their Khitan. The oldest known Mongolian language translations of Buddhist literature were translated from the Uyghur language and contain Turkic language words like sümbür tay (Sumeru Mountain), ayaγ-wa (a dative form of ayaq, an Uyghur word meaning honor), quvaray (monk) and many proper names and titles like buyuruγ and külüg of 12th-century Turkic origin.Nicholas Poppe, The Turkic Loanwords in Middle Mongolian (Central Asiatic Journal Vol. 1, No. 1: Harassowitz Verlang, 1955), 36. ===Mongol Empire and Yuan dynasty (13th-14th century) – second introduction=== Buyandelgeruulekh Monastery in Tsetserleg Genghis Khan (c. 1162 - 1227) and his immediate successors conquered nearly all of Asia and European Russia and sent armies as far as central Europe and Southeast Asia. The emperors of the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368) in the 13th and 14th century converted to Tibetan Buddhism. Kublai Khan (reign 1269-1294; established the Yuan-dynasty in 1271) invited lama Drogön Chögyal Phagpa of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism to spread Buddhism throughout his realm (the second introduction of Buddhism among the Mongols). Buddhism became the de facto state religion of the Mongol Yuan state. In 1269, Kublai Khan commissioned Phagpa lama to design a new writing system to unify the writing systems of the multilingual empire. The 'Phags-pa script, also known as the \\"Square script\\", was based on the Tibetan script and written vertically from top was designed to write in Mongolian, Tibetan, Chinese, Uighur and Sanskrit languages and served as the official script of the empire. Tibetan Buddhist monasticism made an important impact on the early development of Mongolian Buddhism.Michael Jerryson, Mongolian Buddhism: The Rise and Fall of the Sangha, (Chiang Mai: Silkworm Books, 2007), 12. Buddhist monkhood played significant political roles in Central and Southeast Asia, and the sangha in Mongolia was no exception. Mongols assisted Tibetans in unifying the country. The activities of the Mongols were conducive to the prominency of the Sakya school and then the Gelug, and to the further development of Tibeto- Mongolian civilisation.Кузьмин С.Л. 2010. Скрытый Тибет. История независимости и оккупации. С.Петербург: изд. А. Терентьева ===Northern Yuan and cultural renaissance (16th century) – third introduction=== Temple at Erdene Zuu monastery established by Abtai Khan in the Khalkha heartland in the 16th century The Mongols returned to shamanic traditions after the collapse of the Mongol Empire. Hutuhtai Secen Hongtaiji of Ordos and his two brothers invaded Tibet in 1566. He sent an ultimatum to some of the ruling clergy of Tibet demanding their submission.Sagan Cecen, Erdeniin Tobchi. \\"If you surrender, we'll develop the Dharma with you. If you don't surrender, we'll conquer you.\\" (\\"Та манд орж өгвөөс, бид шажин ном хийе, орж эс өгвөөс, бид танд довтолмуй\\".) The Tibetan supreme monks decided to surrender and Hutuhtai Secen Hongtaiji returned to Ordos with three high ranking monks. Tumen Jasaghtu Khan invited a monk of the Kagyu school in 1576. In 1578 Altan Khan, a Mongol military leader with ambitions to unite the Mongols and to emulate the career of Genghis Khan, invited the 3rd Dalai Lama, the head of the rising Gelug lineage to a summit. They formed an alliance that gave Altan Khan legitimacy and religious sanction for his imperial pretensions and that provided the Buddhist school with protection and patronage. Altan Khan recognized Sonam Gyatso lama as a reincarnation of Phagpa lama, gave the Tibetan leader the title of Dalai Lama (\\"Ocean Lama\\"), which his successors still hold. Sonam Gyatso, in turn, recognized Altan as a reincarnation of Kublai Khan.Lobzangdanzan, Altan Tobchi Thus, Altan added legitimacy to the title \\"khan\\" that he had assumed, while Sonam Gyatso received support for the supremacy he sought over the Tibetan sangha. Since this meeting, the heads of the Gelugpa school became known as Dalai Lamas. Altan Khan also bestowed the title Ochirdara (Очирдар, from Sanskr. Vajradhara) to Sonam Gyatso. Altan Khan died soon after, but in the next century the Gelug spread throughout Mongolia, aided in part by the efforts of contending Mongol aristocrats to win religious sanction and mass support for their ultimately unsuccessful efforts to unite all Mongols in a single state. Viharas (Mongolian datsan) were built across Mongolia, often sited at the juncture of trade and migration routes or at summer pastures where large numbers of herders would congregate for shamanistic rituals and sacrifices. Buddhist monks carried out a protracted struggle with the indigenous shamans and succeeded, to some extent, in taking over their functions and fees as healers and diviners, and in pushing the shamans to the fringes of Mongolian culture and religion. Church and state supported each other, and the doctrine of reincarnation made it possible for the reincarnations of living Buddhas to be discovered conveniently in the families of Mongolian nobility until this practice was outlawed by the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty. ===Qing dynasty (1635–1912)=== During the Qing's Emperor Hong Taiji's (1592-1643) campaign against the last Mongol khan Ligdan Khan, he started the sponsorship of Tibetan Buddhism to gain support. According to the Manchu historian Jin Qicong, Buddhism was used by Qing rulers to control Mongolians and Tibetans; it was of little relevance to ordinary Manchus in the Qing dynasty. The long association of the Manchu rulership with the Bodhisattva Manjusri, and his own interest in Tibetan Buddhism, gave credence to the Qianlong Emperor's patronage of Tibetan Buddhist art, and patronage of translations of the Buddhist canon. He supported the Yellow Church (the Tibetan Buddhist Gelukpa sect) to \\"maintain peace among the Mongols\\" since the Mongols were followers of the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama of the Yellow Church.Elisabeth Benard, \\"The Qianlong Emperor and Tibetan Buddhism,\\" in Dunnell & Elliott & Foret & Millward 2004, pp. 123-4. Mark Elliott concludes that these actions delivered political benefits but \\"meshed seamlessly with his personal faith.\\" The Khalkha nobles' power was deliberately undermined by Qianlong, when he appointed the Tibetan Ishi-damba-nima of the Lithang royal family of the eastern Tibetans as the 3rd reincarnated Jebtsundamba, instead of the Khalkha Mongol which they wanted to be appointed.Berger 2003, p. 26. The decision was first protested against by the Outer Mongol Khalkha nobles, and then the Khalkhas sought to have him placed at a distance from them at Dolonnor. Nevertheless, Qianlong snubbed both of their requests, sending the message that he was putting an end to Outer Mongolian autonomy.Berger 2003, p. 17. The decision to make Tibet the only place where the reincarnation came from was intentional by the Qing to curtail the Mongols. ===Bogd Khanate (early 20th century)=== The Bogd Khan was simultaneously the religious and secular head of state until the 1920s. By the beginning of the twentieth century, Outer Mongolia had 583 monasteries and temple complexes, which controlled an estimated 20 percent of the country's wealth. Almost all Mongolian cities have grown up on the sites of monasteries. Ikh Huree, as Ulaanbaatar was then known, was the seat of the preeminent living Buddha of Mongolia (the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, also known as the Bogdo Gegen and later as the Bogd Khan), who ranked third in the ecclesiastical hierarchy after the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama. Two monasteries there contained approximately 13,000 and 7000 monks, respectively, and the pre-revolutionary name of the settlement known to outsiders as Urga, Ikh Huree, means \\"Big Monastery\\". Over the centuries, the monasteries acquired riches and secular dependents, gradually increasing their wealth and power as the wealth and power of the Mongol nobility declined. Some nobles donated a portion of their dependent families—people, rather than land, were the foundation of wealth and power in old Mongolia—to the monasteries. Some herders dedicated themselves and their families to serve the monasteries, either from piety or from the desire to escape the arbitrary exactions of the nobility. In some areas, the monasteries and their living buddhas (of whom there were a total of 140 in 1924) were also the secular authorities. In the 1920s, there were about 110,000 monks, including children, who made up about one-third of the male population, although many of these lived outside the monasteries and did not observe their vows. About 250,000 people, more than a third of the total population, either lived in territories administered by monasteries and living Buddhas or were hereditary dependents of the monasteries. Mongol praying at a shrine in Urga. With the end of Manchu rule in 1911, the Buddhist church and its clergy provided the only political structure available. The autonomous state thus took the form of a weakly centralized theocracy, headed by the Jebtsundamba Khutukhtu in Yehe Kuriye. By the twentieth century, Buddhism had penetrated deeply into the culture of Mongolia, and the populace willingly supported the lamas and the monasteries. Foreign observers usually had a negative opinion of Mongolian monks, condemning them as lazy, ignorant, corrupt, and debauched, but the Mongolian people did not concur. Ordinary Mongolians apparently combined a cynical and realistic anticlericalism, sensitive to the faults and the human fallibility of individual monks or groups of monks, with a deep and unwavering concern for the transcendent values of the church. ===Communist- rule Mongolian People's Republic (1924–1992)=== Ruins of the Ongiin Monastery, Saikhan-Ovoo, Dundgovi. When the revolutionaries took power, determined to modernize their country and to reform its society, they confronted a massive ecclesiastical structure that enrolled a larger part of the population, monopolized education and medical services, administered justice in a part of the country, and controlled a great deal of the national wealth. The Buddhist church, moreover, had no interest in reforming itself or in modernizing the country. The result was a protracted political struggle that absorbed the energies and attention of the party and its Soviet advisers for nearly twenty years. As late as 1934, the party counted 843 major Buddhist centers, about 3,000 temples of various sizes, and nearly 6000 associated buildings, which usually were the only fixed structures in a world of yurts. The annual income of the church was 31 million tögrögs, while that of the state was 37.5 million tögrögs. A party source claimed that, in 1935, monks constituted 48 percent of the adult male population. In a campaign marked by shifts of tactics, alternating between conciliation and persecution, and a few reported uprisings led by monks and abbots, the Buddhist church was removed progressively from public administration, was subjected to confiscatory taxes, was forbidden to teach children, and was prohibited from recruiting new monks or replacing living Buddhas. The campaign's timing matched the phases of Joseph Stalin's persecution of the Russian Orthodox Church. Robert Rupen reports that in the 1920s there were over 112,000 Mongolian Buddhist monks, representing more than 13% of Mongolia's overall population. By the 1940s, nearly every monk was either dead or had apostatized.Michael Jerryson, Mongolian Buddhism: The Rise and Fall of the Sangha, (Chiang Mai: Silkworm Books, 2007), 90. In 1938 — amid accusations that the church and monasteries were trying to cooperate with the Japanese, who were promoting a pan-Mongol puppet state — the remaining monasteries were dissolved, their property was seized, and their monks were secularized, interned or executed. Those monastic buildings that had not been destroyed were taken over to serve as local government offices or schools. Only then was the ruling party, which since 1921 gradually had built a cadre of politically reliable and secularly educated administrators, able to destroy the church and to mobilize the country's wealth and population for its program of modernization and social change.

World tallest indoor statue, 26.5-meter-high, 1996 rebuilt, (first built in 1913, destroyed in 1937) Since the late 1940s, one monastery, Gandan Monastery, with a community of 100 monks, was open in Ulaanbaatar. It was the country's sole monastery and was more for international display than functionality.Michael Jerryson, Mongolian Buddhism: The Rise and Fall of the Sangha, (Chiang Mai: Silkworm Books, 2007), 96. A few of the old monasteries survived as museums, and the Gandan Monastery served as a living museum and a tourist attraction. Its monks included a few young men who had undergone a five-year training period, but whose motives and mode of selection were unknown to Western observers. The party apparently thought that Buddhism no longer posed a challenge to its dominance and that — because Buddhism had played so large a part in the history of Mongolia and traditional arts and culture, total extirpation of knowledge about the religion and its practices would cut modern Mongols off from much of their past to the detriment of their national identity. A few aged former monks were employed to translate Tibetan-language handbooks on herbs and traditional Tibetan medicine. Government spokesmen described the monks of the Gandan Monastery as doing useful work. Today the monastery has been reinvigorated as Gandantegchinlen Monastery by the post- Communist governments of the country. Buddhism, furthermore played a role in Mongolia's foreign policy by linking Mongolia with the communist and the noncommunist states of East and Southeast Asia. Ulaanbaatar was the headquarters of the Asian Buddhist Conference for Peace, which has held conferences for Buddhists from such countries as Japan, Vietnam, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, and Bhutan; published a journal for international circulation; and maintained contacts with such groups as the Christian Peace Conference, the Soviet Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee and the Russian Orthodox Church. It sponsored the visits of the Dalai Lama to Mongolia in 1979 and 1982. The organization, headed by the abbot of then-Gandan Monastery, advanced the foreign policy goals of the Mongolian government, which were in accord with those of the Soviet Union. ===Democracy since the 1990 revolution=== After the 1990 overthrow of communism, there has been a resurgence of Buddhism in the country, with about 200 temples now in existence and a monastic sangha of around 300 to 500 Mongolian monks and nuns.Mullin, G.

HAND may include neurological disorders of various severity. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders are associated with a metabolic encephalopathy induced by HIV infection and fueled by immune activation of macrophages and microglia. These cells are actively infected with HIV and secrete neurotoxins of both host and viral origin. The essential features of AIDS dementia complex (ADC) are disabling cognitive impairment accompanied by motor dysfunction, speech problems and behavioral change. Cognitive impairment is characterised by mental slowness, trouble with memory and poor concentration. Motor symptoms include a loss of fine motor control leading to clumsiness, poor balance and tremors. Behavioral changes may include apathy, lethargy and diminished emotional responses and spontaneity. Histopathologically, it is identified by the infiltration of monocytes and macrophages into the central nervous system (CNS), gliosis, pallor of myelin sheaths, abnormalities of dendritic processes and neuronal loss. ADC typically occurs after years of HIV infection and is associated with low CD4+ T cell levels and high plasma viral loads. It is sometimes seen as the first sign of the onset of AIDS. Prevalence is between 10–24% in Western countries and has only been seen in 1–2% of India-based infections. With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the incidence of ADC has declined in developed countries, although its prevalence is increasing. HAART may prevent or delay the onset of ADC in people with HIV infection, and may also improve mental function in people who already have ADC. Dementia only exists when neurocognitive impairment in the patient is severe enough to interfere markedly with day-to-day function. That is, the patient is typically unable to work and may not be able to take care of him or herself. Before this, the patient is said to have a mild neurocognitive disorder. ==Presentation== Cognitive impairments associated with HIV occur in the domains of attention, memory, verbal fluency, and visuospatial construction. Specifically for memory, the lowered activity of the hippocampus changes the basis for memory encoding and affects mechanisms such as long-term potentiation. Severity of impairment in different domains varies depending on whether or not a patient is being treated with HAART or monotherapy. Studies have shown that patients exhibit cognitive deficits consistent with dysfunction of fronto-striatal circuits including associated parietal areas, the latter of which may account for observed deficits in visuospatial function. In addition to cognitive impairments, psychological dysfunction is also noted. For example, patients with HIV have higher rates of clinical depression and alexithymia, i.e., difficulty processing or recognizing one's own emotions. Patients also have more difficulty recognizing facial emotions. Without combination antiretroviral therapy, cognitive impairments increase with successive stages of HIV. HIV patients in early stages show mild difficulties in concentration and attention. In advanced cases of HIV- associated dementia, speech delay, motor dysfunction, and impaired thought and behavior are observed. Specifically, lower motor speeds were found to correlate with hypertrophy of the right putamen. The diagnosis of HIV- associated neurocognitive impairment is made using clinical criteria after considering and ruling out other possible causes. The severity of neurocognitive impairment is associated with nadir CD4, suggesting that earlier treatment to prevent immunosuppression due to HIV may help prevent HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. ==Pathophysiology== AIDS dementia complex (ADC) is not a true opportunistic infection; it is one of the few conditions caused directly by HIV itself. However, the cause of ADC can be difficult to discern because the central nervous system can be damaged by a number of other causes related to HIV infection: *opportunistic infections *AIDS-related lymphoma or metastasis of other AIDS-related cancers *direct effects of HIV in the brain *toxic effects of drug treatments *malnutrition Many researchers believe that HIV damages the vital brain cells, neurons, indirectly. According to one theory, HIV either infects or activates cells that protect the brain, known as macrophages and microglia. These cells then produce toxins that can set off a series of reactions that instruct neurons to kill themselves. The infected macrophages and microglia also appear to produce additional factors such as chemokines and cytokines that can affect neurons as well as other brain cells known as astrocytes. The affected astrocytes, which normally nurture and protect neurons, also may now end up harming neurons. Astrocytes produce neurotoxic proteins such as Tat, Nef and Rev. Tat is secreted and induces reactivity in astrocytes through increased GFAP expression. HIV protein gp120 inhibits the stem cells in the brain from producing new nerve cells. In the neuronal cells, the HIV gp120 induces mitochondrial-death proteins like caspases, which may influence the upregulation of the death receptor Fas leading to apoptosis. ===Direct effects of HIV=== HIV enters the brain early on in the infection. It is thought that HIV uses a \\"Trojan horse\\" mechanism to enter the brain. Normally, the blood–brain barrier (BBB) serves as a protective mechanism by preventing entry of foreign substances; disruption of the BBB by HIV contributes to the progression of infection. The virus is able to enter the brain through infected cells that pass through the BBB to replace the immune cells surrounding the blood supply in the brain. When infected, immune cells are able to better migrate into tissues compared to uninfected cells. Infected microglia add to the production of the virus. This activation of the microglia may contribute to the process of neuropathogenesis that spreads the infection to nearby cells. Other cells that can get infected include the astrocytes, which can trigger bystander cellular dysfunction and apoptosis, further compromising the blood–brain barrier. The toxicity spreads through a gap junction-dependent mechanism. ====Brain regions affected==== HIV is associated with pathological changes in mainly subcortical and fronto-striatal areas of the brain, including the basal ganglia, deep white matter, and hippocampal regions. Neuroimaging studies of HIV patients indicate that significant volume reductions are apparent in the frontal white matter, whereas subcortically, hypertrophy is apparent in the basal ganglia, especially the putamen. Moreover, the results of some studies suggest loss of brain volume in cortical and subcortical regions even in asymptomatic HIV patients and patients who were on stable treatment. A recent longitudinal study of a small representative cohort of HIV-positive patients on stable medication regiments suggests that this cortical atrophy is progressive, and is in part related to nadir CD4. Cerebral brain volume is associated with factors related to duration of the disease and CD4 nadir; patients with a longer history of chronic HIV and higher CD4 nadir loss present with greater cerebral atrophy. CD4 lymphocyte counts have also been related to greater rates of brain tissue loss. Current factors, such as plasma HIV RNA, have been found to be associated with brain volumes as well, especially with regards to basal ganglia volume and total white matter. Loss of cortical grey matter oligodendrocytes might also contribute to the symptomatology. Changes in the brain may be ongoing but asymptomatic, that is with minimal interference in functioning, making it difficult to diagnose HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders in the early stages. ==Diagnostic criteria== #Marked acquired impairment of at least two ability domains of cognitive function (e.g. memory, attention): typically, the impairment is in multiple domains, especially in learning, information processing and concentration/attention. The cognitive impairment is ascertained by medical history, mental status examination or neuropsychological testing. #Cognitive impairments identified in 1 interfere markedly with day-to-day functioning. #Cognitive impairments identified in 1 are present for at least one month. #Cognitive impairments identified in 1 do not meet the criteria for delirium, or if delirium is present, dementia was diagnosed when delirium was not present. #No evidence of another, pre-existing cause that could explain the dementia (e.g. another CNS infection, CNS neoplasm, cerebrovascular disease, pre-existing neurological disease, severe substance abuse compatible with CNS disorder. While the progression of dysfunction is variable, it is regarded as a serious complication and untreated can progress to a fatal outcome. Diagnosis is made by neurologists who carefully rule out alternative diagnoses. This routinely requires a careful neurological examination, brain scans (MRI or CT scan) and a lumbar puncture to evaluate the cerebrospinal fluid. No single test is available to confirm the diagnosis, but the constellation of history, laboratory findings and examination can reliably establish the diagnosis when performed by experienced clinicians. The amount of virus in the brain does not correlate well with the degree of dementia, suggesting that secondary mechanisms are also important in the manifestation of ADC. ===ADC stage characteristics=== *Stage 0 (Normal) Normal Mental and Motor Function *Stage 0.5 (Subclinical) Minimal symptoms of cognitive or motor dysfunction characteristic of ADC, or mild signs (snout response, slowed extremity movements), but without impairment of work or capacity to perform activities of daily living (ADL). Gait and strength are normal. *Stage 1 (Mild) Evidence of functional intellectual or motor impairment characteristic of ADC, but able to perform all but the more demanding aspects of work or ADL. Can walk without assistance. *Stage 2 (Moderate) Cannot work or maintain the more demanding aspects of daily life, but able to perform basic activities of self care. Ambulatory, but may require a single prop. *Stage 3 (Severe) Major intellectual incapacity - cannot follow news or personal events, cannot sustain complex conversation, considerable slowing of all output. And/or motor disability - cannot walk unassisted, requiring walker or personal support, usually with slowing and clumsiness of arms as well. *Stage 4 (End Stage) Nearly vegetative. Intellectual and social comprehension and responses are at a rudimentary level. Nearly or absolutely mute. Paraparetic or paraplegic with urinary incontinence and fecal incontinence. ===Neuroimaging studies=== A study by Melrose et al. (2008) examined the integrity of the fronto-striatal circuitry that underlies executive functioning in HIV. Participants in the study were diagnosed with HIV three months to sixteen years before the study. Ten out of eleven patients were on antiretroviral medication and none scored within the demented range on the HIV Dementia Scale. It was found that HIV+ patients showed less activity within the ventral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and left dorsolateral PFC. There was reduced connectivity between the left caudate and ventral PFC and between the left caudate and dorsolateral PFC compared to healthy controls. Additionally, there was hypoactivation of the left caudate in the HIV+ patients. In the control group, there was correlation between caudate activity and executive functioning as shown by performance on neuropsychological testing. Further analysis of the pathways in the HIV+ group involving left caudate showed reduced functional connectivity between the left caudate and globus pallidus (basal ganglia output nucleus). This dysfunction with the basal ganglia and PFC may explain the executive function and semantic event sequencing task impairments noted in HIV+ patients included in this study. The study by Melrose et al. (2008) also investigated parietal activation. It was found that anterior parietal activation in HIV+ patients was slightly anterior to that in control participants, which follows the idea that HIV causes a reorganization of the attention network leading to cognitive impairments. Additionally, the anterior parietal activity showed a relationship with caudate functioning, which implicates a compensatory mechanism set forth when damage to the fronto-striatal system occurs. Overall, the study by Melrose et al. (2008) showed that HIV in the brain is associated with cognitive impairments. Damage to the fronto-striatal system may underlie cognitive problems including executive function and sequencing tasks. Another area of impairment due to fronto-striatal dysfunction is in the area of emotion recognition. In a study of HIV+ patients and control adults by Clark et al. (2010), it was shown that HIV patients demonstrate impairments in the recognition of fearful facial expressions. The authors suggested that fronto- striatal abnormalities related to HIV may underlie these impairments. In identification tasks, administered by Clark et al. (2010), HIV+ patients and control participants were asked to identify different facial emotions and landscapes, with these picture categories matched for image complexity. HIV+ patients did worse than the control group on the facial recognition task but not on landscape identification. In the facial emotion task, fear recognition was significantly worse in the HIV than in the control group. ==Neurodevelopmental disorders associated with infection== Mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy is the dominant mode of acquisition of HIV infection in children and has been associated with an increased risk of mortality and developmental delay. Children with AIDS appear to have neurological diseases as a consequence of HIV-1 infection. In HIV-1 infected newborn and children, central nervous system (CNS) is infected with HIV-1 weeks after primary infection, causing neuronal damage and cell death. Although neurological dysfunctions have been associated to HIV infection of the CNS, it is unclear how the pathogenesis of neurological disorders has been established. The main cells infected by HIV-1 in the nervous tissue are the microglia, astrocytes and macrophages, whereas infected neurons have been rarely observed. The susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and replication in neuronal and glial cells is a function of cellular differentiation, and it is more likely in immature precursors than with differentiated cells. Several soluble signals, such as cytokines, have been described to modulate susceptibility and can further contribute in supporting virus latency or virus replication during organ development. In fact, within the developing CNS, cells are under the control of environmental factors that provide instructive signals to neural cell targets. By regulating the survival, differentiation and maintenance of specific functions of neuronal and glial precursors, these extracellular signals can influence many steps of the CNS development and concur in controlling virus-cell interactions in the maturing brain. In addition to the production of cytokines, HIV-1 infected mononuclear cells and astrocytes can produce a number of soluble mediators, including viral proteins such as gp120 and Tat, that can exert damaging effects on both developing and mature neural tissues. Moreover, molecules such as the platelet activating factor (PAF) and prostaglandins, which are produced upon microglia/macrophages and astrocytes functional interactions, have been reported to mediate cell damage in primary neural cell cultures and neural cell lines with immature phenotype. Taken together, these observations suggest that the mechanism by which the virus can alter CNS development and induce pathology in the immature brain may depend upon the altered production of soluble bioactive compounds. Several potentially neurotoxic mediators have been identified in different model systems, including inflammatory cytokines, viral proteins and neurotoxic metabolites. Thus, it is likely that a complex interaction of several mediators may alter the function and survival of actively developing and maturing cells, responsible for the neurologic disorders. == References == == External links == Category:HIV/AIDS Category:Cognitive disorders Category:Dementia Category:Psychiatric diagnosis ","title":"HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder"},{"id":"3250179","text":"Bhutanese Buddhist monk looking out the window of a monastery Buddhism is the most widely practiced religion in Bhutan. Vajrayana Buddhism is the state religion of Bhutan, and Buddhists comprise 75% and Hinduism 23% of its population.https://assets.pewresearch.org/wp- content/uploads/sites/11/2012/12/globalReligion-tables.pdf Although the Buddhism practiced in Bhutan originated in Tibetan Buddhism, it differs significantly in its rituals, liturgy, and monastic organization. The state religion has long been supported financially by the government through annual subsidies to Buddhist monasteries, shrines, monks, and nuns. In the modern era, support of the state religion during the reign of Jigme Dorji Wangchuck includes the manufacture of 10,000 gilded bronze images of the Buddha, publication of elegant calligraphic editions of the 108-volume Kangyur (Collection of the Words of the Buddha) and the 225-volume Tengyur (Collection of Commentaries), and the construction of numerous chorten (stupas) throughout the country. Guaranteed representation in the National Assembly and the Royal Advisory Council, Buddhists constitute the majority of society and are assured an influential voice in public policy. == Organizations == In 1989 some 1,000 monks (lam, or gelong, novices) belonged to the Central Monastic Body in Thimphu and Punakha, and some 4,000 monks belonged to district monastic bodies. The hierarchy is headed by the Je Khenpo, who was assisted by five lopons or masters, each in charge of religious tradition, liturgy, lexicography, or logic and university. The lonpon, one of whom, the Dorji Lonpon, normally succeeded the current Je Khenpo, had under them religious administrators and junior monastic officials in charge of art, music, and other areas. Gelugpa monks were celibate, but Nyingmapas consist of not only monks but also householders, allowing them to marry, raise families, and work in secular occupations while performing liturgical functions in temples and homes. In all, there were some 12,000 monks in Bhutan in the late 1980s. There were also active congregations of nuns, but no figures were readily available. The majority of Bhutan's Buddhists are adherents of the Drukpa subsect of the Kargyupa (literally, oral transmission) school, one of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism. Since July 2002, Menjong Chöthün Tshogpa, currently a nationwide non-profit organization in Bhutan, has been formed by Truku Jigme Chödrag Rinpoche 70th Kyabje Dorjechang, known as the Supreme Dharma King or His Holiness of Bhutan, mainly to preserve the indigenous Buddha's Teachings as their age-old culture and tradition. Subsequently Trizin Tsering Rimpoche was enthroned as the chairman by Truku Jigme Chödrag Rinpoche since June 2003.Founder of the Buddha Dordenma Image Foundation: His Eminence Trizin Tsering His Eminence BhutanHis Eminence Trizin Tsering Rimpoche - YouTube Later in 2004, Trizin Tsering Rimpoche founded the Buddha Dordenma Image Foundation, under the patronage of Truku Jigme Chödrag Rinpoche, with an aim to fulfill a former prophecy in a terma of Guru Padmasambhava to bestow blessings on world peace and glorious happiness through the currently running Buddha Dordenma Project. ===The Zhabdrung=== Prior to 1907, the highest Buddhist leader in Bhutan was the Zhabdrung, a tulku who is seen as the reincarnation of Bhutan's founder. His formal activity to benefit all sentient beings is destined to occur in seven lives, each with his own prophecy. == Monasteries == Monasteries and convents are common in Bhutan. Both monks and nuns keep their heads shaved and wear distinguishing maroon robes. Their days are spent in study and meditation but also in the performance of rituals honoring various bodhisattvas, praying for the dead, and seeking the intercession of bodhisattvas on behalf of the ill. Some of their prayers involved chants and singing accompanied by conch shell trumpets, trumpets made from human thighbones, metal horns up to three meters long, large standing drums and cymbals, hand bells, temple bells, gongs, and wooden sticks. Such monastic music and singing, not normally heard by the general public, has been reported to have \\"great virility\\" and to be more melodious than its Tibetan monotone counterparts. Common people do practice the religion in their own ways: day to day works, in their speech, in their thought and visiting the holy place and persons on holy dates (holy dates are the 8, 10, 15, 25, 28 and 30th day in a month in Bhutanese calendar). == Buildings and objects == To bring Buddhism to the people, numerous symbols and structures are employed. Religious monuments, prayer walls, prayer flags, and sacred mantras carved in stone hillsides are prevalent. Among the religious monuments are chorten, the Bhutanese version of the Indian stupa. They range from simple rectangular \\"house\\" chorten to complex edifices with ornate steps, doors, domes, and spires. Some are decorated with the Buddha's eyes that see in all directions simultaneously. These earth, brick, or stone structures commemorate deceased kings, Buddhist saints, venerable monks, and other notables, and sometimes they serve as reliquaries. Prayer walls are made of laid or piled stone and inscribed with Tantric prayers. Prayers printed with woodblocks on cloth are made into tall, narrow, colorful prayer flags, which are then mounted on long poles and placed both at holy sites and at dangerous locations to ward off demons and to benefit the spirits of the dead. To help propagate the faith, itinerant monks travel from village to village carrying portable shrines with many small doors, which open to reveal statues and images of the Buddha, bodhisattvas, and notable lamas. == Bön in Bhutan == Before the introduction of Buddhism, Bön religion was prevalent in Bhutan. Imported from Tibet and India, perhaps in the eighth century, Bön doctrine became so strongly reinvigorated by Buddhism that by the eleventh and twelfth century it reasserted itself as an independent school apart from Buddhism. Bön continues to be practiced in modern Bhutan. ==See also== * Bhutanese art * Freedom of religion in Bhutan * Dratshang Lhentshog * Dual system of government == References == == Bibliography == * Marks, Thomas A.

They proposed a \\"radical critique of the assumptions which got us [The United States] into Indo-China and were keeping us from getting out\\".Paul Cohen, Discovering History in China: American Historical Writing on the Recent Chinese Past (New York, London:: Columbia University Press, 1984): p. 104 The caucus was held at the Association for Asian Studies convention in Philadelphia, but was a radical critique of that professional association's values, organization, and leadership. The group was largely formed due to the Association for Asian Studies lack of public stance on the Vietnam War. Most of the original members were graduate students or junior faculty in Area Studies programs at Harvard, Stanford, University of Michigan, University of California at Berkeley, and Columbia University, although there were also independent scholars and those with no affiliation in the field.Richard Madsen, China and the American Dream: A Moral Inquiry (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995): 153-157. On 30 March 1969, the group passed the following Statement of Purpose: : We first came together in opposition to the brutal aggression of the United States in Vietnam and to the complicity or silence of our profession with regard to that policy. Those in the field of Asian studies bear responsibility for the consequences of their research and the political posture of their profession. We are concerned about the present unwillingness of specialists to speak out against the implications of an Asian policy committed to ensuring American domination of much of Asia. We reject the legitimacy of this aim, and attempt to change this policy. We recognize that the present structure of the profession has often perverted scholarship and alienated many people in the field. : The Committee of Concerned Asian Scholars seeks to develop a humane and knowledgeable understanding of Asian societies and their efforts to maintain cultural integrity and to confront such problems as poverty, oppression, and imperialism. We realize that to be students of other peoples, we must first understand our relations to them. CCAS wishes to create alternatives to the prevailing trends in scholarship on Asia, which too often spring from a parochial cultural perspective and serve selfish interests and expansionism. Our organization is designed to function as a catalyst, a communications network for both Asian and Western scholars, a provider of central resources for local chapters, and a community for the development of anti-imperialist research.BCAS Founding Statement 30 March, 1969 ==Founding members and contributors== *Herbert Bix *Molly Joel Coye *Bruce Cumings *Norma Diamond *John W.

Young ==Evaluations and debates== Richard Madsen of the University of California at San Diego sees the CCAS as part of a long line of populist criticism of academia, in this case projecting their values onto Mao's China. As graduate students, some of whom were in danger of being shipped off to Vietnam, \\"they identified themselves with the oppressed and saw the Cultural Revolution as a populist revolution expressing the aspirations of people like themselves.\\" Their understandings of China, Madsen concludes, did not explain that cataclysmic event any more adequately than the social science theories they rejected.Richard Madsen, \\"The Academic China Specialists,\\" in American Studies of Contemporary China (New York: ME Sharpe, 1993): 167-170. . Richard Baum of University of California at Los Angeles claimed that the CCAS anti- establishment stance had a polarizing effect on the field, that its early members promoted Maoist doctrine uncritically. He continued that CCAS made ludicrous claims such as all U.S.-government funded academic pursuits were being manipulated by the U.S. government if they were not outright forms of espionage, a stance quickly espoused by the P.R.C. which led to distrust and suspicion between P.R.C. representatives and academics. ==Publications== *Committee of Concerned Asian Scholars., China!

Designed by Brian Eddy and programmed by Lyman Sheats, it had a production run of 4,016 units.http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=4032 It is often regarded by many to be the greatest pinball machine of all time.https://pinside.com/pinball/top-100 Pinside.com's Top 100 List On October 18, 2013, Planetary Pinball Supply announced that they would be taking $1,000 pre-order deposits for a reproduction run of Medieval Madness.http://www.planetarypinball.com/product/product-name-rec6/ ==Playfield== The centerpiece of the playfield is an animated castle with a solenoid-controlled portcullis and motorized drawbridge. One of the game's primary objectives is to \\"destroy\\" six castles by hitting the castle's entryway with the pinball. A specific number of hits will lower the drawbridge, exposing the portcullis; additional hits will cause the portcullis to rise, and shooting the ball into the castle entrance generates an explosion effect on the dot matrix display, a lightshow, and a sizable award of points. Medieval Madness also features two Trolls, animated targets that are normally concealed below the playfield, but can pop up during certain gameplay modes. Other objectives can be scored by shooting the left and right ramps, the left and right orbits, and the catapult ramp in the lower left corner of the playfield. The game's ramps introduced a patented feature that would prevent a failed ramp shot from draining straight down the middle between the flippers.http://www.pinballnews.com/shows/expo2004/fireside.html ==Gameplay== Missions: In order to get to the Wizard Mode \\"Battle for the Kingdom\\" one has to achieve the following goals: * Joust Champion: Shooting the loop(s) advances Joust and finally lights Joust Madness. * Patron of Peasants: Shooting the left ramp advances the Peasants and finally lights Peasant Madness. * Catapult Ace: Shoot the catapult to shoot various items at the castle (Catapult Madness). * Defender of Damsels: Shoot up the right ramp to advance the Damsel. The final shot up the tower lights Damsel Madness. * Master of Trolls: Light the Trolls by hitting the targets in front of the castle. Collect the Trolls in \\"Merlin's Magic\\" and finish them off by three shots at the head each to light Troll Madness. * Castle Crusher: Destroy the castle. All these goals have to be repeated several times to get the corresponding insert in front of the castle to light up. Multiballs: * Castle Multiball: Light the Lock at the broad side (hole to the left of the castle gate) and lock three balls (same hole). Once activated, the player must shoot either ramp five times to collect the jackpot (denoted by Payne Guards). After all five jackpots have been claimed, the broad side hole lights up, and sinking it scores the Super Jackpot and an Extra Ball. The remaining jackpot ramps light up and the player can continue collecting the Super Jackpots. Once all the Super Jackpots have been claimed, the multiball reverts to the guards. * Multiball Madness: Each of the sub-missions (except for \\"Castle Crusher\\") can light an insert in front of \\"Merlin's Magic\\". Collecting at least one can start the Multiball by shooting into \\"Merlin's Magic\\": In this phase, all the jackpot ramps are lit and the player can score Jackpots by shooting the lit ramps. If a player hits a ramp that is denoted by a completed sub-mission, the player would score a Super Jackpot instead. If the player shoots the broad side hole, a Double Super Jackpot would be awarded instead. For each madness completed, the number of balls is denoted as follows: ** Single Madness: 2 Balls. ** Two to Four Madnesses: 3 Balls. ** Five Madnesses: 4 Balls. * Barnyard Multiball: Shoot all catapult items at the castle. * Battle for the Kingdom This two-phased Wizard Mode starts once the player pockets the ball in the castle, with four balls on the playing field. In the first phase, the player has to score all the Battle Jackpots by hitting the madness targets. Once all the Battle Jackpots have been scored, the second phase of the mode starts and the player must hit the castle gate seven times, and get inside to score the final jackpot. Unless the player has any \\"Troll Bombs\\", two trolls will be in the way of the gate making hitting the gate very challenging. If the player succeeds in scoring the final jackpot, all remaining balls are drained and the display shows the King of Payne's demise and Merlin announces you are the new King of the realm, and the game continues, also for the rest of the current ball, all major shots are lit for victory laps. ==Cast of Characters== * Merlin's Magic * Start Trolls! * 3 Troll Bombs * 500,000 * Light Trolls! * 1,000,000 * Joust Madness * Catapult Madness * Peasant Madness * Damsel Madness * Troll Madness * Smack-a-Troll * Start Hurry Up * Hold Bonus X * Extra Ball * Skill Shot * Jackpot * Super Jackpot * Fire * +2 Bonus X * +5 Bonus X * Award Lock * Light Extra Ball * Joust Victory * Super Jets * Light Lock * Destroy Castle Gate * Flashing Shots * Royal Madness * Battle for the Kingdom * Rabble Rouser * Ugly Riot * Angry Mob * Dragon Breath * Peasant Revolt * Dragon Snack * Dragon Death * Joust Charge * Catapult Slam * Catapult Wham * Catapult Bam * Multiball Madness * Castle Multiball * Barnyard Multiball * King of the Realm * Madness Champion * The Reign of Payne * Grand Champion * Bowling Ball * Cow * Chicken * Cat * Skull ==Music and voices== The music and sounds for this game were composed by Dan Forden.

Tina Fey and Andrea Farrell provided the voices of the various princesses (one of which has a \\"valley girl\\" accent), while Greg Freres provided the voices of the jousting announcer and one of the trolls, and Vince Pontarelli provided the voices of Francois Du Grimm and the other troll. The rest of the male voices, including the various knights and the Wizard were provided by Scott Adsit and Kevin Dorff.Pinball Expo 2004: Fireside chat with the Medieval Madness design team. ==Reception== It was an immediate critical success, earning well on location and achieving widespread popularity among collectors. Demand for the machine soon outstripped supply significantly; as of 2005, Medieval Madness machines often sell for prices well in excess of $8,000,http://www.pinpedia.com/machine/1007/prices sometimes much higher if in pristine condition (when purchased new in 1997, the machine cost approximately $3,000). It is considered by many to be the greatest pinball machine of all time.https://pinside.com/pinball/machine/medieval- madness ==Digital versions== Medieval Madness is included as part of the Williams volume 1 tables for Pinball FX 3 on October 9, 2018.

It is used for standard endotracheal intubation, as well as for rapid sequence induction (RSI). ==Pharmacology== === Mechanism of action === It was designed to be a weaker antagonist at the neuromuscular junction than pancuronium; hence its monoquaternary structure and its having an allyl group and a pyrrolidine group attached to the D ring quaternary nitrogen atom. Rocuronium has a rapid onset and intermediate duration of action. There is considered to be a risk of allergic reaction to the drug in some patients (particularly those with asthma), but a similar incidence of allergic reactions has been observed by using other members of the same drug class (non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs). The γ-cyclodextrin derivative sugammadex (trade name Bridion) has been recently introduced as a novel agent to reverse the action of rocuronium. Sugammadex has been in use since 2009 in many European countries; however, it was turned down for approval twice by the US FDA due to concerns over allergic reactions and bleeding, but finally approved the medication for use during surgical procedures in the United States on December 15, 2015. Neostigmine can also be used as a reversal agent of rocuronium but is not as effective as sugammadex. Neostigmine is often still used due to its low cost compared with sugammadex. ==History== It was introduced in 1994, and is marketed under the trade name of Zemuron in the United States and Esmeron in most other countries. == Executions == On July 27, 2012, the U.S. state of Virginia replaced pancuronium bromide, one of the three drugs used in execution by lethal injection, with rocuronium bromide. On 3 October 2016, the U.S. state of Ohio announced that it would resume executions on January 12, 2017, using a combination of midazolam, rocuronium bromide, and potassium chloride. Prior to this, the last execution in Ohio was in January 2014.

After attending trade school, he began to work for the German train system (Reichsbahn). After being drafted in 1944 and participating in World War II, he returned to Neustadt, which was renamed to Prudnik at the end of the war. However, he was forced to flee from Poland to Weimar. From 1946 to 1948 he worked with the Free German Youth organization in East Germany. After taking a variety of jobs, he became a journalist for a number of different newspapers and had the opportunity to work as a reporter in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War and also in Korea. He claimed to have been affected by Agent Orange with lifelong effects. He was married in 1953. Between 1956 and 1958, he worked with the Chinese magazine China Pictorial. After additional travels in East Asia between 1964 and 1980 (including Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Korea, China), he returned to Weimar. There between 1971 and 1983 he was the chairman of the writers union in Thuringia. In 1995 he resigned from the German PEN organization. ==Work== With his 2004 book Treffpunkt Wahrheit Thürk had published sixty books altogether, including novels, nonfiction, and children's books, as well as screenplays. His topics and exciting prose made him especially popular in East Germany, and he had altogether nine million copies printed in nine different languages. However, he remained relatively unknown in West Germany. Among his best-known works are the anti-war novel Die Stunde der toten Augen and the novels Amok and Der Gaukler. Many of his novels take place in Southeast Asia or in his first home of Upper Silesia. In his later years, his writings dealt with current political themes in reunified Germany. Thürk was a very controversial author because of his political themes as well as the frequent sex scenes in his novels. In the Der Gaukler, he portrayed Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn as a tool of the CIA. However, Thürk, a member of the Socialist Unity Party also prompted controversy within the Communist sphere, for example with his depictions of battle scenes involving German troops against the Red Army in his novel Die Stunde der toten Augen (1957). ==Awards and honors== *1964 National Prize of East Germany *1971 Theodor-Körner-Preis (DDR) *1977 National Prize of East Germany ==Selected works== ===Stories=== *Nacht und Morgen, 1950 *Treffpunkt Große Freiheit, 1954 *Goldener Traum Jugend, 1996 *Auch überm Jangtse ist Himmel, 2001 ===Novels=== *Die Herren des Salzes, 1956 *Die Stunde der toten Augen, 1957 *Der Narr und das schwarzhaarige Mädchen, 1958 *Das Tal der sieben Monde, 1960 *Der Wind stirbt vor dem Dschungel, 1961 *Verdorrter Jasmin, 1961 *Lotos auf brennenden Teichen, 1962 *Die weißen Feuer von Hongkong, 1964 *Der Tod und der Regen, 1967 *Der Tiger von Shangri-La, 1970 *Amok, 1974, situated into Indonesia during the 1965-66 massacres. *Des Drachens grauer Atem, 1976 *Der Gaukler (2 Bde.), 1978 *Der schwarze Monsun, 1986 *Operation Mekong, 1988 *Die Lagune, 1991 *Summer of Dead Dreams, 1993 *Piratenspiele, 1995 ====Crime novels==== *Der maskierte Buddha, 1991 *Die toten Masseusen von Kowloon, 1992 *Tod auf Tahiti, 1993 *Die tätowierte Unschuld, 1994 *Tuan Subutu läßt schießen, 1995 *Das letzte Aloha, 1996 *Schwarze Blüte – sanfter Tod, 1997 *Hongkongs Leichen sind sehr tot, 1998 *Der Tod kam aus Shanghai, 1999 *Mord mit zarter Hand, 2000 ===Children's books=== *Fahrten und Abenteuer von Pitt und Ursula, 1955/56 *Su-su von der Himmelsbrücke, 1960 ==External links== * Harry-Thürk- Forum Category:1927 births Category:2005 deaths Category:German military personnel of World War II Category:People from Prudnik County Category:People from the Province of Upper Silesia Category:German male writers Category:East German writers ","title":"Harry Thürk"},{"id":"3250338","text":"The ZaSu Pitts Memorial Orchestra was formed in San Francisco by Stephen Ashman, a bass-player.

When the nerve fibers degenerate, it causes an interruption in the transmission of nerve signals. In the medical field, this is most commonly and advantageously used to alleviate pain in cancer patients. The different types of neurolysis include celiac plexus neurolysis, endoscopic ultrasound guided neurolysis, and lumbar sympathetic neurolysis. Chemodenervation and nerve blocks are also associated with neurolysis. Additionally, there is external neurolysis. Peripheral nerves move (glide) across bones and muscles. A peripheral nerve can be trapped by scarring of surrounding tissue which may lead to potential nerve damage or pain. An external neurolysis is when scar tissue is removed from around the nerve without entering the nerve itself. ==Background== Neurolysis is a chemical ablation technique that is used to alleviate pain. Neurolysis is only used when the disease has progressed to a point where no other pain treatments are effective. A neurolytic agent such as alcohol, phenol, or glycerol is typically injected into the nervous system. Chemical neurolysis causes deconstructive fibrosis which then disrupts the sympathetic ganglia. This results in a reduction of pain signals being transmitted throughout the nerves. The effects generally last for three to six months. Photo of Mathieu Jaboulay courtesy of Romain Rochefeuille Certain neurolysis techniques have been reported to be used in the early 1900s for the treatment of pain by the neurologist Mathieu Jaboulay. Early reported neurolysis helped treat vasospastic disorders such as arterial occlusive disease before the introduction of endovascular procedures. ==Types== ===Celiac plexus neurolysis=== Celiac plexus neurolysis (CPN) is the chemical ablation of the celiac plexus. This type of neurolysis is mainly used to treat pain associated with advanced pancreatic cancer. Traditional opioid medications used to treat pancreatic cancer patients may yield inadequate pain relief in the most advanced stages of pancreatic cancer, so the goal of CPN is to increase the efficiency of the medication. This in turn may lead to a decreased dosage, thereby decreasing the severity of the side effects. CPN is also used to decrease the chances of a patient developing an addiction for opioid medications due to the large doses commonly used in treatment. ====Traditional CPN approaches and nerve blocks==== CPN can be performed by percutaneous injection either anterior or posterior to the celiac plexus. CPN is generally performed complementary to nerve blocks, due to the severe pain associated with the injection itself. Neurolysis is commonly performed only after a successful celiac plexus block. CPN and celiac plexus block (CPB) are different in that CPN is permanent ablation whereas CPB is temporal pain inhibition. There are multiple posterior percutaneous approaches, but no clinical evidence suggests that any one technique is more efficient than the rest. The posterior approaches generally utilize two needles, one at each side of the L1 vertebral body pointing towards the T12 vertebral body. Increasing the spread of the injection may increase the efficacy of the neurolysis. ====Endoscopic ultrasound-guided neurolysis==== Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided neurolysis is a technique that performs neurolysis using a linear-array echoendoscope. The EUS technique is minimally invasive and is believed to be safer than the traditional percutaneous approaches. EUS-guided neurolysis technique can be used to target the celiac plexus, the celiac ganglion, or the broad plexus in the treatment of pancreatic cancer-associated pain. EUS-guided celiac plexus neurolysis (EUS-CPN) is performed with either an oblique-viewing or forward-viewing echoendoscope and is passed through the mouth into the esophagus. From the gastroesophageal junction, EUS imaging allows the doctor to visualize the aorta, which can then be traced to the origin of the celiac artery. The celiac plexus itself cannot be identified, but is located relative to the celiac artery. The neurolysis is then performed with a spray needle that disperses a neurolytic agent, such as alcohol or phenol, into the celiac plexus. EUS-CPN can be performed unilaterally (centrally) or bilaterally, however, there is no clinical evidence supporting the superiority of one over the other. EUS-guided neurolysis can also be performed on the celiac ganglion and the broad plexus in a similar fashion to the EUS-CPN. The celiac ganglion neurolysis (EUS-CGN) is more effective than EUS-CPN and broad plexus neurolysis (EUS-BPN) is more effective than EUS-CGN. ===Lumbar sympathetic neurolysis=== Lumbar sympathetic neurolysis is typically used on patients with ischemic rest pain, generally associated with nonreconstructable arterial occlusive disease. Although the disease is the basis for this type of neurolysis, other diseases such as peripheral neuralgia or vasospastic disorders can receive lumbar sympathetic neurolysis for pain treatment. Magnetic Resonance Image of Lumbar Spine courtesy of Nevit Dilmen Lumbar sympathetic neurolysis is performed between the L1-L4 vertebrae with separate injections at each vertebra junction. The chemicals used for neurolysis of the nerves cause destructive fibrosis and cause a disruption of the sympathetic ganglia. The vasomotor tone is decreased in the area affected by the neurolysis, which in addition to arteriovenous shunting, create a light pink appearance within the affected area. Lumbar sympathetic neurolysis alters the ischemic rest pain transmission by changing norepinephrine and catecholamine levels or by disturbing afferent fibers. This procedure is mainly used only when other feasible approaches to pain management are unable to be used. Lumbar sympathetic neurolysis is performed by using absolute alcohol, but other chemicals such as phenol, or other techniques such as radiofrequency or laser ablation have been studied. To aid in the procedure, fluoroscopy or CT guidance is used. Fluoroscopic guidance is the most frequent, giving better real-time monitoring of the needle. The general technique of administering lumbar sympathetic neurolysis involves using three separate needles rather than one because it allows for better longitudinal spread of the chemicals. Complications can arise from this procedure such as nerve root injury, bleeding, paralysis, and more. Complications have been seen to be diminished when using the aforementioned radiofrequency or laser ablation techniques in comparison to the injection of alcohol or phenol. Generally, approximately two-thirds of patients can expect a favorable outcome (pain relief with minimal complications). Overall, the minimally invasive technique of lumbar sympathetic neurolysis is important in the relief of ischemic rest pain. ===Chemodenervation=== Chemodenervation is a process used to manage focal muscle overactivity through the use of either phenol, alcohol, or one of the more recently discovered botulinum toxins (BoNTs). Chemodenervation is used as a complement to neurolysis. The agent of choice is injected into the muscle fibers as opposed to nerve tissue and the two work together to dull the neuronal signaling within the muscles. Nerve block of cervical spine courtesy of PainDoctorUSA The use of alcohol and phenol injections have different effects than the use of BoNTs. Neurolysis mediates the effects of alcohol and phenol injections but does not mediate the effects of BoNT injections. Phenol and alcohol are less expensive, faster acting, can treat larger areas and can be readministered or boostered in less than three months, however, those injections also require the patient to be sedated cause muscle scarring and can lead to muscle fibrosis. BoNT injections are easier to inject, better accepted by patients, and have reversible effects on muscles, however, they are more expensive, act very slowly, and the body can develop a resistance to them. ==References== Category:Materials degradation Category:Nerves Category:Neurosurgery ","title":"Neurolysis"},{"id":"3250365","text":"Pessoa may refer to: ==People with the surname== *Andy Pessoa (born 1995), American actor *Ciro Pessoa (born 1957), Brazilian musician *Epitácio Pessoa (1865–1942), Brazilian politician and jurist *Fernando Pessoa (1888–1935), Portuguese poet and writer *João Pessoa Cavalcanti de Albuquerque (1878–1930), Brazilian politician and jurist *Nelson Pessoa (born 1935), Brazilian equestrian *Raphael Luz Pessoa (born 1989), Brazilian footballer *Regina Pessoa (born 1969), Portuguese animator *Ricardo Jorge Rodrigues Pessoa (born 1982), Portuguese footballer *Rodrigo Pessoa (born 1972), Brazilian Olympic equestrian ==Other uses== * \\"Pessoa\\", a song by Momus from the album Scobberlotchers * Pessoa Prize, a Portuguese science, arts and literature award * Pessoa (magazine), Brazilian online literary magazine * João Pessoa, Paraíba, the capital city of the state of Paraíba in Brazil ","title":"Pessoa"},{"id":"3250379","text":"right Prince Royalty is the royalty for Prince County, Prince Edward Island, Canada. The township was supposed to host the county's shire town, named Princetown, and was surveyed for this purpose during the 1764 colonial survey undertaken by Capt. Samuel J. Holland. The township is located on a peninsula extending into Malpeque Bay from adjacent Lot 18. Unfortunately, the shallow harbour made it unsuitable for a major port and the commercial centre of the county shifted to an area of Lot 17 township which fronted a sheltered harbour on the Northumberland Strait, which was later named Summerside. Prince Royalty is part of St. David's Parish. ==History== With Prince Royalty being largely unused as a shire town, it saw limited rural settlement by farmers since the Crown, and not a landlord owned the territory, thus an active settlement scheme never transpired. A military road was constructed from the colonial capital at Charlottetown early on and was named the Princetown Road. Princetown became a village on December 2, 1901 but downgraded its status to a settlement in 1925. Confusingly, the post office changed the community name from Princetown to Malpeque on November 16, 1945; the community of Princetown changed its name to Malpeque on March 13, 1947. Malpeque's status was further downgraded to a hamlet in 1960 and was amalgamated into the larger community of Malpeque Bay in 1973, with Malpeque's status being a locality.

Since Eastern Europe was still under the Iron Curtain, it was still difficult for younger hockey players from the Eastern Bloc to play in the NHL. During his NHL career, Pivonka played in 825 games, scored 181 goals and had 418 assists for a total of 599 points, twice leading the Capitals in scoring; 1991–92 (23G, 57A, 80P) and 1995–96 (16G, 65A, 81P). Pivonka last played in the NHL during the 1998-99 season, before finally retiring from hockey in 2000 after several injury-filled seasons.

It usually comes as a disodium salt of 8-acetamido-1-hydroxy-2-phenylazonaphthalene-3,6 disulfonate. == Uses == === Food dye === In the European Union, Red 2G was used as a food dye (E number E128). However, it was only permitted for use in breakfast sausages with a minimum cereal content of 6% and burger meat with a minimum vegetable and/or cereal content of 4%. Following safety concerns raised by EFSA in its opinion of 5 July 2007, the European Commission has prepared a draft Regulation to suspend use of E128 as a food colouring. This proposed course of action was unanimously approved by European Union Member States at a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health (Section Toxicological Safety of the Food Chain) on 20 July 2007. and Commission Regulation (EC) No 884/2007 .http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2007:195:0008:0009:EN:PDF on emergency measures suspending the use of E 128 Red 2G as food colour was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 27 July 2007.

It is relatively insensitive to the bleaching effect of sulfur dioxide (E220) and sodium metabisulfite (E223). In the intestines, Red 2G can be converted to the toxic compound aniline, so there are concerns Red 2G may ultimately interfere with blood haemoglobin, as well as cause cancer. === Inks === It is also used as a dye for coatings, inks, paper, crepe paper, and fine tissue. === Histology === Red 2G can be also used for staining in histology, though rarely, e.g. as a component of Masson's trichrome. == Potential health risks == In July 2007, the EFSA established that E128 is potentially carcinogenic because it forms aniline in the body when consumed. The pressure group, The Food Commission, said there had been concerns about Red 2G going back decades and it was suspected of being a carcinogen in the 1980s. == References == Category:Azo dyes Category:Food colorings Category:Staining dyes Category:Organic sodium salts Category:Acetamides Category:1-Naphthols Category:Naphthalenesulfonates ","title":"Red 2G"},{"id":"3250438","text":"Rainulf Drengot (also Ranulph, Ranulf, or Rannulf; died June 1045) was a Norman adventurer and mercenary in southern Italy. In 1030 he became the first count of Aversa. He was a member of the Drengot family. ==Early life and arrival in Italy== Italy in 1000 AD, prior to Rainulf's arrival in southern Italy When Rainulf was exiled by Richard II of Normandy for a violent criminal act,Marjorie Chibnall, The Normans, (Blackwell Publishing, 2006), 76. Rainulf, Osmond, and their brothers Gilbert Buatère, Asclettin (later count of Acerenza), and Raulf went on a pilgrimage to the shrine of the soldier- archangel, Michael, at Monte Sant'Angelo sul Gargano in the Byzantine Catepanate of Italy. They brought with them a band of 250 warriors, formed of other exiles, landless cadets and similar adventurers. ==Mercenary service== In 1017 they arrived in the Mezzogiorno, which was in a state of virtual anarchy. Establishing a stronghold at Monte Gargano in Apulia, they joined forces with the Lombard Melus of Bari, who had rebelled against his Byzantine overlords but who was currently on the run. Their first major engagement with the army of the Byzantine catepan Basil Boioannes, fought at the Battle of Cannae, an ancient Apulian villa, was a disaster for the Normans and ended in defeat. They were decimated and their leader, Rainulf's brother Gilbert, was killed. Rainulf, who now came to the fore as the undisputed leader, withdrew with the remnants of the band from Apulia to Campania, where, according to Amatus of Montecassino, though surrounded by enemies they were able to take advantage of dissension among the undisciplined Lombard lords. They took to protecting, at a price, bands of pilgrims headed for the shrine of St Michael from the depredations of other marauders. Rainulf also served the Lombard Pandulf IV of Capua. \\"Under his protection,\\" Amatus reports, \\"they hastened to plunder the neighboring places and to harass his enemies. But since human thoughts are inclined to greed and money always triumphs in the end, from time to time they abandoned him... They sold their services as they could, according to circumstances, offering most to him who gave most.\\"Amatus of Montecassino, History of the Normans book I Soon the balance of power in Lombard Campania lay in Norman hands: \\"For the Normans never desired any of the Lombards to win a decisive victory, in case this should be to their disadvantage. But now supporting the one and then aiding the other, they prevented anyone being completely ruined.\\"Amatus Norman reinforcements and local miscreants, who found a welcome in Rainulf's encampment with no questions asked, swelled the numbers at Rainulf's command. Their Norman language and Norman customs welded a disparate group into the semblance of a nation, as Amatus observed. ==Mercenary to Count== Rainulf eventually switched his allegiance to Sergius IV of Naples, with whom he achieved some success. In 1030, Duke Sergius gave him the former Byzantine stronghold of Aversa north of Naples,John Beeler, Warfare in Feudal Europe, (Cornell University Press, 1971), 67. with the title of count and his sister in marriage. In 1034, this first wife died, and Rainulf married the daughter of the duke of Amalfi, who was also the niece of Sergius' inveterate enemy, Pandulf IV of Capua; He expanded his territory at the expense of the abbey of Montecassino. His title to Aversa was recognised in 1037 by Emperor Conrad II. After vanquishing the Byzantines in battle in 1038, he declared himself prince, formalizing his independence from Naples and from his former Lombard allies. He conquered his neighbour Pandulf's principality, and Conrad approved the union of the two domains, which formed the largest polity in southern Italy. In 1039, he was at the side of Guaimar IV of Salerno and the emperor Conrad. Ranulf was one of the leaders of the anti-Byzantine coalition which rebelled in southern Italy in 1040. He took part in the decisive victory at the battle of Olivento in March 1041.John Beeler, Warfare in Feudal Europe, 68. In 1042, after the victory of his Norman ally William Iron Arm, he received, from the erstwhile Byzantine territories, suzerainty over Siponto and Monte Gargano. He died in June 1045 and was succeeded by his nephew, Asclettin, son of Asclettin of Acerenza. The historians Amatus of Montecassino and William of Apulia are the main contemporary sources for the career of Rainulf. ==See also== *Norman conquest of southern Italy *Drengot family ==Notes== ==References== *Norman World: The first Norman rulers *Lexikon des Mittlealters vol.

The name is an anglicised version of the Welsh Llanfarthyn which has the same meaning. == Underwood == Within the parish is Underwood which has an early 1960s council housing estate that consists of houses, shops, a leisure centre, Baptist church and social club. A Westbury homes development was built in Underwood in the 1990s. The Underwood Estate was originally developed from the former World War II Prisoner-of-war camp after the war, in the late 1940s. A few examples of the surviving former PoW huts were visible until the early 1990s, when they were demolished. The original huts stood as early community buildings. In the early 1980s several huts and a water tower were also visible on the now Waltwood Park Drive area, this area belonged to the General Post Office and was used to house old telecommunications equipment until it was sold and demolished by British Telecom who took over the site when the organisation was privatised in the early 1980s. The land was subsequently sold to Westbury homes who built the Waltwood Park Drive Development of around 220 houses on the land. The Underwood Estate is situated in a natural land formation within the falls of a wooded area on the south and north side and a small drainage ditch or reen called \\"Monks Ditch\\" on the northern side of the development. The estate was built in three phases, with the Waltwood Park Development being the last of the three. Many people believe that the Underwood Estate was created for the local steelworks at Llanwern, as it was constructed at the same time as the Richard Thomas and Baldwins \\"Spencer Works\\" was being built. This has some truth, as originally people moved into the huts after the war. However the local council at the time, Magor and St Mellons Rural District Council, created the housing estate with post-war initiatives for more housing, hence why the second phase of the housing development consists of rapid construction poured concrete houses which are very sturdy in construction and much stronger than traditional bricks-and-mortar houses. == Amenities == The Leisure Centre was considered to be one of the best leisure centres in the area, in fact it's widely known as one of the first in Wales. It was built from funding provided by Richard Thomas and Baldwins, when the Llanwern steelworks was constructed, built on land donated to the community by local farmer Mr. Weeks and still covered by a covenant on the land by the original donor. However there are moves to change this donation to build upon the land, of which the local residents are ardently opposed to. The Leisure Centre was closed and sold in 2013 to cut costs; the following year the police discovered it was one of the largest cannabis factories in Gwent, housing an estimated 4000 plants with a value of £1.1 million. Within the Llanmartin area, a large man-made reservoir is located. This reservoir is built on Waltwood Hill. It consists of four lagoons which contain greywater. This water was used at the Llanwern steelworks. It remains private property and is off- limits to the public. Pencoed, with its castle, is situated nearby. A small hamlet of Llanmartin, it consists of farms and a number of houses. The Old Barn is an old barn (c. 1800) which has been converted to a local public house serving quality food and drink. Within St. Martin's Church is the great stone tomb of Sir Nicolas Morgan, the Knight of Pencoed Castle in the reign of Henry VII. The frieze carved on the tomb shows Sir Nicolas' seven sons to his right and seven daughters to his left.Hando, F.J., (1944) \\"The Pleasant Land of Gwent\\" - Chapter Seven, Penhow and Pencoed, R.

His 2000-year performance earned him Baseball Weekly's Minor League Pitcher of the Year award. == No-hitter and major league career == Smith's major league career was short but notable, as he became the 18th rookie since 1900 to throw a no- hitter. Smith's Cardinals defeated the San Diego Padres 4–0 on September 3, 2001, with the rookie hurler giving up four walks but no hits, while throwing 134 pitches in the game. Due to Smith's high pitch count entering the later innings, Cardinal pitching coach Dave Duncan was actually hoping someone would break up the no-hitter, fearing that his young pitcher might tire, although he went against that judgment in allowing Smith to finish the game. , Smith's is the most recent no-hitter by a Cardinals' pitcher. Smith had an impressive rookie season in 2001, compiling a 6–3 record and 3.83 earned run average in 16 games, good for 4th in Rookie of the Year voting. However, after posting a dreadful 6.94 era in his sophomore season, he never pitched at the major league level again. Smith has the distinction of being the last member of the Cardinals to wear the number 51. In his major league debut, he donned the number associated with retired fan favorite Willie McGee, upsetting many fans. Shortly thereafter, Smith agreed to change his number to 52 and no one has used 51 since. For his career, Smith was 7–8 with a 4.95 earned run average in 132.7 innings. He made 27 appearances with 24 starts, with the no-hitter being his only complete game shutout. On July 29, 2002 he was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies along with infielder Plácido Polanco and relief pitcher Mike Timlin for third baseman Scott Rolen, relief pitcher Doug Nickle and cash. Smith never made a major league appearance for the Phillies, and on October 15, 2004 was granted free agency.

Mountain Highway starts from Burwood Highway on the border of Wantirna/Wantirna South and runs eastward through Wantirna, Bayswater and The Basin, then uphill to Sassafras. Between Burwood Highway and Dorset Road, the road is a fairly straight dual carriageway with two lanes in each direction and minor inclines and declines, with the section between Stud Road and Scoresby/Bayswater Road having three in each direction. From Dorset Road to Mount Dandenong Tourist Road, the road is a two-lane single carriageway, with the section of road through the Dandenong Ranges National Park (Forest Road - Mount Dandenong Tourist Road) being steep and windy and with an approximate 1 in 20 (5%) grade, which is especially popular with motorcyclists and cyclists, and is busiest on the weekends. The climb is winding, and the road narrow, so care must be taken when travelling the road.. Speed limits range from 80 km/h from Burwood Highway through to Bayswater, with the limit dropping to 60 km/h between Bayswater town centre and Sassafras. The previous 70 km/h speed limit was removed in 2014 as part of the VicRoads initiative to eliminate 70 km/h and 90 km/h zones, and the drop in speed limit is presumed to be attributable to the presence of cyclists and lack of road shoulder or bicycle lane. In The Basin, a 60 km/h limit applies through the residential area east of Forest Road and a 50 km/h limit applies within the centre of the town.

He works primarily with bands in the alternative rock and rock genres, having produced multiple albums for the bands Red Hot Chili Peppers, Hole, Violent Femmes and Marilyn Manson. ==Career== ===Musician=== Beinhorn started his professional career as a musician, playing synthesizer (Micromoog, EML Synthi AKS, Prophet-5, Roland SVC-350 Vocoder, etc) and co-founding the seminal New York band, Material with Bill Laswell (originally the backing band for Daevid Allen's New York Gong LP, 1979) during the early 1980s. He worked with the jazz musician Herbie Hancock as co-writer and co-producer on Hancock's Future Shock album, which contained the hit single \\"Rockit\\". Like most tracks on the album, except for the title track, \\"Rockit\\" was co-written by Beinhorn and Laswell. \\"Rockit\\" quickly became a Billboard #1, and is regarded as one of hip hop's seminal hits; it was the first recording to contain the legendary \\"Fresh\\" sample (which Beinhorn had created 2 years prior on a recording by the New York hip hop artist Fab Five Freddy/Beside called \\"Change The Beat\\" on Celluloid Records). ===Producer=== In 1998, Beinhorn received a Grammy nomination for \\"Producer Of The Year\\" for his work on Celebrity Skin by Hole and Mechanical Animals by Marilyn Manson. In that year, he became the only producer in history to have two recordings enter the Billboard Album Charts Top Ten in the same week (September 15, 1998), with \\"Celebrity Skin\\" at Number 9 and \\"Mechanical Animals\\" at Number 1. Looking for the best way to capture a broad frequency range during the recording process, Beinhorn devised the Ultra Analog Recording format. This process utilizes two inch magnetic tape, running on a custom built 8 track head stack. Beinhorn has since produced the albums of such artists as; Korn, Marilyn Manson, Soundgarden, Soul Asylum, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Hole, Raging Slab, Ozzy Osbourne, Mew, Social Distortion, The Golden Palominos, and Aerosmith. In 2015, Beinhorn wrote a book called Unlocking Creativity (published by Hal Leonard) which outlines his personal experience with the creative process as a record producer. In July 2017, Beinhorn detailed the process of recording Soundgarden’s 1994 album Superunknown while appearing on The Pods & Sods Network. And he shares his reaction to first hearing Black Hole Sun during that time, “I think for the rest of my entire life, until I draw my last breath, I’ll never ever forget how I felt when they started playing that song. From the very first few notes, I felt like I’d been hit by a thunderbolt. I was just absolutely stunned. What in the world is this? I get goosebumps thinking about it now.” In 2018, being a staunch advocate of album pre-production, Beinhorn started a new business to address the changing music industry climate and the lack of reasonable budgets available to most musicians. Including such services as Song Analysis and Pre- production, he sees this as a way to help musicians achieve their greatest potential while pursuing a return to excellence. ==Productions discography== *1982: One Down - Material *1983: Future Shock - Herbie Hancock *1984: At the Feet of the Moon - The Parachute Club *1986: Love's Imperfection - Idle Eyes *1987: The Uplift Mofo Party Plan - Red Hot Chili Peppers *1988: Standing at the Edge - Idle Eyes *1989: Mother's Milk - Red Hot Chili Peppers *1990: Mercurotones - The Buck Pets *1991: Why Do Birds Sing? - Violent Femmes'' *1991: Hot Diggity - Raw Youth *1992: Grave Dancers Union - Soul Asylum *1992: Soul Martini - Cavedogs *1993: Numb - Hammerbox *1993: Far Gone - Love Battery *1994: Superunknown - Soundgarden *1994: \\"Blind Man\\" and \\"Walk on Water\\" - Aerosmith *1995: Ozzmosis - Ozzy Osbourne *1996: White Light, White Heat, White Trash - Social Distortion *1997: Big Windshield Little Mirror - Foam *1998: Celebrity Skin - Hole *1998: Mechanical Animals - Marilyn Manson *1999: The Verve Pipe - The Verve Pipe *1999: \\"Be a Man\\" - Hole *2000: \\"Painted on My Heart\\" - The Cult *2002: Untouchables - Korn *2003: Natural Selection - Fuel *2003: Greatest Hits - Red Hot Chili Peppers *2004: Lest We Forget: The Best Of - Marilyn Manson *2005: Permanent Record: The Very Best of Violent Femmes - Violent Femmes *2005: The Best of Fuel - Fuel *2005: And the Glass Handed Kites - Mew *2006: A Public Display of Affection - The Blizzards *2006: Shot to Hell - Black Label Society *2006: Nightcrawler - Pete Yorn *2006: The Bronx - The Bronx *2007: Everything Last Winter - Fields *2008: The Sucker Punch Show - Lovedrug *2008: Domino Effect - The Blizzards *2010: Nobody's Daughter - Hole *2015: + - - Mew *2016: Control - Kensington ==References== ==External links== *michaelbeinhorn.com *Michael Beinhorn Discography by Christian Genzel *Michael Beinhorn biography at Artists Direct *How To Save Popular Music Category:21st-century American keyboardists Category:American record producers Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Material (band) members Category:The Ozzy Osbourne Band members Category:Deadline (band) members ","title":"Michael Beinhorn"},{"id":"3250497","text":"Urd by Andreas Bloch and Olaf Krohn. Urðr (Old Norse \\"fate\\"Orchard (1997:169).) is one of the Norns in Norse mythology. Along with Verðandi (possibly \\"happening\\" or \\"present\\"Orchard (1997:174).) and Skuld (possibly \\"debt\\" or \\"future\\"Orchard (1997:151).), Urðr makes up a trio of Norns that are described as deciding the fates of people. Urðr is attested in stanza 20 of the Poetic Edda poem Völuspá and the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning. Urðr is together with the other Norns located at the well Urðarbrunnr beneath the world ash tree Yggdrasil of Asgard. They spin threads of life, cut marks in the pole figures and measure people's destinies, which shows the fate of all human beings and gods. Norns are always present when a child is born and decide its fate. The three Norns represent the past (Urðr), future (Skuld) and present (Verðandi).Norner (Store norske leksikon)Nornor (Nordisk familjebok / Uggleupplagan. 19. Mykenai - Norrpada) Urðr is commonly written as Urd or Urth. In some English translations, her name is glossed with the Old English form of urðr; Wyrd. ==Attestations== ===Poetic Edda=== Yggdrasil is said to stand \\"always over Urd's well\\", or the well of fate, Urd's well is located in Asgard. Urd appears in the Völva's Prophecy Völuspá: > {  Benjamin Thorpe translation: :Thence come maidens, much knowing, :three > from the hall, which under that tree stands :Urd hight the one, the second > Verdandi, :on a tablet they graved—Skuld the third. :Laws they established, > life allotted to the sons of men; :destinies pronounced.Thorpe (1907:3).  > Henry Adams Bellows translation: :Thence come the maidens mighty in wisdom, > :Three from the dwelling down 'neath the tree; :Urth is one named, Verthandi > the next, — :On the wood they scored, — and Skuld the third. :Laws they made > there, and life allotted :To the sons of men, and set their fates.Bellows > (1923:9).  } ==References== ==Sources== *Bellows, Henry Adams (Trans.)

The township was established as part of the colonial survey of 1764 undertaken by Capt. Samuel J. Holland. It was intended to host the colonial capital of Prince Edward Island and shire town of Queens County, what would become known as Charlottetown. The township is located on a peninsula bounded by the North (Yorke) River on the west and the East (Hillsborough) River on the east. Originally, Charlottetown was unincorporated, therefore the \\"royalty\\" and the community were largely synonymous, with many using the term \\"Charlottetown Royalty\\". Charlottetown itself was not officially incorporated as a town until 1855 (and then only hosted 6,000 residents) and only became a city in 1885. The municipality's early boundaries (surveyed as 500 residential/commercial land parcels) only occupied a small portion of the township, with the remainder being divided into 12 acre properties, some of which were purchased as farms from the Crown, the remainder being estates or unused lands. The township was subdivided into an East Royalty, Central Royalty, and West Royalty, with the Central Royalty having common grazing land for all residents. Today, the royalty is almost entirely within the boundaries of the current city of Charlottetown, which has merged various outlying municipalities and rural areas through municipal amalgamation. Queens Royalty is part of Charlotte Parish.

It is administered by the Fort Bend County Toll Road Authority (FBCTRA). The Harris County Toll Road Authority (HCTRA) administers the Harris County (i.e., northern) segment of the road — from just south of Beltway 8 at the county line to US 90A — and uses its purple pentagonal shield labeled as Fort Bend Toll Road (the colloquial name for the entirety). It is proposed to reach a northern terminus at the southwestern corner of Interstate 610 in the future, and SH 99 at its southern terminus. The toll road has two lanes in each direction with major interchanges at Sienna Parkway, State Highway 6, Lake Olympia Parkway, and FM 2234, and a connection, albeit not seamless, with Beltway 8. There are Toll Plazas between every interchange in FBCTRA territory. Originally, a main toll plaza was located north of FM 2234 with ramp tollbooths at FM 2234 and Lake Olympia Parkway. Another toll plaza was located north of Beltway 8 in the HCTRA segment. The speed limit is 65 mph in the southern portion but drops to 60 mph inside Beltway 8. The cost for the toll road is estimated between $55 million and $60 million. ==History and formation== The tollway's origins date back to a TxDOT (Texas Department of Transportation) original proposal of building a highway from the southwest corner of I-610 in Houston (where North Braeswood and I-610 meet). A section of frontage roads (later part of Hillcroft Avenue in Houston) was constructed in the late 1960s/early 1970s (date unknown) south of the proposed Beltway 8 (Sam Houston Tollway), south of Harris County adjacent to the Chasewood and Willow Park II subdivisions in northeast Fort Bend County. Originally planned as either the West Loop Extension or the Bay City Freeway, the proposed freeway was cancelled in 1979 although remnants of the freeway exist (an extension of South Post Oak between West Bellfort and North/South Braeswood, along with a section of the Fort Bend Tollway between Beltway 8 and West Fuqua in Fort Bend County). Although the 1979 cancellation has ended TxDOT's highway proposal, Fort Bend County had an interest in the roadway project since 1984. On March 29, 1988, the parkway was officially designated by TxDOT as State Highway 122—stretching from Beltway 8 to the Grand Parkway (SH 99). Environmental and feasibility studies were conducted during the next 10 years. In November 2000, citizens of Fort Bend County approved a $140 million bond issue to support revenue bond financing for construction of the Parkway and Westpark projects. On February 27, 2003, the State Highway 122 designation was removed from the section north of State Highway 6, as this section would be constructed by the Fort Bend County Toll Road Authority (FBCTRA). After fulfilling prudent feasibility studies and careful planning, Fort Bend County Toll Road Authority (FBCTRA) broke ground and began the construction phase in July 2003. The Fort Bend Parkway Toll Road opened August 30, 2004. Harris County Commissioners' Court approved an approximate five-mile (8 km) extension of the proposed Fort Bend Parkway Toll Road project. While the primary corridor was constructed by the Fort Bend County Toll Road Authority, the extension was built by the Harris County Toll Road Authority and provides a connection from the Fort Bend County line at Beltway 8 to, currently, US Highway 90 Alternate, and in the future to the existing Post Oak Road at West Bellfort—near the southwest corner of I-610. In October 2019, HCTRA began to examine plans for the segment from US 90 Alternate to I-610 utilizing the original 2003 schematics.Harris County Toll Road Authority revisits plans for Fort Bend Parkway extension Community IMPACT Newspaper. 29 October 2020 (Retrieved 19 August 2020) In July 2008, cash collection was discontinued on the Fort Bend Parkway Toll Road (maintained by FBCTRA).

Eventually, it was decided that the toll road would not use state funding, so the SH 122 designation was no longer necessary. Although the Fort Bend Toll Road (Harris County) and the Fort Bend Parkway Toll Road (Fort Bend County) connect as one contiguous route, each is signed as a separate route. State Highway 122 existed as a placeholder for TxDOT in case it was decided to use state funding to build the toll road. ==Exit list== The proposed SH 122 would extend from SH 6 to the planned segment of SH 99 that will be built to the south. In the future, South Post Oak Road/Chimney Rock Road will be a part of the Fort Bend Parkway Tollway. ==References== ==External links== *Fort Bend County Toll Road Authority *Harris County Toll Road Authority Category:Transportation in Fort Bend County, Texas Category:Transportation in Harris County, Texas Category:Freeways in Houston Category:Toll roads in Texas Category:County roads in Fort Bend County, Texas Category:County roads in Harris County, Texas ","title":"Fort Bend Parkway"},{"id":"3250561","text":"right Georgetown Royalty is the royalty for Kings County, Prince Edward Island, Canada.

Jacob \\"Jack\\" Isaacson was a sergeant in the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and Dolly was a homemaker. He was raised in The Bronx, where he attended DeWitt Clinton High School and was classmates with Judd Hirsch and Garry Marshall. By his mid-teens, due to his mother's influential personality, Isaacson had decided he wanted to be in show business. He even placed a star on his bedroom door. He started to entertain at parties he attended with his parents, usually doing a mixture of singing and comedy. He also played varsity football and basketball for DeWitt Clinton High School. Later, he gained a football and basketball scholarship to Kalamazoo College in Kalamazoo, Michigan, where he spent three years. ==Early career== After leaving college, Isaacson formed a double act with his best friend Manny Glasser called \\"Donny and the Duke\\". The duo worked in local New York nightclubs for a few months before Isaacson was drafted into the US Army at age 21. He was commissioned as an officer and served in the artillery. While in the army he formed a double act with fellow soldier Murray Levine, Isaacson usually playing the comic while his partner was the straight man. The double act went on to win the All- Army entertainment contest and earned them an appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1955. One year later Isaacson won the All-Army entertainment contest again as a solo act. After his mandatory service in the army, he later toured for two years entertaining troops all over the United States. After touring the country entertaining the troops as a solo performer, Isaacson started to work his act in the New York nightclubs. It was at this time that he adopted the stage name of \\"Don Lane\\", after fellow entertainer Frankie Laine. Lane worked his act in nightclubs throughout New York, Los Angeles and the showrooms in Las Vegas. During his stint in Las Vegas, he worked alongside Wayne Newton and was often a supporting act for performers such as Sammy Davis Jr.. While in Los Angeles, Lane also worked as an actor and featured in national commercials for Coca-Cola, which Lane said \\"paid the bills for years\\".http://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=don%20lane&docid;=1364947436068∣=AD4F0B02DCC223ED321AAD4F0B02DCC223ED321A&FORM;=LKVR He then returned to New York and performed at weddings, nightclubs and parties. In 1964 Lane was offered a contract to be the headline act at The Dunes Nightclub in Honolulu, Hawaii. This was his first offer to become a headliner and first guaranteed contract as a solo performer. Due to the lucrative offer The Dunes Nightclub made to him, he quickly relocated to Honolulu, where he first started to enjoy success as a headline performer. It was in Hawaii that he met his first wife, Gina, who was an exotic dancer. ==Australian television career== ===Tonight with Don Lane: 1965–1969=== In 1965 the Irish comedian Dave Allen presented a talk show on Sydney television for TCN-9. He was eventually sacked and Nine producer John Collins looked for replacement hosts to fill in for the rest of the season. After a series of temporary hosts, Collins found Lane working in The Dunes Nightclub in Hawaii. While in the United States, Collins asked Las Vegas performer Wayne Newton if there was anybody he should consider as a replacement; Newton's answer was \\"Don Lane\\". Lane was offered the job after filming and sending in an audition tape for the TCN-9 executives. He was given the host's chair for six weeks. He planned to base his version of the show on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show. Lane's run was variously referred to as The Tonight Show, Tonight with Don Lane and Sydney Tonight. Within a month, Nine settled on Lane as permanent host. After four weeks, his original six-week contract was extended to forty weeks. Tonight with Don Lane featured comedy sketches, interviews with visiting entertainers and musical numbers often performed by Lane with the Tonight Show Orchestra. The announcer for the show was Mike Walsh, who later went on to host his own successful variety show. Don Lane and Graham Kennedy split-screen via co-axial cable. Due to technical restrictions, Lane's tonight show was only broadcast throughout New South Wales, just as In Melbourne Tonight(IMT) was restricted to Victoria. Work on a coaxial cable linking Melbourne with Sydney had begun in June 1959 and was completed on 5 February 1963. On 7 July 1965, Lane appeared on a then-innovative live split-screen link with Graham Kennedy via the cable. Lane and Kennedy sang the song \\"Seventy-Six Trombones\\" as a duet. They took full advantage of the new technology and the duet included the performers throwing jugs of water and Kennedy holding up a sign saying \\"Go Home Yank\\", to which Lane laughed. Lane also performed another duet with Kennedy at the Logies ceremony in 1967. In March 1968, Lane was charged with importing marijuana into Australia. He was arrested at Sydney Airport and remanded in custody. He strenuously protested his innocence, claiming that the drugs were planted into his jacket pocket by a former business associate who wanted revenge. He was found not guilty on all charges, being defended by barrister Marcus Einfeld. ===Return to the United States=== When Lane's Tonight Show ended in 1969 he returned to the United States and the Las Vegas showrooms, this time appearing as a headline act. While in Las Vegas he played Professor Harold Hill in the Las Vegas production of The Music Man. The songs \\"Trouble\\" and \\"Seventy-Six Trombones\\", both from that musical, became his signature tunes. He also appeared in the American comedy series Wow, hosted by Ken Berry, which also featured Cheryl Ladd and Steve Martin. The Wow show was a sketch comedy series similar to the format of Saturday Night Live and was the summer replacement show for The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour. Lane was a regular cast member on the show, which lasted three months. ===The Don Lane Show: 1975–1983=== In 1975, Lane returned to Australia and appeared at a benefit concert for the victims of Cyclone Tracy. The concert was held at the Sydney Opera House and Lane sang and performed a sketch with Toni Lamond. While in Sydney in 1975, Lane was chosen to replace Ernie Sigley as host of the Melbourne-based The Ernie Sigley Show. The night before, after filming for the first show of the season was completed, Sigley had criticised Nine Network boss Kerry Packer. Packer contacted Lane and the two flew down to Melbourne. Sigley was fired that afternoon and Lane took his place. Lane's replacement of Sigley was to result in continuing resentment, culminating in a fight in which Lane punched Sigley at the Logies ceremony in 1986. Lane was to host two specials revamping the old In Melbourne Tonight. The producers wanted a \\"barrel boy\\" sidekick for Lane. Lane suggested Bert Newton: > I used to watch him and Graham working on IMT, and look at them with great > envy. So I said 'what about Bert Newton?' If I’m going to work with somebody > I want to know that he's as sharp as anything and a real pro. Newton had hitherto been strongly identified with Australian TV presenter Graham Kennedy. Both Lane and Newton maintain that the first time they met was on-air, during the first episode of the Don Lane Show. Each describes that there was instant \\"chemistry\\" and that they never made any deliberate attempt to build the relationship; that it just happened. Lane described the on-screen chemistry during an interview in 2003: > We were magic from the time he walked out from the curtain …you don't try to > explain those things. You just take them and you use them and you enjoy them > and most of all you appreciate them, because they don't happen often, they > happen once in a rare while. The IMT special was a ratings success. The show was renamed The Don Lane Show and ran until 1983. Like its predecessor, the show was produced at the studios of GTV 9 in Melbourne and aired over the Nine Network. Lane's stint on the show was to make him the most highly paid performer on Australian television and The Don Lane Show is still the highest rated variety program in Australian television history. The Don Lane Show featured big musical numbers, notable guests and comedy sketches. It was produced by Peter Faiman, who went on to direct Crocodile Dundee and the 2000 Olympics Opening Ceremony. Also featured was the 18-piece \\"Don Lane Orchestra\\" conducted by musical director Graeme Lyall and announcer Pete Smith. The show went live-to-air twice a week on Mondays and Thursdays, usually running for ninety minutes from 9:30 to 11.00 pm, although, depending on the length of interviews and \\"the wheel\\" segment, it could finish much later. On one occasion, it ran two hours over time while Sammy Davis Jr. was escorted by a police car from his concert to the studio in a surprise for Lane. Lane and Newton also did infomercials in which they were given free rein to improvise. The show broke down Australia's \\"distance barriers\\" and used innovative technology to conduct satellite interviews with prominent entertainers overseas. Most major recording artists visiting Australia from overseas were guests on the show. Among the live performances and interviews were ABBA, Adam Ant, David Bowie, Bucks Fizz, Chubby Checker, Dr Hook, Duran Duran, Sheena Easton, John Farnham, Aretha Franklin, Hall & Oates, Colleen Hewett, Whitney Houston, Elton John, Kiss, Jerry Lee Lewis, John Mellencamp, Olivia Newton-John, Roy Orbison, Robert Palmer, Tom Petty, the Pointer Sisters, Cliff Richard, Lionel Richie, Demis Roussos, Leo Sayer, Boz Scaggs, Del Shannon, Tina Turner, the Village People, Tom Waits, Dionne Warwick, Stevie Wonder, and John Paul Young. Robin Williams made his first talk show appearance on the show and Lane once played tennis with Charlton Heston and also performed in a sketch with The Osmonds and performed duets with people such as Vic Damone, Cilla Black, Debbie Reynolds and Lane's idol, Sammy Davis Jr.. On Lane's 47th birthday in 1980, during an episode of the show he received a telegram from KISS (who at the time were touring Australia) wishing him a happy birthday and apologising for not being able to be there. He then received a surprise on-set visit from Gene Simmons and Ace Frehley. During a chat with Frehley (who like Lane grew up in The Bronx) it was revealed that both had attended DeWitt Clinton High School.Gene Simmons and Ace Frehley on The Don Lane Show 1980 Although The Don Lane Show featured major acts from around the world, it was also known for helping young local entertainers to establish themselves. John Farnham was featured on numerous occasions and attributes Lane to helping his career: > He helped me over my nerves on being on live TV, he always had something > positive to say and always gave me much-needed advice, which I still rely > heavily on today. Uri Geller, Doris Stokes and broadcaster Kevin Arnett regularly appeared on The Don Lane Show discussing psychic and paranormal themes. On one occasion in 1980, the skeptic James Randi was a guest on the program. After Randi criticised one of the show's regulars, a heated exchange occurred at the end of the interview, which led to Lane saying, \\"we're going for a commercial break and you can piss off. We'll be back with Diana Trask\\". Lane then walked off the set, sweeping the props from the small table, to audience applause. The aftermath of the event led to a national and personal apology to Randi, which was televised on the Nine Network. Due to new management at Channel 9 and its expensive budget, the show was cancelled despite still having strong ratings. During its time on air the show often gained a 30 per cent share of all viewers in the ratings. The Don Lane Show ended on 13 November 1983, Lane's 50th birthday. His final episode ran for two and a half hours and featured such stars as Billy Connolly, Phyllis Diller and David Bowie as well as musical appearances by John Farnham and Colleen Hewett. After tributes from Bert Newton and many guests, Lane ended his final show with an emotional performance of Peter Allen's \\"Once Before I Go\\". He then took a final bow with \\"The Don Lane Show\\" written in lights behind him and the screen faded to black. ===Channel 10=== When The Don Lane Show finished, Lane moved to Los Angeles in an attempt to pursue a career in film and US television. The most notable thing he auditioned for during that period was the role of Eddie Valiant in Who Framed Roger Rabbit. He was a finalist for the role when the director could not get any A-listers to accept it. In 1987 Lane was back in Australia working with Network Ten where he hosted two short-lived comedy shows; You've Got to Be Joking (which featured practical jokes) and Talkin' To Kids with Don Lane. Both were attempts to be in a popular children's show that his son could watch, then go to school and tell his classmates who were talking about it that, that was his dad in the show. He also hosted the 1987 Logie Awards. The following year, Lane fronted his own talk show for Ten entitled Late Night Australia, eventually changed to Late Night Oz. The program aired five nights a week at 10:30 pm and was up against Graham Kennedy's News Show on the Nine Network and Clive Robertson's Newsworld on the Seven Network. Late Night Oz was cancelled after just six months. ===Sportscasting career: 1991–1996=== Lane's career surged again in 1991, this time in the role of a sportscaster. Lane's passion for American football and basketball found a home on the ABC, where he continued to win fans and a new audience for the sports he loved. ABC sports boss David Salter was interested in televising NFL games from the United States with a host who could transcend both American football and rugby league. When learning of Lane's love for both codes, he put him in the host's chair, where he would stay for nearly six years. Lane hosted American NFL broadcasts twice a week and would give enthusiastic weekly reviews of all games with explanations of the rules for the Australian audience. Don was flown to the United States to host live broadcasts from Super Bowl XXVII and Super Bowl XXVIII, which was the first time an Australian broadcaster had done live coverage from a Super Bowl. In 1993 the sports department expanded at the ABC, and Lane hosted NCAA basketball and football for the network for the following two years. He was also a colour commentator for NBL telecasts on the ABC and Foxtel. ===Late television career=== Lane made a guest appearance on the very last episode of The Late Show on the ABC in 1993. Lane closed the show singing \\"Saturday Night is the Loneliest Night of the Week\\". When finished with the song, the Late Show big band played the theme for The Don Lane Show and Lane went behind the camera to film audience members, just as he ended most Don Lane Shows. In 1994, Lane hosted two specials for the Nine Network of The Best of The Don Lane Show. Each special was two hours dedicated to the most memorable moments from The Don Lane Show. In an interview in 1994, Lane explained that coming back to The Don Lane Show environment was very emotional: > The eight and a half years of that television show is firmly embedded in the > minds of many people, and firmly branded into the heads of us. Those were > very special years, and to have that all come together meant so much to all > of us. Lane was honoured in a 1996 episode of This Is Your Life dedicated to him and his career in television. The episode featured tributes from John Farnham, Billy Connolly, Bert Newton, and Garry Marshall. Lane was also involved in a special entitled Don Lane's America and hosted such programs as The Mad Mad World of Sports and 40 Years of Television. He also hosted a special for Channel 9 titled The Best of Studio 9. The special highlighted the shows and memorable moments that were filmed in Studio 9 in Melbourne. Lane also returned to sportscasting in 2001 to broadcast the Super Bowl on SBS. ==Radio career== During his time on The Don Lane Show, Lane also hosted a morning radio program with Bert Newton on radio station 3UZ in Melbourne. Newton tells a story of how he and the producer pretended to be on-air and gave out Lane's home address to the listeners. Newton claims that the joke was worth it to see Lane's reaction but that Lane repaid him for the practical joke.http://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=don%20lane&docid;=1364980466741∣=FD850A94E1DEEB20FD93FD850A94E1DEEB20FD93&FORM;=LKVR28 The program on 3UZ had many guests who had also appeared on the television show the night before. When moving to Sydney in 1987, Lane hosted a morning show on 2UE for two years. After ending his affiliation with 2UE, he moved to 2KY and hosted a competing breakfast program in 1989. His radio programs usually involved music and interviews with visiting entertainers. ==Cabaret performer== Because of his Las Vegas nightclub background, Lane would work in clubs and theatres throughout Sydney, Melbourne and the Gold Coast. He would work nightclubs, theatres and theatre restaurants when he was not working on television. When first arriving in Australia and hosting his tonight show, an agent named Richard Gray saw the appeal that Lane had and asked him to come and do his \\"act\\" at South Sydney Junior Rugby League Club, which was one of Sydney's premier venues. Lane then worked in clubs all over Sydney when his show was not in season, perfecting his act and carrying on from his early nightclub experience. During the era of The Don Lane Show, Lane would perform at Melbourne's premier theatre venues such as The Princess Theatre and Her Majesty's Theatre. Don Lane in Concert was a television special in 1980 which showed Lane's 90-minute stage act live on Channel 9. The musical director for The Don Lane Show, Graeme Lyall, was under contract with the network, so any song which Lane liked was made into an arrangement for an 18-piece orchestra with three backing vocals. During the Don Lane in Concert television special, Lane performed his signature tunes such as \\"Seventy-Six Trombones\\" and \\"Trouble\\". But Lane also performed songs that were new at the time such as \\"I Still Call Australia Home\\", \\"They're Playing Our Song\\" and \\"'She's Out of My life\\"'. Each song was arranged to accommodate Lane's \\"crooning\\" style by musical director Graeme Lyall. Entertainment reporter Peter Ford of radio 2UE described Lane's club act: > Don was a terrific television personality. But when you saw Don doing his > floor show, whether in clubs or theatres, when he had a live audience and > band he really owned that stage. Don Lane knew how to work a room and gave > us Las Vegas \\"pizazz\\" whenever he performed. Lane was responsible for the name of the original club entertainment awards, the \\"MO\\" Awards. Originally named the New South Wales Star Awards, the awards took on the name coined by Lane when they went national. His suggestion not only proved to be a popular name for the awards, it also honours the memory of one of Australia's greatest clowns and comics – Roy Rene, who became a legend in the entertainment industry using the stage name of \\"Mo\\" McCackie. Lane was a recipient of five Mo Awards. Lane was a patron of the Australian Club Entertainment (ACE) Awards, and was honored in 2006 when he was presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the ACE Awards ceremony. Lane was still performing in 2005 in nightclubs all over Sydney. ==Personal life== Lane married Jayne Ambrose, a talent agent, with whom he had a son, Phillip Jacob \\"P.J.\\" Isaacson.Spider PJ and his life as the Fast Lane, Steven Deare, Hornsby and Upper North Shore Advocate, 9 April 2009. His son moved to the United States to further his basketball career, although he later became an entertainer in his own right using the name PJ Lane. He moved back to Sydney in 2009 to look after his ailing father. Although Lane and Ambrose later divorced, they remained good friends and she was his agent for the rest of his life. In 2007 Lane released his \\"tell all\\" autobiography entitled Never Argue With a Mug. The book follows Lane's career and explains in details show- business scandals which he had personally experienced. In June 2008, it was announced that Lane was suffering from Alzheimer's disease and had been living in a care facility for a number of years. News of Lane's condition was saddening for the entertainment community in Australia who viewed him as a TV legend. This explained the lack of public appearances that Lane had made since his induction into the Logie Awards Hall of Fame in 2003. ==Logie awards== The Logie Awards were made in each state separately during the 1960s and early 70s, since it was technically difficult to broadcast live programming interstate. Lane performed in Sydney while Graham Kennedy held the same timeslot in Melbourne. New South Wales Logies: * 1966: Most Popular Male and Most Popular Live Show (Tonight with Don Lane) * 1967: Most Popular Male and Most Popular Live Show (Tonight with Don Lane) * 1968: Best Male Personality and Best Show (Tonight with Don Lane) * 1969: Best Male Personality and Best Show (Tonight with Don Lane) * 1970: Best Male Personality and Best Local Show (Tonight Show with Don Lane) * 1974: Most Popular Male and Most Popular Show (The Don Lane Show) National Logie awards: *Gold Logie 1977. * Most Popular Male Personality * Victoria: Most Popular Male * Most Popular Show In 2003, Lane was inducted into the TV Week Logie Awards Hall of Fame. In 2010, after his death, his son performed a tribute to him. ==Death and public memorial== Lane's grave at Macquarie Park. Lane died from a dementia-related illness caused by Alzheimer's disease on 22 October 2009 in Sydney. During the last eighteen months of his life, due to his deteriorating health, he relocated from his Sydney apartment to Montefiore Nursing Home in Randwick in Sydney's east. A private Jewish funeral ceremony and burial attended by close family and friends was held at Macquarie Park Cemetery and Crematorium a day after his death. On 5 November 2009 a public memorial was held for Lane at the South Sydney Junior Rugby League Club. The memorial was open to all members of the public, who were asked only for a donation to Alzheimer's Australia. Over 1,100 people crammed into the showroom at the club which had a usual capacity of only 600. Other members of the public viewed the memorial on televisions around the club. The memorial celebration featured live performances and speeches from Lane's close friends, such as Rhonda Burchmore, Bert Newton, Mike McColl-Jones, Mike Cleary, Toni Lamond and Helen Reddy. Lane's son opened the memorial with \\"They're Playing Our Song\\", which was his father's opening number, and earned a standing ovation for his performance. Lane was remembered as a generous performer who possessed a matching personality off the television screen as he did on. During Bert Newton's tribute, he removed his toupee, to reveal largely bare terrain underneath. The memorial ended with a recording of Lane's performance of \\"Once Before I Go\\" on the final Don Lane Show which received a standing ovation to audience tears and applause. ==References== ==Further reading== * * * ==External links== *Shirl visits Australia's favourite \\"Lanky Yank\\" at home *The Don Lane story : Never Argue With a Mug *MILESAGO – Television – The Logies Category:1933 births Category:2009 deaths Category:American Jews Category:American television talk show hosts Category:American television hosts Category:Gold Logie winners Category:Television personalities from New York City Category:People from Sydney Category:United States Army officers Category:Deaths from Alzheimer's disease Category:Disability rights activists from the United States Category:American emigrants to Australia Category:Disease-related deaths in New South Wales Category:Activists from New York City Category:DeWitt Clinton High School alumni ","title":"Don Lane"},{"id":"3250584","text":"Garry Andrew Hocking (born 8 October 1968) is a former Australian rules footballer and the current assistant coach at Collingwood in the Australian Football League (AFL). He was formerly the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) senior coach of the Port Adelaide Magpies squad, and he served as caretaker coach of Port Adelaide in the AFL for 4 games in 2012, replacing the sacked Matthew Primus. For a brief period in 1999, he was known as Whiskas in a deal with the cat-food manufacturer. ==Playing career== Hailing from Cobram, Hocking was part of then Geelong coach John Devine's mass recruiting drive which also netted players such as Gavin Exell, Bruce Lindner, Dwayne Russell, Mark Bairstow and Anthony \\"Billy\\" Brownless in the mid-1980s. Hocking represented Victoria on numerous occasions in the State of Origin series and played in four losing Grand Final sides (1989, 1992, 1994, 1995). Hocking was considered unlucky not to win the Brownlow Medal, due to his many close finishes, finishing amongst the top three vote-getters on four occasions, although twice as an ineligible player. Hocking's consistency over a period was recognised by the club in 1995 when after former-captain Bairstow's departure at the end of 1994, Hocking was given the captaincy role for the 1995 season. However early in the season, he stated his intentions to give up the captaincy to concentrate purely on playing. The role would be shared between three players; Ken Hinkley, Barry Stoneham and Gary Ablett. Hocking's tenacity, hardness, consistency and quality was rewarded in 2001 when he was named ruck-rover in Geelong's Team of the Century; a great honour given the fact there have been other quality ruck-rovers in Geelong's history. In the late 1990s (1999) Hocking was part of a promotion with cat-food company Whiskas, where for a short period of time he changed his name by deed-poll to \\"Whiskas\\". He announced this on The Footy Show. This was to help lessen the financial burden that the Geelong Football Club was facing at the time. Hocking retired at the end of the 2001 AFL season after playing 274 games, which at the time was the third highest number of games for Geelong. He was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame on 8 March 2008. ==Coaching career== ===Peel Thunder=== After his playing career, which ended in 2001, Hocking moved into coaching. In 2005, he coached Peel Thunder Football Club in the WAFL, a team which was struggling and managed to win just 4 games for the year in 2005. In one match, Hocking employed a tactic where every player on the Peel team was stationed in defense for a centre-bounce. Known as a \\"full- flood\\", this was viewed as a farcical situation, and one that Hocking wanted to use with his team down by a massive margin. Hocking has promised never to use the tactic again, and has said that in this one instance, it was appropriate for the circumstance.Flood reaches shocking level ===Geelong Falcons=== In 2006, Hocking was the coach for the Geelong Falcons Under 18s side. ===Port Adelaide=== At the end of the 2009 AFL season, Hocking joined the coaching staff at Port Adelaide. On 6 August 2012, he was appointed caretaker coach for the remainder of the 2012 season after Matthew Primus was sacked.Club statement: Primus & Duncanson portadelaidefc 6 August 2012 On 4 October 2013, Hocking was announced as the SANFL senior coach of Port Adelaide, a position he held in 2014 and 2015 before returning to be an assistant coach at Port Adelaide's AFL squad.http://www.portadelaidefc.com.au/news/2015-09-15/hocking-to-vacate- sanfl-coaching-role Hocking left Port Adelaide at the end of the 2016 season. === South Adelaide === In 2017, Hocking was appointed senior coach of the South Adelaide Panthers Football Club in the SANFL for 2 years. === Collingwood === At the end of 2017, Hocking returned to the AFL by accepting a position as assistant coach at Collingwood for the 2018 season. He was appointed senior coach of the club's VFL (reserves) side ahead of the 2020 season. ==Statistics== ===Playing statistics=== :Garry Hocking's player profile at AFL Tables - - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1987 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  51  6  2  1  41  26  67  10  7  0.3  0.2  6.8  4.3  11.2  1.7  1.2  0 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   1988 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  32  3  0  0  26  17  43  7  4  0.0  0.0  8.7  5.7  14.3  2.3  1.3  0 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1989 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  32  26  24  12  285  217  502  81  56  0.9  0.5  11.0  8.3  19.3  3.1  2.2  12 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   1990 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  32  21  14  12  278  204  482  60  40  0.7  0.6  13.2  9.7  23.0  2.9  1.9  0 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1991 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  32  25  41  28  362  265  627  70  47  1.6  1.1  14.5  10.6  25.1  2.8  1.9  19 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   1992 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  32  20  19  18  235  230  465  77  43  1.0  0.9  11.8  11.5  23.3  3.9  2.2  0 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1993 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  32  18  18  17  284  186  470  74  31  1.0  0.9  15.8  10.3  26.1  4.1  1.7  17 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   1994 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  32  24  16  20  338  273  611  85  48  0.7  0.8  14.1  11.4  25.5  3.5  2.0  20 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1995 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  32  21  15  8  270  216  486  77  49  0.7  0.4  12.9  10.3  23.1  3.7  2.3  17 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   1996 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  32  23  21  15  313  270  583  85  66  0.9  0.7  13.6  11.7  25.3  3.7  2.9  19 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1997 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  32  20  27  9  255  192  447  80  49  1.4  0.5  12.8  9.6  22.4  4.0  2.5  2 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   1998 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  32  17  12  4  234  170  404  61  40  0.7  0.2  13.8  10.0  23.8  3.6  2.4  14 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1999 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  32  12  7  4  158  105  263  48  18  0.6  0.3  13.2  8.8  21.9  4.0  1.5  5 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   2000 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  32  21  17  3  255  217  472  70  59  0.8  0.1  12.1  10.3  22.5  3.3  2.8  7 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2001 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  32  17  10  9  122  128  250  45  53  0.6  0.5  7.2  7.5  14.7  2.6  3.1  1 - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! colspan=3 Career ! 274 ! 243 ! 160 ! 3456 ! 2716 ! 6172 ! 930 ! 610 ! 0.9 ! 0.6 ! 12.6 ! 9.9 ! 22.5 ! 3.4 ! 2.2 ! 133 } ===Coaching statistics=== : - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center; font-weight:normal\\"  2012 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  4  0  3  1  12.5%   - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! colspan=2 Career totals ! 4 ! 0 ! 3 ! 1 ! 12.5% ! colspan=2 } ==Honours== *Inducted into Australian Football Hall of Fame in 2008 *All-Australian Team (1991, 1993, 1994, 1996) *Geelong Team of the Century (Ruck-Rover) *Carji Greeves Medal (1991, 1993, 1994, 1996) (club record) *Brownlow Medal top 3 (3rd 1991, 1994) *Brownlow Medal most votes for Geelong (1991, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1998) ==References== ==External links== * Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Geelong Football Club players Category:Carji Greeves Medal winners Category:All-Australians (AFL) Category:Victorian State of Origin players Category:Sportspeople from Geelong Category:Peel Thunder Football Club coaches Category:Port Adelaide Football Club coaches Category:Port Adelaide Football Club (SANFL) coaches Category:Australian Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:Cobram Football Club players ","title":"Garry Hocking"},{"id":"3250610","text":"The Campaign of the Carolinas (January 1 – April 26, 1865), also known as the Carolinas Campaign, was the final campaign conducted by the United States Army (Union Army) against the Confederate States Army in the Western Theater. On January 1, Union Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman advanced north from Savannah, Georgia, through the Carolinas, with the intention of linking up with Union forces in Virginia. The defeat of Confederate Gen. Joseph E. Johnston's army at the Battle of Bentonville, and its unconditional surrender to Union forces on April 26, 1865, effectively ended the American Civil War. ==Background== After Sherman captured Savannah, the culmination of his 'March to the Sea', he was ordered by Union Army general-in-chief Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant to embark his army on ships to reinforce the Army of the Potomac and the Army of the James in Virginia, where Grant was bogged down in the Siege of Petersburg against Confederate General Robert E. Lee. Sherman had bigger things in mind. He predicted on January 5, 1865: \\"I do think that in the several grand epochs of this war, my name will have a prominent part.\\" He persuaded Grant that he should march north through the Carolinas instead, destroying everything of military value along the way, similar to his 'March to the Sea' through Georgia. Sherman was particularly interested in targeting South Carolina, as the first state to secede from the Union, for the effect it would have on Southern morale. Sherman's army commenced toward Columbia, South Carolina, in late January 1865. His 60,079 men were divided into two wings: the Army of the Tennessee, and two corps, the XIV and XX, under Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum, which was later formally designated the Army of Georgia. Reinforcements arrived regularly during his march north, and by April 1 he commanded 88,948 men after the Army of the Ohio under Maj. Gen. John M. Schofield joined up at Goldsboro, NC.Eicher, p. 797. Sherman's opponents on the Confederate side had considerably fewer men. The primary force in the Carolinas was the battered Army of Tennessee, again under the command of Gen. Joseph E. Johnston (who had been relieved of duty by Confederate President Jefferson Davis during the Atlanta Campaign against Sherman and restored after John Bell Hood led a disastrous invasion of Tennessee). His strength was recorded in mid-March at 9,513 and 15,188 by mid-April. The army was organized into three corps, commanded by Lt. Gen. William J. Hardee, Lt. Gen. Alexander P. Stewart, and Lt. Gen. Stephen D. Lee. Also in the Carolinas were cavalry forces from the division of Maj. Gen. Wade Hampton and a small number in Wilmington, North Carolina, under Gen. Braxton Bragg. Sherman's plan was to bypass the minor Confederate troop concentrations at Augusta, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, and reach Goldsboro, North Carolina, by March 15. As with his Georgia operations, Sherman marched his armies in multiple directions simultaneously, confusing the scattered Confederate defenders as to his first true objective, which was the state capital of Columbia, South Carolina. ==Opposing forces== ===Union=== ===Confederate=== ==Battles== Sherman's advance: Tennessee, Georgia and Carolinas (1863–65). Movements in Carolinas Campaign The following battles were fought in the Carolinas Campaign. ===Rivers' Bridge (February 3, 1865)=== Sherman's Army crossing the Edisto during the Carolinas Campaign from 1872 children's textbook. The Confederate division of Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws attempted to prevent the crossing of the Salkehatchie River by the right wing of Sherman's army. The Union division under Maj. Gen. Francis P. Blair (Howard's army) crossed the river and assaulted McLaws' flank. McLaws withdrew to Branchville, causing only one day's delay in the Union advance.NPS Rivers' Bridge On February 17, Columbia, SC, surrendered to Sherman, and Hampton's cavalry retreated from the city. Union forces were overwhelmed by throngs of liberated Federal prisoners and emancipated slaves. Many soldiers took advantage of ample supplies of liquor in the city and began to drink. Fires began in the city, and high winds spread the flames across a wide area. Most of the central city was destroyed, and the city's fire companies found it difficult to operate in conjunction with the invading Union army, many of whom were also trying to put out the fire. The burning of Columbia has engendered controversy ever since, with some claiming the fires were accidental, others stating they were a deliberate act of vengeance as in Atlanta, and others claiming that the fires were set by retreating Confederate soldiers who lit bales of cotton on their way out of town. On that same day, the Confederates evacuated Charleston. On February 18, Sherman's forces destroyed virtually anything of military value in Columbia, including railroad depots, warehouses, arsenals, and machine shops. On February 22, Wilmington, NC surrendered. ===Aiken (February 11)=== This battle took place entirely in South Carolina. ===Wyse Fork (March 7–10)=== Schofield planned to advance inland from Wilmington, NC, in February. At the same time, he assigned Maj. Gen. Jacob D. Cox to direct Union forces from New Bern toward Goldsboro. On March 7, Cox's advance was stopped by divisions under Gen. Braxton Bragg's command at Southwest Creek south of Kinston, North Carolina. On March 8, the Confederates attempted to seize the initiative by attacking the Union flanks. After initial success, their attacks stalled because of faulty communications. On March 9, the Union forces were reinforced and beat back Bragg's renewed attacks on March 10 after heavy fighting. Bragg withdrew across the Neuse River and was unable to prevent the fall of Kinston on March 14.NPS Wyse Fork ===Monroe's Cross Roads (March 10)=== As Sherman's army advanced into North Carolina, Maj. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick's Cavalry Division screened its left flank. On the evening of March 9, two of Kilpatrick's brigades encamped near the Charles Monroe House in Cumberland (now Hoke) County. Early on March 10, Hampton's Confederate cavalry surprised the Federals in their camps, driving them back in confusion and capturing wagons and artillery. The Federals regrouped and counterattacked, regaining their artillery and camps after a desperate fight. With Union reinforcements on the way, the Confederates withdrew.NPS Monroe's Cross Roads ===Averasborough (March 16)=== On the afternoon of March 15, Kilpatrick's cavalry came up against Hardee's corps deployed across the Raleigh Road near Smithville. After feeling out the Confederate defenses, Kilpatrick withdrew and called for infantry support. During the night, four divisions of the XX Corps arrived to confront the Confederates. At dawn, March 16, the Federals advanced on a division front, driving back skirmishers, but they were stopped by the main Confederate line and a counterattack. Mid-morning, the Federals renewed their advance with strong reinforcements and drove the Confederates from two lines of works, but they were repulsed at a third line. Late afternoon, the Union XIV Corps began to arrive on the field but was unable to deploy before dark because of the swampy ground. Hardee retreated during the night after holding up the Union advance for nearly two days.NPS Averasborough ===Bentonville (March 19–21)=== While Slocum's advance was stalled at Averasborough by Hardee's troops, the right wing of Sherman's army under Howard marched toward Goldsboro. On March 19, Slocum encountered the entrenched Confederates of Gen. Joseph E. Johnston who had concentrated to meet his advance at Bentonville. Johnston had increased his forces to about 21,000 men by absorbing the troops under Bragg, who had abandoned Wilmington. Late afternoon, Johnston attacked, crushing the line of the XIV Corps. Only strong counterattacks and desperate fighting south of the Goldsborough Road blunted the Confederate offensive. Elements of the XX Corps were thrown into the action as they arrived on the field. Five Confederate attacks failed to dislodge the Federal defenders, and darkness ended the first day's fighting. During the night, Johnston contracted his line into a \\"V\\" to protect his flanks, with Mill Creek to his rear. On March 20, Slocum was heavily reinforced, but fighting was sporadic. Sherman was inclined to let Johnston retreat. On March 21, however, Johnston remained in position while he removed his wounded. Skirmishing heated up along the entire front. In the afternoon, Maj. Gen. Joseph Mower led his Union division along a narrow trace that carried it across Mill Creek into Johnston's rear. Confederate counterattacks stopped Mower's advance, saving the army's only line of communication and retreat. Mower withdrew, ending fighting for the day. During the night, Johnston retreated across the bridge at Bentonville. Union forces pursued at first light, driving back Wheeler's rearguard and saving the bridge. Federal pursuit was halted at Hannah's Creek after a severe skirmish. Sherman, after regrouping at Goldsboro, pursued Johnston toward Raleigh.NPS Bentonville ==Aftermath== Sherman's Carolina Campaign, in which his troops marched in 50 days, was similar to his march to the sea through Georgia, although physically more demanding. However, the Confederate forces opposing him were much smaller and more dispirited. When Joseph E. Johnston met with Jefferson Davis in Greensboro on April 12–13, he told the Confederate president: On April 18, three days after the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, Johnston signed an armistice with Sherman at Bennett Place, a farmhouse near Durham Station. Sherman got himself into political hot water by offering terms of surrender to Johnston that encompassed political issues as well as military, without authorization from General Grant or the United States government. The confusion on this issue lasted until April 26, when Johnston agreed to purely military terms and formally surrendered his army and all Confederate forces in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. It was the second significant surrender that month. On April 9, Robert E. Lee had surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House. It was the virtual end for the Confederacy, although some smaller forces held out, particularly in the Trans-Mississippi region, into the summer. ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== *Eicher, David J.

M/V Columbia at Bellingham Cruise TerminalConstructed in 1974 by Lockheed Shipbuilding in Seattle, Washington, the M/V Columbia has been the flagship vessel for the Alaska ferry system for over 40 years. As a mainline ferry, which means it serves the largest of the inside passage communities (such as Ketchikan, Wrangell, Petersburg, Juneau, Haines, Skagway, and Sitka), its route spans the entirety of the inside passage, often beginning runs in Bellingham, Washington and running to the northernmost Alaskan Panhandle community of Skagway stopping in communities along the way, during the summer season (winter services are sometimes operated by the MV Malaspina). Columbia has an upper deck between the main vehicle deck and the cabin deck with additional vehicle stowage accessed by two vehicle elevators capable of hoisting 19 foot vehicles with their passengers, and additional passenger cabins. On July 2, 2006, an auxiliary engine room fire broke out on the Columbia temporarily impairing steering and propulsion on its northbound voyage from Bellingham in Seymour Narrows in Canadian waters. The ship motored to Duncan Bay, British Columbia for damage assessment before continuing on to Ketchikan's Alaska Ship & Dry Dock for more extensive repairs. Early on 15 August 2007, only two months before a scheduled overhaul, position number two connecting rod in the Columbias starboard engine experienced a bearing failure. To prevent catastrophic damage to the surrounding components the engine was secured. The 268 passengers were rerouted, and it was sent to Ketchikan, where it was originally planned to be repaired within the week. Soon it became apparent that it would require further work, and in a controversial decision the Marine Highway System chose to cancel all further summer voyages on the ship pending repairs. Nearly all the other ships in the fleet were rerouted to make up for the loss of what many consider to be the flagship of the fleet, and many passengers were urged to seek alternative travel means to help ease the pressure on the system. Transferred to Cascade General Shipyard at Swan Island in the Portland, Oregon area; both main engines were disassembled and overhauled. As of May 19, 2008 the MV Columbia left Cascade General and sailed to Bellingham, WA to begin active service. The vessel was moored in Ketchikan, AK for a winter layup period/heavy maintenance period from September 2009 to June 2010. During this period of time the propeller shafting and associated wheels were overhauled. The repair of damage sustained to the port main engine viscous damper drive coupling during the middle of the 2009 operating season was remediated as well. ==External links== *Official Alaska Marine Highway System website *American Bureau of Shipping records ==References== Category:Alaska Marine Highway System vessels Category:1974 ships ","title":"MV Columbia"},{"id":"3250640","text":"Underwood is a settleemnt in the city of Newport, South East Wales.https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/406735 It is an early 1960s council housing estate that consists of houses,https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/406741 shops, a leisure centre, Baptist church and social club. The leisure centre is now up for sale. == Post-War development == The Underwood Estate was originally developed from the former World War II Prisoner of War camp after the end of the war. A few surviving examples of the former PoW huts were still visible until the early 1990s when they were demolished. The original huts stood as early community buildings. In the early 1980s several huts and a water tower were also visible on the now Waltwood Park Drive area, this area belonged to the General Post Office and was used to house old telecommunications equipment until it was sold and demolished by British Telecom who took over the site when BT was privatised in the early 1980s. The land was subsequently sold to Westbury homes who built the Waltwood Park Drive Development of around 220 houses on the land. The estate is situated in a natural land formation within the falls of a wooded area on the south and north side and a small drainage ditch or reen called \\"Monks Ditch\\" on the northern side of the development. Built in three phases, with the Waltwood Park Development being the last of the three phases. Many people believe that the Underwood Estate was created for the local steelworks at Llanwern, as it was constructed at the same time as the Richard Thomas and Baldwins \\"Spencer Works\\" was being built. This has some truth, as originally people moved into the huts after the war. However the local council at the time, Magor and St Mellons Rural District Council, created the housing estate with post-war initiatives for more housing, hence why the second phase of the housing development consists of rapid construction poured concrete houses which are very sturdy in construction and much stronger than traditional bricks-and-mortar houses. == Amenities == The Leisure Centre was considered to be one of the best leisure centres in the area, even though it has no swimming pool. In fact it was widely known as one of the first in Wales. It was built from funding provided by Richard Thomas and Baldwins, when the steelworks was constructed, built on land donated to the community by local farmer, Mr. Weeks, and still covered by a covenant on the land by the original donor. However, there are moves to change this donation to build upon the land, of which the local residents are ardently opposed to. Within the Llanmartin area, a large man-made reservoir is located. This reservoir is built on Waltwood Hill. It consists of four lagoons which contain Grey water. This water is used at the Llanwern steelworks. It remains private property and is off-limits to the public. Also, Pencoed Castle is situated nearby. A small hamlet of Llanmartin consists of farms and a number of houses -- the Old Barn Llanmartin is an old circa 1800 barn converted to a local public house serving quality food and drink. Within St. Martin's church is a tomb of the ancestors from Pencoed Castle. ==References== * http://www.citypopulation.de/php/uk- wales.php?cityid=W37000219 Category:Villages in Newport, Wales ","title":"Underwood, Newport"},{"id":"3250661","text":"Yves Makabu-Ma-Kalambay (born 31 January 1986) is a Congolese professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper. He most recently played for English club Wycombe Wanderers. Ma-Kalambay has previously played for Chelsea, Watford, Hibernian, Swansea City and KV Mechelen. His parents are from the DR Congo, but Ma-Kalambay grew up in Brussels in the same neighbourhood as fellow footballers Vincent Kompany, Faris Haroun, Anthony Vanden Borre and Jeanvion Yulu-Matondo. Ma-Kalambay represented Belgium in the 2008 Olympic Games and has since played for DR Congo at full international level. == Club career == === Chelsea === Ma-Kalambay signed for Chelsea as a youth. In March 2004 after injuries to Carlo Cudicini and Neil Sullivan, Ma-Kalambay found himself on the bench for a league match at Bolton Wanderers as cover for Marco Ambrosio. He went on loan to Watford in February 2006 to cover for the suspended Ben Foster. Watford manager Aidy Boothroyd suggested that he was interested in signing Ma-Kalambay in some capacity for the 2006–07 season,\\"Boss hints at possible keeper move\\" Watford Observer but this did not come to fruition. On 18 October, Ma-Kalambay made the bench for Chelsea's 1–0 Champions League group stage win against Barcelona, due to injuries to Petr Čech and Carlo Cudicini. After the arrival of Magnus Hedman, Ma-Kalambay was relegated to fifth choice goalkeeper at Chelsea. ===Hibernian=== Makalambay signed for SPL club Hibernian in June 2007. He kept a clean sheet on his competitive debut for Hibs in an Edinburgh derby win at Tynecastle against Hearts. In a 2020 interview, Makalambay revealed that he was hurt and taken aback by the level of racist abuse he received from the Hearts support on his debut, describing it as the worst he experienced throughout his career. Despite making two bad errors in a 3–3 draw with Aberdeen, Makalambay then made a penalty save in his next match, a 1–0 win over Inverness. Makalambay has received some criticism at times for his performances for Hibs, but he claimed during an interview with the Daily Record in December 2008 that he is under greater scrutiny than goalkeepers of other Scottish Premier League clubs. The newspaper surmised that this scrutiny was because of the high-profile mistakes made by his immediate predecessors in the Hibs goal, Zibi Malkowski and Simon Brown. After making an error in an Edinburgh derby, Makalambay was replaced by Grzegorz Szamotulski at half-time due to a hamstring injury. He regained his place in the first team near the end of the season, putting in some impressive displays in draws against the Old Firm and in an Edinburgh derby win at Tynecastle, but then conceded a bizarre goal against Aberdeen on the final day of the season. Makalambay lost his place to new signing Graham Stack in the 2009–10 season. With his contract due to expire at the end of the season, Makalambay expressed a desire to open talks with Hibs about a new deal. Hibs signed goalkeeper Graeme Smith on the first day of the January 2010 transfer window, however, which raised further doubt over Makalambay's future at the club. This doubt was confirmed on 14 May 2010 when it was announced that Ma-Kalambay's contract would not be renewed. After his release, Makalambay claimed that he had only been dropped due to his refusal to sign a new contract. He also claimed to have received offers from clubs in England and Spain. === Swansea City === In September 2010, Makalambay went on trial with Football League Championship club Swansea City. He signed a contract with the club until the end of the 2010–11 season later that month. He played in all of Swansea's League Cup and FA Cup games that season, but left the club at the end of his contract in 2011. === KV Mechelen === In October 2011, Makalambay signed a contract until the end of the season with Jupiler Pro League club KV Mechelen. He was signed because the second choice KV Mechelen goalkeeper, Wouter Biebauw, was injured for a long time. Makalambay left the club at the end of the 2011–12 season. ===Royal Antwerp=== In August 2013, Makalambay signed a contract for two seasons with Belgacom League club Royal Antwerp after a few weeks training in the preseason. ===Wycombe Wanderers=== In October 2017 Yves agreed to a short- term deal with Wycombe Wanderers until 29 January 2018; he will wear the number 30 during his time with the club. In May 2018 it was announced that he had extended his contract for one year, to the end of the 2018–19 season. He was released by Wycombe at the end of the 2018–19 season. == International career == Makalambay was first selected by Belgium in January 2008. He was then selected for their squad in the 2008 Olympic Games. Makalambay played in only one match during the Olympics, when he came on as a substitute for Logan Bailly during their 3–2 victory over Italy in the quarter final. Belgium eventually finished in fourth place; Makalambay missed out on a medal due to Belgian defeats by Nigeria and Brazil. Having not played in a competitive full international for Belgium, Makalambay was still eligible for selection by the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo), the birthplace of his father. Makalambay was selected by DR Congo for a friendly against Saudi Arabia in May 2010. He made his international debut as Congo lost 2–0.http://www.footballdatabase.eu/football.coupe.rd-congo.arabie- saoudite.112232.en.html ==References* * Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Brussels Category:Democratic Republic of the Congo footballers Category:Democratic Republic of the Congo international footballers Category:Belgian footballers Category:Belgium youth international footballers Category:Belgian people of Democratic Republic of the Congo descent Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:PSV Eindhoven players Category:Chelsea F.C. players Category:Watford F.C. players Category:Hibernian F.C. players Category:Swansea City A.F.C. players Category:KV Mechelen players Category:Royal Antwerp F.C. players Category:ASC Oțelul Galați players Category:Scottish Premier League players Category:Belgian First Division A players Category:Liga I players Category:Belgian expatriate footballers Category:Belgian expatriate sportspeople in England Category:Expatriate footballers in the Netherlands Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:Expatriate footballers in Scotland Category:Expatriate footballers in Wales Category:Expatriate footballers in Romania Category:Olympic footballers of Belgium Category:Footballers at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Belgian expatriate sportspeople in Scotland Category:Belgian expatriate sportspeople in Wales Category:Wycombe Wanderers F.C. players Category:Black Belgian sportspeople ","title":"Yves Ma-Kalambay"},{"id":"3250666","text":"A cornucopia is a horn or horn-shaped basket and symbol of abundance.

It is classified as short-acting, and has a rapid onset of action. It is similar in its effects to sodium thiopental, a drug with which it competed in the market for anaesthetics. ==Pharmacology== Methohexital binds to a distinct site which is associated with Cl− ionophores at GABAA receptors. This increases the length of time which the Cl− ionopores are open, thus causing an inhibitory effect. Metabolism of methohexital is primarily hepatic via demethylation and oxidation. Side-chain oxidation is the primary means of metabolism involved in the termination of the drug's biological activity. ==Indications== Methohexital is primarily used to induce anesthesia, and is generally provided as a sodium salt (i.e. methohexital sodium). It is only used in hospital or similar settings, under strict supervision. It has been commonly used to induce deep sedation or general anesthesia for surgery and dental procedures. Unlike many other barbiturates, methohexital actually lowers the seizure threshold, a property that make it particularly useful when anesthesia is provided for an electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). And rapid recovery rate with consciousness being gained within three to seven minutes after induction and full recovery within 30 minutes is a major advantage over other ECT barbiturates. ==Synthesis== Methohexital can be synthesized in the classic manner of making barbituric acid derivatives, in particular by the reaction of malonic ester derivatives with derivatives of urea.W.J. Doran, (1959) The resulting allyl-(1-methyl-2-pentynyl) malonic ester is synthesized by subsequent alkylation of the malonic ester itself, beginning with 2-bromo-3-hexyne, which gives (1-methyl-2-pentynyl)malonic ester, and then by allylbromide. In the final step, reaction of the disubstituted malonic ester with N-methylurea gives methohexital. :Methohexital synthesis == References == ==External links== * RxList.com - Methohexital * Drugs.com - Methohexital Sodium * DrugLib.com - Brevital (Methohexital Sodium) Category:Barbiturates Category:General anesthetics Category:Allyl compounds Category:Alkyne derivatives Category:GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulators ","title":"Methohexital"},{"id":"3250682","text":"A merchant account is a type of bank account that allows businesses to accept payments in multiple ways, typically debit or credit cards. A merchant account is established under an agreement between an acceptor and a merchant acquiring bank for the settlement of payment card transactions. In some cases a payment processor, independent sales organization (ISO), or member service provider (MSP) is also a party to the merchant agreement. Whether a merchant enters into a merchant agreement directly with an acquiring bank or through an aggregator, the agreement contractually binds the merchant to obey the operating regulations established by the card associations. ==Methods of processing credit cards== Today a majority of all credit card transactions are sent electronically to merchant processing banks for authorization, capture and deposit. Various methods exist for presenting a credit card sale to \\"the system.\\" In all circumstances either the entire magnetic strip is read by a swipe through a credit card terminal/reader, a computer chip is read (an \\"EMV\\"), or the credit card information is manually entered into a credit card terminal, a computer or website. The earliest methods, submitting credit card slips to a merchant processing bank by mail, or by accessing an Automated Response Unit (ARU) by telephone, are still in use today but have long been overshadowed by electronic devices. These early methods used two-part forms and a manual device for mechanically imprinting the embossed card number information onto the forms. ===Credit card terminal=== A typical credit card terminal popular in 2005, now typically out of use and of a style/era usually non-compliant per PCI-DSS standards. A credit card terminal is a stand-alone piece of electronic equipment that allows a merchant to swipe or key-enter a credit card's information as well as additional information required to process a credit card transaction. They may be connected to Point of Sale systems and typically have a keypad and network connection and may have a built-in printer. ===Automated response unit (ARU)=== An ARU (also known as a voice authorization, capture and deposit) allows the manual keyed entry and subsequent authorization of a credit card over a cellular or land-line telephone. With this method, a merchant typically imprints their customer's card with an imprinter to create a customer receipt and merchant copy, then process the transaction instantaneously over the phone. ===Payment gateway=== A payment gateway is an e-commerce service that authorizes payments for e-businesses and online retailers. It is the equivalent of a physical POS (point-of-sale) terminal located in most retail outlets. A merchant account provider is typically a separate company from the payment gateway. Some merchant account providers have their own payment gateways but the majority of companies use 3rd party payment gateways. The gateway usually has 2 components: a) the virtual terminal that can allow for a merchant to securely login and key in credit card numbers or b) have the website's shopping-cart connect to the gateway via an API to allow for real time processing from the merchant's website. ==Level 2 or level 3 processing – purchasing cards== For business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-government (B2G) purchases, these interchange fees fall into one of 3 processing categories — Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3. Level 1 has the highest rates. Level 3 has the lowest rates. Level 3 detail refers to passing line-item detail; information generally found on an invoice; PO number descriptions, quantities….other details, level 2 refers to passing tax amount along with invoice/PO#. Both Visa and MasterCard apply higher interchange rates for commercial transactions that are accepted w/o level 3 detail. These are applied to interchange before a processor adds their fee and ranges from .80%-1.5% When set up for level 3 processing transactions over $5,984.61 government, $8725 non government, are eligible for high ticket interchange rates. Interchange varies from .50-1.45% depending on the type of card and size of ticket. ==Merchant account marketing== Merchant accounts are marketed to merchants by two basic methods: either directly by the processor or sponsoring bank, or by an authorized agent for the bank and additionally directly registered with both Visa and MasterCard as an ISO/MSP (independent selling organization / member service Marketing details are by card issuers like Visa and MasterCard, and are enforced by various rules and fines. A few of the largest processors also partner with warehouse clubs to promote merchant accounts to their business member ===Marketing by banks=== A bank that has a merchant processing relationship with Visa and MasterCard, also known as a member bank, can issue merchant accounts directly to merchants. To reduce risk, some banks limit approval to merchants in its geographical area, those with a physical retail storefront, or those that have been in business for two years or more. ===Marketing by independent sales organizations (ISO)/MSPs=== To market merchant accounts, an ISO/MSP must be sponsored by a member bank. This sponsorship requires that the bank verify the financial stability and suitability of the company that will be marketing on its behalf. The ISO/MSP must also pay a fee to be registered with Visa and MasterCard and must comply with regulations in how they may market merchant accounts and the use of trademarks of Visa and MasterCard. One way to verify if an ISO/MSP is in compliance is to check a website or any other marketing material for a disclosure \\"company is a registered ISO/MSP of bank, town, state. FDIC insured\\". This disclosure is required by both Visa and MasterCard and will cause a penalty of up to $25,000 if it is not clearly visible. In almost all cases, if there is no disclosure, the company is likely to be an uninformed fourth party or worse. ==Rates and fees== A merchant account has a variety of fees, some periodic, others charged on a per-item or percentage basis. Some fees are set by the merchant account provider, but the majority of the per- item and percentage fees are passed through the merchant account provider to the credit card issuing bank according to a schedule of rates called interchange fees, which are set by Visa, Discover, and MasterCard. Interchange fees vary depending on card type and the circumstances of the transaction. For example, if a transaction is made by swiping a card through a credit card terminal it will be in a different category than if it were keyed in manually. ===Discount rates=== The discount rate comprises a number of dues, fees, assessments, network charges and mark-ups merchants are required to pay for accepting credit and debit cards, the largest of which by far is the interchange fee. Each bank or ISO/MSP has real costs in addition to the wholesale interchange fees, and creates profit by adding a mark-up to all the fees mentioned above. There are a number of price models banks and ISOs/MSPs used to bill merchants for the services rendered. Here are the more popular price models: ====Three-tier pricing==== The three-tier pricing is the most popular pricing method and the simplest system for most merchants to understand, if not the most transparent. The newer six-tier pricing, including additional tiers covering debit, business, or international cards is gaining in popularity. In three-tier pricing, the merchant account provider groups the transactions into three groups (tiers) and assigns a rate to each tier based on a criterion established for each tier. A possible drawback from the merchant's perspective is that these \\"tiers\\" or \\"buckets\\" are variable from one processor to the next prohibiting any direct comparison from a tier one provided by one provider to a tier one provided by another provider. First tier – qualified rate A qualified rate is the percentage rate a merchant will be charged whenever they accept a regular consumer credit card and process it in a manner defined as \\"standard\\" by their merchant account provider using an approved credit card processing solution. This is usually the lowest rate a merchant will incur when accepting a credit card. The qualified rate is also the rate commonly quoted to a merchant when they inquire about pricing. The qualified rate is created based on the way a merchant will be accepting a majority of their credit cards. For example, for an Internet merchant, the Internet interchange categories will be defined as qualified, while for a physical retailer only transactions swiped through or read by their terminal in an ordinary manner will be defined as qualified. Second tier – mid-qualified rate Also known as a partially qualified rate, the mid-qualified rate is the percentage rate a merchant will be charged whenever they accept a credit card that does not qualify for the lowest rate (the qualified rate). This may happen for several reasons such as: * A consumer credit card is keyed into a credit card terminal instead of being swiped * A special kind of credit card is used like a rewards card or a business card A mid-qualified rate is higher than a qualified rate. Some of the transactions that are usually grouped into the mid-qualified tier can cost the provider more in interchange costs, so the merchant account providers do make a markup on these rates. The use of \\"rewards cards\\" can be as high as 40% of transactions. So it is important that the financial impact of this fee be understood. Third tier – non-qualified rate The non-qualified rate is usually the highest percentage rate a merchant will be charged whenever they accept a credit card. In most cases all transactions that are not qualified or mid-qualified will fall to this rate. This may happen for several reasons such as: * A consumer credit card is keyed into a credit card terminal instead of being swiped and address verification is not performed * A special kind of credit card is used like a business card and all required fields are not entered * A merchant does not settle their daily batch within the allotted time frame, usually past 48 hours from time of authorization. A non-qualified rate can be significantly higher than a qualified rate and can cost the provider much more in interchange costs, so the merchant account providers do make a markup on these rates. ====Six-tier pricing==== As a result of the Walmart Settlement and to compete against PIN-based debit cards (which are processed outside of the Visa and MasterCard networks), Visa and MasterCard lowered the interchange rates for debit cards well below those for credit cards. Some providers can pass on the lower cost of these cards directly to merchants. Consequently, the three tiers programs have added two classifications for debit cards that are processed without a PIN or with a PIN for a total of six rate classifications. ====Interchange-plus pricing==== Some providers offer merchant account services priced on an \\"interchange plus\\" basis. These accounts are based on the \\"interchange\\" tables published by both Visa and MasterCard MasterCard. This type of pricing creates a discount rate by adding interchange rates plus a percentage and authorization fees. This is a common pricing model for very low and very high average tickets. ===Authorization fee=== The authorization fee (actually an authorization request fee) is charged each time a transaction is sent to the card-issuing bank to be authorized. The fee applies whether or not the request is approved. Note this is not the same as a transaction fee. ===Transaction fee=== The transaction fee is charged when you accept your authorization. This fee only applies to an authorization that is accepted without error. ===Statement fee=== The statement fee is a monthly fee associated with the monthly statement that is sent to the merchant at the end of each monthly processing cycle. This statement shows how much processing was done by the merchant during the month and what fees were incurred as a result. Many times, the statement fee is not directly linked to \\"paper\\" statements but rather general overhead. This means that a provider would not waive this fee if a merchant chose to have a \\"paperless\\" statement. ===Monthly minimum fee=== The monthly minimum fee is a way to ensure that merchants pay a minimum amount in fees each month to cover costs from the provider to maintain the account. If a merchant's fees do not equal or exceed the monthly minimum they will be charged the difference up to the monthly minimum. :Example: A merchant has signed a contract with a $25.00 monthly minimum fee. If all the fees (clarity: this is only for processing costs, so it does not include monthly fees, chargeback fees, etc.) for the most recent month of processing total only $15.00, this merchant will be charged an additional $10.00 to meet their monthly minimum requirements. Sometimes there are fees that are charged that are not a part of the monthly minimum, such as statement fees. It is industry standard to charge a monthly minimum, though not all acquirers charge this, nor do all that do charge it for every agreement. ===Batch fee=== A batch fee (also known as a batch-header fee) can be charged to a merchant whenever the merchant \\"settles\\" their terminal. Settling a terminal, also known as \\"batching\\", is when a merchant sends their completed transactions for the day to their acquiring bank for payment. Some providers perform this automatically. It is important to close a batch every 24 hours or a higher rate will be assessed by Visa, Discover or MasterCard. The term \\"batch header\\" originally came from processing pre-electronic terminal era, when each batch of credit card receipts was turned into the merchant's local bank for deposit. The batch header was a mini report summarizing those receipts bundled within. ===Customer service fee=== The customer service fee (also known as a maintenance fee) can be charged by some providers to pay for the cost of customer service. Also referred to as a \\"merchant support fee\\", \\"customer support fee\\", or simply, \\"service fee\\" by some merchant providers. ===Annual fee=== The annual fee can be charged by some providers to pay for costs of maintaining the merchant's account. Sometimes these fees can be quarterly. The fee can be from $79–$399. These fees in cases include a Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance fee, which may include a cyber/breach insurance policy. ===Early termination fee=== The early termination fee can be charged by some providers if the merchant ends the contract before the end of the contract term. While contract terms of one-to-three years are typical, some providers have terms of up to five years with a one-year prior notice to cancel or the fee will be assessed. Some providers also assess all statement fees and monthly minimums remaining when the contract is terminated. Some providers may also assess a \\"lost profit\\" fee based on an assumption of profits they concluded they would have earned during the full term of the contract. ===Chargeback fee=== Chargebacks are the largest risk that is presented to banks and providers. This is not to be confused with refunds, which are simply a merchant refunding a transaction. In the Visa, Discover, and MasterCard rules, the merchant's processing bank is 100% responsible for all the transactions that the merchant performs. This can leave the provider open to millions of dollars of potential losses if the merchant operates in an illegal or risky manner and generates many chargebacks. The providers pass this cost on to the merchant, but if the merchant is fraudulent or simply does not have the money, the provider must pay all the costs to make the cardholder 'whole'. The chargeback risk is the largest part taken into consideration during the contract application and underwriting process. Some banks are much more stringent than others when assessing a merchant's chargeback risk. If a merchant encounters a chargeback they may be assessed a fee by their acquiring bank. A potential chargeback is presented on behalf of the card holder's bank to the merchant's credit card processing bank. Currently, both Visa and MasterCard require all merchants to maintain no more than 1% of dollar volume processed to be chargebacks. If the percentage goes above, there are penalties starting at $5,000 – $25,000 charged to the merchant's processing bank and ultimately passed on to the merchant. In all cases, a chargeback will cost the merchant the chargeback fee, typically $15–$30, plus the cost of the transaction and the amount processed. ===The Durbin Amendment=== On October 1, 2011, new rules, resulting from the Durbin Amendment, went into effect that lower the debit card interchange fees the Visa and MasterCard networks charge merchants. The new rules apply only to debit cards issued by banks with more than $10 billion in total assets. Prior to the implementation of the Durbin Amendment, the swipe fee for a debit card transaction averaged 44 cents. Under Durbin, the Federal Reserve has set a cap of .05% + 21 cents per transaction (22 cents if the card has security features). ==Terms to know== Following are some useful definitions that pertain to pricing merchant transactions: ;Basis point: 1/100 of a percentage point. The term is used to describe discount rates, which are the bulk of card processing fees paid by merchants. ;Discount rate: includes fees, dues, assessments, markups and network charges merchants must pay for accepting credit and debit cards. Interchange is the discount rate's largest component. ;Interchange: the fee paid to the card issuing bank by the card acquiring bank by way of the card brands. Interchange rates vary widely based on card type, transaction amount, risks and retail sector. Interchange is assessed on all Visa and MasterCard branded credit and debit cards. ;Mid-qualified: the percentage rate merchants are charged when accepting credit cards that do not meet qualified rate requirements. Also known as a partially qualified, the mid-qualified rate applies in such cases as when cards are keyed into terminals instead of swiped or if the cards are of a special type such as rewards cards. ;Non-qualified: often the highest percentage rate merchants are charged for accepting credit cards. In most cases, transactions that are neither qualified nor mid-qualified fall into this category. The bulk of these transactions are done with corporate cards. ;Qualified: the percentage rate merchants are charged when they accept regular consumer credit cards and process them with an approved processing solution in a manner defined as standard by their merchant account providers. Qualified is typically the lowest rate merchants incur when accepting credit cards. ==See also== * Merchant services * Payment terminal * Payment gateway * Interchange fee * Credit card fraud * Chargeback insurance * Payment card industry (PCI) * Cardholder Information Security Program (CISP) * Terminated merchant file ==References== * * MasterCard Interchange Rates (PDF) 15 April 2016.

There are three campuses: * Campus of Vigo in Lagoas- Marcosende, between the municipalities of Vigo and Mos, 15 kilometres away from the city centre. Also known as CUVI (Ciudad universitaria de Vigo, University city of Vigo); * Campus of Pontevedra in A Xunqueira, Pontevedra, and in the city centre; * Campus of Ourense in As Lagoas, Ourense. Considered the most technical of the universities of Galicia, it offers engineer degrees in Mining, Telecommunications, Forestry Engineering, Computer Science and Industrial Engineering. ==History of the university in Galicia== ===Political background=== Following the introduction of the new Spanish Constitution of 1978 and the arrival of democracy, the newly elected president of Spain, Felipe Gonzalez Marquez, leader of the Spanish Socialist Worker’s Party (PSOE), introduced legislation from Madrid to transform the hitherto centralized Spanish State into an amalgamation of autonomous regions with different degrees of self-administration. The northwestern corner of the Iberian Peninsula was thus raised to the status of autonomous region, and the Spanish language had thereafter to co-exist with the new official language: Galician. A new parliament and a new government were created in Galicia for its people. And from the Galician capital, Santiago de Compostela, the newly created Galician Parliament would bring new legislation for the autonomous community. And it was in this set of circumstances that the university map in Galicia was transformed. ===From one university to many=== Galicia's first university, the University of Santiago de Compostela, was created in 1495. This was the only university in Galicia had no other university until the early 1980s, when two satellite campuses of the University of Santiago de Compostela were created in A Coruña and Vigo. Before that, the only other institution in Galicia with the power to grant degrees was the School of Naval and Industrial Engineers of Ferrol, which was created by a ministerial order under the initiative of General Francisco Franco in the early 1960s. This school was directly dependent on the Ministry of Education in Madrid, although in 1992 it was amalgamated with the University of A Coruña. In the late 1980s, the two university campuses of A Coruña and Vigo, which were created as dependent on the University of Santiago de Compostela, became fully independent universities, being able for the first time to issue their own official university degree titles. ===From the 1990s to the present=== As of the early 1990s, Galicia had three universities, each of them with its own satellite campuses. These were the University of Santiago de Compostela with two university campuses, one in Santiago de Compostela and the other in Lugo; the University of A Coruña with two university campuses, one in A Coruña and the other in Ferrol; and the University of Vigo with three university campuses, one in Pontevedra, one in Ourense, and one in Vigo. ==Campus of Vigo (Lagoas Marcosende, 15 kilometres away from Vigo) - CUVI== * School of Industrial Engineering * School of Mining Engineering * Faculty of Philology, Translation and Interpretation. * Faculty of Juridic and Labour Sciences. * Faculty of Economy, Business and Management Sciences. * Superior Technical School of Mining Engineering. * Superior Technical School of Telecommunication Engineering. * Faculty of Biology. * Faculty of Marine Science. * Faculty of Chemistry. * Center of Technological and Scientific Support for Investigation.

San Diego Chargers and the Cincinnati Bengals. The game was played on January 10, 1982 at Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium, and televised by NBC, with announcers Dick Enberg and Merlin Olsen. The game, won by the Bengals, 27–7, was played in the coldest temperature in NFL history in terms of wind chill. Air temperature was , but the wind chill, factoring in a sustained wind of , was (calculated as using the now outdated wind chill formula in place at the time). (The game that was played in the coldest in terms of air temperature was the Ice Bowl.) ==Background== Despite the Bengals’ dominating 40–17 win over the Chargers during the season, their meeting in the championship was expected to be a very thrilling and hard-fought game. The Chargers' offense featured three future members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame: quarterback Dan Fouts, receiver Charlie Joiner and tight end Kellen Winslow. San Diego also had two superb running backs, Chuck Muncie, who led the NFL with 19 touchdowns, and multi- talented rookie James Brooks, who finished the season with 2,093 all-purpose yards. Cincinnati also had several stars on offense. Quarterback Ken Anderson (1996 and 1998 Pro Football Hall of Fame finalist) was the top rated passer in the NFL, and had won both the NFL Most Valuable Player Award and the NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award. Tight end Dan Ross, running back Pete Johnson, and rookie receiver Cris Collinsworth were widely considered to be among the best players in the NFL at their positions. The Bengals offensive line featured future Hall of Fame left tackle Anthony Muñoz, who was selected by NFL coaches as the NFL Lineman of the Year Award winner during the season. Both teams were coming off extremely narrow wins in the divisional playoffs. A week earlier, the Bengals won their first ever playoff game by defeating the Buffalo Bills 28–21 after forcing Buffalo to turn the ball over on downs during their final drive. Meanwhile, the Chargers narrowly defeated the Miami Dolphins in overtime 41–38, in a game that set playoff records for most points scored in a playoff game (79), the most total yards by both teams (1,036), and most passing yards by both teams (809). That game, which became known as “The Epic In Miami”, was played in the heat and humidity of Miami, and the Chargers found themselves dealing with nearly the exact opposite conditions in the AFC title game. Within one week, the Chargers went from playing an overtime game in Miami in , high humidity weather to playing in the wind chill in Cincinnati, an effective difference of . Before the Chargers took the field, Running back/Special teamer Hank Bauer tested the field conditions. Bauer recalled: When he returned to the locker room, he told his teammates: The Bengals offensive line played the entire game with bare arms, and a number of them played with bare hands as well. They placed hot water bottles inside their cups (athletic supporters) and between plays they walked around with their hands in their pants which many people found amusing. It was so cold that icicles started to form on Fouts’ beard early in the game. ==Overview== The game was one of the few in NFL history in which the same team kicked off to begin both halves. Cincinnati won the toss and instead of receiving, elected to have the brutally cold wind at their backs to start the game, believing it would neutralize San Diego’s passing game and help the Bengals to build an early lead. The strategy paid off as Cincinnati built a 10–0 lead in the first quarter. San Diego would score their only touchdown in the second, but gave up another score to the Bengals and trailed 17–7 at halftime. Accordingly, San Diego used its option at the beginning of the second half to receive the kickoff, resulting in Cincinnati kicking off to begin both halves—and in the same direction both times, using their second half option to again begin the half with the wind at their backs. Aided by an 18-yard completion from Anderson to tight end Dan Ross, Cincinnati scored first with a 31-yard field goal from kicker Jim Breech. Then linebacker Rick Razzano forced a fumble from Chargers’ rookie kick returner James Brooks, and Don Bass recovered for the Bengals on the San Diego 12-yard line. Following a 4-yard run by Charles Alexander, the Bengals scored a touchdown on an 8-yard pass from Anderson to tight end M. L. Harris, increasing their lead to 10–0. Brooks returned the ensuing kickoff 35 yards to the 43-yard line. Then on 3rd down and 9, Fouts’ 21-yard completion to Wes Chandler moved the ball to the Bengals’ 33. However, Cincinnati’s defense halted the drive at the 18-yard line and it ended with no points when Rolf Benirschke, kicking into the fierce wind, missed a 37-yard field goal attempt. After a Bengals punt, Chandler gave the Chargers good field position with a 7-yard return to the 45-yard line. San Diego then drove 55 yards and cut their deficit to 10–7 when Fouts, desperately trying to avoid a hit from lineman Eddie Edwards, managed to fire a pass to Kellen Winslow, who subsequently raced from the line of scrimmage 33 yards down the right sideline for a score. Nevertheless, the Bengals stormed right back on a drive set up by David Verser’s 40-yard kickoff to the 46-yard line. Faced with 3rd down and 7 inside the red zone later in the drive, Anderson kept the drive going with a 16-yard completion to Isaac Curtis on the Chargers’ 1-yard line, and fullback Pete Johnson scored a touchdown run on the next play, giving them a 17–7 lead. The Bengals completely took over the game from that point on. The Chargers would move the ball inside the Bengals 40-yard line five times during the rest of the game, but failed to score on each possession. San Diego responded with a drive to the Bengals 33-yard line, but came up empty when defensive back Louis Breeden intercepted a deep pass intended for Charlie Joiner at the 5-yard line. The Chargers defense quickly gave the offense another scoring opportunity, forcing a punt from Pat McInally that went just 32 yards to the Bengals 45. However, once again this amounted to nothing as Fouts was intercepted in the end zone by rookie safety Bobby Kemp. On the opening drive of the second half, San Diego drove to the Bengals 38-yard line, only to lose their fourth turnover of the day when Reggie Williams stripped the ball from Chuck Muncie and Cincinnati lineman Ross Browner recovered it. Then Anderson went to work, rushing three times for 31 yards and completing a 19-yard pass to Ross on a drive that moved the ball inside the San Diego 10-yard line. Following three incompletions and a fake field goal touchdown run by Steve Kreider called back by a holding penalty, Breech's 38-yard field goal made the score 20–7. On their next drive, Anderson’s five completions moved the ball deep into Chargers territory, but defensive back Willie Buchanon put an end to it when he recovered a fumble from Ross that had been forced by Woodrow Lowe. The Chargers then drove to the Bengals’ 20-yard line, but on third down, Fouts tripped over the foot of guard Doug Wilkerson and was downed for an 11-yard loss. Then Benirschke missed a 50-yard field goal try on the next play. Taking the ball back after the missed field goal, Cincinnati put the game away with a 14-play touchdown drive. Anderson was injured early in the drive and replaced for two plays by Jack Thompson. Nevertheless, Johnson kept the Bengals moving on those plays, first rushing for 8 yards and then gaining 14 yards on a screen pass on 3rd down and 8. Later on the drive, Johnson converted a 4th and inches situation with a 7-yard run, and Anderson eventually finished it off with a 3-yard touchdown pass to Don Bass, making the final score 27–7. San Diego responded with a drive to the Bengals 5-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs with less than three minutes left. Fouts completed 15 of 28 passes for 185 yards and a touchdown, with two interceptions; the future Hall of Fame QB sadly noted that the brutal weather conditions made it very difficult for him to throw the ball, adding that he was impressed that Ken Anderson was able to throw spirals during the game. Muncie was the top rusher of the game with 94 yards. Anderson completed 14 of 22 passes for 161 yards and two touchdowns, with no interceptions, and rushed for 39 yards. Johnson rushed for 80 yards and a touchdown, while also catching a pass for 14 yards. As a sidenote, Cincinnati head coach Forrest Gregg had already participated in one of the coldest games in NFL history prior to this one. When he was a player for the Green Bay Packers in 1967, Gregg played in the famous NFL championship game against the Dallas Cowboys that became known as the Ice Bowl. Another sidenote is that Brooks, whose fumble helped the Bengals win the game, would later go on to help the Bengals get to Super Bowl XXIII in the 1988 season, this time not as an opponent, but as a player for the team. After spending two more seasons with the Chargers, Brooks was traded to the Bengals in exchange for Pete Johnson, and remained on the team until 1991. Brooks made the Pro Bowl four times with the Bengals (1986, 1988–1990) and left Cincinnati as the team’s all-time leading rusher. Both Winslow and Ken Anderson said that the windchill’s effect was so brutal that they have felt its effects decades later—Winslow in noting that he suffers from the residual impact of frostbite in one of his toes, and Anderson because his hands turn cold and numb much more quickly in cold weather now than they did pre-Freezer Bowl. According to special teams ace Hank Bauer, the Chargers' return flight to San Diego was delayed over three hours due to ice buildup on planes at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. ==Scoring summary== *CIN – FG Breech 31 yards *CIN – Harris 8 yard pass from Anderson (Breech kick) *SD – Winslow 33 yard pass from Fouts (Benirschke kick) *CIN – Johnson 1 yard run (Breech kick) *CIN – FG Breech 38 yards *CIN – Bass 3 yard pass from Anderson (Breech kick) ==Officials== *Referee: Fred Silva *Umpire: Art Demmas *Head Linesman: Burl Toler *Line Judge: Walt Peters *Side Judge: Dave Parry *Back Judge: Jim Poole *Field Judge: Bob Lewis ==See also== * 1981–82 NFL playoffs * The similarly named Snow Bowl and Ice Bowl * Epic in Miami, a game played a week earlier * The Catch, 1981 NFC Championship game held on the same day ==References== * *Frozen in Time by Geoff Hobson, Cincinnati Bengals.com, archived via wayback machine *Total Football: The Official Encyclopedia of the National Football League () *Freezer Bowl by Bob Fulton, Referee Magazine *Top Weather Games (SD vs Cin) Category:1981 National Football League season Category:AFC Championship Games Category:Cincinnati Bengals postseason Category:San Diego Chargers postseason Category:Sports competitions in Cincinnati Category:January 1982 sports events in the United States Category:1982 in sports in Ohio Category:20th century in Cincinnati ","title":"Freezer Bowl"},{"id":"3250732","text":"Arthur Lawrence Kornfeld (b. 1942) is an American musician, record producer, and music executive.

It is now the oldest existing defense organization in the world. In March 2006, the OAS assumed formal authority over the IADB. As of that date, 27 of the 34 members of OAS were also members of the IADB. == Inter-American Defense College== The Board is made up of three main organs, one of which is the Inter-American Defense College (IADC). The IADC offers an eleven-month Master of Science for senior military, police and government officials that covers governmental systems, the current international environment, and the structure and function of the Inter-American system, and offers an opportunity to study broad-based defense and security issues affecting the Western Hemisphere and the world. It is located at Fort Lesley J. McNair in Washington, D.C. official website == Inter-American Defense Board Medal == The Inter-American Defense Board Medal is an international military decoration. It is awarded to any military officer, serving in a member nation of the OAS, who completes a tour of service with the IADB. The award is also presented to military personnel who serve on the staff of the IADB Chairman or Secretariat, and for those who complete instructor tours at the IADC. ==External links== *Official website *\\"Remarks Regarding the Inter-American Defense Board\\", Remarks by Ambassador John F.

It was on Hazel Creek. It is named after Moses Proctor, first white settler to this area. The town was flooded by Fontana Lake, which was created by the construction of the Fontana Dam, and remains submerged unless lake levels are very low. While the Proctor mine offices were flooded, much of the town and cemetery are above the water line. There is one home left and remains of the lumber mill. Former residents were promised a road but only seven miles were built because the former town became part of Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and the National Park Service opposed the road, though they did provide ferry boats to allow visits to the cemeteries, which are accessible only by trails. The town of Proctor is mentioned in an episode of ASY TV’s “It Happened to Me”, where hiker John Vineyard recalls an ill-fated trek through the town that featured bear encounters, rattlesnakes and paranormal activity. ==References== * * westernncattractions.com Category:Ghost towns in North Carolina Category:Geography of Swain County, North Carolina ","title":"Proctor, North Carolina"},{"id":"3250796","text":"Johnny Basil, a.k.a. Desmond \\"Zil\\" Mobay, played by Lance Reddick, is a fictional character on the HBO drama Oz. ==Character overview== Johnny Basil is an undercover narcotics officer, working under the false identity of Jamaican drug addict \\"Desmond Mobay\\", who has been sent into the Oswald Maximum Security Penitentiary (\\"Oz\\") to investigate the drug trade. Basil gets too deep undercover, and in the process of attempting to prove his loyalty to the gangsters, he becomes a genuine heroin addict and kills an incarcerated police officer. Later, after being confronted by Augustus Hill, he confesses to the murder. He serves time in Oz's police unit, Unit J, where he is eventually killed by Clayton Hughes, an incarcerated former correctional officer. ===Season 4=== ====Part I==== Basil arrives prepared to join with the Homeboys, the African-American gang within \\"Emerald City\\", Oz's experimental cell block. He gets a job as an assistant to Warden Leo Glynn, keeping him informed and having free access to phones and computers; with these, he regularly contacts his partner, Nancy Mears, and his supervisor about what is happening within Oz. Glynn is initially the only person in Oz who knows of Basil's true identity, and he warns him about a similar operation which ended in the murder of the undercover cop, Paul Markstrom. Glynn also warns Basil that he is not allowed to use drugs. Basil tells Glynn that undercover narcs have ways of faking drug addiction. Inside Em City, Basil rooms with Augustus Hill, who tells him that if he wants drugs, he should go to Kenny Wangler. When Wangler and Junior Pierce die in a shooting inside Em City, Basil asks inmate Arnold \\"Poet\\" Jackson if he can join the Homeboys. Homeboy leader Simon Adebisi is suspicious of Basil, and asks him for the name of a person who can vouch for his criminality. Basil has planned a potential parolee at Lardner named Nester Parks to vouch for him, in exchange for having an easy parole hearing. Nancy visits Basil regularly, posing as his girlfriend. Hill recognizes her from the night of his arrest, but does not say anything until later on. Basil realizes this and tells Nancy, who denies encountering Hill, not to visit for a while. As his first test, the other inmates ask him to snort heroin to prove that he is one of them. He does so and ends up in solitary confinement during a drug shakedown. He is fully addicted by the time he gets out, but Adebisi does not yet see him as worthy enough for the Homeboys. His second test involves being able to take a punch from Chucky Pancamo, the leader of the Italians. Basil is severely beaten, but stays standing long enough to gain some of the gangs' respect. Poet gives him some heroin as comfort for his wounds, which he uses immediately. Basil's incoherent e-mails cause Nancy to suspect that he is using drugs and should be replaced. However, he convinces her and Glynn both that he is not using and that he is close to busting Adebisi, Pancamo, and other inmates. The gang leaders vote in a straw poll over whether or not Basil is worthy of membership. Pancamo votes yes; Adebisi votes no; and Latino leader Enrique Morales abstains. To break the tie, his third test is to kill an inmate and make it look like an accident. Meanwhile, Bruno Goergen, a racist cop who sent to Oz for killing a weapons dealer, blackmails Basil for protection in exchange for keeping his undercover identity secret. Deciding him to be \\"Mobay's\\" murder victim, he lures Goergen to an open elevator shaft, telling him that Hill has found out he is a cop and wishes to expose him. As Goergen and Hill struggle, Basil pretends to help Goergen but then pushes him into the shaft, killing him. This solidifies the trust of the two uncertain gang leaders, and he is granted membership. A new unit manager, Martin Querns, allows Adebisi, Pancamo, and Morales to do as they wish in Em City as long as there is no violence. Drugs are sold in the open and Basil is pressured to entice \\"babies\\" (new customers) to buy. Basil uses money he brought into Oz to pretend to find his \\"babies\\", while using the heroin he buys. The gangsters decide that Basil must sell drugs in front of them to prove that he is one of them, leading Glynn to suggest that another undercover detective should pose as a customer so there are no complications regarding the sale of drugs by a police officer. The cop, Cecil Brand, is seen purchasing drugs from Basil and Poet, and Pancamo assures Adebisi that Basil is still worthy of membership. Detective Guinevere McGorry questions inmates about Goergen's death. \\"Mobay\\" agrees to help if he finds sufficient information. Adebisi uncovers Brand's identity and commands Basil to kill him. Basil is prepares to do so until he is confronted by Hill, who calls him a fraud for breaking the law in the name of the law. Angry, Basil threatens and assaults Hill. Shamed, Basil confesses to McGorry and Glynn that he murdered Goergen because he wanted to prove that he is not a fraud, but real. He is tried for murder and sent to Unit J for at least three years, the unit for incarcerated police. As a result of Basil's arrest, the drug investigation is over. ====Part II==== In Unit J, Basil rooms with former Oz corrections officer Clayton Hughes and a sheriff named Alvin Yood. Glynn urges Basil to visit his wife, his lieutenant, and his former partner Nancy. He apologizes to his lieutenant, who is sorry to lose him to prison, and to Nancy, who is angered by his presence and says she is not sorry that he's in prison for what he did. Basil also meets his wife, whom he is scared to see since he let her down. After her visit, Basil insults Hughes, who in turn murders him. Hughes is sent to solitary as a result. Basil's body is later seen in the infirmary. ===Murders committed=== * Bruno Goergen - Murdered by Basil, pushing him on the bottom of the elevator shaft because he was threatening to put word in Oz that Basil was an undercover cop, and also so Basil gets in good with Enrique Morales, Chucky Pancamo & Simon Adebisi if he killed someone in Oz so he continues to bust the drug trade in Oz.

Nepherites then crowned himself pharaoh at Memphis and possibly also at Sais, before shifting the capital from Sais to his hometown Mendes. The fact that Nepherites I chose the same Horus name of Psamtik I and the Golden Horus name of Amasis II – both relevant rulers of the earlier 26th Dynasty - is thought to demonstrate that he wanted to associate his rule with an earlier 'golden age' of Egyptian history. ===Activities=== According to Manetho, Nepherites I ruled for six years, although his highest archaeologically attested date is his regnal year 4. Evidence of Nepherites' building work has been found in a number of locations across the country. In Lower Egypt, he is attested at Thmuis, Tell Roba, Buto (where a statue of him has been foundGabra, G. (1981). \\"A lifesize statue of Nepherites I from Buto\\", SAK 9, pp. 119-23), Memphis, Saqqara (where an Apis burial took place in his regnal year 2) and his capital and hometown Mendes. In Middle and Upper Egypt, he ordered a chapel at Akoris while at Akhmim, near Sohag, there is evidence of the worship of a statue of him which was placed inside a naos. He also added some buildings at Karnak such as a storeroom and a shrine meant to house a sacred bark. A basalt sphinx with his name is now located in the Louvre, but it was known to have been brought to Europe as early as the 16th century, having adorned a fountain at the Villa Borghese, Rome. In foreign affairs, he resumed the policy of Egyptian intervention in the Middle East. As reported by Diodorus Siculus, in 396 BC he supported the Spartan king Agesilaus in his war against the Persians; the Spartans had conquered Cyprus and Rhodes and were attempting to extend their influence further east. Nepherites supplied the Spartans with 500,000 measures of grain and material for 100 triremes. However, the cargo reached Rhodes just after the Persians managed to retake the island, so it was entirely seized by the philo-Persian admiral Conon of Athens. ===Death and succession=== A shabti of Nepherites I Nepherites I died during the winter of 394/393 BC after six years of reign. The Demotic Chronicle simply states that \\"his son\\" was allowed to succeed him, without providing any name. Nowadays it is generally believed that Nepherites' son was Hakor, who ruled after him for only a year before being overthrown by an apparently unrelated claimant, Psammuthes; Hakor, however, was able to retake the throne the following year.Ray, John D. (1986). \\"Psammuthis and Hakoris\\", The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, 72: 149-158. ==Possible tomb== A tomb believed to be that of Nepherites was discovered by a joint team from the University of Toronto and the University of Washington in 1992-93. Possible ownership of the tomb was identified by the presence of a shabti bearing the name of Nepherites I; however, definitive proof has not been found. Although still containing funerary objects and a large limestone sarcophagus, the tomb was believed to have been destroyed by the Persians in 343 BC. Ceramic vessels containing fish specimens and fish-covered stelae have been found on the site of Nepherites's funerary complex. The presence of the fish, often interpreted as votive offerings, could be an indication that the site was previously occupied by a temple of the fish-goddess Hatmehyt. ==See also== *Muthis – A conjectural pharaoh, once believed to be Nepherites I's son. ==References== ==External links== *Livius.org: Nepherites I Category:4th-century BC Pharaohs Category:Pharaohs of the Twenty-ninth Dynasty of Egypt Category:5th-century BC births Category:393 BC deaths ","title":"Nepherites I"},{"id":"3250805","text":"Joeri FransenWebsite Joeri Fransen (born 10 July 1981) is the winner of Idool 2004, the Belgian version of Pop Idol. == Idol performances == # Semi-Finals (group 1): \\"Lean On Me\\" (Bill Withers) # Top 10: \\"If I Had A Rocket Launcher\\" (Bruce Cockburn) # Top 9: \\"All Night Long\\" (Lionel Richie) # Top 8: \\"Geen Toeval\\" (Marco Borsato) # Top 7: \\"Everybody's Talking\\" (Harry Nilsson) # Top 6: \\"Lovin Whiskey\\" (Rory Block) # Top 5: \\"Feeling Good\\" (Nina Simone) # Top 4: \\"Black\\" (Pearl Jam) # Top 4: \\"Clocks\\" (Coldplay) # Top 3: \\"Wicked Game\\" (Chris Isaak) # Top 3: \\"Out of Time\\" (Chris Farlowe) # Top 2: \\"Ya Bout To Find Out\\" (winner's single) # Top 2: \\"Everybody's Talking\\" (reprise) (Harry Nilsson) # Top 2: \\"Georgia on My Mind\\" (Ray Charles) == Discography == * \\"Ya Bout To Find Out\\" (Debut Single) # \\"Ya Bout To Find Out\\" # \\"Everybody's Talking\\" # \\"Georgia on My Mind\\" # \\"Ya Bout To Find Out\\" (instrumental) * \\"High and Alive\\" # \\"High and Alive\\" # \\"If I Had A Rocket Launcher\\" * True Lies (Debut Album) # \\"Song For You\\" # \\"If I Had A Rocket Launcher\\" # \\"High and Alive\\" # \\"You Gotta Learn\\" # \\"Once A Man\\" # \\"Scratch The Surface\\" # \\"Here's To You\\" # \\"True Lies\\" # \\"Personality\\" # \\"Brave Heart\\" # \\"Ya Bout To Find Out\\" # \\"We Came This Far\\" # \\"Hold On to a Dream\\" * \\"We Came This Far\\" # \\"We Came This Far\\" # \\"Stephanie Says\\" * \\"True Lies\\" (single) # \\"True Lies\\" == References == Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Idols (TV series) winners Category:Belgian pop singers Category:21st-century Belgian singers ","title":"Joeri Fransen"},{"id":"3250810","text":"Dennis John Maruk (born November 17, 1955) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player of Ukrainian descent.Oral History >Famous Ukrainian- Canadians He played in the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1975 to 1989, scoring a career-high 60 goals for the Washington Capitals in 1981–82. ==Career== As a youth, Maruk played in the 1968 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Etobicoke. Maruk played junior \\"A\\" hockey in the Ontario Hockey League for the London Knights before he was drafted in 1975 by the California Golden Seals. While with the Seals, he became the first NHL rookie to score five shorthanded goals in a season. Maruk followed the franchise when it relocated to Cleveland to become the Cleveland Barons a year later. Maruk's rights were later obtained by the Minnesota North Stars after the Barons merged with them in 1978, but he was traded shortly afterwards to the Washington Capitals. During his time with the Capitals, he scored 50 goals in 1980-81 and 60 goals in 1981-82; his mark of 76 assists and 136 points in the 1982 season remain Capitals' records for a single-season. Maruk was the first Capitals player to score 100 points in a season. In 1982-83, Maruk was one of the players instrumental in leading the Capitals to their first playoff appearance. Despite this, he was traded back to the North Stars where he would finish his career. At the time of his retirement in 1989, he was the last active NHL player to have played for the Seals/Barons franchise, although Charlie Simmer played later than him in minor leagues. Maruk was also the last Minnesota North Stars player to wear the number 9 prior to Mike Modano. In 888 NHL games, he scored 356 goals and had 522 assists. ==Career statistics== ===Regular season and playoffs=== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:60em\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" ! rowspan=\\"100\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" ! colspan=\\"5\\"Regular season ! rowspan=\\"100\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" ! colspan=\\"5\\"Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

During the 19th and 20th centuries, German scholars in particular made significant contributions to the study of historical place names, or Ortsnamenkunde. These studies have, in turn, contributed to the study of genealogy. For genealogists and historians of pre-Modern Europe, knowing alternate names of places is vital to extracting information from both public and private records. Even specialists in this field point out, however, that the information can be easily taken out of context, since there is a great deal of repetition of place names throughout Europe; reliance purely on apparent connections should therefore be tempered with valid historical methodology. ==Caveats and notes== Latin place names are not always exclusive to one place -- for example, there were several Roman cities whose names began with Colonia and then a more descriptive term. During the Middle Ages, these were often shortened to just Colonia. One of these, Colonia Agrippinensis, retains the name today in the form of Cologne. Early sources for Roman names show numerous variants and spellings of the Latin names. The modern canonical name is listed first. Sources are listed chronologically. In general, only the earliest source is shown for each name, although many of the names are recorded in more than one of the sources. Where the source differs in spelling, or has other alternatives, these are listed following the source. As an aid to searching, variants are spelled completely, and listed in most likely chronology. Superscripts indicate: # Latinized form of the Greek- derived name. # Latinized form of the Asian-derived name via Greek. # Altered Latinized form of the Greek-derived name. ==Cities and towns in Anatolia (Turkey)== { border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" !

Its headquarters are in Houston.\\"Contact Us.\\" Harris County Toll Road Authority. Retrieved on October 16, 2011. \\"Administrative Office Harris County Toll Road Authority 7701 Wilshire Place Drive Houston, TX 77040\\" ==History== HCTRA came into existence in September 1983 when Harris County voters approved a referendum by a 7-3 margin to release up to $900 million in bonds to create two toll roads - the Hardy Toll Road and the Sam Houston Tollway, to improve the regional mobility and reduce traffic congestion in the Greater Houston area, an area known for rapid population growth. The need for a county-run toll road system came from TxDOT's budget shortfall and its inability to authorize funding to upgrade the second loop around the city, Beltway 8, which had been on planning maps since the 1950s. The Texas Turnpike Authority turned down the opportunity to improve the road as well, leaving the county to upgrade the road to freeway standards. However, Harris County could not afford to build and maintain a freeway from its general fund. Shortly after the referendum, the Commissioners Court created the Toll Road Authority to administer the construction and operation of the new road system. Then-County Judge Jon Lindsay is generally credited with shepherding the referendum from its infancy to its passage, along with the implementation of the plan for the roadway. HCTRA is a part of Harris County's Public Infrastructure Department and is subdivided into a Services and an Operations Division. While for many years, the Hardy Toll Road never had the traffic that the HCTRA envisioned it would need to turn a profit, the Sam Houston Tollway has more than made up for the lost revenue. The high profit margins on the Sam Houston Tollway allowed the authority to construct its third and fourth toll roads, the Westpark Tollway and Fort Bend Toll Road, both of which opened in 2004. Both of these toll roads have termini in Fort Bend County and are run in conjunction with the Fort Bend County Toll Road Authority. HCTRA also operates managed lanes that run along the median of I-10/Katy Freeway between SH 6 and I-610 that opened in April 2009.Katy Toll Road, accessed 29 September 2006 The most recent project of HCTRA is the Tomball Tollway, which was completed in phases between 2015 and 2019. On March 1, 2020, operations of the Lynchburg Ferry and the Washburn Tunnel were transferred from Harris County Precinct 2 to the Harris County Toll Road Authority.Toll Road Authority Takes Control Of Washburn Tunnel, Lynchburg Ferry Houston Public Media (KUHF-FM, News 88.7). 1 March 2020 (Retrieved 19 August 2020) There are no plans for HCTRA to implement tolls either the Lynchburg Ferry or the Washburn Tunnel. Nevertheless, HCTRA's involvement will include plans to improve the operations of both facilities, as well as much-needed repairs and upgrades. ==Current system== The HCTRA uses their own toll tag called the EZ TAG. The system has been interoperable with the Texas Department of Transportation's TxTag and the North Texas Tollway Authority's TollTag since 2003. Around the 3rd quarter of 2017, the system will be interoperable with the Kansas Turnpike Authority's K-Tag and the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority's PikePass. The following toll roads (in order of first segment completion) form the current HCTRA system: ===Sam Houston Tollway (1982)=== The Sam Houston Tollway is the name given to the tolled sections of Beltway 8, the second highway loop around Houston. The first opened section was the Sam Houston Ship Channel Bridge in the east quadrant of the road system. From 1982 to 1994, the bridge, which was originally named in honor of local politician and entrepreneur Jesse H. Jones, was maintained by the Texas Turnpike Authority (now North Texas Tollway Authority). As of February 26, 2011, the Sam Houston Tollway is a complete tolled beltway loop around Houston (minus a few minor sections that are freeways managed by TXDOT). ===Hardy Toll Road (1988)=== The Hardy Toll Road was constructed to help alleviate traffic off of I-45 North. The route begins at I-610 North between I-45 North and I-69/US 59 North and travels northward parallel to I-45 for after which it merges onto I-45. The toll road also features a spur to George Bush Intercontinental Airport. ===Westpark Tollway (2004)=== The Westpark Tollway is a toll road starting in Uptown Houston and travelling westward parallel to sections of Westpark Drive and FM 1093 and terminating just past the Grand Parkway (SH 99). It is the first all- electronic toll road in the United States. The Fort Bend County Toll Road Authority (FBCTRA) operates the westernmost of the tollway. ===Fort Bend Toll Road (2004)=== The Fort Bend Toll Road is a tollway that follows the route of the formerly-cancelled State Highway 122. The toll road currently begins with direct connectors at US 90A, just north of the Sam Houston Tollway, and travels southward to its terminus at SH 6. As with the Westpark Tollway, the Fort Bend Toll Road is jointly operated with the FBCTRA. ===Katy Freeway Managed Lanes (2009)=== In 2002, HCTRA entered into an agreement with TxDOT and Harris County for the reconstruction of I-10/Katy Freeway. The toll road authority's portion of the project is a managed lane facility in the center of the reconstructed freeway that is used by METRO and HOV vehicles at no charge and single passenger vehicles for a toll. The four lane roadway, running between I-610/West Loop and SH 6, has been completed. The lanes opened during the second quarter of 2009. ===Tomball Tollway (2015)=== The Tomball Tollway consists of a 7.5-mile (12.1 km) segment of three toll lanes in each direction from Spring Cypress Road up to Sentinel Oaks in Pinehurst. Texas State Highway 249 serves as toll-free frontage roads for the Tomball Tollway. Tolling on the Tomball Tollway is all-electronic; an EZ TAG, TollTag or TxTag are required for passage. No cash or pay-by-mail option is available for the Tomball Tollway. Construction of Phase I of the Tomball Tollway between Spring Cypress Road and the north end of the Tomball Bypass began in Fall 2013 and was finished on April 12, 2015. Phase II of the SH 249 (Tomball Tollway) project, in partnership with Montgomery County Toll Road Authority, extends the tollway north of the Tomball Bypass to Sentinel Oaks just north of Spring Creek in Montgomery County. From that point, the corridor will extend north to points beyond in Montgomery and Grimes Counties. Construction of Phase II commenced in Spring 2017 and was completed in December 2019.Harris County Toll Road Authority – HCTRA System Map https://www.hctra.org/TollRoadMap#OverviewSectionCommunity IMPACT Newspaper - Tomball Tollway Phase II opens Dec. 19 https://communityimpact.com/houston/tomball- magnolia/transportation/2019/12/19/tomball-tollway-phase-ii-opens-dec-19/ ==Future projects== ===Hardy Downtown Connector=== This long project will provide a connection between Downtown Houston and the current terminus of the Hardy Toll Road at I-610. Planning for the Hardy Toll Road connection into Downtown Houston was announced in 2000. The project will be completed in two phases. Phase I consists of moving a railroad line, right of way acquisition, and the construction of two overpasses. Phase II will be the construction of 4 toll lanes. Relocation of the rail line is expected to begin Fall of 2012. ===Hardy Toll Road Interchange at Beltway 8=== To relieve congestion on surface streets, direct connectors between Hardy Toll Road and Beltway 8 will be constructed. Currently there is only one direct connector ramp from Beltway 8 East to Hardy Toll Road North. Expected construction start date is unknown. ===Tomball Tollway direct connectors at SH 99=== This project will add a total of four direct connectors: two from northbound Tomball Tollway to east and westbound SH 99 (Grand Parkway), with the other two connecting to southbound Tomball Tollway from east and westbound SH 99. Construction is expected to begin in early 2020 and should last for thirty months.Community IMPACT Newspaper - Direct connectors set for early 2020 construction https://communityimpact.com/houston/tomball- magnolia/transportation/2020/01/04/direct-connectors-set-for- early-2020-construction/ ===Increased capacity of existing toll roads=== Added capacity is planned for the following existing tollway segments: *Sam Houston Tollway Southeast from SH 288 to IH 45 South: Two lanes will be added in each direction with improvements to the mainline toll plaza, and will have reconstructed entrance/exit ramps. Schematic design has been completed, construction is expected to begin in approximately 2 years. As of late 2015 the construction has not commenced since the interchange at SH288 has not been finalized where both TxDOT and HCTRA are finalizing plans for both the tollway upgrade and SH288 managed lanes. The first phase which commenced in 2015 is the construction of new overpasses for the west and eastbound Beltway 8 service lanes over a railroad right of way which parallels Mykawa Road (since the 1997 opening of the Sam Houston Tollway East one eastbound lane over Mykawa Road is co-shared with Beltway 8 where the realignment of the service lanes will eliminate the co-sharing with HCTRA and TxDOT (prior to the right of way co-sharing those who used the Beltway 8 service lanes had to make a turn on Mykawa Road and a left on Knapp Road in Pearland, TX where it had a surface crossing at a railroad right of way, which has been decommissioned later replaced with a flyover on McHard Road a few miles south during the early 2000s); this section of the tollway is congested on weekends where Cole's Flea Market is located south of the tollway on State Highway 35 in Pearland). *Sam Houston Tollway East from IH 45 South to SH 225: One or two lanes are to be added in each direction with improvements to the mainline toll plaza, and will have reconstructed entrance/exit ramps. Construction for the tollway lanes is expected to begin in 2017. *Sam Houston Tollway - Ship Channel Bridge from SH 225 to IH 10 East: A second span will be constructed over the Ship Channel with three or four lanes with full shoulders in each direction. Construction is expected to begin in 2018. First phase of the plan involved the conversion of the Ship Channel Bridge toll plazas into electronic toll collection, which was implemented on January 11, 2016. ===Fort Bend Parkway/South Post Oak Road Extension=== The project will connect I-610 via the South Post Oak exit (which terminates south of West Bellfort) to the northern terminus of the Fort Bend Parkway at US 90 Alternate with just over of tolled lanes. In October 2019, HCTRA began to examine plans for the segment utilizing the original 2003 schematics.Harris County Toll Road Authority revisits plans for Fort Bend Parkway extension Community IMPACT Newspaper. 29 October 2020 (Retrieved 19 August 2020) ==Former or cancelled projects== ===Fairmont Parkway East Managed Lanes=== Project is no longer being built. As of 03/30/10http://app1.kuhf.org/houston_public_radio-news- display.php?articles_id=1253738352 ===Hempstead Highway/US 290 Managed Lanes=== The planned project will add four tolled lanes along the Hempstead Highway corridor between I-610 and the future Grand Parkway (SH 99) northwest segment. The project is one component of the complete US 290 corridor upgrade by TxDOT, which also includes added capacity to US 290, a new HOV system parallel to the Hempstead Highway, and a possible commuter rail line in conjunction with METRO. However, in April 2012, it was announced by HCTRA that the primacy of the Hempstead Tollway was handed off to TxDOT. Construction of the tollway by TxDOT is not anticipated for several years.my290.com - HEMPSTEAD MANAGED TOLL ROAD https://www.my290.com/environmental/120-hempstead- managed-toll-road.html ===SH 242/I-45 Flyover Ramps (2015)=== Although both of them are located within Montgomery County and were at the time owned and operated by Montgomery County Toll Road Authority (MCTRA), HCTRA formerly collected tolls for MCTRA for two flyover ramps: one from northbound I-45 to SH 242 westbound and the other from westbound SH 242 to I-45 southbound near The Woodlands. Both flyover ramps were completed on May 11, 2015, and were tolled between July 6, 2015, and May 28, 2019. Both ramps solely utilized electronic toll collection, and required drivers to own an EZ TAG, TollTag or TxTag transponder. After a unanimous vote by the Montgomery County Commissioners Court on May 28, 2019, the tolls were lifted, and ownership and maintenance of both flyover ramps were transferred to the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). As a result, HCTRA stopped collecting tolls on the flyover ramps. ===SH 288 Managed Lanes=== To help alleviate congestion on SH 288, HCTRA had planned to construct toll lanes in the median of the existing freeway. The route would begin at I-69/US 59 just south of Midtown and terminate at the intersection of the proposed Grand Parkway (SH 99) for a total length of 26 miles (41.8 km). HCTRA would have maintain its segment north of Clear Creek at the Brazoria County Line. Shortly before construction began in November 2016, TxDOT's Toll Operations Division took control of the project from HCTRA.Houston Public Media - What Commuters Need To Know About The State Highway 288 Toll Project https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2016/11/15/177376/what- commuters-need-to-know-about-the-state-highway-288-toll-project/ ==See also== Texas State Highway 99 ==References== ==External links== *Harris County Toll Road Authority - About HCTRA *Harris County Toll Road Authority *Houston Freeways *- About the Grand Parkway Category:Toll road authorities of the United States Category:Transportation in Harris County, Texas Category:Transportation in Houston Category:Toll roads in Texas z ","title":"Harris County Toll Road Authority"},{"id":"3250828","text":"\\"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\\" is a show tune from the 1943 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Oklahoma!.

He served in the House of Commons of Canada from 1993 to 2000, as a member of the Liberal Party. Murray was born in Sarnia, Ontario, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in History from the University of Guelph in 1973. He had an extensive career in Canadian politics before running for office himself. Murray was a research assistant for a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1974 to 1976, and a special assistant to the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Communications from 1976 to 1977. From 1977 to 1979 and 1980 to 1982, he served as special assistant to the Minister of Veterans Affairs. Murray served with Northern Telecom Ltd. from 1982 to 1993, and was director of Government Relations from 1987 to 1993. He won the Liberal nomination for Lanark—Carleton in 1993 under unusual conditions. After five counts on a preferential ballot, Murray and another candidate were deadlocked in support. The returning officer broke the tie by giving Murray the nomination, but his opponent appealed this decision to party headquarters. The nomination was finally decided by a coin toss. Murray disapproved of this selection method, but the decision nonetheless went in his favour and he was formally approved as a candidate. He was elected by a large margin in the 1993 federal election, defeating Progressive Conservative incumbent Paul Dick by over 18,000 votes in a riding that has not traditionally voted Liberal. Murray considered voting against his government's gun control bill in 1995, but ultimately supported the government side. In 1996, he voted against second reading of a government bill extended anti-discrimination protection to gays and lesbians. Murray claimed he did not object to the principle of the bill, but opposed it on the grounds that it could result in a redefinition of the traditional family.Ottawa Citizen, 3 May 1996.

Music for the production was composed and performed by Bill Thompson. Its central character is the ghost Isobel, a nine-year-old Portuguese girl who is searching for her killer by observing and occasionally interacting with her neighbors seventeen years after her murder, revealing their dark, horrific, emotional, and very private experiences. Lion in the Streets was published in 1992 by Playwrights Canada Press. ==Characters== There are twenty-eight or twenty-nine characters with speaking parts of varying lengths. The original ensemble was composed of four women and two men who split the roles up roughly as follows (there is some confusion in the Playwrights Canada Press printing, as some character names in the initial list do not actually exist in the play, and some characters who do speak are omitted entirely): Women: *Isobel *Nellie, Laura, Elaine, Christine, Sherry *Rachel (who is also Rose for two pages), Lily, Rhonda, Ellen, Scarlett *Sue, Jill, Joanne, Joan (an optional character) Men: *Scalato, Timmy, George, Maria, David, Rodney, (Edward?), Ben *Martin, Bill, Isobel's Father, Ron, Father Hayes, Michael, (Edward?) ==Plot== Isobel's ghost wanders around lost, in a playground. \\"Is my house but is not my house is my street but is not my street my people is gone I am lost.\\" (Thompson, Lion in the Streets, line 11-13)Worthen, W. B. (2010). Wadsworth Anthology of Drama 6th edition. Wadsworth publishing. Page 1580 A women named Sue comes to her rescue from other kids picking on her. Before Isobel follows Sue home she sees her father, and recalls that he is dead. After Sue's son Tommy makes some depressing comments, Isobel follows Sue on to a dinner party with her husband. Sue calls him to come home and find out he's been having an affair with a woman at the party. Isobel realizes Sue's inability to care for her and calls to the audience for someone to take her home. Isobel stays with Laura, the dinner party hostess, and witnesses a flashback to when Isobel's mother, Maria, found out about Isobel's father's suicide. As Maria tells of her vision of her husband dying, Isobel dramatically acts out her father falling onto the train tracks. As Laura goes on to a day care meeting, she gets into a heated conversation with Rhonda, the child care provider. After all the drama, Isobel points her finger at each member of the meeting and \\"shoots\\" them individually, though real shots are heard. Isobel clings to Rhonda's feet as they move onto the next scene, where Rhonda meats a friend, Joanne, at a bar. Joanne shares that she has cancer, and asks Rhonda to help her plan out an Ophelia-like suicide. As they leave the bar, Isobel realizes her purgatorial state and that she wants to go to heaven. She follows the bartender, David, to confession with his childhood priest. At confession, David realizes he is also long dead. In Act Two, Isobel starts looking to protect rather than be protected. It begins with Isobel in a playground again, warning the people around that the Lion in the Streets is coming. She follows Christine from the park to an interview with a young women with cerebral palsy named Scarlet. Scarlet shares a private topic but is betrayed by Christine, who threatens to publish it. Scarlet begins to provoke Christine, who then attacks and kills Scarlet. Isobel calls Christine a \\"slave\\" of the Lion, and follows her to the next scene, where she hopes to find the Lion. Christine's assistant, Rodney, has an unpleasant conversation with her and then receives an unexpected visit from an old friend. The friend, Michael, alludes to their youthful sexual experimentation and accuses Rodney of being queer. They fight, and Rodney \\"kills\\" Michael. After Michael leaves, Rodney has a monologue about his interactions with Michael growing up. Sherry, his coworker, bursts in, tries to calm him down, and gives him some chocolate before she goes home. Isobel watches a conversation between Sherry and her boyfriend quickly escalate into a fight where he makes her relive a rape that happened to her years before. He makes her say that it was her fault, to satisfy his own fantasies. The scene ends with Sherry continuing to talk about preparing for their wedding. Sherry and Isobel then walk over to the graveyard where Ben, Isobel's murderer, (a.k.a. the Lion) is sitting. Sherry lays down at her grave, and as Ben continues to tell his story of justification of why he killed Isobel, she confronts him. She tells her part of the story and has an internal battle between vengeance and forgiveness. Forgiveness wins: she tells Ben \\"I love you\\" and asks him for her life back. Now appearing as an adult, Isobel tells the audience that though he took her heart, her heart was never silent, and she urges the audience to take back their lives. ==Background== After 1953 there was a large influx of Portuguese immigrants to Canada, seeking economic opportunity and political freedom. 69% of Portuguese Canadians live in Ontario, and many are in Toronto. Isobel comes from a Portuguese family in Toronto and her strong accent indicates that her family has not lived in Canada for very long. One of the themes of the play is the difficult lives experienced by immigrants (shown by Isobel's father's job as a manual laborer, and his subsequent suicide). ==Structure and Inspiration== Lion in the Streets is a series of shorter scenes or vignettes linked by the character of Isobel. The playwright, Judith Thompson, said: \\"I thought I just can’t bear some giant narrative, somebody taking this immense journey. So I thought, well, write a bunch of little plays, like two women in a restaurant and one says, ‘Guess what?’ I had no idea what it was going to be. It was an improvisation\\" (Zimmerman interview 188).https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/scl/article/view/5822/10704 The scene-to-scene structure of Lion in the Streets is somewhat reminiscent of Arthur Schnitzler's La Ronde, which is made up of ten interlocking scenes between pairs of lovers, with each character appearing in two consecutive scenes. The difference with Lion in the Streets is that it has a main character, Isobel, whose thread we follow throughout the play as she witnesses the other scenes take place. ==Themes and Ideas== Isobel continually encounters evil and violence within the city; Judith Thompson is showing a sort of \\"hidden\\" side of Toronto and discussing issues that are often taboo. Isobel says that a lion lurks among us, which only she can point out. The play looks away from the \\"upper-class, male-centered, high-art paradigm\\" to \\"[locate] freedom and power for a lower-class, female, immigrant- child.\\"https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/scl/article/view/5822/10704 ==Criticism== Critics have commented on the dream-like nature of the play: \\"Besides Isobel's ghostly presence, other aspects of the play are surreal as well; it begins with a circus-like dance in which masked actors swirl around the open stage... frightening, seemingly on the edge of losing control. Like the lion of the title, there's something wild here in the midst of apparent civilization, something untamed in a very dangerous way\\".https://www.austinchronicle.com/arts/2002-02-22/84700/ However, other critics have found the script \\"pretentious and shallow\\" and the character of Isobel \\"obnoxious.\\" https://variety.com/2005/legit/reviews/lion-in-the- streets-1200523216/ ==Awards== In 1991, Judith Thompson received a Floyd S. Chalmers Canadian Play Award for Lion in the Streets. This is a $25,000 award for plays by Canadian playwrights and performed in the Toronto area, named after Floyd Chalmers, the editor, publisher, and philanthropist. ==Adaptations== In 2002, Ed Gass-Donnelly directed a 6-minute film, Dying Like Ophelia, based on the scene between the characters Joanne and Rhonda. ==References== ==External links== *Lion in the Streets at the Canadian Theatre Encyclopedia Category:Plays by Judith Thompson Category:1990 plays ","title":"Lion in the Streets"},{"id":"3250864","text":"Worldchanging was a nonprofit online publisher that operated from 2003 to 2010. Its strapline was A bright green future. It published newsletters and books about sustainability, bright green environmentalism, futurism and social innovation. ==History== Worldchanging was launched in October 2003 in San Francisco by Alex Steffen, Jamais Cascio, and a core of initial contributors. In 2005, Worldchanging moved its offices to Seattle, Washington. In early 2006, Cascio left to form the website Open the Future. From 2005 - 2010, Worldchanging was headquartered in Seattle with Alex Steffen as executive editor and editorial lead, Julia Levitt and Amanda Reed as managing editors, and several contributing editors including Jeremy Faludi and Sarah Rich. It relied extensively on an international network of writers and correspondents. Worldchanging was overseen by a board of directors, led by Worldchanging's chairman, the environmental photographer Edward Burtynsky until May 2010. Worldchanging was supported by grants, book sales, speaker fees and reader donations. On November 29, 2010, Worldchanging announced that due to fundraising difficulties it would shut down. It was acquired by Architecture for Humanity in September, 2011. That organization subsequently filed for bankruptcy in January 2015, and the Worldchanging website became unavailable around March 2016. ==Content== Worldchanging practiced \\"solutions-based journalism\\": countering cynicism by highlighting possible solutions to the planet's most pressing problems rather than just reporting on those problems and their causes. In the opening paragraph of its manifesto, Worldchanging declared: ==Impact== This pithy remark is an indication of the impact Worldchanging had in the first decade of the twenty-first century. Much environmental reporting of the time was preoccupied with predictions of social and ecological collapse unless there was a wholescale retreat from industrial modernism. Worldchanging provided a welcome breath of optimism. It demonstrated that, not only were there solutions to even the most pressing problems, they were available now. This school of thought has come to be known as bright green environmentalism. Reflecting on the closure of Worldchanging in 2010, Andrew Revkin contrasted its work with The World Without Us, which examined how quickly nature would erase the works of civilisation were humans to suddenly disappear. He summarised Worldchanging's work as taking on \\"the tougher challenge of charting life on the World *with* us\\". ==Critical reception== Wired columnist Bruce Sterling called Worldchanging \\"The best collaborative weblog in the whole wide world\\". Journalist and author Bill McKibben considered it \\"one of the most professional and interesting Web sites that you could possibly bookmark on your browser\\". Author Architect Richard Meier named it as his favorite site and praised it for having \\"a wealth of information on sustainability\\". Alex Steffen gave a TED global talk in 2005, and Jamais Cascio gave a TED talk in 2006. Worldchanging won or was a finalist for the following awards and prizes: * Winner of the 2004 Utne Independent Press Award for Best Online Cultural Coverage. * Finalist in 2005 Webby for Best Blog. * Finalist in 2005 Bloggie for Best Non-Weblog Content of a Weblog Site. * Finalist in 2006 Bloggie for Best Group Weblog. * Finalist in 2007 Webby for Best Magazine. * Official Honoree in 2008 Webby. In 2007, Time Magazine named Worldchanging one of the world's top 15 environmental websites. In 2008, Nielsen rated Worldchanging the second leading sustainability site in the world for 2007, ==Worldchanging book== In November 2006, Worldchanging published a survey of global innovation, Worldchanging: A User's Guide for the 21st Century with a foreword by Al Gore, design by Stefan Sagmeister, and an introduction by Bruce Sterling.

It saw translation into French, German, Korean and several other languages. === Reception === The book was well received on its release, and was rated highly by the general public on book review sites. The layout and design were also received favourably. It was \\"emphatically recommended\\" by TreeHugger, who praised its structure and, while noting that the coverage was broader than it was deep, also noted that each section contained references to further reading material. Publishers Weekly concluded that \\"it's hard to imagine a more complete resource for those hoping to live in a future that is, as editor Steffen puts it, 'bright, green, free and tough.'\\". Writing in the New York Review of Books, Bill McKibben described the book as seeking answers to the question 'how we can radically transform our daily lives?'. He found it had a refreshingly pragmatic approach, although he also felt it placed a little too much emphasis on the individual over the Government as agents of change. Looking past observations that \\"... it leans left and it appears to downplay the role of markets as a possible solution\\", Bloomberg Businessweek's Bruce Nussbaum found Worldchanging to be \\"full of innovation and pragmatic solutions.\\". Writing in New Scientist, Andrew Simms was less enthusiastic. While he thought it made the \\"positive point that all is not hopeless, and that there are more ways of improving the human lot than are being used\\", he also thought it \\"betrayed a technocratic mindset that sought to impose solutions from outside a problem, rather than acknowledging that those inside a problem [refugees] know perfectly well what they need.\\". In The Guardian, children's author Josh Lacey described the book as \\"a vision of how things might look if the geeks inherit the Earth.\\" He found the brief articles contributed by over sixty authors ranged from practical suggestions for changing your daily life to simple inspirations, but that \\"... all this information is sandwiched between thick slices of polemic. The wide-eyed gusto does sometimes get a bit irritating.\\" Lacey did conclude on a positive note, describing the book itself as \\"Elegantly produced and built to last\\" and that having all this information available to hand was \\"... a pretty good reminder of why books aren't yet redundant and probably won't be for a long time.\\" There were less favourable reviews. Several commentators asked how a website that promoted sustainability could justify consuming resources to publish a 600-page hardcover book and conduct a national tour to promote it (a sentiment foreshadowed by Sterling's reference to \\"a dizzyingly comprehensive chunk of treeware\\" in his Introduction on p 14). The book's publishers noted on the back page that they recorded the ecological costs and applied the appropriate offsets. The criticism may be taken as an illustration of the differences between 'bright' and 'dark' green thinking. ===Revised edition=== Worldchanging, Revised Edition: A User's Guide for the 21st Century was issued in 2011 as a revision with updated technological material, relating to sustainable living, including some 160 new entries relating to food security, sustainable transport, carbon neutrality, ecotourism and updated information on the emerging local food movement. Again, it rated well with the general public but, by the time of publication, Worldchanging had ceased operations and the book received virtually no coverage in editorial columns. ==References== == External links == *Worldchanging.com (via Internet Archive). *TED Talk (Video) Alex Steffen sees a sustainable future *Interview with Alex Steffen *New York Times: Alex Steffen, a Designing Optimist Category:American environmental websites Category:Appropriate technology organizations Category:Defunct magazines published in the United States Category:Environmental publishers Category:Environmental magazines Category:Defunct websites Category:Internet-based activism Category:Magazines established in 2003 Category:Magazines disestablished in 2010 Category:Magazines published in San Francisco Category:Magazines published in Seattle Category:Sustainability organizations ","title":"Worldchanging"},{"id":"3250877","text":"La mujer de mi hermano (\\"My brother's wife\\", literally, \\"The woman of my brother\\") is a 2005 Peruvian film directed by Ricardo de Montreuil, based on the novel of the same name by the Peruvian writer, journalist and TV host Jaime Bayly. It starred Bárbara Mori, Manolo Cardona, Christian Meier, and Angélica Aragón. Its soundtrack was given by Pakistani singer Atif Aslam. ==Plot== ===Structure=== La Mujer De Mi Hermano ( \\"My Brother's Wife\\") could be considered in a category of films that critic Alissa Quart calls 'hyperlink movies', in which multiple stories take place, each affecting the other in ways that characters are unaware of, all the while using radically different aesthetic and cinematic techniques to define the mise en scène of each storyline. ==Synopsis== Zoe (Bárbara Mori) is a beautiful woman who has been married to Ignacio (Christian Meier) for nearly a decade. While Zoe still loves her husband, she feels the spark has gone out of their relationship, and she's become restless and anxious. Hoping to find the excitement she craves in forbidden fruit, Zoe falls into an affair with Gonzalo (Manolo Cardona), Ignacio’s rough-edged but handsome brother. During their encounters, she complains to Gonzalo that Ignacio seems uninterested in her sexually as he only makes love to her on Saturdays and rejects her advances regularly. Reciprocating her negative thoughts of Ignacio, Gonzalo accuses him of being jealous as he has gone on to work in his passion of painting. On the other hand, Ignacio is running the family business and blatantly states that Gonzalo is a good-for-nothing and a moocher as he doesn’t work and simply collects his monthly stipend. Ignacio further deems Gonzalo’s painting a waste of time. Zoe confides in and seeks advice about the affair from her best friend, Boris (Bruno Bichir). One night after sex, Gonzalo comments that he suspects Ignacio of being gay. Zoe again seeks council from Boris, who states he can confirm her suspicions about Ignacio’s sexuality due to his lack of sexual interest in her. Zoe and Gonzalo's passionate affair is satisfying to them both, but the adulterous couple must deal with the sharp sting of betrayal when Ignacio finds out they've been sleeping together. However, the story takes a big turn when it is revealed the affair has only been a revenge towards his brother for Gonzalo. He confronts Ignacio admitting he remembers being raped by him when he was younger, therefore, Gonzalo is set on destroying his life. To further complicate the love triangle, Zoe becomes pregnant with Gonzalo’s child, which he adamantly denies is his and demands Zoe abort. Zoe leaves Ignacio a Dear John letter and leaves their house. Ignacio writes a letter in return, stating that he still loves her and is willing to forgive her affair with Gonzalo. Ignacio meets Zoe at her hotel and declares that while he deeply loves her, he is sexually attracted to men. Zoe agrees to stay married to Ignacio and he agrees to raise the baby his own on the condition that Zoe allow him male lovers at his discretion. Zoe agrees to the terms and Ignacio sends Gonzalo an email in which Gonzalo is led to believe that Ignacio remained oblivious of the affair and that the baby is his. The film closes with Ignacio and Gonzalo’s mother telling Ignacio how much the baby looks like him. ==Cast== * Bárbara Mori as Zoe * Manolo Cardona as Gonzalo * Christian Meier as Ignacio * Bruno Bichir as Boris * Gaby Espino as Laura * Angélica Aragón as Cristina * Beto Cuevas as Padre Santiago * David Leche Ruiz as Jorge ==Adaptation== For this film, director Ricardo de Montreuil and novelist Bayly intended to take the story in a separate and somewhat different direction than the novel. \\"When María Eugenia Argomedo and I began collaborating on the script, we were hoping to make something new out of the material, rather than simply reproducing the book onto film,\\" said Montreuil on an IFC interview. ==Reviews== The film received mixed reviews from critics. They attacked the film's plot for being overtly dramatic, while defenders interpreted it as a truthful film, one that tries to depict the most realistic aspects of relationships.La Mujer de Mi Hermano (2006): Reviews La Mujer de mi Hermano rates poorly on RottenTomatoes.com, with a 21% approval rating, the consensus being, \\"No better than an R-rated telenovela, with the requisite love...\\" \\"Great, Brave and Smart acting in a bad movie It currently holds a 41% rating on Metacritic, which indicates \\"some medium reaction.\\" == Soundtrack == The song \\"Maula\\" and \\"Doorie\\" was sung by Atif Aslam (Pakistani Pop Singer). ==Box office== By the time the movie debuted in the Festival de Cine Iberoamericano de Huelva on November 26, 2005, it had already been seen in Mexico by 850,000 people. The film won second place at the festival that year, after Luis Mandoki's Voces inocentes, and was expected to reach one million total spectators and two million dollars at the box-office. In the first week of exhibition it had a box-office total of nine million pesos (approximately 800,000 dollars). The movie opened in third place after Chicken Little and The Legend of Zorro. In the first weekend of the United States release the film grossed slightly over 1 million dollars (an uncommon feat for a Mexican film in the American market). The film was dubbed and released in India in 2010 with the English version named as 'A Beautiful Wife' and Hindi version known as 'Spanish Beauty'.IMDB reference of the movie for Indian versions The film opened to poor reviews Review of Hindi version 'Spanish Beauty' and both the versions performed poorly in India. ==References* Category:2005 films Category:2005 drama films Category:Films based on Peruvian novels Category:Mexican films Category:Spanish-language films Category:Lionsgate films Category:Films directed by Ricardo de Montreuil ","title":"La mujer de mi hermano"},{"id":"3250885","text":"The Battle of Ahmed Khel was fought between the British Empire with its British and Indian armies and the Afghans, on the road between Kandahar and Kabul in Afghanistan on 19 April 1880. The battle occurred during General Donald Stewart's march from Kandahar to Kabul via Ghazni, and ended in a British victory. The British forces, consisting of 7,200 British and Indian troops, were commanded by Lieutenant General Sir Donald Stewart. On the opposite side were 15,000 tribesmen, both mounted and on foot, of the Andarees, Tarkees, Suleiman Khels and other Afghan tribes, led by their tribal leaders. The Indian regiments were commanded by British officers, in the proportion of 7 British officers to 650 Indian infantry soldiers. This was an insufficient number for units in which all tactical decisions of significance were made by the British, and was particularly inadequate for less experienced units. For weaponry, the British infantry carried a single-shot Martini–Henry rifle, while the Indian infantry had a similar single-shot rifle, but one of older model. In addition to these rifles the British-Indian cavalry forces were armed with sword, lance and carbines. During times of peace the Indian army had no formations above regiment level, other than the staffs of garrisons in cities or forts. There was no operational training for staff officers. On the outbreak of war, brigade and divisional staffs had to be established, and were trained through experience. ==Order of battle== *Royal Horse Artillery (F Battery) *Royal Artillery *19th Bengal Cavalry (Fane's Lancers) *1st Punjab Cavalry *2nd Punjab Cavalry *59th Foot *2nd/60th Rifles *15th Bengal Native Infantry (Ludhiana Sikhs) *19th Bengal Native Infantry (Punjabis) *25th Bengal Native Infantry (Punjabis) *3rd Gurkha Rifles *2nd Sikh Infantry ==References== Category:Conflicts in 1880 Category:1880 in Afghanistan Category:Battles of the Second Anglo-Afghan War Category:Battles involving the United Kingdom Category:Battles involving Afghanistan Category:Battle honours of the King's Royal Rifle Corps Category:April 1880 events ","title":"Battle of Ahmed Khel"},{"id":"3250889","text":"Villa Elaine was Remy Zero's second studio album, released in 1998 and produced for Geffen Records.

He was the founder of Sri Lanka's drug policy, which was used as a model for development of policies based on rational pharmaceutical use in other countries as well by the World Health Organization, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the Non-Aligned Movement. Due to the far reaching effects of his proposals and policies, he has been called the 'greatest medical benefactor of humanity that Sri Lanka has hitherto produced'.Will his drugs legacy survive the new tendencies in the industry ? == Biography == Charles Wimala Bibile, Sylvester Chandra Bibile, Sujatha Doris Ranawana (Nee Bibile), Seneka William Bibile, Prof.Senaka Bibile, Sylvia Jayawardena Bibile, Henry Ananda Bibile, Cuda Banda Bibile Senaka Bibile was born at Kathaluwa Walauwa. His father was Charles William Bibile, a Rate Mahathmaya or Chief Native Feudal Official of Wellassa, his mother Sylvia Jayawardhana of Kathaluwa Walauwa, the manor house of the Jayawardhana family. The Bibile family claimed descent from a 16th-century Vedda chieftain. === Education === He received his primary and secondary education at Trinity College, Kandy. He entered the Medical College in Colombo, where he had a brilliant career, winning the gold medals for medicine and surgery, and obtained a first class honours degree in 1945. In 1949, he began post-graduate studies at the University of Edinburgh, returning to Sri Lanka in 1952 with a PhD. His doctorate thesis was a study of biological assays of cortical hormone and their application. His PhD supervisor was Dr Marthe Louise Vogt a famous British Pharmacologist of German Origin. === Academic career === He joined the University of Ceylon in 1947. In 1947–49 he led a research team of doctors under the guidance of Professor Cullumbine, Professor of Physiology. In 1958 he was selected as the first Professor of Pharmacology and became the head of a new department. He was the first dean of the faculty of medicine at the University of Peradeniya from 1967 to 1977. There he started the first medical education unit in Sri Lanka. === Pharmaceutical policy === He is best known for his advocacy of the government- controlled pharmaceutical purchasing plans often referred to as \\"rationalisation\\" of pharmaceuticals and the development of a national pharmaceuticals policy. He played the leading role in developing a rational pharmaceutical policy aimed at ensuring that impoverished people would get reasonable drugs at a low price. Further, the programs are aimed towards ensuring that doctors prescribe the minimum required drugs to treat the patient's illness. A careful selection of drugs was an essential component of the policies he advocated. He was called up by the Minister of Health to address this and prepared the Ceylon Hospital Formulary of about 630 drugs under their generic names almost singlehandedly. Subsequently, the National Formulary Committee (NFC), consisting of representatives from the public and private health sectors and the University Medical Schools a formulary committee was set up with him as its first chairman. The NFC published Formulary Notes for the use of doctors, which later became The Prescriber. At the time, it was alleged and widely believed that Pharmaceutical companies in the country made considerable money by selling drugs under their trade names, giving out biased information about the branded drugs as against those named generically. The United Front Government of 1970 appointed Dr S.A. Wickremasinghe and Dr. Bibile to lead a commission of inquiry to investigate this issue and they recommended the establishment a national policy and of a state body to regularise the trade. Accordingly, in 1971 Hon. T.B. Subasinghe, the Cabinet Minister of Industries, appointed him founder chairman of the Sri Lanka State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC). The SPC channelled all imports of pharmaceuticals, calling for worldwide bulk tenders which were limited to the approved drugs listed in the national formulary. The public and private health sectors obtained all their requirements from the SPC. Hence the drug trade was regulated by this body and vendors were forced to compete with each other and with generic drug producers on a cost basis only. This program is generally perceived to have resulted in a cheaper drug supply for poor countries. This policy was supported by WHO and other UN agencies with enormous benefit to Third World countries. The UNCTAD Secretariat examined the Sri Lankan experience, concluding that an analysis of the Sri Lankan model could give other developing countries an insight into ways of formulating, developing and implementing integrated national pharmaceutical policies. With Bibile's assistance, it published \\"Case Studies in the Transfer of Technology: Pharmaceutical Policies in Sri Lanka\\". This document has proved to be a very valuable guideline for developing countries intending to initiate pharmaceutical reforms. Translated into other languages, it may be found with health planners of almost every Third World country. Although his policy was watered down by the United National Party Government of 1977, which re-opened the doors to unrestricted imports, the SPC was never dissolved and continued to supply affordable drugs. In 2005 the United People's Freedom Alliance Government promised to establish a National Medicinal Drugs Policy (NMPD) that would enable Sri Lankans significantly to cut down on drug expenses and get quality drugs at affordable prices while saving billions of rupees in foreign exchange for the country. Implementation of the NMDP could reduce the number of drugs imported, prescribed and sold in Sri Lanka to about 350 varieties. Bibile's contribution to development in the area of drugs was acknowledged publicly during the 35th World Health Assembly, in Geneva in May 1982. It is widely regarded in his home country of Sri Lanka that the threat he posed to the powerful drugs Multi-nationals may have had some bearing on his premature and mysterious death in 1977 while on a UN assignment in Guyana to introduce these policies there.http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/EditorialReviews/erev200106/20010614editorialreview.html See Wikileaks information on Dr Bibile's drug policy and the United States https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/wikleaks-americans-sabotage-senaka- bibiles-pharmaceutical-policy/ === Politics === He was a Trotskyist and a member of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party, becoming Treasurer of its Youth Leagues. He conducted study classes on Marxism at his house in Castle Street, Colombo. At the height of the language issue crisis, when the LSSP stood for both Sinhala and Tamil being state languages, he agreed to contest a by- election for a seat on the Colombo Municipal Council as the LSSP candidate, to fight for that principle, risking his life in the process and facing certain defeat in an atmosphere of ethnic animosity. In the mid-1950s, he, together with Herbert Keuneman, 'Bonnie' Fernando, Anil and Jeanne Moonesinghe and other members of the radical intelligentsia founded Sri Lanka's first co- operative housing scheme, the Gothatuwa Building Society. This led to the foundation of the Welikadawatte housing estate, which attained some fame as an island of intellectual creativity. == Publications == Dr Bibile has over 45 publications, including: *Bibile, S, and Lall, S, 'The Political Economy of Controlling Transnationals: The Pharmaceutical Industry in Sri Lanka (1972–76)', World Development, August 1977. == Oration == An oration is held every year in commemoration of Senaka Bibile, under the auspices of the Kandy Society of Medicine. == References == *Prof. Carlo Fonseka, 'How many doctors remember the wonderful work of Bibile?', Daily Mirror Online, 4 October 2002 *Prof. Tissa Vitarana, The Sri Lankan who challenged global giants * Dr. K Balasubramaniam, The neglected solution * Include Medicinal Drugs Policy in Polls Manifesto ==External links== *State Pharmaceuticals Corporation of Sri Lanka *'Breakthrough – and Bibile lives again, LankaNewspapers.Com *'National Medicinal Drug Policy', Weekly Epidemiological Report, Vol 32 No 41, 08 – 14 *'Who was Senaka Bibile, LankaNewspapers.Com, October 2005 (PDF) *33rd commemoration day of Prof. Senaka Bibile Category:1920 births Category:1977 deaths Category:Sri Lankan Buddhists Category:Sinhalese academics Category:Lanka Sama Samaja Party politicians Category:Pharmaceuticals policy Category:Sri Lankan pharmacologists Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh Category:Academics of the University of Peradeniya ","title":"Seneka Bibile"},{"id":"3250900","text":"Dark Adventure is a dimetric action-adventure game produced by Konami that was released for the arcades in North America in 1987. It was the first arcade game by Konami that allowed up to three players simultaneously. The game was also released as in Japan and as Devil World in other countries outside North America, although these versions feature significant gameplay differences and only allow up to two players. ==Plot== An archeologist named Dr. Condor discovers the coffin of a demon in ancient ruins. During a press conference announcing his discovery, he decides to open the coffin for the first time, only to be transported into another world alongside a reporter named Labryna and another archeologist named Zorlock. The three heroes must now fight their way out of the Devil World in order to defeat the evil Demon King who is keeping them trapped and return to the human world. ==Gameplay== Labryna battles an enemy. Dark Adventure can be played by up to three players, with a different character assigned to each control panel. Each character starts the game with a different default weapon: Labryna (the leftmost player) wields a sword, Condor (the center player) uses a whip, and Zorlock (the rightmost player) carries a spear. The controls for each player consist of an eight-way joystick to move their character and three action buttons for jumping, attacking and throwing dynamite. The dynamite throw button only works when the player has acquired the required power-up. There's also a map button that can be used by any of the three players. When held, the map button will pause the game and display the location of keys and exits in places explored by the player, although this function is not available in every area. The objective of the game is to pick up the keys and unlock exits until the player has reached the lair of the final boss. There are a total of 40 areas to explore. Enemy creatures include minotaurs, skeleton warriors, swamp monsters, man- eating trees, giant spiders and rats. The game features both limited lives and a health gauge system. The player's health will gradually be drained as time goes by, even when the character is not sustaining any damage from enemies. The player must pick up soft drink cans to keep the health gauge filled and prevent the character from dying. If the player runs out of lives, every key in his or her possession will be dropped along with whatever weapon the character was last carrying, allowing another player to pick it up. Extra lives can be added to the player's stock by inserting more credit into the respective coin slot. In addition to the default weapons, the player can also pick up a flamethrower or a laser gun, allowing the character to attack enemies from a safer distance. Other power-ups include a crystal ball that enhances melee weapons, a necklace that increases the player's walking speed, a shield that reduces the amount of damage taken by enemy attacks, and a magic orb that destroys all on-screen enemies. ==Version differences== The Devil World/Majū no Ōkoku versions of the game feature the following differences from Dark Adventure. * The game can only be played by up to two players, since these versions were made as conversion kits for 2-player cabinets. Zorlock, the third player character, is absent as a result. * The player character uses firearms instead of melee weapons as their default weapons. Labryna uses a bowgun, while Condor wields a pistol. * Three additional firearms can also be obtained in addition to the laser gun and flamethrower. These consist of a machine gun, a shotgun and a bazooka. * Dynamites are now thrown with the standard attack button instead of a dedicated button. This allows the player to use his or her main weapon while throwing dynamites at the same time. * Instead of instant power-ups, the game uses a power-up selection meter similar to Gradius. By picking up blue power orbs, the cursor on the selection meter moves up by one level. When the cursor is on an item that the player wishes to use, he or she can obtain it by pressing the power-up button (which replaces the dynamite throw button). The two player characters have their power-up selection meters arranged differently. * The map displays the whole area rather than just the portions already explored by the player. * The player's health is drained at a much slower rate. * Stages now have a much more linear structure, with almost all of them only having a single key and exit, preventing backtracking to previously cleared areas. The only exception is the thirteenth stage, Metropolis, which has numerous fake exits, including one that leads to the previous boss encounter, and a real exit. Every fourth stage now consists of a boss battle against a recurring two-headed draconic monster. Counting the dragon battles, Devil World/Majū no Ōkoku has a total of 19 stages, in contrast to the 40 stages in Dark Adventure. * Credits cannot be used to add more lives during play. Continues are still allowed after both players run out of lives, but only up to three times per play. Continues will cease to be available once the final stage is reached. * The ending of the game varies depending on certain conditions. One possible ending depicts the player being transported to the top of the Statue of Liberty after defeating the final boss (this is the only ending featured in Dark Adventure). The other ending shows the player stranded in the middle of the sea atop a floating raft. * Devil World gives out points by the single or double digits, whereas Dark Adventure and Majū no Ōkoku have those same values multiplied by the hundreds. == Reception == In Japan, Game Machine listed Dark Adventure on their December 1, 1987 issue as being the fifteenth most-successful table arcade unit of the year. ==References== ==External links== * Majū no Ōkoku flyer at The Arcade Flyers Archive * Dark Adventure flyer at The Arcade Flyers Archive Category:1987 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Arcade-only games Category:Konami games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Cooperative video games Category:Video games with alternate endings Category:Konami arcade games ","title":"Dark Adventure"},{"id":"3250917","text":"The Free African Society, founded in 1787, was a benevolent organization that held religious services and provided mutual aid for \\"free Africans and their descendants\\" in Philadelphia. The Society was founded by Richard Allen and Absalom Jones. It was the first Black religious institution in the city and led to the establishment of the first independent Black churches in the United States. Founding members, all free Black men, included Samuel Baston, Joseph Johnson, Cato Freedman, Caesar Cranchell, James Potter and William White. Notable members included African American abolitionists such as Cyrus Bustill, James Forten, and William Gray. == Background == The Free African Society (FAS) developed as part of the rise in civic organizing following American independence in the 1776 to 1783 Revolutionary War; it was the first black mutual aid society in Philadelphia. The city was a growing center of free blacks, attracted to its jobs and other opportunities. By 1790, the city had 2,000 free black residents, a number that continued to increase.\\"Philadelphia\\", Part 3: 1791-1831/\\"Brotherly Love,\\" Africans in America, 1998, PBS, accessed 16 March 2012 In the first two decades after the war, inspired by revolutionary ideals, many slaveholders freed their slaves, especially in the Upper South. Northern states largely abolished slavery. Numerous freedmen migrated to Philadelphia from rural areas of Pennsylvania and the South; it was a growing center of free black society. In addition, their numbers were increased by free people of color who were refugees from the Haitian Revolution in Saint-Domingue, as well as fugitive slaves escaping from the South. == Early years: 1787 to 1792 == The FAS was founded in the spring of 1787 in Philadelphia, shortly before the Constitutional Convention was held in the city. Richard Allen, a Methodist preacher, and Absalom Jones rejected the second-class status blacks were forced into at their white- dominated Methodist church. As their numbers had increased, the church congregation had built a gallery where it asked them to sit separately from the white congregation. The men and their supporters wanted to create an independent group to meet African-American needs. They designed the Free African Society as a mutual aid society to help support widows and orphans, as well as the sick or unemployed. They supported the education of children, or arranged apprenticeships if the children could not attend one of the free schools that were developed. The FAS provided social and economic guidance, and medical care. It also helped new citizens establish their new sense of self-determination. While teaching thriftiness and how to save to build wealth, it became the model for banks in the African-American community. It sought to improve the morals of its members by regulating marriages, condemning drunkenness and adultery. Working with the city, it acquired land at Potter's Field for a burying ground; it began to perform and record marriages and also to record births for the people of its community. To encourage responsibility and create a common aid fund, the FAS asked members to pay dues of one shilling per month. If they failed to pay dues for three months, they were cut off from the society, no longer able to share in its benefits. The dues collected were the fund for the community service projects that the FAS organized. Among these was a food program to help support the community's poor and widowed. == Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1793 == In aid to the sick, the FAS became famous for its members' charitable work as nurses and aides during the Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1793, when many residents abandoned the city. The doctor Benjamin Rush believed African Americans were immune to the disease. He wrote an open letter in the newspaper, under the pseudonym of a well-known Quaker who helped educate blacks, and appealed to blacks to aid others in the city during the epidemic.American Daily Advertiser, September 2, 1793. Allen and Jones decided to respond, together with other members of the FAS who served both black and white residents as nurses and aides during those terrible months. After all their work, Allen and Jones wrote a memoir about the events, which they published the following year, A Narrative of the Proceedings of the Black People during the late awful calamity ... They were trying to set the record straight and defend themselves against an accusatory pamphlet published by Mathew Carey, after he had fled the city for much of September 1793. He accused blacks of charging high prices for nursing, taking advantage of whites, and even of stealing from them during the epidemic. His pamphlet was entitled A Short Account of the Malignant Fever (1793). Allen and Jones noted that it was whites who charged high rates for nursing during the crisis. == 1794 to early 1800s == Many members who wanted more religious affiliation followed Absalom Jones when he founded the African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas. It opened its doors in 1794 as the first Episcopal church for blacks. Numerous members had come from the South, where they had belonged to the Anglican Church before the war. In 1804, Jones was the first black to be ordained as an Episcopal priest in the United States. Richard Allen and others who wanted to continue as Methodists founded the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), which also opened the doors of its first church building in 1794. While an independent congregation, it was still affiliated with the regional and national Methodist Church. Allen was ordained as a Methodist minister. To achieve full independence from white supervision, in 1816 Allen brought several regional AME congregations together and founded the first fully independent black denomination, the AME church. They elected him as the first bishop of the AME Church. The Free African Society also played a role in educating blacks, starting with a class in reading in 1795 at a Sunday school at Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME Church). In 1803, Cyrus Bustill opened a school for black children in his home, and a year later, Absalom Jones opened another school. By 1837, with financial help from the Quakers and the Pennsylvania Abolition Society, ten private schools for blacks were operating in Philadelphia. ==Preamble and articles of the association== == See also == *Benefit society *Free African Union Society, Newport, Rhode Island *Garrison Literary and Benevolent Association, New York City == References == ==Further reading== * Boyd, Herb. of a People: Three Centuries of African American History Told by Those Who Lived It, New York: Doubleday, 2000, collection of primary source documents *Johnson, Charles, Patricia Smith, et al., Preamble with link for text for Free African Society, Part 3: 1791-1831/\\"Brotherly Love,\\" Africans in America, 1998, PBS, WGBH Educational Foundation *\\"The Free African Society of Philadelphia\\", DocStoc Category:African Methodist Episcopal Church Category:African-American history in Philadelphia Category:Nondenominational Christian societies and communities Category:Organizations established in 1787 Category:Organizations based in Philadelphia Category:African-American history of Pennsylvania Category:Ethnic fraternal orders in the United States Category:American abolitionist organizations Category:African Americans' rights organizations Category:African American Benevolent Associations ","title":"Free African Society"},{"id":"3250922","text":"Lawrence of Aquilegia (Lorenzo di Aquileia) was a thirteenth-century Italian canon and teacher. He is best known for his treatises on the ars dictaminis—the medieval art of letter writing. Lawrence’s major works found inspiration in Ciceronian rhetoric but introduced a new phatic element to writing and include the Summa dictaminis edita iuxta doctrinam Tullii and the Practica sive usus dictaminis edita ad utilitatem rudium. The Practica is his most popular work and characterizes his pragmatic, phatic approach to letter writing through the use of tables. ==Biographical information== In Cividale del Friuli in the northern Italian diocese of Aquilegia, Lawrence was born sometime before 1250. After studying the arts at Bologna (the hub of dictatorial study), he returned home and became canon of Aquilegia. As canon, Lawrence worked closely with the patriarchate, starting in 1269, where he assisted at the promulgation of the will of the recently deceased Patriarch of Aquilegia. Lawrence worked with the patriarchate until 1304, making notable appearances in the train of patriarch-elect Philip of Carinthia in 1270 and at patriarch Raimondo della Torre’s generale colloquium in 1274 (Jensen 1973). Aside from his civic duties, Lawrence was a respected traveling teacher. He began his teaching career in the early 1280s, where medieval scholars propose he traveled first to Bologna, then sojourned in Rome, Toulouse, and Orléans (Jensen 1973). In the late 1290s, Lawrence gained popularity as a teacher in the faculty of arts at Paris. It was here that he wrote his first treatise, Summa dictaminis, and delivered it to the assembled university. The composition was well received, marking his position as a distinguished dictatores (or orator) and writer on the art of letter writing (Jensen 1973). His popularity rose with his continued writing, and copies of his eight manuscripts on the theory and application of the dictaminal style were widely circulated. Along with writing manuscripts, Lawrence combined his civic and teaching career, composing letters on behalf of the university at Paris. His most significant letter was addressed to the pope, requesting a studium of Greek, Arabic, and Tartar be established (Jensen 1973). After a distinguished academic and civic career, scholars assume Lawrence died of old age sometime after 1304. ==Works== ===Summa dictaminis edita iuxta doctrinam Tullii=== Lawrence’s first work, written at Paris and dated between 1298 and 1302, the treatise borrows from Cicero’s De inventione and the Rhetorica ad Herennium as well as from fellow dictatores Buoncompagno’s Rhetorica novissima (Jensen 1973). In the first of the treatise’s eight main parts, Lawrence defines the basic concepts related to dictaminal writing: orator, rhetor, dictatores, and dictamen. He concludes by defining the letter and its parts. Parts two through six concern a detailed description of each of the five parts of a letter: salutation, exordium, narrative, petition, and conclusion. Of the five parts, the description of the salutation is the longest, which is not surprising given the medieval preoccupation with social levels (Jensen 1973). In parts seven and eight, Lawrence concludes his work with the colours of rhetoric and strategies for embellishment, respectively. ===Summa dictaminis breviter et artificiose composita secundum stilum Romane curie et consuetudinem modernorum (undated)=== Also written at Paris, this second work is simpler and shorter than his first. Lawrence intended the work for “novices eager to learn dictamen” (Jensen 1973), and its simplicity contributed to its popularity. Like its predecessor, this work defines dictamen and the five parts of the letter—known as the “Approved Format” of the time (Murphy 1974). Again, the bulk of the work concerns the salutation, with thirty-seven chapters devoted to salutations for different social levels (i.e. writing to the Pope, writing to a king, writing to a farmer, writing to a scholar). Lawrence covers the other parts of the letter only briefly. He ends his work with a discussion of stylistic vices. ===Practica sive usus dictaminis edita ad utilitatem rudium (undated)=== Lawrence’s most popular work arranges forms of address to people of various social levels in tabular form. Seven tables (one for each class of persons) offer examples of salutations, narratives, petitions, and conclusions (see images 1 and 2 below). The Practica’s formulaic, pragmatic approach to letter writing not only contributed to its popularity but also represents the “mechanistic dead end” (Perelman 1991) of the ars dictaminis. By following the tables, anyone “capable of copying individual letters of the alphabet” (Murphy 1974) could compose a letter to an addressee of a particular social class. The Practica “struck a responsive chord” (Murphy 1974), as no formal artistic training or rhetorical command of language was necessary to write a letter following Lawrence’s tables. Image 1: Lawrence of Aquilegia, Practica sive usus dictaminis. Oxford, Bodleian Library Ms. Lyell 13, fol. 256 in Murphy 1974. Image 2: Printed text taken from the Practica (Murphy 1974). ===Tractatus super diversis modis componendi epistolam; Ars narrandi, petendi, et concludendi; Speculum dictaminis super diversis litterarum formis; Theorica dictaminis (all undated)=== These four works represent shortened or excerpted versions of Lawrence’s previous treatises. Some scholars ascribe these works to John of Bondi, believed to be Lawrence’s pupil, but it was regular practice for dictatores to compose different versions of the same manuscript (Murphy 1974). ===Letters=== To model the epistolary style to students and to complement his treatises, Lawrence wrote many letters. The letters exist in two fourteenth-century collections in manuscript form. ==Influence== While Lawrence is known for taking the ars dictaminis to its “mechanistic dead end” (Perelman 1991) and marking its decline, his pragmatic approach marks the corresponding rise of a new movement in Italy: the ars notaria. With the ars notaria, a new class of writers appeared, working as professional secretaries and scribes. These early notaries concerned themselves with documents’ forms and legal documents. With his formulaic approach to the ars dictaminis, Lawrence introduced a pragmatic form in his Practica that “t[ook] the chartistic view to its ultimate point” (Murphy 1974). Furthermore, the Practica marks a shift from content- to form-based writing and emphasizes a “phatic rhetoric of personal and official relations” (Perelman 1991). Unlike the classical rhetorical style concerned with persuasion, Lawrence’s works concern writing for social purposes, as is clear from his extensive treatment of the salutation in his treatises on letter writing (Jensen 1973). Medieval rhetoric scholar, James J. Murphy, stresses the phatic approach characterized by Lawrence’s writing, noting “It is the addressee’s level which determines the nature of the letter, not the subject matter or the level of the writer, or the intentions of the writer” (1974). Lawrence’s applied approach to letter writing also stands as an early ancestor to modern texts on business communication (Perelman 1991). Just as teachers today direct their students to examples of memos and reports in textbooks, Lawrence directed his students to his model letters and tables in the Practica and related texts (Perelman 1991). ==Further reading== *Camargo, Martin.

Takelot III ruled the first five years of his reign in a coregency with his father, according to the evidence from Nile Quay Text No.14 (which equates Year 28 of Osorkon III to Year 5 of Takelot III), and succeeded his father as king the following year. He served previously as the High Priest of Amun at Thebes. He was previously thought to have ruled Egypt for only 7 years until his 13th Year was found on a stela from Ahmeida in the Dakhla Oasis in 2005.Frédéric Payraudeau, \\"Le règne de Takélot III et les débuts de la domination Koushite,\\" GM 198(2004) pp.79-80 ==Reign length== Takelot is attested by several documents: a donation stela from Gurob which calls him \\"The First Prophet of Amun-Re, General and Commander Takelot,\\" a stone block from Herakleopolis which calls him 'the Chief of Pi- Sekhemkheperre' and king's son by Tentsai, Quay Text No.13, as noted above, and Quay Text No.4 which records his Year 6. A graffito on the roof of the Temple of Khonsu which records his Year 7, was long believed to be his Highest Year date. However, in February 2005, a hieratic stela from Year 13 of his reign was discovered by a Columbia University archaeological expedition in the ruins of a Temple at the Dakhla Oasis.Olaf Kaper and Robert Demarée, \\"A Donation Stela in the Name of Takeloth III from Amheida, Dakhleh Oasis,\\" Jaarbericht Ex Oriente Lux(JEOL) 39 [2006], pp.19-37 Their subsequent analysis of this dated document conclusively established this king's identity as Takelot III.Kaper & Demarée, pp.29, 31-33 This document—which measures \\"between 42-48 cm wide; between 47-51 cm high; [and] between 10-16 cm thick\\"—has now been published in JEOL 39 (2006) by Dr. Olaf Kaper and Robert Demarée.Kaper & Demarée, p.22 Part of the abstract for their article is given below: : ...The stela belongs to a group of finds documenting the temple of the God Thoth...[in the western part of the Dakhla Oasis]...during the Third Intermediate Period. One block of temple decoration was found in the name of king Petubastis (I), and the stela under discussion was set up in the temple to which this block belonged. The stela's principal text has five lines, in which the date of the stela is given as Year 13 of Takeloth III (c. 740 BCE), as well as the name of the god Thoth of SA-wHAt, the local deity. The stela records a land donation to the temple on the part of the local governor, chief of a Libyan tribe, and it concludes with a list of eleven priests who are beneficiaries of this donation....Another donation stela erected by the same governor is known from the temple of Seth in Mut (Dakhleh).Kaper & Demarée, JEOL 39 abstract The governor mentioned here is Nes-Djehuti or Esdhuti who appears as the Chief of the Shamin Libyans in both the aforementioned Year 13 stela of Takelot III and also in the Smaller Dakhla Stela.Kaper & Demaree, pp.31-32K.A. Kitchen, The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (c.1100--650 BC), 3rd ed., Warminster: 1996. p.371 The smaller Dakla stela dates to Year 24 of the Nubian king Piye.Jac Janssen, The Smaller Dakhla Stele JEA 54 (1968) pp.166-71 This could mean that Takelot III and Piye were near contemporaries during their respective reigns. It suggested that an important graffito at Wadi Gasus—which apparently links the God's Wife Amenirdis I (hence Shabaka here) to Year 19 of a God's Wife Shepenupet—is a synchronism between a Nubian ruler and an Upper Egyptian Libyan king thereby equating Year 12 of Shabaka to Takelot III (rather than the short-lived Rudamun). This graffito would have been carved prior to Piye's Nubian conquest of Egypt in his 20th Year—by which time both Takelot III and Rudamun had already died. However, new evidence on the Wadi Gasus graffito published by Claus Jurman in 2006 has now redated the carving to the 25th dynastic Nubian period entirely—to Year 12 of Shabaka and Year 19 of Taharqa rather than to the 23rd dynastic Libyan era—and demonstrates that they instead pertain to Amenirdis I and Shepenupet II respectively based on palaegraphic and other evidence collated by Jurman at Karnak rather than the Nubian Amenirdis I and the Libyan Shepenupet I, daughter of Osorkon III.Claus Jurman, Die Namen des Rudjamun in der Kapelle des Osiris-Hekadjet. Bemerkungen der 3. Zwischenzeit un dem Wadi Gasus- Graffito, GM 210 (2006), pp.69-91 The God's Wife Shepenupet II was Piye's daughter and Taharqa's sister. Jurman notes that no evidence from the innermost sanctuary of the chapel of Osiris Heqadjet at Karnak shows Shepenupet I associated with Piye's daughter, Amenirdis I.Jurman, GM 210, pp.68-91 The Wadi Gasus graffiti were written in 2 separate handstyles and the year date formulas for '12' and '19' were also written differently which suggests that they are unlikely to have been composed at the same time. This means that the Year 19 date cannot be assigned to Takelot III and likely belongs to the Nubian king Taharqa instead. ==Papyrus Berlin 3048== Frederic Payraudeau once noted that Takelot III likely ruled Egypt for a minimum of 14 Years and was presumably the unknown Year 19 Egyptian monarch recorded at Wadi Gasus. He based his interpretation on the evidence of Papyrus Berlin 3048, the only surviving administrative document on papyri for the entire Libyan period. This document, which is explicitly dated to Year 14 of a Takelot Si-Ese Meryamun (i.e., either Takelot II or III), records a marriage contract which was witnessed by Vizier Hor, and 2 Royal Treasurers: Bakenamun and Djedmontuiufankh, respectively. The papyrus has traditionally been assigned to Takelot II since this ruler's highest date is his Year 25, whereas Takelot III's highest unequivocal date was only thought to be his Year 7. The author observed 3 pieces of evidence which, taken together, could have supported the attribution of this papyrus to Takelot III instead. Firstly, Payraudeau stressed that P. Berlin 3048 specifically mentions two Royal treasurers. The fact that 2 treasurers served Pharaoh at the same time is inconsistent with the known facts for the period from the reign of Osorkon II until the early years of Osorkon III at Thebes, when only a single person from one influential family served in this office. They were the descendants of Djedkhonsuiufankh A, who was the Fourth Prophet of Amun under Takelot I: Nakhtefmut A, Harsiese C and Djedkhonsuiufankh C. Djedkhonsuiufankh A's son, Nakhtefmut A, first assumed the office of Royal Treasurer under Osorkon II; then Nakhtefmut A's son, Harsiese C, in turn succeeded him (likely under Takelot II). Finally, Harsiese C's son, Djedkhonsuiufankh C, occupied this office from the end of Takelot II's reign until the early years of Osorkon III's reign under whom he is attested. Since three direct descendants of one powerful family held the office of Royal Treasurer in the period around Takelot II's reign, it is unlikely that Djedmontuiufankh could have intervened in office as early as Year 14 of Takelot II since he was not even connected to this family. Hence, the only other viable candidate for Djedmontuiufankh's master is Takelot III for whom no Royal Treasurer is known with certainty. Secondly, the Vizier Hor who is mentioned in Papyrus Berlin 3048 was thought to be the same person who is named as the father of Vizier Nebneterou in several Nubian and Saite era genealogical documents.Herman De Meulenaere, Le Vizir Nebneterou, BIFAO 86(1986), pp.143-149 This also makes it far more plausible that P. Berlin 3048 belongs to Takelot III since Hor would have served as Vizier only a few years prior to the start of the Nubian Dynasty in Egypt under Piye and would explain his son's later attestations in Nubian and Saite documents. In contrast, Takelot II died long before Piye conquered Egypt in his 20th Year. Finally, the author noted that the Royal Treasurer Djedmontuiufankh, son of Aafenmut II, lists his family genealogy on the opposite side of this papyrus. (Payraudeau: 84-85) This specific list of his family tree is given: Harsiese-->Bakenkhonsu-->Harsiese-->Aafenmut I-->Merkhonsu-->Harsiese--> (name lost) -->Harsiese-->Aafenmut II-->Djedmontuiufankh-->Harsiese. An Aafenmut, a scribe of the Chief Treasurer, was buried under Osorkon I (bracelets on his Mummy bore this king's prenomen). Frederic notes that an identification of this person with one of the listed predecessors of Djedmontuiufankh is certain here since this person functioned as a 'scribe of the Treasury'--a state office with which Djedmontuiufankh's family was intimately linked. However, this Aafenmut was probably Aafenmut I rather than Aafenmut II, Djedmontuiufankh's father, since this person's son could not have lived beyond three family generations (under Takelot I, Osorkon II and the High Priest Nimlot C) from the reign of Osorkon I into Year 14 of Takelot II, as the author notes. Payraudeau also highlights the existence of the funerary stela of a certain Harsiese, son of Merkhonsu, which was found at the Ramesseum and has been stylistically dated to the 9th Century BC in the period around Takelot I or Osorkon II's reign to support his hypothesis that both Aafenmut I and Merkhonsu were direct ancestors of Djedmontuiufankh. As an aside, the author believed that Nile Quay Text No.45—which, according to Gerardus Broekman in JEA 88(2002), records either Year 17, 18 or 25 of an anonymous Theban king who ruled after Shoshenq III—may perhaps be ascribed to Takelot III based on the evidence of Papyrus Berlin 3048.Broekman, pp.170-178 Since Year 13 of Takelot III is now attested, it was possible that the Year 14 date in this document also belongs to his reign, rather than that of Takelot II. However, Payraudeau has since changed his views here and instead assigns this papyrus to Takelot II based on the mention of a certain Harsiese—designated the fourth prophet of Amun—in this document, who is known to have served in office during king Takelot II's reign.Frédéric Payraudeau, Takeloth III: Considerations on Old and New Documents in 'The Libyan Period in Egypt.' Historical and Cultural Studies into the 21st-24th Dynasties: Proceedings of a Conference at Leiden University 25–27 October 2007, G. Broekman, RJ Demaree & O.E. Kaper (eds), Peeters Leuven 2009, p.294 This means that Takelot III's highest date is his 13th year. The fact that the chief of the Shamin-Libyans, a Nes-Djehuti, is attested in the same office in both Year 13 of Takelot III and Year 24 of Piye also shows that the interval between these two kings' dates was close in time; also, it is unlikely that Takelot III ruled Egypt for 19 years since his brother Rudamun succeeded him at Thebes and Rudamun, in turn, was succeeded in this city by king Ini who ruled here for at least 5 years before Thebes fell permanently under Kushite control during Piye's reign.Payraudeau, The Libyan Period in Egypt, p.296 ==Successor== Takelot III was the husband of Irtiubast who is named \\"as a King's Daughter on the coffin of their son, Osorkon G.\\"Aidan Dodson & Dyan Hilton, The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt, Thames & Hudson, 2004. p.227 Another Irtiubast (\\"B\\") appears to be a daughter of the king.Helmut Brandl, with a contribution by Joachim Friedrich Quack, A Bichrome Faience Statuette of Bastet from the Reign of Takeloth III, Tuna el Gebel IV (= Festschrift für Dieter Kessler), Munich 2013, 67-89. https://www.academia.edu/9342683/A_Bichrome_Faience_Statuette_of_Bastet_from_the_Reign_of_Takeloth_III He was ultimately succeeded in power by his younger brother Rudamun, who was another son of Osorkon III rather than by any of his 3 known sons: the Prince/High Priest Osorkon F, a Prince Ihtesamun who is known from the stela of his grandson Ankhfenmut in Croydon Central Library and, finally, the Second Prophet of Amun, Djedptahefankh D who is attested in statue Tübingen 1734 and in stela CG 41006 of his great-granddaughter Nakhtbasteru.Aston & Taylor, pp.132-136 This development suggests that Takelot III must have reached an advanced age to have outlived all of his sons since it was unusual for a brother of a king to assume the throne if the king still had a son who was living.Payraudeau, GM 198, pp.87-88 Traditional Egyptian custom required that the son of a king directly succeed his father. ==References== ==Bibliography== * D.A.

He is a poorly attested pharaoh of this dynasty according to Kenneth Kitchen's seminal book on The Third Intermediate Period of Egypt. Kitchen credits him with a brief reign of about two to three years due to the few contemporary documents known for him. These include a small amount of decorative work done on the Temple of Osiris Heqadjet, several stone blocks from Medinet Habu, and a vase. In recent years, two fragments of a faience statuette bearing Rudamun's name from Hermopolis have been discovered.Perdu, Olivier; \\"Le Roi Roudamon en personne!\\" (\\"King Rudamun in Person!\\"), RdE 53 (2002), pp.151-178. This recent discovery suggests that Radamun managed to preserve the unity of his father's large kingdom in Upper Egypt ranging from at least Herakleopolis Magna to Thebes during his brief reign. Some Egyptologists such as David Aston have argued that Rudamun was the anonymous Year 19 king attested at Wadi Gasus. However, new evidence on the Wadi Gasus graffito published by Claus Jurman in 2006 has now redated the graffito to the 25th dynastic Nubian period entirely (rather than to the Libyan era) and demonstrates that they pertain to Amenirdis I and Shepenupet II based on paleographic and other evidence at Karnak rather than the Libyan Shepenupet I and the Nubian Amenirdis I.Claus Jurman, Die Namen des Rudjamun in der Kapelle des Osiris-Hekadjet.

Broekman in a paper based on Nile Level Text No. 3 which is dated to Year 5 of a Theban king who ruled after Osorkon III.Broekman, Gerard, \\"The Chronological Position of King Shoshenq Mentioned in Nile Level Record No. 3 on the Quay Wall of the Great Temple of Amun at Karnak\\", SAK 33 (2005) However, there are serious doubts among scholars as to whether Nile Level Text No. 3 contained the nomen Shoshenq rather than Takelot. Georges Legrain, who had the first opportunity to survey the Karnak Quay Texts, did not, in his 1898 publication of the Quay Texts, read any royal nomen in this inscription since the stone had already been badly eroded. The stone would have been in even worse condition when Von Beckerath inspected the document in 1953 and assumed the surviving traces on the Text No. 3 referred to a king Shoshenq, rather than a Takelot.http://disc.server.com/discussion.cgi?disc=177754;article=4534;title=The%20Ancient%20Near%20Eastern%20Chronology%20Forum The Ancient Near Eastern Chronology Forum, accessed September 3, 2007 Soon after Rudamun's death, his kingdom quickly fragmented into several minor city states under the control of various local kings such as Peftjaubast of Herakleopolis Magna, Nimlot at Hermopolis, and Ini at Thebes.

The surviving contemporary information from his reign suggests that it was quite brief. ==References== ==Further reading== *Kitchen, K.A.; The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (1100–650 BC) 2nd edition( 1986), Warminster: Aris & Phillips Limited, p. 360\\\\. *Payraudeau, Frédéric; 'Le règne de Takélot III et les débuts de la domination Koushite,' (\\"The reign of Takelot III and the beginning of Kushite control\\") GM 198(2004), pp. 79–90. *Perdu, Olivier; \\"Le Roi Roudamon en personne!\\" (King Rudamun in Person), RdE 53(2002), pp. 151–178 *Olaf Kaper and Robert Demarée, \\"A Donation Stela in the Name of Takeloth III from Amheida, Dakhleh Oasis,\\" JEOL (Jaarbericht Ex Oriente Lux) 39 [2005], pp. 19–37 Category:8th-century BC Pharaohs Category:Pharaohs of the Twenty-third Dynasty of Egypt Category:739 BC deaths Category:Year of birth unknown Category:8th century BC in Egypt ","title":"Rudamun"},{"id":"3250964","text":"Time Crisis is a first-person on-rails light gun shooter series of arcade video games by Namco. The first installment of the series was released in arcades in 1995 and later ported to PlayStation consoles. ==Overview== GunCons were bundled with the console versions of Time Crisis. This is a GunCon for the original PlayStation. The setting of each Time Crisis revolves around a serious threat to usually one nation. However, some games have involved a threat to either the world (Time Crisis II) or the protagonist (Time Crisis: Project Titan). The V.S.S.E. (Vital Situation, Swift-Elimination), a covert organization, must send in its highly skilled agents to eliminate any security threats. The first Time Crisis had three stages with four areas (location where the game starts) each. The second and third installments have three stages, each with three areas. The fourth installment adds a prologue for a total of 4 stages each with three areas (with the exception of the prologue, which has only one area). The fifth installment has an exclusive upgrade kit version of (True Mastermind edition, which is the full version of the game) to double the stages from 3 to 6, with 3 areas that were interconnected with each other, thus there would be no breaks/loadings after clearing an area (with the exception of the final stage, which only has one area). Many of the fighting areas are dangerous situations, such as a steadily capsizing ship or a train dangling off a damaged bridge (as in Time Crisis 3). In the third and fourth installments, supporters from various organizations come in to assist the V.S.S.E. agents, sometimes to aid them in their mission, sometimes to protect their own reputations. Crisis Zone has a different plot. It takes place in the United Kingdom and concerns the S.T.F. (or Special Tactical Force)'s attempt to destroy the U.R.D.A., a terrorist organization. Razing Storm and Time Crisis: Razing Storm, which take place in the near-future, involve an elite task force known as S.C.A.R. (Strategic Combat and Rescue) being sent to a South America country during a revolution to capture and defeat the mastermind who has orchestrated an attack on the United States together with several international military organizations, while battling terrorists and other renegade soldiers and other combatants. ==Games== ===Main series=== ====Time Crisis (1995)==== The first Time Crisis was released for arcades in 1995 and ported to the PlayStation in 1997. It was the first game to support the GunCon light gun peripheral. ====Time Crisis II (1998)==== A two-player sequel, titled Time Crisis II, featured two machines linked together, allowing players to cover each other. Each player dispatches enemies on slightly different routes, creating unique environments to defend themselves on. It was released for the arcades in 1998 and for the PlayStation 2 in 2001. It was the first game to support the GunCon 2 light gun peripheral. ====Time Crisis 3 (2002)==== In 2002, Namco released Time Crisis 3 for arcades and the PlayStation 2. It granted four different weapons available at the start (handgun, machine gun, shotgun and grenade launcher). The ammo of the latter three had to be recharged during play. The home version, released for the PlayStation 2 featured a new side story in which the player can use a sniper rifle during certain scenes. ====Time Crisis 4 (2006)==== In 2006, Time Crisis 4 was released and introduced a refined multi-hiding system (similar to the one featured in Time Crisis: Project Titan) where the player can move the gun in a certain direction to move the character's position in certain areas of the game regardless whether or not the player may hiding or attacking the enemy. A PlayStation 3 version was released in 2007 in the United States and Japan, and in 2008 in Europe and Australia, bundled with the GunCon 3 light gun peripheral. It was notable for introducing a first-person shooter mode to the series. ====Time Crisis 5 (2015)==== Time Crisis 5 was released by Namco in March 2015 in the arcades. It is the first entry in the Time Crisis series to use Epic Games' Unreal Engine. Unlike its predecessors, the game uses two pedals. Namco later announced a True Mastermind edition (真の黒幕編 Shin no kokumakuhen) of the game which was released near the end of August 2015, and includes the second half of the game, consisting of three new stages, for a total of six stages, the largest in the series. ===Other games=== ====Crisis Zone (1999)==== Crisis Zone was released in 1999 in the arcades. While Crisis Zone had similar play mechanics as with Time Crisis, Crisis Zone featured solo play with a fully automatic machine gun (as opposed to the standard pistol, though the pistol can be used later in the remake version), interactive backgrounds, and a different storyline centering on the anti-terrorist tasks of elite S.T.F. trooper Claude McGarren (spelled \\"Croad MacGalain\\" in the arcade version). A PlayStation 2 remake of the title was released in 2004 and turns it into a subtitle of its full name, Time Crisis: Crisis Zone. ====Time Crisis: Project Titan (2001)==== A side story to the first Time Crisis game Time Crisis: Project Titan, was released in 2001 for the PlayStation, featuring a new multi-hiding system. ===Cobra the Arcade (2005)=== Cobra the Arcade is a Japanese spin-off based on the Cobra manga and anime franchise, released for arcades in 2005. The game uses the same gameplay engine as the main Time Crisis series, adding elements such as the \\"Psycho Shot\\" which allows players to lock-on to multiple targets.\\"アミューズメントマシン｜コブラ・ザ・アーケード (Translated) ====Razing Storm (2009)==== In 2009 Razing Storm, was released in the arcades. It was re-released in October 2010 with the title Time Crisis: Razing Storm, for the PS3. This version is known in Japan as Big 3 Gun Shooting and comes packaged with Deadstorm Pirates and the arcade version of Time Crisis 4. All games feature full PlayStation Move and GunCon 3 support. ===Mobile games=== ====Time Crisis Strike (2009)==== Time Crisis Strike was released by Namco in January 2009 for iOS and J2ME. It is a spin-off of Time Crisis 3, with a different story. ====Time Crisis 2nd Strike (2010)==== Time Crisis 2nd Strike was released by Namco in September 2010 for iOS. It is the sequel of the Time Crisis spin-off and the alternate version of Time Crisis 4. It allowed players to use another iOS device as a gun controller via the app iGunCon. It is no longer available for purchase as of March 30, 2015. ==Gameplay== Time Crisis focuses on shooting all on-screen enemies in an area within a specific time limit to continue on to the next area and complete the level. The franchise's distinctive feature is its cover system: the player steps on a foot pedal to have the player character emerge from cover and attack enemies, and releases the pedal to get behind cover, protecting the character from enemy attacks but leaving them unable to shoot. In Time Crisis 5, the pedal has been redesigned as two pedals, one in the left and one in the right, to give the player 2 positions from which to emerge from cover and catch enemies unaware. The player must take cover to reload their standard gun. Time Crisis 3 introduced new weapons: a machine gun, shotgun, and grenade launcher, that have limited ammunition but can be replenished by killing certain enemies. To switch weapons in Time Crisis 3 and 4, the player must press the trigger while behind cover; in Time Crisis 5, a separate button located on the left and right of the gun controller allows the player to switch weapons at any point. The countdown clock prevents the player from remaining behind cover for too long and imposes a time limit to clear the stage of enemies. The player must manage their time in and out of cover to attack enemies on sight, while avoiding being hit by direct shots. In Time Crisis and Project Titan, after the clearance of an area the game adds only a partial amount of time to the overall clock while the timer keeps running down and the game ends if the time reaches zero. In multiplayer installments (starting with Time Crisis II), the clock resets after the player clears their immediate area of enemies, and will deduct 1 life point if it reaches zero. Time Crisis 5 introduces new scenario-specific timed sequences apart from the standard countdown clock where the player must act within a specific timeframe: dodge moments (the player must press the indicated left or right pedal to avoid a hit from incoming debris), a sniper level (killing enemies from concealed positions), and slow-motion target sequences (shooting bullseyes painted on a target before they turn red). ==References== ==External links== *Time Crisis series at MobyGames Category:Bandai Namco Entertainment franchises Category:Rail shooters Category:Video game franchises Category:IOS games Category:Military science fiction video games Category:Light gun games Category:Terrorism in fiction Category:Video game franchises introduced in 1995 ","title":"Time Crisis"},{"id":"3250972","text":"Right to Life Australia is an organisation which advocates consistent life ethic positions in issues such as abortion, euthanasia and stem cell research.

The play is a moral allegory about Mankind, a representative of the human race, and follows his fall into sin and his repentance. Its author is unknown; the manuscript is signed by a monk named Hyngham, believed to have transcribed the play. Mankind is unique among moralities for its surprising juxtaposition of serious theological matters and colloquial (sometimes obscene) dialogue. Along with the morality plays Wisdom and The Castle of Perseverance, Mankind belongs to the collection of the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C. as a part of the Macro Manuscript (so named after 18th century owner Cox Macro). ==Date and provenance== In his critical edition of the play published by the Early English Text Society in 1969, Eccles argues for a date between 1465 and 1470. Wickham, in his Dent edition of 1976, agrees, finally settling on 1470.Wickham (1976, 1, 7). Similarly, Lester, in his New Mermaids edition of 1981, offers between 1464 and 1471.Lester (1981, xiv). Baker and, following his suggestion, Southern agree on a date of 1466.Southern (1973, 23). These arguments are based upon references to coinage in the playtext, specifically the \\"royal\\" and the \\"angel\\", which were minted between 1465 – 1470. The poem certainly dates from the reign of Edward IV of England, and likely has an East Anglian provenance; it was likely \\"intended to be performed in the area around Cambridge and the environs of Lynn in Norfolk.\\"Walker (2000, 258-59). This is evidenced by numerous local place names dispersed throughout the play, including that of Bury St Edmunds, significant for being the home of two former owners of the play: Thomas Hyngman (15th century) and Cox Macro (18th century).Ashley, introduction to Mankind Like Wisdom, Mankind bears a Latin inscription by the monk Thomas Hyngman and the phrase (translated), “Oh book, if anyone shall perhaps ask to whom you belong, you will say, “I belong above everything to Hyngham, a monk.” Eccles, pp. xxviii Similarities between this hand and the text of the play lead scholars to believe that Hyngman transcribed the play.Beadle, pp. 318 However, several textual oddities likely derive from Hyngman's miscopying of the text because he was unfamiliar with it, so scholars do not credit Hyngman with authorship. Along with The Castle of Perseverance and Wisdom, Hyngman's Mankind was acquired by the Reverend Cox Macro in the early 18th century. Macro bound them together somewhat arbitrarily, along with three other non-dramatic manuscripts. Early 19th- century owner Henry Gurney separated The Castle, Wisdom, and Mankind from the other manuscripts and bound them together as a collection in a separate volume. In August of 1936, Joseph Quincy Adams, the Director of the Folger Shakespeare Library, purchased this manuscript along with Wisdom and The Castle from the antiquarian firm Bernard Quaritch for £1,125 (approximately $5,625).[4] The manuscripts had been purchased by Quaritch earlier in 1936 at a Sotheby's auction on March 30thSeymour de Ricci, Census of Medieval and Renaissance Manuscripts in the United States and Canada, ii (New York, 1937), p.2272 for 440 pounds. ==Synopsis== The play is a moral allegory about Mankind, a representative of the human race, and follows his fall into sin and his repentance. The audience is instructed in the proper Christian life by watching Mankind's fall and redemption. The play begins with Mercy, who instructs the audience in how they should behave but is soon interrupted by Mischief (whose name indicates, in fifteenth-century English, something much more serious than the 'prank' it means now). Mischief mocks Mercy's preaching. A page is then missing in the manuscript. When the play resumes, Mischief has departed and New Guise (i.e., 'Fashion), Nowadays (i.e. 'living for today') and Nought (i.e. 'nothingness') are on stage. They continue the mockery of Mercy. After their exit, Mercy again addresses the audience, explaining why the three are evil and urging the audience to not follow their example. Mankind enters, and addresses the audience, introducing himself. He is a farmer, and is resolved to live a virtuous life. Mercy instructs Mankind about how to continue in this goal, warning him specifically about Mischief, New Guise, Nowadays and Nought. But Mankind has to stand against temptation on his own, and so Mercy leaves. New Guise, Nowadays and Nought return to tempt Mankind. First, they encourage the audience to join in with a scatological song. Then they turn their attention to Mankind, but he successfully resists their enticements and beats them off with his spade. Mischief returns and conspires with New Guise, Nowadays and Nought to bring in a greater devil, Titivillus. But first, they demand that the audience pay money before they can see Titivillus. When the audience does so, Titivillus enters, and begins immediately making Mankind's life difficult. The audience can see him, but he is invisible to Mankind. He hardens the ground, making it hard to farm. He steals Mankind's seed and spade. He induces a need to urinate. He distracts him from his prayers. Finally Mankind becomes so frustrated that he gives up and goes to sleep, and Titivillus whispers to him that Mercy is dead. Through his scene, Titivillus implores the audience to keep silent and watch him, which makes the audience complicit in his actions. Thus deluded, Mankind rejects Mercy and goes to join New Guise, Nowadays and Nought. But now their full evil is revealed. Mischief has been in jail, and has escaped, robbed the jailer, and raped his wife. New Guise has narrowly escaped hanging. Nowadays has robbed a church. The three have Mankind swear vows to join their gang, vows which also show their depravity—to be a highway robber, to seduce women, to 'rob, steal, and kill as fast as you may go' (708). When they leave, Mercy returns to plead with the audience about the unreliability of Mankind, and to pray for his redemption. The three reveal to Mankind that Mercy is not really dead, and tempt him to kill himself rather than face Mercy. But Mercy chases them away. The final struggle for Mankind's redemption is with himself. Mercy tells him all that he must do to be forgiven is to ask, but Mankind finds this difficult and raises a series of objections. The theology of the ending focuses on perseverance, on living as a Christian even while continuing to sin, even while trying not to, and having to repeatedly ask for mercy for those offences. Mankind finally accepts Mercy, and then promptly tries to blame the devils for his problems, but Mercy reminds him that he warned Mankind about them. For the play ends with Mercy addressing the audience again, exhorting them to repentance. ==Themes== Like other moralities, Mankind dramatizes the struggle over humanity between the forces of good and evil. Within this larger thematic structure, scholars have been fascinated by the comedic and potentially subversive tone of the play. The play is interested in the humor of transgression – five out of seven speaking roles are comic villains, making Mankind the lightest and most colloquial of the Macro plays.Spivack, p. 123 At the same time, the play places a remarkable emphasis on language. Greene argues that Titivillus and the vices under his command reduce Mankind to the level of a dumb beast, lost and on the brink of damnation, by drawing him into their perverse, topsy-turvy distortions of language.Greene, p. 77 In his introduction to Furnivall's edition, Pollard writes that the \\"low tone\\" of the play is due to its nature as an economic venture, since the tone appealed to the largely uneducated common audiences for whom players performed.Pollard, in the introduction to Furnivall's The Macro Plays Eccles notes that Mankind is the first English play to \\"mention gathering money from an audience\\".Eccles, p. xlii Indeed, the play calls for a relatively significant amount of audience participation, as in the scene where New Guise, Nowadays and Naught cajole the audience into singing obscene carols with them. Ashley notes that in this way, \\"the audience itself is tricked into complicity with the devil’s machinations against Mankind.\\" ==Notes== ==References== *Ashley, Kathleen, ed. Mankind.

In Reverie was released in mid-September through DreamWorks. Shortly after its release, DreamWorks was absorbed by Interscope Records, resulting in the band being dropped from the label. ==Background and recording== In July 2001, Saves the Day released Stay What You Are through independent label Vagrant Records. The album's first single, \\"At Your Funeral\\", became the band's breakthrough hit. The album would go on to sell over 120,000 copies by early 2002. Frontman Chris Conley was, according to Gigwise's David Renshaw, \\"hailed as a hero with his lyrics about broken hearts and relationships.\\" Line-up changes soon occurred: drummer Bryan Newman and guitarist Ted Alexander left the group. Conley, who had previously written songs on guitar, began playing it in the group. Newman was replaced by Face to Face drummer Pete Parada. In February 2002, the group were rumoured to have signed with major label Interscope Records. In January 2003, the group was doing pre-production in Los Angeles. They were reportedly working on 18 songs. Prior to recording, the group wished to \\"capture the songs\\" as best as they could, according to Conley. Recording took place at Larrabee Studios East and Cello Studios with producer Rob Schnapf and engineer Doug Boehm. The pair were assisted by engineer Jeff Moses at Larrabee Studios East and by engineer Steven Rhodes at Cello Studios. Richard Barron played organ on \\"Rise\\", \\"Monkey\\" and \\"Tomorrow Too Late\\". Schnapf played the tambourine on \\"Driving in the Dark\\". Rhodes performed various percussion instruments on the recordings. Reed Black contributed a number of instruments to different tracks: electric piano (\\"Anywhere with You\\", \\"Monkey\\", \\"In My Waking Life\\" and \\"She\\"), grand piano (\\"Rise\\"), mellotron (\\"She\\" and \\"Wednesday the Third\\") and synth (\\"In Reverie\\"). Schnapf and Boehm mixed the album at The Sound Factory with assistance from engineer Kevin Dean. Ted Jensen mastered the album at Sterling Sound in New York City. Conley later revealed that the group created \\"a record we're proud of\\". Two songs that did not make it on to the album, \\"Shattered\\" and \\"Delusional\\", were re-worked for the group's next album, Sound the Alarm (2006). ==Composition== While working with Schnapf on Stay What You Are, Conley learned that he was writing songs out of his vocal range. He subsequently learned how to sing notes naturally as opposed to forcing them. Conley's voice subsequently changed for In Reverie. Comparing the material to that of Stay What You Are, Conley described the songs as being \\"more harmonically intricate\\" as well as \\"more complicated melodically\\". He said that after getting into the Beatles following Stay What You Are, he learned \\"a bunch of complex chords\\", which influenced his creativity. Despite being credited to the band, Conley wrote all of the songs. Though, he said he was \\"nowhere near [a] dictator\\" and often enjoyed what parts the other members came up with. He added, whenever guitarist David Soloway came up with a part \\"it’s exactly the right thing; it’s more than I could have imagined.\\" Musically, the album has been described as indie rock,Griffin 2006, p. D18 melodic punk, pop and power pop. One day, Conley was playing guitar and came up with the opening riff for \\"Anywhere with You\\". The remainder of the song soon followed. Bassist Eben D'Amico said the track was originally titled \\"Cactus Stomp\\" before it had any lyrics. Conley said it talks about \\"longing for something better — for a feeling of peace or completeness\\". \\"What Went Wrong\\" was written nine to ten months before the group worked on the album. Conley did not think the track was worthy enough, until one morning when he woke up with the song in his head. The song is about a kid who is being strip-searched despite having done nothing wrong. \\"Driving in the Dark\\" is about searching for peace in the world and not in a person. Conley said \\"Rise\\" was about \\"looking around and seeing everyone else trying to buy this or that and thinking it's going to make them happy.\\" Conley mentioned that reverie refers to being in a dreamlike state, and the title- track is about that: \\"...floating through life and trying to figure it all out ... transcending the things you get really pissed off about\\". \\"Morning in the Moonlight\\" talks about joy. \\"Monkey\\" is about filling up empty space with material possessions, despite said possessions still leaving you empty. Conley came up with the melody for \\"In My Waking Life\\" while at his mom's house. The track simply \\"appeared in my mind as if it were a cloud coming over the horizon.\\" \\"She\\" is about being both confused and in love with the various aspects of life. Around the time the band toured with Weezer, Conley was suffering from Crohn's disease, which inspired \\"Where Are You?\\". The track is about \\"taking everything in, the depression, confusion and anxiety, but also the incredible highs.\\" \\"Wednesday the Third\\" is about \\"telling ... off\\" The Man. Conley explained he's \\"drawing a line in the sand and crossing over to the other side, which means I'm done with the past – onward and inward.\\" With \\"Tomorrow Too Late\\", Conley is personifying the feeling of restlessness and the need for peace. ==Release== The forthcoming album was planned to be Saves the Day's final one for Vagrant; they brought in some staff members from major label DreamWorks Records to hear the new songs. The staff enjoyed the songs so much that they proceeded to buy the record from Vagrant. Sometime afterwards, they signed to DreamWorks. Conley reasoned they were under the impression that as the label had no shareholders that interfered in business choices, they were driven by artistic decisions. On June 10, 2003, In Reverie was announced for release. \\"Anywhere with You\\" was released to radio on August 12. Around this time, a music video was filmed for the song in Los Angeles. It features the group performing the song in a recording studio.Santangelo 2003, p. 26 On August 16, the group released an e-card, which included four new songs: \\"Anywhere with You\\", \\"Driving in the Dark\\", \\"What Went Wrong\\" and \\"Where Are You?\\". In Reverie was released through DreamWorks Records on September 16.Sciarretto 2003, p. 5 The album's artwork was done by Brazilian artist Stephan Doitschinoff, who the group met while in the UK in 2002. A few days later, In Honor: A Compilation to Beat Cancer, a tribute to the band's former bassist Sean McGrath, was released featuring an In Reverie outtake \\"Don't Go Outside\\". From mid-September to late November, the group went on a co- headlining US tour with Taking Back Sunday. They were supported by Moneen. Following the band's biggest headlining show at Ashbury Park to 4,000 people, Conley received a call from the band's A&R; person at DreamWorks: \\"[H]e said, 'None of the programmers at radio are biting at the single, and MTV doesn't want to play the video, so we're going have to start thinking about the next record.' I had a total breakdown. I was like, 'How is this possible? The album just came out!'\\" A few weeks after In Reveries release, the label was absorbed by Interscope Records. The staff at Interscope didn't care for the album, refusing to take the group's calls. They subsequently paid the band severance to leave the label. In March and April 2004, the band went on a co-headlining US tour with Grandaddy, with support from The Fire Theft. Dios opened the first half of the tour, while Hey Mercedes opened the second half.

Donated bodies are mostly used for medical education and research. They are used for gross anatomy, surgical anatomy and for furthering medical education. For years, only medical schools accepted bodies for donation, but now private programs also accept donors. Depending on the program's need for body donation, some programs accept donors with different specifications. Body donation is important for understanding the human body and for making advancements in science. There is usually no cost to donate a body to science; donation programs will often provide a stipend and/or cover the cost of cremation or burial once a donated cadaver has served its purpose and is returned to the family for interment. Any person wishing to donate their body may do so through a willed body program. The donor may be required, but not always, to make prior arrangements with the local medical school, university, or body donation program before death. Individuals may request a consent form, and will be supplied information about policies and procedures that will take place after the potential donor is deceased. Anatomical donation is still relatively rare, and in attempts to increase these donations, many countries have instituted programs and regulations surrounding the donation of cadavers or body parts. For example, in some states within the United States and for academic-based programs, a person must make the decision to donate their remains themselves prior to death; the decision cannot be made by a power of attorney. If a person decides not to donate their whole body, or they are unable to, there are other forms of donation via which one can contribute their body to science after death, such as organ donation and tissue donation. == Religion == Many religions show support for anatomical donations. The Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim, and Christian, religions all support the idea of body donation and/or organ donation for the betterment of the world. The support of these religions is critical in many parts of the world as many people actively practice these religions. == India == In 1948, the Anatomy Act was passed in all of India’s states. This allows bodies to be donated by the donor and bodies to be claimed for medical and research use if there is no claim to one’s body within a 48-hour timeframe. Similar to the US, India also has specific guidelines for accepting bodies for donations. Donations that are not deemed suitable include bodies with HIV/AIDS, hepatitis (A, B, and C), donated organs, extreme BMI, or skin diseases. Some leaders have donated their bodies for medical research, such as communist leader Jyoti Basu and Jana Sangh leader Nanaji Deshmukh. Nowadays, many people in India donate their bodies after death by signing a pledge form with two accompanying witness signatures. ==United Kingdom== Body donation in the UK is governed by the Human Tissue Authority (HTA) under the auspices of the Human Tissue Act 2004. The HTA licenses and inspects establishments, such as medical schools, which teach anatomy using donated bodies. Under the Human Tissue Act, written consent must be given prior to death; consent cannot be given by anyone else after death. Human Tissue Authority Body Donation FAQs in the UK The minimum age to consent to donate one's body in the UK is 17. The Human Tissue Authority provides information to donors about where they can donate and answers many prevalent questions related to tissue donation on their website. The Human Tissue Authority provides the links to each establishment’s information, but each establishment has its own guidelines for body donation. The HTA also provides the tools to find donation sites local to the person wishing to donate their body, or tissues. Although most establishments accept most donations, donors who have had an autopsy may be declined from a program. Certain programs also may decline bodies of donors who have died abroad. ==United States== Only the legal next-of-kin of the deceased can provide the necessary consent for donation if the donor did not provide it to the specific accepting program prior to death. Body donation is not regulated through licensure and inspection by the federal government and most states. Body brokers (or non- transplant tissue banks) engage in the acquisition of cadavers, often via offers of free cremation, and then subsequently process the cadaver and resell body parts in a largely unregulated national market.In the U.S. market for human bodies, almost anyone can dissect and sell the dead, Reuters, Brian Grow and John Shiffman, 25 October 2017 The legal right for an individual to choose body donation is governed by the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, which has been largely adopted by most states. Laws relating to the transportation and disposition of human bodies currently apply, regardless of the recent House Bill introduced. The American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB) provides accreditation to non-transplant tissue bank research and education programs to establish that the level of medical, technical, and administrative performance meets or exceeds the standards set by the AATB. Whole body donation and non- transplant tissue banking remains an industry with limited regulation, and while it is not a legal requirement, accreditation allows for individuals choosing to donate their body to medical research or education programs to choose a program with the highest quality standards. The American Medical Education and Research Association (AMERA) is a peer-recognized national accrediting body in the United States that provides accreditation to organizations using standards developed solely for non-transplant organizations. This includes whole body donor organizations, university anatomical programs, bio-repository programs, and end users of human tissue. AMERA encourages the industry to become accredited and involved in establishing standards that are relevant to non-clinical tissue organizations. Many medical programs in the United States now hold student-led memorial services for the donated bodies. This is to show respect for the donors and their families, and to shine a positive light on the process of body donation.Riederer, B. M. (2016), Body donations today and tomorrow: What is best practice and why?. Clin. Anat., 29: 11–18. doi: 10.1002/ca.22641 There are many private body donation programs in the US. Each of these private programs accepts bodies from certain surrounding areas. Most programs also have guidelines for bodies they will and will not accept. Generally, programs will not accept bodies that are positive for Hepatitis (A, B, and C), HIV/AIDS, history of illegal drug use, or fall within an extreme category for their BMI. The embalming process adds even more weight to a donor's body, so if they have a high BMI the programs may not take them because they cannot handle the weight of the donor after embalming. If a donor has a specific disease prior to death, which is not contagious, and would like to be a part of a program’s study they may contact that research program specifically. == Germany == Body disposal and donation are regulated by the Bestattungsgesetze (funeral laws) of the states. In Germany, the right to autonomy extends beyond death, as a result of which the instructions given by a deceased during their lifetime must be respected when dealing with their body. A body donation can only take place if the deceased signed a declaration of last will in their lifetime, stating the intention of donating their body to an anatomical institute. Relatives of the deceased can neither give permission nor deny body donation against said declaration, the institute however may deny the body. Denial of the body may occur if it carries infectious diseases, has had organs or body parts removed for donation or surgery, is gravely injured or otherwise unfit for teaching, if the body is located too far away from the institute or for reasons of storage capacity. Most institutes require an advance fee to be deposited to pay for funeral costs. Marburg University Häufig gestellte Fragen zur Körperspende (FAQ on body donation) (German), retrieved 6 February 2018 == Motives behind the decision == The decision to become a body donor is influenced by factors such as: social awareness, cultural attitudes and perceptions of body donation, cultural attitudes and perceptions of death, religion, and perceptions of the body-mind relationship.Savulescu, J. (2003). Death, Us and Our Bodies: Personal Reflections. Journal of Medical Ethics, 29(3), 127-130. Studies indicate most donors are primarily driven by altruism and their desire to aid the advancement of medical knowledge and to be useful after death.Bolt, S., Venbrux, E., Eisinga, R., Kuks, J. B. M., Veening, J. G., Gerrits, P. O. (2010). Motivation for body donation to science: More than an altruistic act. Annals of Anatomy, 192(2), 70-74. Other reasons include helping future generations, expressing gratitude for life and good health or for the medical field, to avoid a funeral or to avoid waste.Bolt, S., Venbrux, E., Eisinga, R., Kuks, J. B. M., Veening, J. G., Gerrits, P. O. (2010). Motivation for body donation to science: More than an altruistic act. Annals of Anatomy, 192(2), 70-74. The offering of financial incentives as a way to increase donor numbers or as an acknowledgement for donors is generally considered to detract from the act of donation and serve as a deterrent.Ajita, R. & Singh, I. (2007). Body Donation and Its Relevance in Anatomy Learning – A Review. Journal of the Anatomical Society of India, 56(1), 44-47. However, a US study showing a positive correlation between body donation numbers and funeral cover cost savings offered as compensation suggests that, in reality, the added incentive could be a persuasive factor for donors.Harrington, D. E. & Sayre, E. A. (2007). Paying for Bodies, But Not for Organs. Regulation, 29(4), 14-19. == Use of donors == Bodies donated to any organization are used for scientific research and medical training. Bodies are used to teach medical students anatomy, but they are also used to improve and create new medical technologies. Many programs that accept body donations have specific research affiliations, these can be viewed by looking at each programs website. These can include cancer research, Alzheimer’s research, and research into improving surgeries. Listed below are examples of research conducted with donated bodies: * Arthritis * Cancer * Cardiovascular Diseases * Diabetes * Hip Replacement * Knee Replacement * Neurological Conditions * Paramedic Training * Shoulder Replacement * Spinal Disorders * Tumor Removal Some programs accept whole bodies but distribute different body parts based on need. This ensures a maximum benefit from each donation. These programs can assist with research as shown above, technical training, or improvement/research of medical devices. After bodies are accepted for donation, a timeframe of six months to three years is expected before the donor's body will be returned to the family. This takes into account embalming, research, and the number of bodies the program has access to at the time. == References * Category:Medical donations Category:Medical aspects of death Category:Transplantation medicine Donation ","title":"Body donation"},{"id":"3251008","text":"Khaksari flag The Khaksar movement () was a social movement based in Lahore, Punjab, British India, established by Allama Mashriqi in 1931, with the aim of freeing India from the rule of the British Empire and establish a Hindu-Muslim government in India. The membership of the Khaksar movement was open to everyone and had no membership fee regardless of the person's religion, race and caste or social status. The emphasis was on the brotherhood of mankind and being inclusive for all people. ==History== Khaksars in uniform Khaksars in Hyderabad Around 1930, Allama Mashriqi, a charismatic Muslim intellectual whom some considered to be of anarchist persuasion, revisited the principles for self-reform and self-conduct that he had laid out in his 1924 treatise, entitled Tazkira. He incorporated them into a second treatise, Isharat, and this served as the foundation for the Khaksar movement, which Roy Jackson has described as being \\"... essentially to free India from colonial rule and to revive Islam, although it also aimed to give justice and equal rights to all faiths.\\" They took their name from the Persian words khak and sar, respectively meaning dust and life and roughly combined to translate as a \\"humble person\\".Profile of The Khaksar Movement on storyofpakistan.com website Retrieved 19 January 2018 Adopting the language of revolution, Mashriqi began recruiting followers to his cause in his village of Ichhra near Lahore. An early report said that the movement began with 90 followers. It quickly expanded, adding 300 young members within a few weeks. By 1942 it was reported that the membership was four million and Jackson remarks that it was \\"phenomenal in its success.\\" There was also an associated weekly newspaper called Al-Islah. On 4 October 1939, after the commencement of the Second world war, Mashriqui, who was then in Lucknow jail, offered to increase the size of the organisation to help with the war effort. He offered a force of 30,000 well-drilled soldiers for the internal defence of India, 10,000 for the police, and 10,000 to provide help for Turkey or to fight on European soil. His offer was not accepted. Due to the movement's rigid manifesto and strict policies to adhere to their own ideology, it often came into conflict with the ruling British government. Allama Mashriqi and some of his followers spent much time in British government's jails. Mashriqi was kept in jail without any legal proceedings. In protest, he had fasted to the point of death. Mashraqi was released from Vellore Jail on 19 January 1942, but his movements were restricted to Madras Presidency. He remained interned until 28 December 1942. Mashraqi arrived in New Delhi on 2 January 1943.Syed Shabbir Hussain, Al- Mashriqi: The Disowned Genius, 1991, page 180, Publisher: Jang Publisher, Lahore, Pakistan. The Khaskar Movement was vocal in its opposition to the partition of India, and instead favored a united India. During the partition itself, the Khaksars took a vow to do what they could to protect those in distress; this resulted in many lives being saved, including Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims. In one incident, a Khaksar volunteer entered a local colony near Rawalpindi to calm people down, but was stabbed to death. Allama Mashriqi disbanded the Khaksar Tehrik on 4 July 1947 considering that the Muslims of India were more than satisfied after the newly revived hope of a new separate Muslim state i.e. Pakistan and he felt that they had lost much of their motivation which could meet the requirements of the Khaksar movement. Khaksar movement's declared objectives of unity of India regardless of religion eventually came in conflict with All India Muslim League's and Muhammad Ali Jinnah's objectives of Two-nation theory based on the religions of Hindus and Muslims of British India. A significant number of the Indian Muslim population gravitated to the formation of a separate Muslim nation and thus helped create Pakistan in 1947. In October 1947, after the creation of Pakistan, Mashriqi founded the Islam League. Khaksar Tehrik was later revived as a civilian political group after his death on 27 August 1963 at Lahore and it sometimes made political alliances with other Pakistani political parties, for example, it joined the Pakistan National Alliance in 1977. ==Ideology== \\"Al-Islah\\" (Khaksar Tehrik weekly) ===Twenty-Four Principles=== Mashriqi had said in 1931 that the Khaksar movement had three distinct objectives; \\"to emphasize the idea of superiority of God, unity of the nation and service to mankind\\". In addition, Mashriqi outlined twenty-four principles on 29 November 1936 in an address to a Khaksar camp at Sialkot. This initial speech and subsequent set of principles laid out by the movement founder, encouraged members of the movement to serve the people regardless of their caste or religion; and Khaksars were expected to convince others to join the movement through \\"love and affection\\". ===Fourteen Points; The Khaksar Creed=== On 14 March 1937, Allama Mashriqi again addressed a camp of Khaksars at Lahore to further clarify the fourteen points that became the foundation of the movement. These points solidified the notion that the movement was both dictatorial and militaristic. In other words, the movement founder Allama Mashriqi was mainly shaping the policy guidelines. The organization was set up in a way where Allama Mashriqi was the Khaksar-e-Azam (the biggest khaksar) with an advisory council but Allama could overrule any advice. He was entitled to remove any movement member from the organization while there was no procedure to remove him. At this point, its aims were to establish self-rule in India. However the success of Muslim rule in India necessitated certain conditions, such as: \\"(a) \\"regard for the religious and social sentiments of the various communities that live in British India: (b) maintenance of their particular culture and customs, and (c) general tolerance\\". The volunteers of the Khaksar movement were expected to participate daily in military parade and social work. They were seen drilling and parading in playgrounds, streets and neighborhoods wearing khaki uniforms with spades on their shoulders. The movement workers were required to bear their own expenses and find spare time for work of social welfare in the community. ==Khaksar symbols== All members, regardless of rank, wore the same uniform; a khaki shirt with khaki pyjama secured with a belt, together with military boots. The khaki colour was chosen because it was \\"simple and unassuming\\" and \\"cheap and available for all\\", although in practice the uniforms were paid for by the Khaksar organisation. They wore a red badge (akhuwat) on their right arm as a symbol of brotherhood. On their heads Khaksars wore the white handkerchief of the Arabs and Hajis, consisting of a white cloth the length and width of one and one-half yards which was secured around the head with a cotton string. Some Khaksar's wore the Pashtun style turban on their head with the cloth flowing down and a fan shaped shamla peaking up. All Khaksars carried a bailcha (spade) as a sign of unity and strength. In addition the spade represents humility, in the same way that a spade is used to level the ground, the Khaksars used it as a symbol of the \\"leveling\\" of society. In other words, it was meant to be used to level the existing society for equity and equality and remove the existing division among the rich and the poor. The flag of the Khaksars is a modified Ottoman symbol; a crescent moon and a star on a red background. == See also == *All India Azad Muslim Conference *Composite Nationalism and Islam *Hindu–Muslim unity ==References== Notes Citations ==External links== *Pakistan's Freedom & Allama Mashriqi on GoogleBooks ==Further reading== * Category:Political history of Pakistan Category:Political parties in Pakistan Category:Defunct political parties in India Category:Indian independence movement Category:Pakistan Movement Category:Islam in India Category:Partition of India Category:Political terminology in Pakistan Category:History of Lahore Category:India in World War II ","title":"Khaksar movement"},{"id":"3251021","text":"SunSITE (Sun Software, Information & Technology Exchange) is a network of Internet servers providing archives of information, software and other publicly available resources.

When Technology Fails: A Manual for Self-reliance, Sustainability, and Surviving the Long Emergency. White River Junction, VT: Chelsea Green Pub., 2008. 189. Print. based on the earlier Turkish Alker, which is a concrete-like composite with soil of a suitable composition as its bulk component stabilized with about 15% calcined gypsum (plaster of Paris) instead of Portland cement. It can be used to form solid walls that need not be reinforced with a steel frame or timber framing, unless extra seismic reinforcement is necessary. Forms are set up and filled with Cast Earth, which sets quickly and solidly. Once the forms are removed the wall stays sound. Cast Earth is often promoted as an environmentally friendly alternative to cast concrete. The Cast Earth slurry is poured in forms similar to concrete construction and is a suitable alternative to concrete walls in areas prone to hurricane damage. The technology has the potential to be able to compete against traditional wood frame construction in terms of cost. Cast Earth can also be installed with a lot less labor than most green alternatives, such as rammed earth. Since the product is proprietary, installation requires a crew trained by the Cast Earth company, leaving it out of reach of do-it-yourself builders. It is also not cost-effective for contractors unless they do a lot of Cast Earth installations. The calcined gypsum sets quickly. When calcined gypsum is added to soil, the setting time is reduced even further, to mere minutes. Often this quick setting is too fast and a retardant must be added to the mix so it can be poured. In Alker, lime is added to extend working time to 20 minutes. Cast Earth uses another retardant for an even greater working time. This ingredient is proprietary and a carefully guarded secret. When the material is dry, it is similar to adobe in various ways, outperforming it in tensile strength, hardness, and erosion resistance. It also has less tendency to crack and shrink. Some Cast Earth walls do soak up water, however, depending upon the porosity of the earthen materials used. For example, decomposed granite tends to be prone to absorption if the eaves of the roof is inadequate or it is exposed to water for a prolonged time, i.e. days. Limestone materials however, tend to repel water once the walls are completely dried/cured. ==References== ==External links== * http://www.castearth.com/ is the inventor's website Category:Soil-based building materials Category:Masonry ","title":"Cast Earth"},{"id":"3251030","text":"Andrew Trimble (born 20 October 1984) is a former Irish rugby union player who played for Ulster and represented Ireland at international level. == Club career == He attended Coleraine Academical Institution, where he competed in the Ulster Schools Cup. He played at outside centre or on the wing for Ulster Rugby. In April 2006 he signed a new three-year deal with Ulster. Trimble also played club rugby for Ballymena RFC in the AIB League and has represented Ireland Schools and the Ireland U21 team. Due to a pre-season groin injury, however, he required surgery and missed part of the 2007–08 season. He later underwent a hernia operation. On 30 April 2009, Trimble underwent surgery on his right knee to remove a piece of chipped bone. In May 2018, Trimble announced that he would be retiring from rugby at the end of the 2017–18 season. He does however, on occasion, still partake in amateur level competition with his local Coleraine rugby club. == International career == Trimble, replacing the injured Brian O'Driscoll, made his debut for the Ireland national rugby union team during the 2005 IRB Autumn Internationals, against Australia. He started again the following week against Romania, securing victory for the Irish with two tries. Building on his earlier success, Trimble made the 22-man squad for Ireland's 2006 Six Nations Championship opener against Italy. He came on as a second-half replacement to score his third try against France, the following week. In the 2007 and 2008, Trimble was a member of the Ireland team for the 2007 Rugby World Cup, and played both on the wing and in the centre. Due to injuries, he missed both Ireland's 2008 and 2009 summer tours. Trimble has scored test tries for Ireland at the 2011 Rugby World Cup, and the 2012 Six Nations Championship.

Alone in the Dark was released for MS-DOS in 1992, ported for the 3DO by Krisalis in 1994, and ported for iOS by Atari in 2014. Set in 1920s Louisiana, the game challenges the player to guide the player character out of a haunted mansion, advancing by solving puzzles while either banishing, slaying, or eluding various ghosts and monsters. The player can collect and use weapons, manage a weight-based inventory system, and explore a partially nonlinear map. Alone in the Dark received critical acclaim upon its release, and is considered a breakthrough and influential title, as it was the first 3D survival horror game. Among the accolades which followed its release, Alone in the Dark received the European Computer Trade Show awards for Best Graphics and Most Original Game in 1993. In 2009, Empire included Alone in the Dark on their list of 100 greatest video games of all time. Alone in the Dark is considered a forefather of the survival horror genre, and its influence can be seen in the Resident Evil franchise. Alone in the Dark has also spawned four follow-up games as part of the series, as well as two films loosely based on them. ==Gameplay== Carnby opening a trunk at the Derceto mansion Players choose between a male or female protagonist (Edward Carnby or Emily Hartwood respectively), and are then trapped inside the haunted mansion of Derceto. The player character starts in the attic, having ascended to the top of the mansion without incident, and is tasked with finding a way out of the mansion while avoiding, outsmarting or defeating various supernatural enemies including slave zombies and giant bipedal rat-like creatures. Though able to kill most enemies with simply fists and feet, the player character can also find and utilize various weapons. Many opponents can be beaten by solving a particular puzzle rather than a straight fight—indeed, a significant number of opponents cannot be killed at all. Much of the game involves exploration and puzzle-solving, and optionally searching the house for clues as to what occurred before the player's arrival. The player character can search any area, open and close doors, push certain objects, and pick up some items. Items in inventory can be used, opened, read, thrown, or put down, though not all of these options are offered for every item. Inventory is highly limited, and the player must often discard items to make room. It is possible to discard items that are needed to complete the game, but discarded items remain in play and can be retrieved later, even if the player character leaves the room. Available space in inventory is determined by weight, not number of items; for example, a player may discard a book and two knives yet still not be able to pick up the heavy statuette. Unlike its sequels, and much of the survival horror genre, the game is partially non-linear. The player character is initially restricted to the attic and third floor, whose rooms are arranged such that they must be traversed in a linear order. Completing the puzzle at the end of the third floor grants the player character access to the first and second floors. The player can explore the rooms in this area in any order, and can also revisit the attic and third floor if desired. Upon completing a specific puzzle, the player gains access to the caverns beneath the mansion. The caverns are completely linear, and each challenge must be overcome as it is encountered. ==Plot== In 1924, Jeremy Hartwood, a noted artist and owner of the Louisiana mansion Derceto (named after the Syrian deity), has committed suicide by hanging himself. His death appears suspicious yet seems to surprise nobody, for Derceto is widely reputed to be haunted by an evil power. The case is quickly dealt with by the police and soon forgotten by the public. The player assumes the role of either Edward Carnby—a private investigator who is sent to find a piano in the loft for an antique dealer—or Emily Hartwood, Jeremy's niece, who is also interested in finding the piano because she believes a secret drawer in it has a note in which Jeremy explains his suicide. Whether Carnby or Hartwood, the character goes to the mansion to investigate. A monster watches the character approaching the house from the open window. Upon entering the house, the doors mysteriously slam shut behind the player character. He or she continues up to the attic, but is attacked by monsters. The player character progresses back down through the house, fighting off various creatures and hazards. The player character finds documents throughout the house indicating that Derceto was built by an occultist pirate named Ezechiel Pregzt, and that beneath the house are caverns that were used for dark rituals meant to increase Pregzt's fortunes and unnaturally extend his life. Pregzt was shot and Derceto was burned down by encamped Union soldiers during the American Civil War. However, Pregzt's spirit lived on, and his corpse was placed by his servants in an old tree in the caverns underneath Derceto. Jeremy Hartwood committed suicide to prevent his body being used as a host for Pregzt; so Pregzt now focuses on the player character. If the player character is incapacitated, their body is subsequently dragged to a sacrificial area and possessed by Pregzt, whereupon the game ends with an image of supernatural horrors being unleashed from the house into the world at large. The player character finds a passage into the caverns in Hartwood's study, and makes his or her way to the tree where Pregzt resides. The player character hurls a lighted lantern at the tree, then flees the collapsing cavern. Pregzt is consumed by the flames, and the house is purged of supernatural creatures and other effects caused by his influence. The player can finally open the front doors and leave the house, which is also now completely safe to explore (except for physical hazards such as falling to one's death through chasms or rotten floorboards, and two magical books in the library which remain lethal to read without certain precautions). The driver is outside to take the character home; however, the driver is revealed to be a zombie. The zombie then drives the car back to civilization. The story is heavily influenced by the works of Edgar Allan Poe and H. P. Lovecraft. The setting for the story is inspired by Poe's \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\". Grimoires found in the mansion's library include the Necronomicon and De Vermis Mysteriis, both taken from Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. Other Mythos references include books that feature the narrated history of Lord Boleskine, a direct reference to another Infogrames Cthulhu Mythos-based game, Shadow of the Comet, and the last name of player character Edward Carnby, a reference to John Carnby, a character in the mythos tale The Return of the Sorcerer by Clark Ashton Smith. Several of the supernatural opponents are recognizable creatures from the Mythos, including Deep Ones, Nightgaunts and a Chthonian. ==Development and release== In 1989, Frédérick Raynal, a staff programmer at Infogrames, was assigned to port the early 3D game Alpha Waves. Working on the game inspired him to begin programming a tool for the creation and animation of 3D characters, with help from Franck De Girolami. In 1991, Infogrames CEO Bruno Bonnell proposed a game in which the player would use matches to gain snapshot views of an otherwise completely dark environment. An aficionado of horror films such as Dawn of the Dead, Raynal saw in this proposal the opportunity to create a horror-based game, and was given permission to lead the project. The game's working titles included In the Dark Daniel Ichbiah, La saga des jeux vidéo. and Scream in the Dark (or Screams in the DarkComputer Gaming World 99, page 84: \\"Over There: enCore! enCore!\\".). Following Raynal's basic vision for the game, Infogrames artistic director Didier Chanfray rendered a series of concept sketches using white chalk on black Canson paper. These sketches were used for an internal contest to pick the game's graphic artist, Yaël Barroz. By this time Raynal already had decided that the game would make use of text to convey the backstory, as he felt computer graphics at the time were not advanced enough to be frightening on their own.Leigh Alexander, Inside the Making of Alone in the Dark , Gamasutra, March 9, 2012. He had also determined the game's setting: Initially he planned to create the game's backgrounds using scanned photos of an actual mansion built in the 1920s, but this idea proved too ambitious for the 3D rendering tools available, and the team had to use hand-drawn bitmaps instead.Travis Fahs, Alone in the Dark Restrospective, IGN, June 23, 2008. Items and characters in Alone in the Dark are three-dimensional, rendered upon a two-dimensional fixed background. Mixing polygons and 2D prerendered background images required a fixed camera angle, which designers used to their advantage to create dramatic scene setups appropriate for a horror-themed game. In September 1991, the team of Raynal, Chanfray, and Barroz presented an early playable version of Alone in the Dark - containing only a couple rooms - to Infogrames, who then green- lighted production of the game. The development team was expanded to include Franck De Girolami (programmer), Philippe Vachey (composer), Hubert Chardot (writer), and Franck Manzetti (designer). The game briefly acquired the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game license, but was ultimately denied it when Chaosium determined that the game was too simple to do justice to the rules of the pen-and-paper game. The character Emily Hartwood was added because the conventional wisdom of the time was that a game would appeal to more female gamers if it had a female playable character. To maximize the player's anxiety and fear, the game was designed so that even such mundane actions as walking down a hall, opening a door, and reading a book could cause the player character to die. Though such deaths would only occur in select places, they would make the player feel unnerved whenever taking such actions. During the game's production, Raynal and Barroz became romantically involved and conceived a child. Most of the production was marked with a spirit of optimism and creative enthusiasm, but the bug-testing phase wore out the team, especially Raynal. By the time it was released, he felt dissatisfied with almost every aspect of Alone in the Dark and felt certain that all of its flaws would be noticed by players. Outside of Europe, Alone in the Dark was distributed in North America by Interplay Entertainment and in Japan by Arrow Micro-Techs Corp, which developed and published Japanese-exclusive versions for the PC-98 and FM Towns computers. The game was also ported to the 3DO by Krisalis in 1994. This version is largely identical to the original, but uses an orchestrated version of the original soundtrack and adds voice acting to the character intros and documents. This version was also published in Japan by Pony Canyon. An Atari Jaguar CD port was also in development by Infogrames but it was never released. In 2012, when asked for a possible high-definition remake of Alone In The Dark, Raynal said he loved the idea but no attempts have been made yet as he no longer holds the rights to the franchise. ==Reception== By February 1997, Alone in the Dark had sold 600,000 copies. According to the French newspaper Libération, it sold 2.5 million units by January 2000. Alone in the Dark was met with great critical acclaim. Computer Gaming Worlds Charles Ardai praised the game, citing its multiple viewpoints and stating that no previous game had caused him to \\"jump in fright at the slightest sound .. I feel that I have been inside a real house\\". He described the game as \\"truly a diabolical simulation, rich in evil imaginings and unexpected twists\\". In the same issue Scorpia was more critical, citing issues such as books that killed without warning when read. She stated that \\"Alone in the Dark is one of those neat games with some irritating flaws. It sets a good atmosphere ... Using Lovecraftian overtones adds a lot ... The view shifts are a novel and effective addition\\", and concluded that it \\"is a nice change of pace from the usual run of adventure games\\". In 1994 the magazine said that \\"The floppy-based version was simply the best horror game for the computer in years\\", and that the CD version \\"offers better animation and more eerie sounds\\". Reviewing the 3DO version, GamePro described it as \\"a clunky, semirealistic game\\", citing restrictively linear game design, an overly slow- moving player character, and \\"silly-looking, quirky-moving monsters\\", though they did praise the moody sound effects and 3D camera angles. In contrast, Electronic Gaming Monthly commented \\"A faithful translation of the PC title, this game has excellent graphics and sound ... for fans of more deliberate game play, this is the one to get.\\" Next Generation reviewed the 3DO version of the game, and stated that \\"Alone's subtle mix of eerie music, grim animation sequences, and suspense-filled storyline create an atmosphere of tense horror that adds an interesting new twist to the standard graphic adventure.\\" A review for the Macintosh version in Next Generation stated that \\"Eerie, flowing movement and less-is-more polygonal simplicity make this Lovecraft-inspired game all the more creepy.\\" Praising the game's sound effects, balance of action with more cerebral gameplay, and mood-setting camera angles, the reviewer dubbed it \\"A breakthrough game\\". Alone in the Dark won many prestigious gaming industry awards, including the European Computer Trade Show 1993 awards for Best Graphics, Most Original Game and Best French Game of the year, and the Consumer Electronics Show 1993 award for Best Foreign Game.Alone in the Dark: The Official Strategy Guide, Prima Games 1994 (page 9). In 1994, PC Gamer US named Alone in the Dark the 10th best computer game ever. The editors called it \\"without a doubt, one of the most unique and exciting games ever.\\" That same year, PC Gamer UK named it the 31st best computer game of all time, calling it \\"a classic title.\\" In 1996, Computer Gaming World ranked Alone in the Dark as the 88th best video game of all time, adding that it \\"showed that 3D action needn't get in the way of a tense, exciting story\\", also listing the game's Game Over cutscene among the 15 \\"best ways to die in computer gaming\\". In 2005, Game Informer put it on their list of top 25 most influential video games of all time.Game Informer 136 (October 2005). In 2009, Empire included Alone in the Dark on their list of 100 greatest video games of all time for its \\"ingenious approach coming closer than any game had before to photo-realism, and inspiring other developers to experiment with fresh approaches to presentation.\\" In 1998, PC Gamer declared it the 22nd-best computer game ever released, and the editors called it \\"the high-point of the series thanks to its spine-tingling storyline and creepy monsters\\". ==Legacy== Alone in the Dark was supposed to be the first part of Infogrames' Call of Cthulhu series, and later of the Virtual Dreams series (the original French cover included the Virtual Dreams logo), but ended up starting its own franchise. The game was followed by five more games in the series: Alone in the Dark 2 (1993), Alone in the Dark 3 (1994), Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare (2001), Alone in the Dark (2008) and Alone in the Dark: Illumination (2015), and inspired two live-action films Alone in the Dark and Alone in the Dark II. It is widely considered to be a forefather of the survival horror game genre, setting the standard for later rival popular survival horror games such as Resident Evil and Silent Hill. ==ReferencesCategory:1992 video games Category:Infogrames games Category:3DO Interactive Multiplayer games Category:Acorn Archimedes games Category:Alone in the Dark Category:Cancelled Atari Jaguar games Category:Cancelled Sega 32X games Category:Cthulhu Mythos games Category:DOS games Category:FM Towns games Category:Games commercially released with DOSBox Category:Horror video games Category:IOS games Category:Krisalis Software games Category:Mac OS games Category:NEC PC-9801 games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in France Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Video games set in 1924 Category:Video games set in Louisiana Category:Video games with pre-rendered 3D graphics Category:Zombie video games ","title":"Alone in the Dark (1992 video game)"},{"id":"3251051","text":"Megarectum is a large rectum as a result of underlying nerve supply abnormalities or muscle dysfunction, which remains after disimpaction of the rectum.

Zur Vorgeschichte einer Zeitenwende. Sonderschriften des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts, Abteilung Kairo, 31. Berlin/New York: Walter de Gruyter, 2007. pp.49-50 According to the Abbott Papyrus and the Leopold- Amherst Papyrus, which is dated to Year 16 of Ramesses IX, Sekhemre Shedtawy Sobekemsaf was buried along with his chief Queen Nubkhaes in his royal tomb. ==Placement in the 17th Dynasty== The German Egyptologist Daniel Polz, who rediscovered Nubkheperre Intef's tomb at Dra Abu el Naga', strongly maintains that Nubkheperre Intef ruled very late in the 17th Dynasty, which means that Sekhemre Wadjkhau Sobekemsaf (I) cannot have intervened between the Intef line of kings and the Ahmoside family of kings: Senakhtenre, Seqenenre and Kamose. Polz's hypothesis that Nubkheperre Intef ruled late in the 17th Dynasty is supported \\"by the evidence of the box of Minemhat, who was governor of Coptos\\" in Year 3 of Nubkheperre Intefsee the Coptos Decree \\"which was part of the funerary equipment of an Aqher who lived under Seqenenre [Tao].\\"Herbert Winlock, Journal of Egyptian Archaeology 10 (1924) 258 with n.1 & Thomas Schneider, \\"The Relative Chronology of the Middle Kingdom and the Hyksos Period (Dyns. 12-17)\\" in Erik Hornung, Rolf Krauss & David Warburton (editors), Ancient Egyptian Chronology (Handbook of Oriental Studies), Brill, 2006. p.187 This discovery strongly suggests that the reigns of Nubkheperre Intef and Seqenenre Tao were separated by only a few years in time rather than 15 to 20 years at a time when few pharaohs enjoyed long reigns in the 17th Dynasty. The late Middle Kingdom German Egyptologist Detlef Franke (1952–2007) also supported this view in an article which was published in 2008—a year after his death—where he wrote: :Contrary to Ryholt, I see no place for a king Sobekemsaf who ruled [Egypt] after Nubkheperra Antef.Detlef Franke, The Late Middle Kingdom (Thirteenth to Seveenth Dynasties): The Chronological Framework, Journal of Egyptian History, Vol.1 No.2 (2008) Koninklijke Brill, p.279 Ryholt believed that Sekhemre Wadjkhaw Sobekemsaf intervened between the line of Intef kings and the accession of Senakhtenre—the first 17th Dynasty kings from the Ahmoside family line. Polz argues that Sekemre Wadjkhaw Sobekemsaf was instead the father of Sekhemre Shedtawy Sobekemsaf (II) and the grandfather of the Intef kings since a statue of Sekhemre Wadjkhaw Sobekemsaf shows that his eldest son was also named Sobekemsaf as Anthony Spalinger notes.Anthony Spalinger, LÄ, V, 1032. This means that Sekhemre Wadjkhaw Sobekemsaf ruled on the throne before the Intef kings took power early in the 17th Dynasty—and that he would be _Sobekemsaf I_ instead and the father of Sobekemsaf II. Since Sekhemre Shedtawy Sobekemsaf (II) himself is known to be the father of Nubkheperre Intef, this means that both he and Sobekemsaf I ruled Egypt before Sekhemre-Wepmaat Intef and Nubkheperre Intef assumed the throne. Sobekemsaf II would, therefore, be the son of Sobekemsaf I and the father of his two immediate successors: Sekhemre-Wepmaat Intef and Nubkheperre Intef. ==The robbery of Sobekemsaf's tomb== The Abbott and Leopold-Amherst Papyruses, which are dated to Year 16 of Ramesses IX, state that this king's royal pyramid tomb was violated and destroyed by tomb robbers. The confessions and tomb robbery trials of the men responsible for the looting of Sekhemre Shedtawy Sobekemsaf's tomb are detailed in the latter papyrus which is dated to Year 16, III Peret day 22 of Ramesses IX. This document relates that a certain Amenpnufer, son of Anhernakhte, a stonemason from the Temple of Amun Re \\"fell into the habit of robbing the tombs [of noblemen in West Thebes] in company with the stonemason Hapiwer\\" and mentions that they robbed Sobekemsaf's tomb along with six other accomplices in Year 13 of Ramesses IX.Leonard Cottrell, The Lost Pharaohs, Pan Books, London and Sydney, 8th printing:1977, p.135 Amenpnufer confesses that they In his trial, Amenpnufer testifies that he and his companions dug a tunnel into the king's pyramid with their copper tools: Amenpnufer states that the treasures taken from the two royal mummies amounted to \\"160 deben of gold\\" or 32 lbs (14.5 kg).Peter Clayton, Chronicle of the Pharaohs, Thames & Hudson Ltd, 1994, p.171 The document ends with the conviction of the thieves—with a probable death sentence—and notes that a copy of the official trial transcripts was dispatched to Ramesses IX in Lower Egypt. Amenpnufer himself would have been sentenced to death by impalement, a punishment which \\"was reserved for [only] the most heinous crimes\\" in Ancient Egypt.Anton Gill, \\"Ancient Egyptians: The Kingdom of the Pharaohs brought to Life,\\" Harper Collins Entertainment, 2003. pp.176-77 ==References== ==Bibliography== *Kim Ryholt: The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period c.1800–1550 B.C, Museum Tuscalanum Press, 1997. , 393 File 17/2 ==Further reading== * Category:16th-century BC Pharaohs Category:Pharaohs of the Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt arz:سوبيكيمساف الاول yo:Sobekemsaf I ","title":"Sobekemsaf II"},{"id":"3251072","text":"Lawrence Henry \\"Little Dempsey\\" Aurie (February 8, 1905 – December 11, 1952) was a Canadian professional ice hockey right winger who played 11 seasons in the National Hockey League for the Detroit Cougars, Detroit Falcons and Detroit Red Wings. == Playing career == Aurie was considered by owner James Norris as the heart and soul of the Detroit NHL franchise from 1927 through 1938. He was known for his remarkable all-around play, goal-scoring achievements and for being instrumental in the Red Wings' winning their first two Stanley Cup championships in 1936 and 1937. Aurie began his professional hockey career in 1926 with the London Panthers of the Canadian Professional Hockey League (CPHL). The following season, he moved up to the NHL to play with Detroit. His dedication to off-season fitness with his short stature (5 foot 6 inches) earned him the nicknames \\"Little Dempsey\\" (for his fistic abilities) and \\"The Little Rag Man\\" (for his remarkable and entertaining ability to control or \\"rag\\" the puck during penalty killing). Twice during his career, Aurie led the Wings in assists and in 1933–34, his 35 points topped the club in scoring. He was third in NHL scoring with a career-high 46 points in 1934–35 and fourth overall in 1936–37 with 43 points. He and Herbie Lewis represented the Red Wings at the first ever NHL All Star Game in 1934. Aurie captained the team in the 1932–33 season, led the league in playoff scoring in 1934 with 10 points in nine games and led the league in goal scoring in 1937 with 23 while earning a first-team selection on the post-season NHL All-Star Team. He was part of the Wings' first big line, playing alongside center Marty Barry and left wing Lewis. His selfless play and hustle made him a favorite of owner James Norris. Aurie scored his NHL leading 23rd goal on March 11, 1937 in a 4–2 win over the New York Rangers, but later in the game fractured his leg in a collision with Rangers' defenceman Art Coulter, ending his season. Aurie's season leading scoring performance earned him a berth on the NHL First All-Star Team. Unfortunately, this was Aurie's last strong season. The lingering effects of his fractured leg began to affect his play and in 1937–38, he dropped to 10 goals and 19 points and was forced to retire after the season at age 33. After the season, team owner James Norris decided to honor Aurie by retiring his jersey No. 6 - the first Detroit player to have this honor bestowed upon him. The following season, Aurie was named player- coach of Detroit's AHL farm club, the Pittsburgh Hornets, but returned to the Red Wings for one final game on Jan. 10 - scoring the winning goal against Montreal in a 3–0 shutout at Detroit. Aurie would later go on to head coach the Oshawa Generals. == Retirement == Aurie's No. 6 jersey was officially retired by Wings owner James Norris after the 1937–38 season (he returned to play one more game for Detroit on Jan. 10, 1939), but was reissued once in the late 1950s to his cousin (not nephew as has been widely reported) Cummy Burton, with the family's blessing. His jersey was displayed in the Olympia Stadium lobby during the 1960s, but then-owner Mike Ilitch refused to display the number at Joe Louis Arena with the other retired numbers, despite several published accounts to support the retirement of the number. thumb In a 1997 Detroit Free Press article, Wings vice president Jimmy Devellano said the team refused to hang the number because he was not a Hall of Famer, despite the fact that the number was already retired before Ilitch became the owner in 1982. Aurie died in Detroit's Mount Carmel Mercy Hospital on December 12, 1952, having suffered a stroke while driving his car the previous evening. He was buried at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery, in Southfield, Michigan. == Awards and achievements == * IAHL Second All-Star Team, 1939 * Led NHL in goals in 1936–37 * Named to NHL First All-Star Team, 1936–37 * Played in NHL All-Star Game, 1933–34 * Won the Stanley Cup (with the Detroit Red Wings) 1936, 1937 == Career statistics == ===Regular season and playoffs=== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:60em\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" ! rowspan=\\"100\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" ! colspan=\\"5\\"Regular season ! rowspan=\\"100\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" ! colspan=\\"5\\"Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

Its gameplay is based on the 1988 film of the same name. During the game, the player rescues hostages and battles with terrorists from a top view perspective at Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles. ==Plot== John McClane decides to visit his wife Holly in Nakatomi Plaza, only to discover that she is taken hostage on the 30th floor, along with a number of other hostages. The terrorist leader, Hans Gruber, is after the money locked away in a safe on the 30th floor. His hacker, Theo, is slowly breaking the locks into the vault. McClane decides to fight the terrorists on his own, ascending the building as he does so. ==Gameplay (NES)== There are 40 terrorists scattered throughout the building, and John McClane's task is to clear each floor of terrorists, and he can then use the stairwell or the express elevator to travel upwards, to a maximum of floors 31-35 (more floors are unlocked in \\"Advanced\\" mode). In addition, by shooting at grids in the wall, John is able to climb in the vents, dropping into a designated spot or moving down or up a floor. At the start of the game, the player character can only use a pistol (with 15 bullets) and his fists to dispose of enemies, but later acquires several weapons, such as submachine guns, explosives, rocket launchers, flamethrowers and flashbangs which the terrorists can also use. When McClane is shot, a few picked up items can drop where he must pick them up again. The player's bullets have minimal range, and due to the control scheme can only be aimed at 90 or 45 degree angles. However once acquired, the submachine gun can also fire a spray of bullets in an arc, allowing for more firing angles. McClane's health, which is drained by bullet wounds, can be restored by collecting soda cans from either enemies, snack machines (by shooting several bullets at them) or empty rooms. The player loses the game when all life is lost. The player has about four minutes before one of the six locks are opened, but can gain more time by destroying the main computer on the fourth floor. Once all the locks have been opened, the vault is opened and the game's final battle is triggered. The player has only a few minutes to go to the 30th floor, for a final confrontation with Karl, Hans, and any of the 40 terrorists left alive. One interesting aspect of the game allows the player to listen to Hans shouting orders to his guards through a two-way radio. However, after the second lock is opened, Hans will tell everyone to not use the radio. Also notable is the \\"foot meter\\". The meter starts out full, but will eventually decrease if the player character steps on shattered glass or runs around. If the meter becomes empty, McClane will walk much slower than he does when the foot meter is full. It can be restored by collecting med-kits. The game features cinematic sequences, which change the story depending on which actions the player takes. For example, if there is fewer than one minute left, and the player defeats Karl, the last scene with John and Holly will tell the player the roof has been destroyed by the helicopter sent by Hans. ==Version differences== The Nintendo Entertainment System version of the game is played from a top-down perspective, as opposed to the 1st-/3rd-person perspective seen on the Commodore 64 and DOS ports. ==References* * * Category:1990 video games Category:Activision games Category:Die Hard video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Commodore 64 games Category:DOS games Category:Cancelled ZX Spectrum games Category:iOS games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:TurboGrafx-16 games Category:Pack-In-Video games Category:Video games set in Los Angeles Category:Nintendo hard games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games with alternate endings ","title":"Die Hard (video game)"},{"id":"3251077","text":"Autosan Eurolider 12 - intercity coach Autosan Eurolider 15 LE - local/intercity low-entry bus Autosan A8V Wetlina City (Osprey) in Kielce, Poland Autosan M09LE Sancity 9 - city bus Autosan Sancity 12LE - city bus Intercity/tourist coach Autosan Gemini Autosan A1010T DW police bus Autosan S.A. is a Polish bus and coach manufacturer. The company is located in Sanok, Poland. Its sales network includes European (also non-EU countries), African and Asian countries. Currently it produces approximately 300 buses a year. ==History== The company was founded in 1832 by Walenty Lipiński and Mateusz Beksiński as a boilermaker's plant. The history of the factory changed depending on domestic and European economic situations. At the beginning of its activity, the factory produced devices and equipment for the oil mining, distillery and brewing industries. It later added transportation to its range and by 1894 it had become Poland's most important manufacturer of rail coaches and freight cars, tramcars and other high-capacity vehicles, while continuing to produce their initial output of boilers and other related devices. Later, even more variety of product was added, including cisterns, cranes, dredgers, road rollers, steel lifeboats, steel bridge constructions and casting articles. In 1926, Autosan launched its first lot of buses mounted on Lancia chassis. Activities were interrupted during World War II but resumed in 1950. In 1973, a new family of buses is launched - the H9 bus, with the engine mounted at the rear. It would be followed in 1984 by the high-capacity H10 model. In September 2013 the Court of Krosno declared the factory bankrupt. In a statement issued at the time it was explained that it was impossible to continue financing the restructuring. A few days later Sobiesław Zasada Group, which owned the company, sold a package of shares in Autosan to Gregory Tarnawa for one Polish zloty. Trade unionists from the factory picketed in front of the former owner, Sobiesław Zasada Group, in Kraków, demanding payment of arrears of salary for several months. The company is still operational. Since 2001, the company has developed and produced components for rail vehicles, especially the bodies of railcars and trams. ==Products== ===Buses=== ====Current models==== * Tourist coaches ** Autosan A0808T \\"Gemini\\" ** Autosan A1112T \\"Ramzes\\" * Intercity buses ** Autosan A0808T \\"Gemini\\" ** Autosan A0909L \\"Tramp 2\\" (Autosan Scamp) ** Autosan A1010T \\"Lider 3\\" ** Autosan A1012T \\"Lider\\" ** Autosan Eurolider 12 ** Autosan Eurolider 13 ** Autosan Lider 9 eco ** Autosan Lider 9 eco2 ** Autosan A8V \\"Wetlina\\" (Autosan Osprey) * Local buses ** Autosan A1010T \\"Lider 10\\" ** Autosan H7-20MB \\"Solina\\" ** Autosan Sancity 9LE ** Autosan Eurolider 13LE ** Autosan Eurolider 15LE * City buses (low-floor and low-entry buses) ** Sancity 9LE ** Sancity 10LF ** Sancity 12LE ** Sancity 12LF ** Sancity 18LF ** Autosan A8V \\"Wetlina City\\" (Autosan Osprey) * School buses ** Autosan A0909S Smyk ** Autosan A1012T \\"Eagle RHD\\" * Special buses, prison vans ** Autosan A1010T DW ** Autosan H7-10ZK * Police buses for military squads ** Autosan H7-10I ====Historical buses==== Autosan H9-21, a very long-running and popular model now discontinued.

Ruby Rich is an American scholar; critic of independent, Latin American, documentary, feminist, and queer films; and a professor emerita of Film & Digital Media and Social Documentation at UC Santa Cruz.UCSC.edu Among her many contributions, she is known for coining the term \\"New Queer Cinema\\". She is currently the editor of Film Quarterly, a scholarly film journal published by University of California Press. == Career == Rich began her career in film exhibition as co-founder of the Woods Hole Film Society. In 1973, she became associate director of what is now the Gene Siskel Film Center at the Art Institute of Chicago. After working as film critic for the Chicago Reader, she moved to New York City to become the director of the film program for the New York State Council on the Arts, where she worked for a decade. While living in New York City, she began writing for the Village Voice. She then moved to San Francisco, where she began teaching, first at the University of California, Berkeley, and then at UC Santa Cruz. As Professor of Film and Digital Media there, she helped to build the Social Documentation graduate program. In 2017, the Barbican hosted a season of films and talks to commemorate her career as a film critic, academic and curator. === Media appearances === In 1999, Rich appeared as a guest critic on several episodes of Roger Ebert at the Movies. B. Ruby Rich appears in the 2009 documentary film For the Love of Movies: The Story of American Film Criticism where she discusses the appeal of the film Amélie, and expresses her desire for a new kind of criticism to emerge from young critics who can go beyond auteur theory. She appears in the film !Women Art Revolution. == New Queer Cinema and other influences == Rich coined the term \\"New Queer Cinema\\" in a 1992 article for the Village Voice, which was reprinted in Sight and Sound.Hays, Matthew. \\"Beyond The Celluloid Closet.\\" Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide 20.4 (2013): 37. Academic Search Complete. Web. April 22, 2016. In the article, Rich identified a wave of films that \\"collided\\" at film festivals such as Sundance and TIFF. Rich asserted that these independent films, made by and for queer-identified people, used radical aesthetics to combat homophobia, grapple with the trauma of the AIDS epidemic, and address complicated queer subjectivities while importing much needed discussions of race. Rich argued that, although films dealing with these issues can be found in the previous decade, New Queer Cinema broke with the gay liberation ethos that self-representation should remain positive and desirable. Rich's presence at film festivals (such as Sundance, where she was an early member of the selection committee; TIFF, where she served as an international programmer in 2002; Telluride, where she was Guest Director in 1996; and Provincetown, where she appears every spring) has been significant. Her film reviews in major national publications, and her commentary on public broadcasting programs such as The World, Independent View, and All Things Considered, have led to her being characterized as a \\"central figure\\" in cinema studies and culture.Myers, Emma (February 7, 2014). \\"CriticWire\\".

(Observation data from the 1994 unmanned spacecraft Clementine has indicated the existence of subsurface water ice mixed with lunar soil, as confirmed by Lunar Prospector and subsequent missions, but exposed water ice on the Moon's surface has not been recognized by the scientific community.) There the crew tests an experimental heavy Lunar rover, launched to their location earlier by a Saturn 1B and delivered to the Moon using a stand-alone Apollo Lunar Module descent stage called the \\"LM Truck.\\" (Both of these vehicles might have been actually used on the Moon, according to Johnson, had not Project Apollo been cut short.) All goes well until the astronauts are ready to lift off to return to the orbiting Apollo CSM. Unfortunately, their LM ascent engine fails to fire. Repeated attempts to restart that engine—the only part of the LM system without a backup—all end in failure. Finding themselves stranded, the mission commander and LM pilot say goodbye to their wives. The commander peremptorily orders his CM pilot, in orbit around the Moon, to return home. He and the LM pilot then abandon the LM and strike out on their own, driving their rover to the limit of its remaining driving range \\"to see what we can see.\\" In their last message to Earth, they ask their colleague and Capsule Communicator to help their returning crewmate understand that he must not blame himself for their deaths. Before their oxygen runs out entirely, they find a vast and incredible Out-of-place artifact that might save their lives - or kill them. It is an ancient, abandoned, but fully functioning Lunar base - which they find immediately before the last seconds of their air run out. The base contains technology far beyond the reach of human science and engineering, best exemplified in the \\"war room\\" that they find immediately upon entry. This leads the two men to argue whether extrasolar visitors built it. LM Pilot Charlie Shepherd, a fundamentalist Christian, refuses to admit the possibility, because the Bible contains no warrant for it. Both men agree, however, that whoever the base builders are (or were) would be able to conquer Earth easily, had they chosen to attack—though why they never did attack remains a mystery. The two men soon find EVA suits that are one-third again as tall as human EVA suits are. Shortly thereafter, they find many members of the base crew—dead of various acts of violence, and in at least one case, a suicide. The suicide's living quarters contains multiple artworks depicting various scenes of torture, indicating that the base builders were a thoroughly evil people whose mania for causing suffering is incomprehensible. Subsequently, Mission Commander Gary Lucas vanishes into an apparent journey into the past—specifically to the builders' home world. His friend, left on the base, searches it in vain for his friend, not realizing that his friend has entered a machine that can simulate events stored in its historical memory, based on input from a base-wide and planet-wide surveillance system. Shepherd finds a means of sustenance, and then finds a hangar—which turns out to be empty. Angered and desperate, Shepherd activates all the base' systems in the war room, except for one system that refuses to activate. In the process, he activates the base computer system, which regards him as non-human and starts broadcasting a distress signal to Earth. That signal will turn out to be the salvation of the two astronauts—because Congress, on the point of cancelling Project Apollo completely, reverses itself and authorizes Apollo 20 in direct response to the signal, which clearly is coming \\"from the Marlow Basin\\". They cannot read the message, but—at least subconsciously—they realize that its activation after the men of Apollo 19 were supposed to have died cannot be coincidental. Gary Lucas has many perilous adventures in the \\"home world\\" simulation, which he accepts as entirely real. They begin with his rescue of a woman being assaulted, and continue with his capture by men bent on offering him as a human sacrifice and by his rescue by the woman's husband and brother-in-law. In gratitude, Lucas offers to join the workforce that is now applying the finishing touches to a vast granary that his hosts have been building and stocking. Meanwhile, Shepherd tries again to activate the last war-room system—and realizes, too late, that he has in fact started a self- destruct sequence. One by one, various base systems—gravity, climate control, and ultimately the food dispensary—begin to shut down. Lucas is injured during the storehouse construction project and, after the householders have an apparent argument concerning him, is given a sedative. He awakes to find himself in an empty house and steps outside in time to hear the roar of an onrushing wall of water, which lifts the storehouse off its foundations (incredibly, without damaging it) and threatens to sweep Lucas to his death. But then Lucas finds himself back on the base, in time to watch its crew destroy one another in mutiny, mayhem, murder, human sacrifice, and the eventual suicide of the base commander, who is the crew's last survivor. Following this, Lucas experiences an attack of vertigo. In fact the simulator machine has run its program, sounds three piercing alarm tones, and ejects him into the waiting arms of Shepherd just as the crew of Apollo 20 arrive to rescue them. That rescue is just in time—because after Apollo 20 completes trans-Earth injection, the self-destruct sequence runs its course, and the base destroys itself, apparently in a thermonuclear detonation. Back on Earth, the mission commander studies the Bible—and realizes that he actually witnessed the Noachic Flood and even ate at Noah's table. Also, the base builders never attacked Earth, because they were from Earth originally—from Antediluvian Earth. He and Shepherd further realize that God has entrusted him with a warning, which he must convey to anyone who will listen. The novel ends when it shifts to somewhere on the surface of Mars, where another base similar to the one found on the Moon, ominously activates by itself. ==Characters== *Astronaut Gary Lucas, Apollo 19 Mission Commander: Gary Lucas became an astronaut in 1965. During his training, he met and married his wife, Diane, in Cocoa Beach, Florida. They have one son, Jeff, who is ten years old at the time in which the novel takes place. Gary Lucas, lands near the Moon's south pole, near the Marlow Basin (this is the Aitken Basin in real life). He and his friend, LM Pilot Charles Shepherd, intend to explore this basin, which they believe is a massive meteoric impact crater that might contain fragments of lunar bedrock. Indeed, they find a large quantity of precious and semiprecious stones, the most colorful and valuable yet found on the Moon. *Diane \\"Annie\\" Lucas, his wife *Jeffrey Lucas, his son *Astronaut Charles Shepherd, Apollo 19 Lunar Module Pilot: Charles Shepherd failed of selection as an astronaut when he first applied. But that failure afforded him the opportunity to meet his wife, Carol, also a believer. They have one young son, Joseph (\\"Joey\\"). Shortly before the launch of Apollo 19, Shepherd participated in a gambling pool to see whether his commander would succeed in making a precision landing closer than the record set by astronaut Pete Conrad during Apollo 12. The precision landing is required because part of their mission equipment is a new kind of heavy rover, delivered previously aboard an Apollo LM Truck. Astronaut Shepherd is inordinately proud of his commander, because the commander has bested Pete Conrad's old precision-landing record, thus winning Shepherd a hundred dollars in a gambling pool (see back story above). He is even happier when he and Gary Lucas, driving their heavy rover in the Marlow Basin (actually the Aitken Basin), discover an outcropping of precious and semi-precious stones—easily the most colorful geological samples ever recovered from the Moon. *Carol Shepherd, his wife *Joseph \\"Joey\\" Shepherd, his son *Astronaut Victor Kendall, Apollo 19 Command Module Pilot, afterwards CapCom on White Team. He serves as the Apollo CSM pilot on this mission to the Lunar south pole. He shares in the joy that his friends, Mission Commander Gary Lucas and LM Pilot Charlie Shepherd, feel when they discover semi- precious gemstones in their landing zone—gemstones that might contribute to a debate on the continuation of Project Apollo, now slated to close down after this mission. *Katie Kendall, his wife *Astronaut Bruce Cortney, CapCom on White Team, afterwards Apollo 20 Mission Commander *Astronaut James Irwin, Apollo 20 Lunar Module Pilot *Astronaut Donald K. Slayton, Director, Astronaut Office, and Apollo 20 Command Module Pilot *Gene Kranz, Flight Director, White Team *Noah *Wife of Noah *Shem, Ham, and Japheth, sons of Noah *Wives of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, one of whom is attacked in a burning town and escapes serious injury only with the intervention of astronaut Lucas *Unnamed Base Commander and crew of the Antediluvian Lunar base === Cameo appearances === *Astronaut Jim Lovell *Marilyn Lovell, his wife *Walter Cronkite, Managing Editor, CBS News ==Major themes== History of Project Apollo, Bible history (specifically of Noah and the Great Flood that bears his name), speculation on the nature of Antediluvian civilization, the utility of prayer, and the Providential nature of God. ==Allusions/references to other works== *Ice makes one allusion to Star Trek, and specifically to the fabled technology of food preparation in the twenty-third century. *Ice also makes an allusion to the motion picture Dr. Strangelove, when astronaut Shepherd states that a \\"war room\\" on the lunar base reminds him of a similar room in that film. ==Literary significance and criticism== Ice highlights the Christianity of many Apollo astronauts (one of them wrote the foreword to this work). It touches on several themes at once: the history of Project Apollo, how the nation would have handled what would have been an appallingly demoralizing disaster, the possibility of extraterrestrial visitation of the earth in modern or ancient times, and speculation about the Flood. Ice attracted little notice beyond the Christian readership to which Johnson directed it, and it is now out-of-print. She had intended a sequel to this novel, titled Fire, based on a similar encounter on the planet Mars. But at last report, the publisher canceled that project. ===Awards and nominations=== Ice was a finalist for the Christy Award for the best futuristic Christian novel of 2002. It lost to Time Lottery. The other finalist in the category was The Fifth Man, a novel about a fictional mission to Mars. ==Allusions to actual history== In various scenes, this novel re-creates an entire J-mission profile, including a launch sequence for an equally fictional Apollo 20 mission flown with the stated objective of reclaiming the astronauts' remains using the Skylab Rescue CSM for the mission, rather than leave dead astronauts' bodies in space, something that has never happened in the history of manned spaceflight. (The Soyuz 1 and Soyuz 11 capsules returned their cosmonauts' bodies to Earth while Challenger and Columbia disintegrated, leaving scattered remains.) Johnson clearly demonstrates extensive knowledge of Project Apollo mission hardware and systems, from the Saturn V down to the EVA suits that Apollo astronauts wore. A number of actual persons appear in fictional scenes, including CBS News Managing Editor Walter Cronkite, Flight Director Gene Kranz, and astronauts Jim Lovell, James Irwin, and Donald K. Slayton. The novel references the precision landing made by astronaut Pete Conrad during Apollo 12 and to the nearly disastrous Apollo 13. It also features a foreword from astronaut Charles Duke and a cover painting by astronaut Alan Bean. In addition, Ice lays out a theory of how the Moon came to be the pockmarked, meteor-scarred body that we know today and of how the Biblical Flood took place. == References == Category:2002 American novels Category:American alternate history novels Category:American Christian novels Category:American science fiction novels Category:Novels about ancient astronauts Category:Novels set on the Moon Category:Fiction set in 1975 Category:Novels about Noah's Ark Category:Novels about NASA Category:Space exploration novels Category:Novels about time travel ","title":"Ice (Johnson novel)"},{"id":"3251096","text":"MSPE may refer to: *Mindful Sport Performance Enhancement: a mental training program for athletes and coaches *Mean squared prediction error *Mean squared pure error *Medical School Performance Evaluation (or dean's letter): a formal, written evaluation of a medical student *Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes, a role-playing game written by Michael A.

His playing career extended over 20 seasons, most notably in the National Hockey League with the Los Angeles Kings, Atlanta Thrashers, and the Carolina Hurricanes. ==Playing career== Kaberle was drafted 76th overall in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft by the Kings. During the 1999-2000 season, he was traded to the Atlanta Thrashers for whom he would score his first career NHL goal on April 8, 2000 against Artūrs Irbe and the Carolina Hurricanes in a 4-3 Thrashers loss. Coincidentally, after the 2004-05 lockout, Kaberle would sign with Carolina. In the 2006 Stanley Cup Finals, Kaberle scored a power play goal in the second period of Game 7 against the Edmonton Oilers, which would turn out to be the game and Stanley Cup winning goal. It would mark Kaberle's only Stanley Cup win. During the off-season before the 2006–07 season, Kaberle suffered a shoulder injury, and was placed on the injured reserve on September 13, 2006. He was removed from the injured reserve on February 6, 2007, and scored the game winner that same night. After four seasons with the Hurricanes, Kaberle was declared a free agent after he was bought out his final year of his contract on July 28, 2009. With his North American career at a close, he returned to his native Czech Republic and re-joined his original club, HC Kladno, for the 2009–10 season. Kaberle played two more seasons in the Czech Extraliga with HC Pardubice and HC Plzeň before concluding his professional career after the 2011–12 season. ==International play== František Kaberle won the Ice Hockey World Championships five times: in 1996, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2005. In 2006, he won the bronze medal at the Olympic Games in Turin. That same year, he would become the third player (first and second were Igor Larionov and Pavel Datsyuk in 2002) to win both bronze medal and Stanley Cup. ==Personal life== František Kaberle married his wife Kateřina on May 30, 1998. They have two daughters named Francesca and Vanessa. His brother Tomáš Kaberle is a free agent and is also a fellow Stanley Cup winner with the Boston Bruins in 2011. Both of the Kaberle brothers were named to the Czech national ice hockey team for the 2006 Winter Olympics.

The band released five albums and were the first Australian thrash metal band to tour internationally. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, they were one of \\"two leading lights... [of] a small, but fervent underground thrash/speed metal scene.\\" ==History== === Mayhemic Destruction and Face of Despair (1985-1990) === Andy Eftichiou live at Jalometalli During the mid-1980s Sydney provided \\"two leading lights... [of] a small, but fervent underground thrash/speed metal scene\\", which were Mortal Sin and Slaughter Lord. Mortal Sin were founded in 1985 by Wayne Campbell on drums, Paul Carwana on guitar, Andy Eftichiou on bass guitar, Keith Krstin on guitar and Mat Maurer on lead vocals. Campbell attempted to recruit Maurer for his band, Wizzard, but his other members were reluctant to support the idea so the pair struck out on their own. They recruited Wizzard's Krstin, and Eftichiou from another band, Judge, and a second guitarist Neville Reynolds. Reynolds was fired for being unavailable for their debut gig and was replaced by Carwana. Mortal Sin developed a solid following and seven months after their first live show they recorded an album-length demo in three days in July 1986. It was self-financed and self-produced. The eight tracks were released late that year as their debut album, Mayhemic Destruction, on their own label, Mega Metal Productions. It \\"attracted a great deal of interest from overseas thrash metal fans. UK rock magazine Metal Forces rated the album as one of the best of its genre ever issued.\\" The group were signed for international distribution by Phonogram Records' label, Vertigo Records, which then re-released, Mayhemic Destruction, worldwide in 1987. AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia felt it \\"caused quite a stir\\" and was \\"considered a minor thrash classic in its time.\\" They toured the Australian eastern states. Krstin left at the end of 1987 and was replaced on guitar by Mick Burke from Slaughter Lord. Mortal Sin spent much of 1988 recording a second album, Face of Despair, with United States producer Randy Burns (Kreator, Dark Angel and Megadeth). The release was delayed for more than a year, until May 1989 as they supported Metallica on the Australian leg of their Damaged Justice tour. Rivadavia felt the album \\"fell somewhat short of expectations; its superior production values were incapable of masking the mostly lackluster songwriting within. In retrospect, it's clear that creative stagnation had already set in.\\" Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, noticed that \\"With its greater attention to song arrangements and quality production, the album vindicated the overseas interest shown in the band.\\" The Metal Forge's Simon Milburn rated the album as 8 stars out of 10 and explained that it was \\"the pinnacle of their short lived thrash career... Tracks like 'I Am Immortal', 'Voyage of the Disturbed' and 'Martyrs of Eternity' are pure classics full of memorable riffs and hooks that it's near impossible to not start headbanging to. They are the best on offer for sure but the rest aren't lagging too far behind.\\" In July 1989 Campbell was sacked and Steve Hughes (also ex-Slaughter Lord), replaced him on drums. In January 1990 Mortal Sin toured Europe with Testament and the UK supporting Faith No More. Mortal Sin also played a number of shows in the US but after the end of the tour, Maurer quit the band. ===Every Dog Has Its Day (1990-1993)=== On its return to Australia, the band split, only to reform a short time later with Steve Sly replacing Maurer. The new line-up found some acceptance, however by the end of the year Hughes, Burke & Carwana had all left the band due to past management and touring issues, to pursue other interests. Eftichiou and Sly continued rebuilding the band, recruiting Alex Hardy (guitar), ex-Enticer guitarist Dave DeFrancesco & drummer Nash Hall (the Wrecking Crue[Parramatta]) and toured for 12 months. A third album entitled Every Dog Has Its Day (released as Rebellious Youth in some markets), showcased a more traditional metal style than previously. Mortal Sin sometimes suffered from being too big for their old circuit in Australia, particularly when they appeared in Sly's home town of Newcastle, Australia, at the Cambridge Hotel, hundreds more turned out than the venue could accommodate, leading to arrests, injuries and a ban from the city. After supporting Megadeth on the Rust in Peace tour of Australia, Mortal Sin were faced by more problems, including venue issues, split with their management and internal bickering. These events resulted in the band's second breakup in 1993. ===Post-breakup (1993-1995)=== For the next few years Wayne Campbell played in several Sydney bands such as White Trash and Grungeon and also worked as a promoter. Steve Hughes played in Presto and Nazxul before eventually heading to the UK to pursue a career as a comedian. Andy Eftichiou formed Who's Guilty, a heavy rock band that recorded an EP and ironically also included two former members of Wizzard. Mick Burke moved into the area of sound engineering and was later involved in a motor vehicle accident that left him with a permanent brain injury. Mat Maurer formed Omega, a band which supported Scatterbrain, but did not progress into a writing stage. Sly went on to front the pop-rock outfit The Chosen Few, whose song \\"Rise\\" was covered by Daryl Braithwaite and became a hit in several countries. On the eve of his own recording deal in Germany, Sly suffered serious health concerns that forced him to cease his singing career. ===Brief reunion and third split (1996-2003)=== Campbell and Maurer reformed Mortal Sin once again in 1996, reuniting with Eftichiou and Carwana and with Anthony Hoffman from Campbell's band Grungeon also on guitar. Carwana departed after one live show and was replaced by Troy Scerri. Scerri had played in a long list of bands throughout the late 80s and early 90s, including White Trash (with Campbell), Death Mission and This Thing. This version of the band released the EP \\"Revolution of the Mind\\" and launched the first full-scale Australian tour that Mortal Sin had ever undertaken. The tour was not a successful one and Eftichiou was sacked, replaced with Mark \\"Chook\\" O'Rourke from Sydney death metal band Tscabeze for the group's only appearance at the annual Metal for the Brain festival in Canberra. Jason Thorncraft of Sydney's Headlifter took Eftichiou's place after this but Mortal Sin split up once more in September 1998. Troy Scerri moved on to various heavy rock, hardcore and stoner bands that have included Daredevil, Faturra Della Morte, The Blasting Process and The Neptune Power Federation. Wayne Campbell joined Sydney metal band Temtris in 2000. ===An Absence of Faith and Psychology of Death (2004-2011)=== In February 2004, Mortal Sin once again reformed, this time as Campbell, Maurer, Eftichou and former Addictive guitarists Joe Buttigieg and Mick Sultana. Within a year the line-up changed again when Campbell and Buttigieg were replaced by Luke Cook and Nathan Shea. In April 2005, Mortal Sin toured Australia with Anthrax and a new album was recorded. On 4 February 2006, the band played a show in Sydney that featured them performing the Mayhemic Destruction album live in its entirety for the first time; this performance was filmed for a proposed DVD release, but the project was abandoned due to poor audio quality. In August 2006, the band returned to Europe where they appeared alongside Michael Schenker Group, Rose Tattoo, Metal Church, and Tourettes Syndrome and performed at the Wacken Open Air Festival. Mortal Sin's fourth album An Absence of Faith was recorded in February 2007 at The Basement Studios in Sydney with producer Phil McKellar. It was released in July 2007 in Australia through Riot! Entertainment and in Europe in September through Germany's Armageddon Music. In late 2007, the band also released reissued versions of Mayhemic Destruction and Face of Despair through Riot!, both of which contained bonus tracks. Mortal Sin returned to Europe in March 2008 as support to Overkill to tour and promote the new album. In the summer of 2008, the band played some festival gigs like the Wacken Open Air and Jalometalli. Back in Australia, they supported Judas Priest and Testament in 2008 and late in 2009 undertook a two-week tour of South America, for which Mick Sultana was temporarily replaced by Andrew Lilley. In 2011 Ryan Huthnance replaced Sultana ahead of an Australian tour with Overkill and in July Mortal Sin finished recording a new album, Psychology of Death. In November they toured nationally with Destruction and then completed a European tour with Exodus, Sepultura and Heathen in late 2011 as part of the \\"Thrashfest Classics\\" tour. ===Departure of Mat Maurer, fourth split and possible reunion (2012-present)=== In 2012 ,Mat Maurer announced his departure from Mortal Sin. Dave Tinelt from the Wollongong band Nekrofeist was announced as his replacement but after only two live performances, Luke Cook and Nathan Shea left the band, ending Mortal Sin on 30 April . Luke Cook has performed with Wollongong band Carbon Black and Sydney thrash band Killrazer. Wayne Campbell rejoined Temtris in January 2015. Mick Burke, guitarist from 1987–1990, died on 24 August 2017. His death was reported on the band's Facebook page. On 30 August 2018, former drummer Wayne Campbell teased a possible reunion on his Facebook page, writing, \\"If Mortal Sin played a show again would you come to see?\\". == Members == Mat Maurer live at Jalometalli ;Vocalists *Mat Maurer - Vocals (1985–1990, 1996–1998, 2004–2012) *Steve Sly - Vocals (1991–1993) ;Guitarists *Keith Krstin - Guitar (1985–1987) *Paul Carwana - Guitar (1985–1990) *Mick Burke - Guitar (1987–1990; died 2017) *Tom Dostoupil - Guitar (1991–1993) *Dave DeFrancesco - Guitar (1991–1993) *Anthony Hoffman - Guitar (1996–1998) *Troy Scerri - Guitar (1996–1998) *Joe Buttigieg - Guitar (2004–2005) *Mick Sultana - Guitar (2004–2010) *Nathan Shea - Guitar (2006–2012) *Ryan Huthnance - Guitar (2010–2012) ;Bassists *Andy Eftichiou - Bass (1985–1993, 1996–1998, 2004–2012) ;Drummers *Wayne Campbell - Drums (1985–1989, 1996–1998, 2004–2005) *Steve Hughes - Drums (1989–1990) *Nash Hall - Drums (1991–1993) *Luke Cook - Drums (2006–2012) ===Timeline=== ==Discography== Studio Albums: Rebellious Youth * Released: 1991 * Format: CD * Label: Virgin Records (Australia) * Producer: Kevin Shirley * Note - Released internationally under the titled \\"Every Dog Has Its Day\\" with different cover artwork.

The alveoli that are present tend to not be mature enough to function normally. It is more common in infants with low birth weight (LBW) and those who receive prolonged mechanical ventilation to treat respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). It results in significant morbidity and mortality. The definition of BPD has continued to evolve primarily due to changes in the population, such as more survivors at earlier gestational ages, and improved neonatal management including surfactant, antenatal glucocorticoid therapy, and less aggressive mechanical ventilation. Currently the description of BPD includes the grading of its severity into mild, moderate and severe. This correlates with the infant's maturity, growth and overall severity of illness. The new system offers a better description of underlying pulmonary disease and its severity. ==Presentation== === Complications === Feeding problems are common in infants with BPD, often due to prolonged intubation. Such infants often display oral- tactile hypersensitivity (also known as oral aversion).Gaining & Growing. \\"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia\\", Gaining & Growing, March 20, 2007. (Retrieved June 12, 2008.) Physical findings: * hypoxemia; * hypercapnia; * crackles, wheezing, & decreased breath sounds; * increased bronchial secretions; * hyperinflation; * frequent lower respiratory infections; * delayed growth & development; * cor pulmonale; * CXR shows with hyperinflation, low diaphragm, atelectasis, cystic changes. == Cause == Prolonged high oxygen delivery in premature infants causes necrotizing bronchiolitis and alveolar septal injury, with inflammation and scarring. This results in hypoxemia. Today, with the advent of surfactant therapy and high frequency ventilation and oxygen supplementation, infants with BPD experience much milder injury without necrotizing bronchiolitis or alveolar septal fibrosis. Instead, there are usually uniformly dilated acini with thin alveolar septa and little or no interstitial fibrosis. It develops most commonly in the first 4 weeks after birth. == Diagnosis == ===Earlier criteria=== The classic diagnosis of BPD may be assigned at 28 days of life if the following criteria are met: #Positive pressure ventilation during the first 2 weeks of life for a minimum of 3 days. #Clinical signs of abnormal respiratory function. #Requirements for supplemental oxygen for longer than 28 days of age to maintain PaO2 above 50 mm Hg. #Chest radiograph with diffuse abnormal findings characteristic of BPD. ===Newer criteria=== The newer National Institute of Health (US) criteria for BPD (for neonates treated with more than 21% oxygen for at least 28 days) is as follows:, ;Mild * Breathing room air at 36 weeks' post-menstrual age or discharge (whichever comes first) for babies born before 32 weeks, or * breathing room air by 56 days' postnatal age, or discharge (whichever comes first) for babies born after 32 weeks' gestation. ;Moderate * Need for <30% oxygen at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, or discharge (whichever comes first) for babies born before 32 weeks, or * need for <30% oxygen to 56 days' postnatal age, or discharge (whichever comes first) for babies born after 32 weeks' gestation. ;Severe * Need for >30% oxygen, with or without positive pressure ventilation or continuous positive pressure at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, or discharge (whichever comes first) for babies born before 32 weeks, or * need for >30% oxygen with or without positive pressure ventilation or continuous positive pressure at 56 days' postnatal age, or discharge (whichever comes first) for babies born after 32 weeks' gestation. ==Management== There is evidence to show that steroids given to babies less than 8 days old can prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia. However, the risks of neurodevelopmental sequelae may outweigh the benefits. It is unclear if starting steroids more than 7 days after birth is harmful or beneficial. It is thus recommended that they only be used in those who cannot be taken off of a ventilator. Evidence suggests that vitamin A in LBW babies is associated with a reduction in mortality and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Oxygen therapy at home is recommended in those with significant low oxygen levels. ==Epidemiology== The rate of BPD varies among institutions, which may reflect neonatal risk factors, care practices (e.g., target levels for acceptable oxygen saturation), and differences in the clinical definitions of BPD. == See also == * Respiratory distress syndrome * Wilson–Mikity syndrome == References == == Further reading == * * Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia on National Institutes of Health == External links == Category:Bronchus disorders Category:Neonatology ","title":"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia"},{"id":"3251187","text":"The 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse is a 1962 American drama film directed by Vincente Minnelli and starring Glenn Ford, Ingrid Thulin, Charles Boyer, Lee J. Cobb, Paul Lukas, Yvette Mimieux, Karl Boehm and Paul Henreid. It is loosely based on the 1916 novel by Vicente Blasco Ibáñez, which had been filmed in 1921 with Rudolph Valentino. Unlike the first film, this was a critical and commercial disaster, which contributed greatly to the financial problems of MGM. ==Plot== In 1936, Madariaga is an 80-year-old patriarch of a large Argentinian cattle ranch. He has two grandsons – Julio, son of the French son-in-law Marcelo, and Heinrich, son of the German Karl. Heinrich returns home from studying in Germany to reveal he has become a Nazi. Madariaga slaps Heinrich and predicts that the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (Conquest, War, Pestilence, and Death) will soon devastate the earth; he runs outside into a storm with visions of the four horsemen and then dies in Julio's arms. In 1938 Julio goes to Paris with his family and befriends Marcelo's anti-Nazi friend Etienne Laurier. Julio falls in love with Laurier's wife, Marguerite, and becomes her lover after war breaks out and Laurier is sent to a prisoner-of-war camp. He takes advantage of his status as a neutral to live a pleasant life with Marguerite in German-occupied Paris where his cousin Heinrich is an important official in the SS. When Marguerite becomes the object of German General von Kleig's lust, Julio defies him and incurs von Kleig's personal enmity. Julio's younger sister Chi Chi becomes active in the French resistance, troubling Julio about his own lack of character. Laurier is released from prison an apparently broken man and Marguerite leaves Julio to care for him. When Julio discovers that Laurier is an important figure in the resistance, he joins it as well. Eventually both Chi Chi and Laurier are tortured and murdered by the Gestapo, and Laurier reveals to von Kleig that Julio is working for the resistance and on an important mission: guiding Allied bombers to destroy a Nazi headquarters in Normandy. Heinrich captures him when he realizes Julio is probably a French agent, but too late: just as the bombs are falling on them, killing both. The final scene – the most important scene in the film – is missing from several versions shown. In it, the grandchildren's parents are listening helplessly on the telephone as the deaths happen. The final words are from one set of parents to another: \\"Our children have killed each other\\". In other prints, the film ends with the four horsemen riding on to create future havoc for other generations. ==Cast== ==Production== ===Development=== The silent film rights to the original story had been purchased by Metro in 1918 for $190,000. There had been discussions by MGM about remaking the film before the American copyright expired in 1946. The following year MGM producer Sam Marx announced the studio might remake the film as a vehicle for Ricardo Montalbán, and if they did, the story would be updated to World War II. Early in 1958 MGM set about clarifying the copyright situation. They had recently authorized a remake of Ben-Hur, which looked like it was going to be a phenomenal success, and were looking for other old MGM properties to remake. They obtained the necessary rights and announced they would make the movie in June 1958. Julian Blaustein was assigned as producer. ===Scripting=== Blaustein announced the story would be updated from World War I to World War II: > The driving force of the book is of love among men instead of hatred. I > don't think it can be said often enough that such love is indispensable for > all of us if we are to have any future. If a motion picture can dramatize > such a theme entertainingly then the motion picture may make a small > contribution to peace in the world. It certainly impresses me as being worth > the try... The Paris of the occupation, the births of the resistance > movements have never been thoroughly explored on the screen to my mind. I'm > not interested in trying to recreate the shooting war. That's almost too > difficult to realistically do on the screen today. What I want to put on > screen is the atmosphere, so that when you sit in the theatre you will feel > the hope and frustration of people struggling against invasion and may > realize no man is an island. Robert Ardrey wrote the initial script. The movie was, along with a remake of Cimarron, going to be one of MGM's big films for 1960. MGM allocated a budget of $4 million and Vincente Minnelli to direct. Minnelli said he had doubts about relocating the time period and wanted it set back in World War I, but the studio was insistent.Minnelli p 337 Filming was pushed back due to the actors strike in 1960. Minnelli later claimed he was \\"drafted\\" into making the movie, and was rushed into production before he was ready because MGM had a start date.Minnelli p 339 However he did manage to get head of production Sol Siegel to arrange for the script to be rewritten in order to reflect the German Occupation of Paris. Because Robert Ardrey was busy, MGM hired John Gay to do rewrites of an outline prepared by Minnelli, which showed the weaknesses as he saw them. \\"Gay proved to be an enormous help\\", wrote Minnelli later. \\"The script – with the dreadful World War II setting – took shape. But I never justified the updating in my mind.\\"Minnelli p 340 Pre-production commenced in Paris. Minnelli wrote he flew back to the US and tried to talk the studio into changing the time period once again but they refused. \\"I began to believe I was the victim of a studio set up\\", he wrote. ===Casting=== Early contenders for the male lead – the part originally played by Rudolph Valentino – were MGM contractee George Hamilton, and Maximilian Schell. Vincente Minnelli said he wanted Alain Delon for the starring role and met with the young actor in Rome, but the producers did not feel he was sufficiently well known at the time. In June 1960 it was announced that Glenn Ford, who had a long relationship with MGM and had recently signed a new contract with the studio, would play the lead role. Minnelli later reflected \\"There I was, stuck with a story I didn't want to do, with a leading actor who lacked the brashness and impulsiveness I associated with his part. I wanted new challenges but I didn't think they'd be that challenging.\\" However he did say that the rest of the cast \\"was as brilliant as it was international.\\" Yvette Mimieux was cast in the ingenue part with Charles Boyer and Claude Dauphin in support, and Ava Gardner in the female lead, the part played by Alice Terry in the 1921 film. Eventually Gardner dropped out and Ingrid Thulin, best known for Wild Strawberries, stepped in. The studio wanted Horst Buchholz to play the young German son but he was unable to do it due to his commitment to make Fanny (1961), so Karl Boehm instead was hired. Ford was paired with an older actress, Ingrid Thulin, making both main roles much older than the book and 1921 film characters, giving more credibility to their relationship than a May–December romance would have. Although Thulin spoke English well, she was dubbed by Angela Lansbury. ===Shooting=== Minnelli later wrote that as he was unhappy with the story he decided to make the film at least as \\"stunning visually as I could make it. The flaws in the story might be overlooked. Some of my previous pictures hadn't held much hope in the beginning, but they'd been saved because I'd had some leeway in the writing. But I didn't have this freedom on Four Horsemen. It would be interesting to see what could be accomplished.\\" Minnelli decided to make the Four Horsemen an integral part of the story, which would be designed by Tony Duquette as a set of andirons riding the sky, parallel to the main action. He used red as \\"a dominating color, culminating in a red gel over the newsreels, which would be shown in a documentary way to point up the devastation of the war and the insensitivity of the principal actors in taking scant notice of it.\\" Filming started in Paris on 17 October. It proved difficult, in part due to riots due to the situation in Algeria and because of local reluctance to recreate scenes from the Occupation. It was decided to film the bulk of the movie in Hollywood instead. One of the more famous scenes of the 1921 movie involved Rudolph Valentino dancing the tango. However the scene was not in the novel, and it was decided not to have a similar scene in the remake. Ingrid Thulin later reflected on filming: > It was an interesting experience. I could not conform to their standards of > beauty. I tried... After the first few rushes it was obvious that it [the > film] would turn out badly. Yet they went right on. Perhaps they couldn't > convince themselves that all that money would end in disaster. I really did > want to be as beautiful as they wanted. It was terribly difficult. Then I > worked very hard to dub the dialogue but they kept changing lines to things > I couldn't pronounce. So they had to dub in another voice. MGM were impressed by the performance of Boehm and signed him to a contract, putting him in such films as Come Fly with Me and The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm. ===Post production=== The movie spent a considerable amount of time in post production, causing its budget to increase further. This, combined with the massive cost over-runs of Lady L (which had been postponed) and the remake of Mutiny on the Bounty, as well as the massive failures of Cimarron, King of Kings, Mutiny on the Bounty, and this film, led to the resignation of Sol C. Siegel, MGM's head of production,. == Reception == The film had its world premiere in February 1962. === Box office === MGM had become aware by April that the film would not recoup its cost and started writing off the losses. Ultimately the movie earned $1,600,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $2,500,000 overseas. When costs of prints and advertising were added, the studio recorded a loss of $5,853,000. === Critical === It was compared very unfavorably to the famous 1921 version, which propelled Rudolph Valentino to superstardom. Ford, with many films behind him, was not the unknown that Valentino was when he appeared in the 1921 film. Ford, 46 years old, also had the disadvantage of trying to reprise a role that Valentino had played when he was 26. Critics also considered Ford severely miscast as a Latin lover who, in their minds, should have been played by someone much younger. The Los Angeles Times wrote the filmmakers \\"have pulled it off. The new \\"Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\\" restores the pleasure there can be in seeing a good story well told on the screen.\\" Minnelli said the movie received better reviews in Europe and it influenced the look of The Damned, The Conformist and The Garden of the Finzi Continis.Minnelli p 345 == Soundtrack == André Previn composed the soundtrack score, which Alan and Marilyn Bergman later adapted and wrote lyrics to. The resulting song, \\"More in Love with You\\", was recorded by Barbra Streisand for The Movie Album (2003). ==Comic book adaption== * Dell Four Color #1250 (1961) == Bibliography == * Minnelli, Vincent & Harold Acre, I Remember It Well; Samuel French, 1975. == References == == External links == * * * Review of film at The New York Times Category:1960s war drama films Category:1962 films Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by André Previn Category:Films directed by Vincente Minnelli Category:Films with screenplays by Robert Ardrey Category:Films with screenplays by John Gay (screenwriter) Category:Films about the French Resistance Category:Films based on works by Vicente Blasco Ibáñez Category:Films set in Argentina Category:Films set in Paris Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films Category:American film remakes Category:Sound film remakes of silent films Category:Films adapted into comics Category:1960s political drama films Category:Anti-war films about World War II Category:Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in popular culture Category:1962 drama films ","title":"Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (film)"},{"id":"3251189","text":"In computational complexity theory and cryptography, the existence of pseudorandom generators is related to the existence of one-way functions through a number of theorems, collectively referred to as the pseudorandom generator theorem. == Introduction == === Pseudorandomness === A distribution is considered pseudorandom if no efficient computation can distinguish it from the true uniform distribution by a non-negligible advantage. Formally, a family of distributions Dn is pseudorandom if for any polynomial size circuit C, and any ε inversely polynomial in n :Probx∈U [C(x)=1] − Probx∈D [C(x)=1]  ≤ ε. === Pseudorandom generators === A function Gl: {0,1}l → {0,1}m, where l < m is a pseudorandom generator if: *Gl can be computed in time polynomial in l *Gl(x) is pseudorandom, when x is uniformly random. === One additional pseudorandom bit implies polynomially more pseudorandom bits === It can be shown that if there is a pseudorandom generator Gl: {0,1}l → {0,1}l+1, i.e. a generator that adds only one pseudorandom bit, then for any m = poly(l), there is a pseudorandom generator G'l: {0,1}l → {0,1}m. The idea of the proof is as follows: first s bits from uniform distribution Ul are picked and used as the seed to the first instance of Gl, which is known to be a pseudorandom generator. Next, the output of the first instance of Gl is divided into two parts: first l bits are fed into the second instance of Gl as a seed, while the last bit becomes the first bit of the output. Repeating this process for m times yields an output of m pseudorandom bits. It can be shown that such G'l, that consists of m instances of Gl, is indeed a pseudorandom generator by using a hybrid approach and proof by contradiction as follows: Consider m+1 intermediate distributions Hi: 0 ≤ i ≤ m, where first i bits are chosen from the uniform distribution, and last m − i bits are chosen from the output of G'l. Thus, H0 is the full output of G'l and Hm is a true uniform distribution Um. Therefore, distributions Hi and Hi+1 will be different in only one bit (bit number i+1). Now, assume that G'l is not a pseudorandom distribution; that is, there exists some circuit C that can distinguish between G'l and Um with an advantage ε = 1/poly(l). In other words, this circuit can distinguish between H0 and Hm. Therefore, there exists such i that the circuit C can distinguish between Hi and Hi+1 by at least ε / m. Note, that since m are polynomial in l, then ε / m is also polynomial in l and is still a non-negligible advantage. Now, assume we are given l+1 bits that are either output of Gl or a drawn from uniform distribution. Let's reuse the approach of building large pseudorandom generators out of instances of Gl and construct a string of pseudorandom bits of length m−i−1 in the same way the G'l was constructed above using the first l given bits as the seed. Then, let's create a string consisting of i bits drawn from uniform, concatenated with the last one of the given bits, followed by the created m−i−1 bits. The resulting output is either Hi or Hi+1, since the i+1 bit is either drawn from uniform or from Gl. Since by assumption we can distinguish between Hi and Hi+1 with non-negligible advantage, then we can distinguish between U and Gl, which implies that Gl is not a pseudorandom generator, which is a contradiction to the hypothesis. Q.E.D. Now, let's illustrate that if exists, the circuit for distinguishing between Gl and Ul+1 does not have to toss random coins. As we showed above, if exists a circuit C for distinguishing between G'l and Um, where m = poly(l), then exists a circuit C' for distinguishing between Gl and Ul+1 that uses i random bits. For this circuit C' :  Probu, s [C' (u1,...,ui,Gl(s)) = 1 ] − Probu, y [C' (u1,>,...,ui,y) = 1]  ≥ ε / m, where u is a string of i uniformly random bits, s is a string of l uniformly random bits, and y is a string of l+1 uniformly random bits. Then, Probu[  Probs [C' (u1,...,ui,Gl(s)) = 1] - Proby [C' (u1,...,ui,y) = 1]  ] ≥ ε / m; Which means, there exists some fixed string u of i bits that can be used as an \\"advice\\" to circuit C' for distinguishing between Gl and Ul+1. == Existence of pseudorandom generators == The existence of pseudorandom generators is related to the existence of one-way functions and hard-core predicates. Formally, pseudorandom generators exist if and only if one-way functions exist, or PRG ↔ OWF === Definitions === ==== One-way functions ==== Intuitively one-way functions are functions that are easy to compute and hard to invert. In other words, the complexity (or circuit size) of the function is much smaller than that of its inverse. Formally: A function ƒ: {0,1}n → {0,1}n is (S,ε) one-way if for any circuit C of size ≤ S, Prob[ƒ(C(ƒ(x))) = ƒ(x)] ≤ ε . Moreover, ƒ is a one-way function if * ƒ can be computed in polynomial time * ƒ is (poly(n), 1/poly(n)) one-way ==== Hard-core predicate ==== Function B: {0,1}n → {0,1} is a hard-core predicate for function ƒ if * B can be computed in polynomial time * for any polynomial size circuit C and any non-negligible ε = 1/poly(n), Probx~U [C(ƒ(x)) = B(x)] ≤ 1/2+ε In other words, it is hard to predict B(x) from function ƒ(x). === Proof === Here an outline of the proof is given. Please see references for detailed proofs. ==== PRG -> OWF ==== Consider a pseudorandom generator Gl: {0,1}l → {0,1}2l. Let's create the following one- way function ƒ: {0,1}n → {0,1}n that uses the first half of the output of Gl as its output. Formally, ƒ(x,y) → Gl(x) A key observation that justifies such selection, is that the image of the function is of size 2n and is a negligible fraction of the pre-image universe of size 22n. To prove that ƒ is indeed a one-way function let's construct an argument by contradiction. Assume there exists a circuit C that inverts ƒ with advantage ε: Prob[ƒ(C(ƒ(x,y))) = ƒ(x,y)] > ε Then we can create the following algorithm that will distinguish Gl from uniform, which contradicts the hypothesis. The algorithm would take an input of 2n bits z and compute (x,y) = C(z). If Gl(x) = z the algorithm would accept, otherwise it rejects. Now, if z is drawn from uniform distribution, the probability that the above algorithm accepts is ≤ 1/2l, since the size of image is 1/2l of the size of the pre-image. However, if z was drawn from the output of Gl then the probability of acceptance is > ε by assumption of the existence of circuit C. Therefore, the advantage that circuit C has in distinguishing between the uniform U and output of Gl is > ε − 1/2l, which is non-negligible and thus contradicts our assumption of Gl being a pseudorandom generator. Q.E.D. ==== OWF -> PRG ==== For this case we prove a weaker version of the theorem: One-way permutation → pseudorandom generator A one-way permutation is a one-way function that is also a permutation of the input bits. A pseudorandom generator can be constructed from one-way permutation ƒ as follows: Gl: {0,1}l→{0,1}l+1 = ƒ(x).B(x), where B is hard-core predicate of ƒ and \\".\\" is a concatenation operator. Note, that by the theorem proven above, it is only needed to show the existence of a generator that adds just one pseudorandom bit.  Hard-core predicate -> PRG  First, let's show that if B is a hard-core predicate for ƒ then Gl is indeed pseudorandom. Again, we'll use an argument by contradiction. Assume that Gl is not a pseudorandom generator; that is, there exists circuit C of polynomial size that distinguishes Gl(x) =ƒ(x).B(x) from Ul+1 with advantage ≥ε, where ε is non-negligible. Note, that since ƒ(x) is a permutation, then if x is drawn from uniform distribution, then so if ƒ(x). Therefore, Ul+1 is equivalent to ƒ(x).b, where b is a bit drawn independently from a uniform distribution. Formally, Probx~U [C(G(x))=1] − Probx~U,b~U [C(x.b)=1] ≥ ε Let's construct the following algorithm C': 1\\\\. Given z=f(x) guess bit b 2\\\\. Run C on z.b 3\\\\. IF C(z.b)=1 4\\\\. output b 5\\\\. ELSE 6\\\\. output 1-b Given the output of ƒ the algorithm first guesses bit b by tossing a random coin, i.e. Prob[b=0] = Prob[b=1] = 0.5. Then, algorithm (circuit) C is run on f(x).b and if the result is 1 then b is outputted, otherwise the inverse of b is returned. Then probability of C' guessing B(x) correctly is: Probx~U [C'(z)=B(x)] = Prob[b=B(x) ∧ C(z.b)=1] + Prob[b≠B(x) ∧ C(z.b)=0] = Prob[b=B(x)]⋅Prob[C(z.b)=1  b=B(x)] + Prob[b≠B(x)]⋅Prob[C(z.b)=0  b≠B(x)] = 1/2⋅Prob[C(z.b)=1  b=B(x)] + 1/2⋅Prob[C(z.b)=0  b≠B(x)] = (1−1/2)⋅Prob[C(z.b)=1  b=B(x)] + 1/2⋅(1−Prob[C(z.b)=1  b≠B(x)]) = 1/2+Probz.b~G(x) [C(z.b)=1] − 1/2⋅(Prob[C(z.b)=1  b=B(x)]+Prob[C(z.b)=1  b≠B(x)]) = 1/2+Probz.b~G(x) [C(z.b)=1] − Probz.b~U [C(z.b)=1] ≥ 1/2+ε This implies that circuit C' can predict B(x) with probability more than 1/2 + ε, which means that B cannot be a hard-core predicate for ƒ and the hypothesis is contradicted. Q.E.D.  OWP -> hard-core predicate  The outline of the proof is as follows: If ƒ{0,1}n→{0,1}n is a one-way permutation, then so is ƒ'{0,1}2n→{0,1}2n, where ƒ'(x,y)=ƒ(x).y by definition. Then B(x,y)=x⋅y is a hard-core predicate for ƒ', where ⋅ is a vector dot product. To prove that it is indeed hard-core let's assume otherwise, and show a contradiction with the hypothesis of ƒ being one- way. If B is not a hard-core predicate, then there exists a circuit C that predicts it, so Probx,y[C(ƒ(x),y)=x⋅y] ≥ 1/2+ε. That fact can be used to recover x by cleverly constructing permutations y that isolate bits in x. In fact, for a constant fraction of x, there exists a polynomial time algorithm that lists O(1/ε2) candidates that include all valid x. Thus, an algorithm can invert ƒ(x) in polynomial time for a non-negligible fraction of x, which contradicts the hypothesis. == References == * W. Diffie, M.E.

The FalconSAT-2 program started in late 2000, as a followup to FalconSAT-1. The spacecraft was based on a bus constructed by Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd, with the experiments being constructed at the USAF Academy. The primary instrument aboard FalconSAT-2 was the Miniaturized Electrostatic Analyzer, or MESA. It was originally scheduled to be deployed from , on mission STS-114 in early 2003. Following the Columbia accident this mission was delayed, and FalconSAT-2 was removed from the Shuttle manifest. It was then assigned as the payload for the maiden flight of the Falcon 1 rocket, which was launched from Omelek Island at 22:30 GMT on 24 March 2006. At launch, a corroded nut caused an engine fire, leading to the failure of the engine twenty five seconds into the flight. The rocket fell into the Pacific Ocean close to the launch site.

The parade follows a 3.5-mile (5.6 km) route along Hollywood Boulevard, then back along Sunset Boulevard and features various celebrities among its participants. Per tradition, Santa Claus appears at the conclusion of every parade. ==History== ===1900s=== Beginning in 1928, Hollywood merchants transformed a one-mile stretch of Hollywood Boulevard into \\"Santa Claus Lane\\" to boost shopping. Part of the promotion was a daily parade featuring Santa Claus and a film star.Masters, Nathan. \\"When Hollywood Boulevard Became Santa Claus Lane\\", KCET, Burbank, 21 December 2012. Originally called the Santa Claus Lane Parade, the inaugural event featured only Santa Claus and the actress Jeanette Loff. The parade continued to grow in scale with the help of local businesses and the community. In 1931 Santa Claus rode a truck-pulled float instead of the reindeer-pulled carriage of previous years. American Legion Post 43 marched with a color guard, drum line and bugle corps. The Parade was suspended from 1942 to 1944 due to World War II but reopened in 1945 with record attendance. In 1946 Gene Autry rode his horse in the parade and was inspired by the children yelling \\"Here comes Santa Claus, Here comes Santa Claus,\\" to write the song \\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\" along with Oakley Haldeman. Autry would become a perennial Grand Marshal of the parade. The parade continued to grow throughout the 1950s, '60s, and '70s, adding floats, animals, bands and celebrities. By 1978, the parade had been renamed the Hollywood Christmas Parade in order to attract more celebrities, and was broadcast locally on KTLA (which was purchased by Autry's Golden West Broadcasters in 1964) with the help of Autry and Johnny Grant. This change coincided with a shift in the parade's scheduling from Thanksgiving Eve to the Sunday after Thanksgiving, and continued to be a decades-long tradition on Los Angeles's channel 5, even after Autry's sale of KTLA to KKR in 1982, then Tribune Broadcasting in 1985. ===2000s=== In 2002, an attempt to present the parade as a primetime special on NBC sponsored by Blockbuster imperiled the future of the parade, as the presentation was lowly-rated. Renamed the Blockbuster Hollywood Christmas Spectacular and produced by Bob Bain, the parade was nearly completely dispensed with for pre-recorded and rehearsed spotlights in the vein of NBC's popular Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, pre- recorded musical performances from LeAnn Rimes and Destiny's Child to promote their new holiday albums, along with much lower wattage star power as most of the celebrities highlighted were either older or lower-tier actors exclusively starring on NBC series. Inexplicably, the special ended with a completely unrelated stunt involving a fall by stuntperson Mikal Kartvedt off a twelve- story building to promote the Blockbuster-exclusive home video rental release of the film XXX (the actual parade would air without any of the Bain-produced elements on Christmas morning on KCOP-TV). The following year, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce announced it would discontinue airing the parade on KTLA and other Tribune Broadcasting stations due to rising production costs. In March 2007, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce decided to end the parade's run due to lack of celebrities and a loss of $100,000 for the 2006 production, which The Associated Press said cost about $1 million to mount. However, later in 2007, the City of Los Angeles created a new parade to replace the Hollywood Christmas Parade, entitled the Hollywood Santa Parade and produced on the weekend after Thanksgiving (the original parade had traditionally been held on the Wednesday evening before the holiday). Participation in the new parade became by only, and Bob Barker, fresh from his farewell tapings as host of The Price Is Right, was that year's Parade Grand Marshal. 2007 and 2008, KTLA aired the new parade on a tape-delayed basis. It was later announced that MyNetworkTV would telecast the 2009 parade (with the Hollywood Christmas Parade name restored) in two consecutive prime-time showings: the first scheduled for December 10, the second for Christmas Eve night. The parade has since been produced annually by Associated Television International, which then coordinated airings on the Hallmark Channel, and in traditional syndication in later years. Since 2015, the parade has been recorded and edited, then aired as a part of The CW's annual holiday programming, still being produced by ATI (thus airing on KTLA locally as a part of the CW lineup). Lifestyle also carries the parade internationally. ==Grand Marshals== * 1928 - Jeanette Loff * 1932 - Joe E. Brown * 1940 - Joan Leslie * 1971 - Johnny Mathis * 1972 - General Robert E.

This effect is often mistakenly said to be part of the grain of the wood; it is more accurately called \\"figure\\", as the distortion is perpendicular to the grain direction. Prized for its beautiful appearance, it is used frequently in the manufacturing of fine furniture and musical instruments, such as violins, guitars, and bassoons. During the westward expansion of early settlers and explorers into the lands west of the Appalachian Mountains, curly maple was often used for making the stocks used on Kentucky rifles. == Usage in Guitars == Popularization Flame maple is especially popular in guitars, and has been for decades. Generally, the process includes cutting the maple to shape, forming it if necessary through mold-warping and applying a clear coat or lacquer to protect the finish, and ensure the wood holds its shape. Controversy Among guitar communities, one debate always present is that of tonality. This is the debate on how much or how little the instrument's material affects its sound. While this is a massive debate in itself, flame maple is a hardwood which is generally regarded to produce a bright, shimmering sound, due to its rigidity and reflection against sound waves. This effect is generally noticeable in acoustic flame-maple guitars, but arguably insignificant in electric guitars. Additionally, the effects of clear-coating or applying nitro to a flame maple finish are also up for debate. ==Variations== ===Figures on (1958-1960)=== 1958 Gibson Les Paul with light flame pattern According to the Beauty Of The Burst by Yasuhiko Watanabe, the figures seen on the sunburst Les Paul are categorized into 8 types: 6 types of flame maple (Curly, Ribbon curly, Flame, Tiger stripe, Fiddleback, Pin stripe), and 2 other types (Blister and Bird's eye).

It is reached from Rome at Placentia via the Via Flaminia (dark blue) followed by the Via Aemilia (red). The Via Postumia was an ancient Roman road of northern Italy constructed in 148 BC by the consul Spurius Postumius Albinus Magnus. It ran from the coast at Genua through the mountains to Dertona, Placentia (the termination of the Via Aemilia) and Cremona, just east of the point where it crossed the Po River. From Cremona the road ran eastward to Bedriacum, the current town of Calvatone, where it forked, one branch running to the right to Mantua, the other to the left to Verona, crossing the Adige river on the Ponte Pietra, the only bridge on the Adige river at that time, and then traversing the Venetian plain, crossing the Piave River at Maserada sul Piave until finally reaching Aquileia, an important military frontier town founded by Rome in 181 BC. The Roman conquest of Liguria depended upon this road, and several of the more important towns owed their origin largely to it. Cremona was its central point, the distance being reckoned from it both eastwards and westwards. Via Julia Augusta is the name given to the Roman road by Augustus Caesar's efforts starting in 13 BC to merge the Via Aemilia Scauri with the Via Postumia, running from Placentia (modern Piacenza) to a triumphal arch in La Turbie, France. It is later extended to Arelates (modern Arles) joining the Via Domitia, through Dertona (Tortona), Vada Sabatia (Vado Ligure), Albingaunum (Albenga) and Album Intimilium (Ventimiglia).

The original station operated from 1840 to 1985 and was accessed via the north side of Lea Bridge Road as it crosses the tracks. ==History== ===19th century=== The station was opened on 15 September 1840 by the Northern and Eastern Railway as Lea Bridge Road and is thought to be the earliest example of a station having its building on a road bridge, with staircases down to the platforms. The original station building was an attractive Italianate style structure designed by Sancton Wood (1815-1886) and featured a bell turret on the roof with a bell that was rung when a train was due. The line was initially laid to a gauge of but already this had been identified as non- standard, and between 5 September and 7 October 1844 the whole network was re- laid to . The Northern and Eastern Railway was leased by the Eastern Counties Railway, which operated the station. The ECR became part of the Great Eastern Railway (GER) in 1862. The GER established its signal works (which included a dummy signal box) on the eastern side of the line; the works were demolished in 1939 and replaced by a parcels depot. To the south of the station were the large Temple Mills marshalling yards, and the station would have seen large numbers of goods trains passing. In 1870 a line was opened to Shern Hall Street station (a temporary station located west of the present-day Wood Street station) and a shuttle service operated between Lea Bridge and Shern Hall Street, commencing traffic on 24 April 1870. Prior to this, a horse bus operating between Walthamstow and Lea Bridge had met all trains arriving at the station. The station was renamed Lea Bridge in 1841. ===20th century=== In 1923 the GER became part of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). In the 1930s the station was served by trains to Liverpool Street (via Stratford), to North Woolwich (via Stratford low level platforms), and to Hertford East and Palace Gates. At that time there were Sunday services via the Hall Farm curve to the Chingford branch. On 31 March 1944 the station building was gutted by fire, although the frontage survived. After World War II, in 1948, the railways of the UK were nationalised, and operation of the station passed to British Railways Eastern Region. The Hall Farm spur line through to the Chingford branch was rarely used and, despite being electrified in 1960, the line was lifted in 1967. ===Closure=== The station became an unstaffed halt in 1976 and the station building was demolished at about that time. By then, the only trains serving Lea Bridge were those operating between Tottenham Hale and North Woolwich via Stratford (low level platforms), and the withdrawal of that service led to the closure of the station on 8 July 1985. The simple open-sided shelter, located on the road bridge over the tracks, and which had replaced the original station buildings, was also demolished in 1985. The last train consisted of a two-car Cravens Class 105 DMU. ===Re- opening=== In December 2005 a new service to and from Stratford reintroduced regular passenger trains passing through the closed station. For many years, plans were under consideration to rebuild and reopen the station and the nearby Hall Farm Curve junction, as part of wider plans for the redevelopment of the Stratford and Lower Lea Valley area. In January 2013 it was announced that plans had been approved to rebuild and reopen the station. Construction on the £6.5m scheme was planned to start in spring 2014. The station was included in Network Rail's Route Specification for Anglia in 2014 for opening within the next five years. In October 2013, the overgrown platforms were cleared in preparation for construction of the new station building. The new buildings were to be situated on the up side (towards Stratford) rather than on the road bridge over the line, and the platforms were to be linked by a footbridge. Estimates by Transport for London (TfL) show 352,000 entries and exits annually by 2031 with a service of two trains per hour. It was hoped that—after 29 years of closure—the station would reopen in late 2014. The construction date slipped, but work started in July 2015; the station reopened on the evening of Sunday 15 May 2016 with the full service beginning on Monday, 16 May 2016. ==Services== All services at Lea Bridge are run by Greater Anglia.

However, Skynet learns of the time travel attempt and sends Terminators to stop Flo. In the game, the player controls RoboCop, who may move across the screen, jump, fire and exchange weapons. RoboCop starts with the Auto-9 which has unlimited ammunition. Other weapons may be more powerful and carry unlimited ammunition as well. Beginning the game on a mission of law enforcement, RoboCop soon meets up with Flo and must engage in battle against Terminators, the forces of OCP and several obstacles. Upon discovering one of the Terminators has infiltrated the OCP building, RoboCop plugs himself into a console to reprogram the security, only to fall into a trap and be digitized. After his body is disassembled and used for building Skynet, RoboCop watches Skynet come to power before using his digitized mind to seize control of an abandoned robotics factory, rebuild himself, and begin to destroy Skynet in the future. ==RoboCop (2001)== In 1999, Titus Software acquired the rights for RoboCop video games. By 2001, Titus had begun development of a RoboCop game for the Game Boy Color (GBC) and Game Boy Advance (GBA), with an expected release in the fourth quarter of 2001. The GBA version featured identical gameplay to the 1988 RoboCop game. The GBC version was released later that year. In May 2002, Titus unveiled more screenshots of the GBA version, which was expected for release in October 2002, but the game was ultimately cancelled. ==RoboCop (2003)== RoboCop was developed and published by Titus in 2003, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, and Xbox. The following year, Titus released a GameCube version in Japan, under the title . The game allows the player to play as RoboCop and to uncover a sinister plot involving OCP, local gangsters dealing a deadly new synthetic drug and a powerful cyborg known only as MIND. As a last hope, RoboCop must capture, destroy, or arrest hostile characters in a desperate search for clues and evidence. The Xbox version received \\"unfavorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. ==RoboCop (2004)== RoboCop is a side-scrolling action platform game. It was released for mobile phones and is based on the 1987 film, featuring RoboCop as he attempts to stop Clarence Boddicker and his gang. Developer Digital Bridges announced the game in May 2004, as part of an agreement with MGM to produce video games based on the studio's film franchises. RoboCop was released in North America in October 2004. IGN rated the game 8.5 out of 10, praising the graphics and music. ==RoboCop (2014)== RoboCop is a 2014 free-to-play shooter game developed and published by Glu Mobile for iOS and Android. The game served as a tie-in to the 2014 RoboCop remake film, although it follows a different plot in which RoboCop fights against holographic enemies and robots in a training simulation. RoboCop is played as a third-person shooter. RoboCop can use various weapons throughout the game's missions, and can also take cover behind objects. RoboCop was in a soft launch phase in Canada as of October 2013. The game was released for iOS on January 7, 2014, while the Android version was released on January 15, prior to the film's release in February 2014. RoboCop received \\"Mixed or average reviews\\" according to Metacritic. Some reviewers criticized the game's free-to-play aspects. Slide to Play, while praising the game's cover system, was critical of \\"some of the most aggressive attempts at monetization that we've seen yet,\\" stating that the game's \\"best weapons are enormously expensive, and some premium weapons cost over $100 in in-app purchases.\\" However, Slide to Play stated that the game was fun by focusing on its progression and action while ignoring the microtransactions. TouchArcade wrote that the game \\"suffers greatly\\" from the free-to-play elements, but praised the gameplay, graphics, sounds, and controls, stating that \\"It's probably one of the more competent Robocop games ever made, actually.\\" Pete Davison of USgamer called it a \\"technically impressive but shallow, derivative, money- hungry waste of time,\\" stating that, \\"Being a freemium mobile game, Robocop comes with all the annoyances we've come to expect.\\" Steven Burns of VideoGamer.com considered the game to be boring and repetitive, while stating that the free-to-play aspect \\"negatively affects what little gameplay is there\\". Peter Willington of Pocket Gamer praised the game as \\"quick to understand, and simple to play,\\" but criticized it as repetitive, ultimately calling it \\"competent but forgettable\\". Alex de Vore of Gamezebo praised the graphics but criticized the \\"Boring, needless dialog\\" and the \\"utterly forgettable\\" music, and concluded, \\"Everything from the boring shooting to the lack of any real control just reeks of a rush job.\\" IGN called the game \\"formulaic and forgettable\\". ==References== ==External links== * *Robocop at CPC Zone *Robocop Games Information on several games in the franchise. *Robocop at MobyGames *Robocop PlayStation Tech Demo at The PlayStation Museum * http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/action/robocop/review.html * Robocop ","title":"List of RoboCop video games"},{"id":"3251276","text":"Siegfried Rädel (7 March 1893 - 10 May 1943) was a German politician, a member of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and a resistance fighter against the Nazi régime. ==Biography== Rädel was born in Pirna-Copitz, Saxony. At the age of 20, in 1913, Rädel became a soldier. With his Pioneer Battalion, he lived through four years of World War I on the front lines and was wounded twice. In 1919, his colleagues elected him as the chairman of the plant council at the rayon works in Pirna. As of 1921, he was a town councillor in Pirna and leader of the KPD faction. He also became a member of the KPD central committee, and from 1924 to 1933, a member of the Reichstag. With some interruptions, he was for many years either a candidate or a member of the KPD central committee. Rädel's commitment to the relief efforts for those affected by floodwaters in the Gottleuba and Müglitz valleys between 1927 and 1932 is well known, as is his commitment to dam construction aimed at controlling the floods. However, such a system of dams was not realized until much later, between 1958 and 1974 – retention basins in Buschbach, Liebstadt, Friedrichswalde-Ottendorf, Mordgrundbach and Glashütte, and the Gottleuba dam. Rädel's endeavours to organize social initiatives, powers, and organizations led in 1927 to the founding of the Work Community of Social-Political Organizations (Arbeitsgemeinschaft sozialpolitischer Organisationen; ARSO) on a national scale. The ARSO, with Rädel as publisher, published the magazine Proletarische Sozialpolitik beginning in May 1928. Rädel was among the German delegates at the World Peace Congress in August 1928 in Amsterdam. After Adolf Hitler and the Nazis seized power in 1933, Rädel had to go into exile. He went to Prague, France, the Soviet Union, and Zürich. The Party began proceedings against him for \\"factional activities\\", but this ended with a simple reprimand. The Swiss police arrested him in late 1936 along with his partner, Maria Weiterer, with whom he had lived and worked since 1927. In France, where he found himself after being expelled from Switzerland, the Secretariat of the KPD Central Committee, which at that time was based in Paris, transferred to Rädel the leadership of the Communist emigrant organization. Rädel took part in attempts to build up an antifascist people's front while in France. At the KPD's \\"Bern Conference\\" in Draveil near Paris, he was chosen to be one of the 17 members of the Central Committee. Among his circle of German émigré friends were Heinrich Mann, Lion Feuchtwanger, Rudolf Leonhard, Leonhard Frank and Paul Merker. Extensive work in publicity was undertaken against fascist German aggression politics. However, with the German-Soviet non-aggression pact came the arrest and detention in 1940 of every German Communist émigré in France, including Rädel, who was delivered to Le Vernet concentration camp. In 1942, Rädel was handed over to the Gestapo by the Vichy régime. In a high treason trial, he was sentenced by the Volksgerichtshof to death on 25 February 1943, shortly before his 50th birthday, and executed on 10 May 1943 in the infamous \\"murder garage\\" at Brandenburg Prison. The rayon plant in Pirna was named after Rädel when Pirna was part of East Germany. With reunification, his name disappeared, and in the end, the rayon plant was later shut down and then demolished. However, a street in downtown Pirna is still named after him. ==External links== *Speech for Siegfried Rädel, given on 13 March 1993 in Pirna on the occasion of his 100th birthday ==References== Category:1893 births Category:1943 deaths Category:German military personnel of World War I Category:Communist Party of Germany politicians Category:People condemned by Nazi courts Category:People from the Kingdom of Saxony Category:Communists in the German Resistance Category:Members of the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic ","title":"Siegfried Rädel"},{"id":"3251292","text":"Calamine most commonly refers to calamine lotion.

He studied at Reims under Gerbert, afterwards Pope Silvester II, who taught him mathematics, history, letters and eloquence. He was also well versed in the medical science of his time, and in 991 travelled to Chartres to consult the medical manuscripts there. He was still living in 998, but there is no mention of him after that date. ==Historiae== In the 19th century, it was thought by both French and German scholars that Richerus was an ardent supporter of the Carolingians and French supremacy, as opposed to the Ottonians, but this view has since been tempered somewhat. Whatever one makes of Richer's political biases, inaccuracies and his taste for stylistic embellishment, his Historiae has a unique value as giving us the only tolerably full account by a contemporary of the memorable revolution of 987, which placed the Capets on the throne of France. The Historiae, in four books, spans the period from 888 to 995. It begins with Charles the Fat and Eudes, and goes down to the year 995. For the first two books, Richerus made extensive use of the annals and church history written by Flodoard (d. 966). From 969 onwards Richerus had no earlier history before him, and his work is the chief source for the period. The history survives in a single manuscript (Bamberg State Library, Msc.Hist.5), discovered in the early part of the nineteenth century. It was the author's autograph and showed signs of continuous revision, probably until his death. ==References== ==Bibliography== ===Editions and translations=== *Lake, Justin (ed. and tr.)

The grandson of a Crimean Jew (Krymchak), Selvinsky grew up in Evpatoriya in the family of a furrier merchant. In 1919, Selvinsky graduated from a gymnasium in Evpatoriya, spending his summers as a vagabond and trying his hands at different trades, including sailing, fishing, working as a longshoreman and circus wrestler, and acting in an itinerant theater. Selvinsky published his first poem in 1915 and in the 1920s experimented with the use of Yiddishisms and thieves' lingo in Russian verse. He is credited with innovations in Russian versification, including the proliferation of taktovik, a Russian nonclassical meter. Extensive travel and turbulent adventures fueled Selvinsky's longer narrative works and cycles, \\"loadified\\" (term used by the Russian constructivists) with local color. Selvinsky briefly joined the anarchist troops in the Russian Civil War but later fought on the side of the Reds. He moved to Moscow in 1921 and studied law at Moscow University, graduating in 1922. From 1924 until its dismantlement in 1930, Selvinsky was the leader of the Literary Center of Constructivists (LTsK), an early Soviet modernist group, and edited several landmark anthologies by constructivist authors (e.g., The State Plan of Literature). In the late 1920s, the LtsK counted among its members poets Eduard Bagritsky, Vera Inber, and Vladimir Lugovskoy; critic Kornely Zelinsky; prose writer Evgeny Gabrilovich; and others. In the middle to late 1920s, after the publication of Records, The Lay of Ulyalaev (1924) and the narrative poem Notes of a Poet (1927), Selvinsky achieved fame and acclaim. In 1929, his tragedy Army 2 Commander was staged by Vsevolod Meyerhold. Selvinsky's major early Jewish works include Bar Kokhba (1920, published 1924), a powerful monument to Jewish—and Judaic—survival; \\"Anecdotes about the Karaite Philosopher Babakai-Sudduk\\" (1931); \\"Motke Malech-hamovess [Motke the Angel of Death]\\" (1926); and The Lay of Ulyalaev. \\"Portrait of My Mother\\" (1933) contains a constructivist bitter comment about Jewish-Soviet assimilation: \\"Henceforth her son's face will remain defiled/Like the Judaic Jerusalem,/Having suddenly become a Christian holy site.\\" In the late 1930s Selvinsky was an important mentor to the younger generation of Soviet Russian poets. During World War II, Selvinsky served as a military journalist and combat political officer in his native Crimea, North Caucasus, and Kuban. He joined the Communist Party in 1941, and was wounded and decorated for valor. In the poem \\"I Saw It!\\" (\\"Ia eto videl!\\"), composed in January 1942 and published shortly thereafter, Selvinsky depicted the aftermath of the mass execution, in November–December 1941, of thousands of Jews at the so-called Bagerovo anti-tank ditch outside the Crimean city of Kerch. According to the research of Maxim D. Shrayer, Selvinsky's \\"I Saw It!\\" was the first literary text about the Shoah by bullet in the occupied Soviet territories to reach a nationwide audience. In late 1943 Lieutenant Colonel Selvinsky was summoned to Moscow, punitively dismissed from the army, and subjected to repressions. Especially devastating was the February 10, 1944 resolution of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, \\"About I. Selvinsky's Poem 'To whom Russia sang a lullaby….'\\" In April 1945, Selvinsky's status was finally restored, and he was allowed to return to the frontlines. One of the principal Soviet literary witnesses to the Shoah, Selvinsky treated the topic of the mass extermination of Jews by the Nazis and their accomplices in two other works of 1942, \\"Kerch\\" and \\"A Reply to Goebbels,\\" and in other wartime poems. Selvinsky's long poem Kandava (1945) unfolds around a nightmare in which he imagines himself and his wife \\"somewhere in Auschwitz/or Maidanek.\\" Through a combination of personal bravery and political navigation, Selvinsky weathered the storms of Stalinism. He remained a proud Jew during the most antisemitic of the Soviet years and despite direct official ostracism. Shortly before his death, Selvinsky published the autobiographical novel O My Youth (1966), where Jewish themes figured prominently. Selvinsky died in Moscow in 1968. A poetic virtuoso of high caliber, Selvinsky holds a prominent place in the history of modern Russian poetry and in the history of Jewish literature and Shoah literature. Selvinsky's uneclipsed literary achievements include the epic poem The Lay of Ulyalaev and the novel in verse Fur Trade (1928). ==References== Vera S. Babenko.

The Information and Communication Technology (ICT) project, under way in all member institutions of FOTIM, has as two of its major aims the fostering of flexible learning and the building of capacity through human resource training and skills development in the information technology area. Other FOTIM initiatives include matters pertaining to access, quality assurance, disability, HIV/AIDS and regional clearance of academic programmes. A number of workshops and meetings addressing these topics took place in 2001. On the issue of academic programme collaboration, FOTIM commissioned two consultants to investigate opportunities for collaboration in the region. A report entitled Academic Programme Collaboration in the FOTIM Region is being examined and discussed by the senior management of member institutions. A meeting will be convened early in 2002 to consider the consultants' recommendations.

He has been a member and/or founder of over half a dozen groups, most of whose work has been recorded at The Chickenhouse, his well outfitted home studio in his hometown of Uppsala. His work with the band Samla Mammas Manna, in the late 1960s and early 1970s and up to 2002, when the re-formed group played at the two-day ProgDay festival in North Carolina, was and is considered progressive rock. However, he is most centrally an empathetic and generous collaborator: whether as a member of Accordion Tribe, while working with the experimental guitarist Fred Frith, or while spending several months with Japanese jazz players, he seems to find a style that brings his partners to the fore while remaining identifiably himself. Though his work is little known in the United States, he won a Swedish Grammis award in 1999 for his record Andetag. He has also composed extensively for Swedish film, as well as for theatre and dance productions. Consistent elements of his music throughout his career included use of irregular time signatures (often changing several times within a piece), a daring sense of improvisation (particularly vocal improvisation that utilized nonsense syllables), and used complex polyrhythms. Hollmer died in December 2008 of cancer, aged 60.

G-Mode currently owns the intellectual property rights to the Side Pocket series, and licenses these games globally. ==Gameplay== Mega Drive/Genesis version), showing a lit-up pocket. The primary play mode, called \\"Pocket Game\\", is a straight pool game set within a limited number of lives; the player must achieve a predetermined score to advance through four or five levels, each with increasing number of balls. The player earns points by potting balls, potting balls on consecutive shots, and potting balls in numerical order. On occasion, a flashing star appear in a pocket, and if the player pots a ball into that pocket in the same shot, a bonus will be awarded in the form of points, extra lives or a bonus round. One life is lost if the player or fails to pot a ball in two consecutive shots. In the two-player mode, the player can choose between Pocket Game or 9-Ball Game. In two-player Pocket Game, the game plays similarly, except the two players take turns and there are no lives; if one player misses or scratches, control of the ball simply changes to the other player. In 9-Ball Game, each player have three lives and one life is lost if a is committed. However, the lives will be restored if the player makes a legal shot on the next turn. In the Game Boy and Game Gear version, there is also an additional practice mode, which is essentially a single-player version of 9-Ball Game. A variety of trick shot challenges are also available to the player(s), to earn additional points or extra life, requiring the player pot all balls into select pockets using a single shot. The player may put various spins on the ball, such as left and right , and perform and .North American SNES Cover art. The Genesis and SNES versions features a photo-realistic representation of the player characters. The characters are a homage to the 1986 billiards-themed film The Color of Money; with the characters bear resemblance Vincent Lauria (played by Tom Cruise) and Fast Eddie (played by Paul Newman), the two main characters from the film. ==Version differences== ===Original=== The original Side Pocket on the arcade was ported to the NES and Game Boy with several alterations. The NES version plays almost identical to the arcade version, but the Pocket Game mode features 4 levels and the player starts by possessing 5 lives, as opposed to 2. The NES version also introduce four different rack configuration that become standard in later versions, whereas the arcade version only feature six-ball and nine-ball racks. The Game Boy version of Side Pocket is significantly different from the NES version, featuring a smaller playing field (to compensate with Game Boy's screen), simplified physics and a different screen layout. Like in NES version, the Pocket Game mode features 4 levels and the player starts with 5 lives. One unique addition to the Game Boy version is the ability to play single-player nine-ball mode, while in other versions this mode is limited only to two players. ===Enhanced remake=== An enhanced remake was released for the Sega Genesis, SNES and Game Gear. This version features completely different contents compared to the original, including revamped graphics, new smooth jazz-oriented soundtrack, new sound effects and photo-realistic background sceneries during gameplay. The main game modes remain identical to the original, with several alteration on the Pocket Game mode. This mode now features 5 levels represented as \\"cities\\" (Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas, New York, and Atlantic City) and the player starts with 8 lives. In addition, a new \\"trick shot\\" mode is featured, in which the player can try one of the 19 trick shot levels, each with increasing difficulty. The SNES port is otherwise identical with the Genesis version, apart from different soundtrack set and better graphics. The Game Gear version, despite being part of the enhanced remake, it plays more akin to the original rendition, more specifically the NES version. However, most elements from the Genesis version are retained, such as the background images (scaled down to 8-bit), soundtrack, and the trick shot levels. ==Reception== In Japan, Game Machine listed Side Pocket on their August 1, 1986 issue as being the eighth most-successful table arcade unit of the year. In reviewing the NES version, Computer Gaming World declared it \\"far and away the best billiards simulation ever published for any system\\". The features that went beyond realistic pool were especially praised as enhancing the game's play. Reviewing the SNES version, GamePro praised the variety of modes, the audio and graphical improvements over the NES version, and the realistic details. They recommended the game \\"for pool enthusiasts and casual video game pool players alike. There are plenty of great options and genuine pool strategies to keep serious players interested, and yet it's simple enough to play without the manual.\\" They gave the Game Gear version a more mixed review, commenting that the representation of the player's stick as a stream of balls is needlessly cumbersome, and that the graphics and sound are poor. However, they summarized, \\"Determining the precise angle and power for a shot can be harder than taking a geometry test, but it's definitely more fun.\\" Electronic Gaming Monthly also complained of poor sounds but were more impressed with the graphics, describing them as exceptional for a portable system. They praised the game for its trick shots and generally strategic gameplay and gave it a 6.25 out of 10. Entertainment Weekly gave the game a B- and wrote that \\"Insipid electronic lounge sounds are an integral component of Side Pocket (for Genesis), which presents American pool halls as a series of squeaky-clean (no beer stains on the felt here), nonconfrontational venues where your sole objective is to play pool — and not, say, impress your date with how many shots of tequila you can down in five minutes. Embodying this utilitarian approach is the game's hyper-realistic, overhead-angle table display — not as realistic, unfortunately, is its follow-the-dotted-line aiming system, which allows you to hit the cue ball in only about half a dozen places. An extensive trick-shot menu — apparently meant to compensate for this glaring limitation — is intriguing, but completely superfluous.\\"https://ew.com/article/1992/10/30/side-pocket/ Italian magazine Consolmania, however, gave the Genesis version 80.https://archive.org/details/Consolemania-014/page/n39 == Pocket Gal == Pocket Gal arcade video game. Pocket Gal Deluxe arcade video game. Pocket Gal is the arcade adaptation of the NES version of Side Pocket released exclusively for Japan in 1987. Gameplay remains similar to the NES game, although the lesser number of lives makes the game more challenging. It also has different music and sound effects, alongside hidden explicit imagery as rewards for completing certain levels. An English version was also released under the name Pocket Gal 2. There is also another version of the game called Super Pool III which removes the hidden explicit images. This version was published by I-Vics in North America. In 1992, a sequel called Pocket Gal Deluxe was released in Japan and Europe. While the gameplay remains the same, Pocket Gal Deluxe features revamped graphics, more levels and includes a MIDI- based jazz music. Furthermore, Pocket Gal Deluxe also serve as the basis for the Genesis and SNES versions of Side Pocket. ==Sequels== The game has two sequels, Side Pocket 2 and Side Pocket 3. Side Pocket 2 expands greatly upon the original game by adding various pool games (including eight-ball, straight pool, and one-pocket) and the ability to play against AI-controlled players. Side Pocket 3 introduces a first-person three dimensional graphics. ==References== ==External links== *Official G-Mode webpage of the Side Pocket series *Side Pocket at Killer List of Videogames * *Side Pocket Franchise at GameFAQs Category:1986 video games Category:1987 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Cue sports video games Category:Data East video games Category:Marvelous Entertainment franchises Category:Game Boy games Category:Sega Game Gear games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Virtual Console games Category:WonderSwan games Category:Data East arcade games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games ","title":"Side Pocket"},{"id":"3251360","text":"Bolshoye Maslennikovo () is a village in Tutayevsky District of Yaroslavl Oblast, Russia, located about 20 km to the west from Yaroslavl.

It is one of the four groundbreaking papers Einstein published in 1905, in Annalen der Physik, in his miracle year. In 1827, botanist Robert Brown used a microscope to look at dust grains floating in water. He found that the floating grains were moving about erratically; a phenomenon that became known as \\"Brownian motion\\". This was thought to be caused by water molecules knocking the grains about. In 1905, Albert Einstein proved the reality of these molecules and their motions by producing the first statistical physics analysis of Brownian motion. French physicist Jean Perrin used Einstein's results to experimentally determine the mass, and the dimensions, of atoms, thereby conclusively verifying Dalton's atomic theory. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated whether atoms were real entities. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms with an ordinary microscope. Wilhelm Ostwald, one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told Arnold Sommerfeld that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion. The paper also provided the best way up to that time of estimating Avogadro's Number—the corrected value from Einstein's paper was accurate to one significant figure. ==References* Category:1905 in science Category:1905 documents Category:Works by Albert Einstein Category:Physics papers Category:Works originally published in Annalen der Physik ","title":"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen"},{"id":"3251423","text":"A caddie is an assistant to a golf player.

Born and raised in Arizona, he was the son of David King Udall, a politician, and Eliza Stewart Udall, the first telegraph operator in the Arizona Territory. He was named after his grandfather, Levi Stewart. He was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In 1914 he married Louisa Lee, a granddaughter of John D. Lee and Jacob Hamblin. They would later have six children. He passed the Arizona Bar exam in 1922, and was admitted to the bar, without having earned a law degree (a common practice in those days). Later that year he succeeded his father as stake president of the St. Johns Stake, a position he held until 1945. In 1922, he lost a bid to be elected as clerk to the Arizona Superior Court. He was defeated by his older brother John Hunt Udall. In 1946 he was elected to the Arizona Supreme Court, and remained a Justice of that court from 1947 until his death. In 1948 Udall wrote the majority opinion of the Arizona State Supreme Court granting Native Americans living on reservations the right to vote. From 1951-1952 and 1957-1958 he served as the Chief Justice of that court. In 1960 he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Arizona. He died on May 30 of that year. ==Legacy== *His half- brother, Jesse Addison Udall, succeeded him as Justice and later Chief Justice of the Arizona Supreme court. *His son Stewart Udall, was a U.S. Congressman from Arizona, and U.S. Secretary of the Interior. *Another of his sons, Mo Udall, was a U.S. Congressman for 30 years, and a candidate for President of the United States in 1976. *His grandson, Mark Udall, was a U.S. Senator from Colorado from 2009-2015 and was a U.S. Congressman from 1999 to 2009. *His grandson, Tom Udall, is a U.S. Senator from New Mexico from 2009-2021 and was a U.S. Congressman from 1999 to 2009. * His son, D.

The area today is in part occupied by the small hamlet of Villa Potenza, part of the comune of Macerata, and is partially used as farmland. The town is located at the junction of the river Flosis with a crossroad of the Via Salaria Gallica Gallica and a byroad of the Via Flaminia. ==History== Due to small-scale rescue digs in several parts of the town, it is suggested that Ricina was already quite extensively occupied from the later 2nd century BC on however most of the urban evidence belongs to the period between the 1st century BC and the 4th century AD. Ricina became a municipium from the mid-1st century BC when the first colonists, veterans of the Civil Wars, were settled here. It flourished under the reigns of Augustus (27 BC - AD 14) and Tiberius (AD 14-37) to judge by a series of funerary monuments and inscriptions which probably originate from a cemetery on the SW side, the construction of an aqueduct, and the largest theatre in Picenum. During the 2nd century AD a good deal of public building was achieved and squares and streets were repaved. Traces of a baths complex near the theatre and parts of houses with mosaic floors are also dated to the 2nd century AD. But as early as the first half of the 2nd century AD the municipal finances seem to decline when a curator rei publicae Riciniensium was appointed. During the reign of Septimius Severus (AD 193-211), the town became a colony with the name Helvia Ricina Pertinax (CIL IX 5747), in honour of Septimius’ predecessor. The town may have suffered from invasions in the 5th and 6th centuries AD, with the remaining population seeking new dwellings in the hills to the east and west of the former Roman town. ==Research== Due to several aerial photography campaigns and surveys on the farmland conducted by the Potenza Valley Survey Project (Ghent University) more information has been available about the general layout and organization of the town. Recently in July and October 2013, also geophysical surveys were undertaken by the geophysical survey company Eastern Atlas with the objective of locating and mapping more remains of subsurface archaeological features in Trea. Also the recent study of the Roman pottery to deliver chronological clues and help to determine functional zones as well as the study of stone architectural decoration to gain more insights in the embellishment of the town, has led to more information. It seems that the layout of the town was a fairly regular and quite flat, almost rectangular area of c. 22 ha. The valley road from Trea to Potentia crossed roughly the centre of town from southwest to northeast and served as its main decumanus. One main NW-SE axis, if confirmed by further fieldwork, could have linked the main decumanus with the Roman bridge over the Potenza, which earlier observations located a few meters upstream from the present-day bridge. This street passed directly in front of and parallel with the stage building of the theatre. The forum was probably located near the intersection of the north-south axis with the main decumanus. Although a major part of the ancient town is built over by the houses and streets of Villa Potenza, several large buildings can be distinguished in the crops of the fields north of the central area. One of them is a rectangular building (at least 18 x 33 m) oriented northwest-southeast, perpendicular to the main decumanus and possibly bordering a forum on its south. This was probably the main temple (Capitolium?) of Helvia Ricina. Other traces of buildings may be seen in the fields: several large domus, a large cistern, which may point to a nearby public facility or baths and a row of similar rectangular rooms, flanked by a corridor or portico suggest a set of tabernae or possibly a horreum. The latter is supported by the presence of many dolia and amphora sherds found at this location. There are also signs of habitation outside the walls, more specifically directly southwest of the town, outside the presumed location of the southwest gate and alongside the road to Trea as well as at the northeast side of the town were crop-marks and a wide scatter of Roman material point to an extramural settlement. The theatre is the only well-preserved remain of the city above ground. It has a cavea of 71.80 m diameter and is now surrounded by modern houses of Villa Potenza. During an aerial photography campaign conducted by the PVS team in May 2009 clear traces of an amphitheatre were detected as well. The building, positioned east of the theatre, was possibly originally connected with it and thus formed part of one architectural complex. Because of its position on the main east-west road along the valley to the coastal town of Potentia, which acts as the town’s decumanus, Ricina can be characterized as a road-town. ==See also== * Archaeological Park of Urbs Salvia * Ancient Ostra * Potentia (ancient city) * Sentinum * Septempeda * Suasa ==References== * Percossi Serenelli, E., Pignocchi, G. and Vermeulen, F.

The complex is located south of downtown in the Barelas neighborhood, bounded by Second Street, Hazeldine Avenue, Commercial Street, and Pacific Avenue. The shops were one of four major maintenance facilities constructed by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, the others being located in Topeka, Kansas, Cleburne, Texas, and San Bernardino, California. The railway shops were the largest employer in the city during the railroad's heyday. Currently they have been empty for years but a variety of plans have been proposed for the historic complex. ==History== Railroad workers forging a part in the blacksmith shop, 1943 Railroad shops and a roundhouse were first erected on the site in the 1880s, after Albuquerque was designated as the division point between the AT&SF; railway and the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. After buying out the A&P; in 1902, the Santa Fe Railway began expanding and modernizing the old A&P; shops in 1912. The first buildings to be completed were the roundhouse, storehouse, power station, and freight car shops, all of which were located south of the surviving complex near the present Bridge Boulevard overpass. These structures have since been demolished, but the subsequent buildings completed after 1915 are all still standing. The current railyard buildings were constructed between 1915 and 1925. The shops became Albuquerque's largest employer, with 970 employees (then about a quarter of the city's workforce) in 1919, and a peak of 1,500 in the 1940s. The core operation was maintenance of steam locomotives, which required a complete rebuild every 12 to 18 months. At their peak, the Albuquerque shops completed around 40 such overhauls per month. However, activity at the railyard declined in the 1950s as the Santa Fe transitioned from steam to diesel locomotives. The railroad decided to locate its diesel repair facilities at the Cleburne and San Bernardino yards, scaling back operations in Albuquerque to around 200 employees. The shops continued to operate as maintenance-of-way equipment repair shops into the 1980s. ==Buildings== ===Erection/Machine shop=== Interior of the main bay in the erection shop By far the largest building at the railyard is the erection and machine shop, which spans the full width of the site from Second to Commercial and contains about of floor space. The building was designed in 1920 and built in eight months starting in February 1921. The erection shop and machine shop are within one building, separated by a wall on the south side of the erection shop. At the time it was considered to be at the forefront of industrial design, comparable to the Glass Plant at the Ford River Rouge Complex in Michigan. The building has a steel structure, with uninterrupted glass curtain walls on the north and south faces and more substantial reinforced concrete facades on the east and west sides. The expansive main bay (erection shop) is high and long with several overhead cranes, the largest of which has a 250-ton capacity. The building is floored with wooden blocks to cut down on noise. The boiler shop and transfer table ===Boiler shop=== The smaller boiler shop, which was completed in 1923, stands to the north of the erection shop and is similar to it in design and appearance. It has a floor area of . Like the erection shop, the boiler shop employs a cross-axial design with track rail perpendicular to the main axis of the building. ===Blacksmith shop=== The blacksmith shop was completed in 1917 and stands to the east of the boiler shop. It is the third largest building on the site at approximately . The building is of steel frame construction with brick and glass exterior walls. The blacksmith shop was responsible for repairing cracked locomotive frames as well as forging replacement parts. ===Fire station=== The fire station in 2014 Another significant structure is the fire station, a rustic, Mediterranean-style building with sandstone walls, crenelated parapets, and an asymmetrical corner tower. It was designed by E.A. Harrison and stands on the northwest corner of the railyard complex, near the intersection of First and Second streets. Built in 1920, it is the oldest surviving fire station in Albuquerque. The building has been designated an Albuquerque historic landmark and is thus protected from alteration without city approval. ===Other buildings=== The complex includes around a dozen other buildings including the flue shop (1920), tank shop (1925), and storehouse (1915). The railroad shops as seen from the Barelas neighborhood ==Current status== Various ideas have been discussed for reusing the Santa Fe shops, including a transportation museum to be called the Wheels Museum, mixed-income housing, a multi-use retail and exposition center, and a state-of-the-art digital film studio. The complex was purchased by the city of Albuquerque in 2007 for $8.5 million. In 2011, a California-based developer was selected to lead the redevelopment of the site, but the contract was canceled in 2018 after little progress during the intervening years. Mayor Tim Keller tore up the contract at a press conference and announced that subsequent redevelopment efforts would be led by the city. The complex was added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties and the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. In 2013, the city spent $900,000 to repair and stabilize the Blacksmith Shop building, hoping to rent it out for special events. Since 2014, the building has hosted the Rail Yards Market, a weekly farmers' market which operates from May through October. As of 2018, the city plans to repair a second building to add more space for the market and other special events. Since the 2000s, the unused railyard has become a popular filming location. Movies with scenes filmed there include Beerfest (2006), The Spirit (2008), Gamer (2009), Terminator Salvation (2009), and The Avengers (2012). The pilot episode of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles also used the railyard as a location. Several Episodes of Sci-Fi's Lost Room were filmed there, as was the yet to be released 0000 movie. Several scenes in the AMC television series Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul were shot at the shops. The cover of the DVD for the Fifth Season of Breaking Bad is a photo of Walter White inside the shops. ==References== ==External links== *Wheels Museum Category:Buildings and structures in Albuquerque, New Mexico Albuquerque Category:Economy of Albuquerque, New Mexico Category:Industrial buildings and structures in New Mexico Category:Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in New Mexico Category:Fire stations on the National Register of Historic Places in New Mexico Category:Landmarks in Albuquerque, New Mexico Category:National Register of Historic Places in Albuquerque, New Mexico Category:Railroad roundhouses in New Mexico Category:Railway workshops in the United States Category:Transport infrastructure completed in 1925 Category:Unused buildings in New Mexico Category:Railway roundhouses on the National Register of Historic Places Category:Railway workshops on the National Register of Historic Places Category:Railway buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in New Mexico Category:New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties Category:Blacksmith shops ","title":"Santa Fe Railway Shops (Albuquerque)"},{"id":"3251469","text":" The Hawker Woodcock was a British single-seat fighter built by the Hawker Engineering Company as the first fighter to be produced by Hawker Engineering (the successor to Sopwith Aviation). It was used by the RAF as a night fighter in the 1920s. ==Design and development== The Hawker Woodcock was designed as a night fighter in 1922 to meet specification 25/22. The chief designer was Captain Thomson, and the prototype, serial number J6987, was first flown with a 358 hp (267 kW) Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar II engine in March 1923 with F. P. Raynham at the controls. It featured a two-bay wing with the inner struts at about span. The prototype was rejected because of lack of manoeuvrability as well as suffering from serious wing flutter and ineffective rudder control. Following the first flight W. G. Carter took over as chief designer and changed the design, reducing the wingspan by 2 ft (0.61 m) and making it a single-bay structure. The powerplant was changed to a 380 hp (283 kW) Bristol Jupiter IV engine. The modified design was designated the Woodcock Mk II and first flew in July 1923. A number of accidents occurred and the design was progressively strengthened until the structural weakness had been cured. The Woodcock was armed with two .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine guns, synchronised to fire through the propeller arc. The guns were mounted externally on each side of the fuselage, just below the edge of the cockpit. The first order for the Royal Air Force was for ten Woodcock IIs, with the first six being completed without any night flying equipment. The service eventually ordered a total of 62 aircraft. One of the first batch of aircraft was given a civil registration to allow it to be demonstrated in Scandinavia. On return to the United Kingdom, the demonstrator was entered into the 1925 King's Cup Air Race but it crashed during the race in bad weather near Luton. ==Operational history== The first aircraft to be delivered to the Royal Air Force entered service with 3 Squadron in May 1925 at RAF Upavon. No. 17 Squadron was the only other operational squadron, with first deliveries being made in March 1926. Once the type's early structural problems were solved, the Woodcock proved popular with its pilots. It was replaced by the Gloster Gamecock in 1928. However, some Woodcocks were still flying in 1936.Mason 1991, p. 106. In June 1927 a Woodcock II of No. 17 Squadron was borrowed by the notable aviator Charles Lindbergh. He used the aircraft to fly back to Paris from London soon after his transatlantic flight in the Spirit of St. Louis.

It is named after the Wollman family who donated the funds for its original construction. The rink is open for ice skating from late October to early April; from late May to September it is transformed into Victorian Gardens, an amusement park for children. The ice rink is currently operated by the Trump Organization. The children's amusement park is operated by Central Amusement International, LLC, who also operates the Luna Park amusement park in Coney Island, Brooklyn. ==Site== The rink is located at the southeast corner of Central Park. It was formerly part of the Pond, located directly east of Wollman Rink. The Pond's western section was drained and backfilled during the mid-20th century. Wollman Rink at Central Park is distinct from the Kate Wollman Memorial Rink at Prospect Park in Brooklyn which was built with money donated by the William J. Wollman Foundation after Kate Wollman's death. It was operational from 1961 until its demolition in 2010. ==History== Wollman Rink opened in 1950. The rink was closed for renovations in the winter of 1980 and reopened in November 1986. In 2003, the Victorian Gardens amusement park with rides \\"specifically geared to ages 2–12 years old\\" opened its gates to the general public during the summer months for the first time. ===Initial planning and funding=== A skating rink in the southeastern corner of Central Park was first proposed in 1945. In 1949, philanthropist Kate Wollman (1869–1955) donated $600,000 for the rink's construction to commemorate her family. She is the great-aunt of Henry and Richard Bloch, co-founders of H&R; Block. One of her brothers was William J. Wollman, who operated the W.J. Wollman & Co. stock exchange firm, originally in Kansas City and later in New York. After he died in 1937, she helped administer his estate. ===Concert venue=== Until 1980, the rink was the venue for a series of outdoor summer rock, pop, country, and jazz concerts. Initially the \\"Wollman Theater\\" or \\"Wollman Skating Rink Theater\\" had 4,400 seats; bleachers were added in 1972 to increase the capacity to 8,000. In the summer of 1957, WOR radio personality Jean Shepherd hosted a series of \\"Jazz under the stars\\" concerts on 15 consecutive nights, featuring Billie Holiday, Bud Powell, Lionel Hampton, Dave Brubeck, Dizzy Gillespie, Buddy Rich, Dinah Washington, Stan Getz, and others. From 1966 to 1980, summer music festivals consisting of 30 to 50 concerts each summer took place at the rink. The festivals were named after their main sponsors, Rheingold Breweries in 1966 and 1967, F. & M. Schaefer Brewing Company from 1968 to 1976 when the festival was called the Schaefer Music Festival, and Dr Pepper from 1977 to 1980 when it was called the Dr Pepper Central Park Music Festival. The Jimi Hendrix Experience, The Who, Led Zeppelin, The Beach Boys, and the Patti Smith Group were some of the biggest rock groups who played at the rink; country, blues, rhythm & blues, and jazz artists included Earl Scruggs, John Lee Hooker, The Supremes, and Buddy Rich. ===Renovation: 1980–1986=== In 1974, the New York City Parks and Recreation Department started planning a renovation of the rink, including switching the refrigeration system from brinewater to liquid Freon to lower the operation costs at a time of rising fuel costs. In January 1975, a $4 million plan to renovate Wollman Rink at the park's southeastern corner was announced. By late 1975, the Central Park Task Force, an agency of NYC Parks, released a revised plan to dredge the Pond and redesign the landscaping in the park's southeastern corner for $2.5 million. All plans were deferred due to the 1975 New York City fiscal crisis. The rink had to be closed in the winter of 1980 when its concrete floor buckled; at that time, the renovation was estimated to cost up to $4.9 million and take two years. Due to the necessity of soliciting bids for three separate contracts and a series of planning errors, construction mishaps, and flooding caused by heavy rains, the renovations had not been completed by May 1986 when the city decided to use brinewater in plastic pipes. By that time, $12.9 million had been spent, with an additional $2 to $3 million estimated to complete the work by the winter of 1987. Donald Trump then offered mayor Ed Koch to rebuild Wollman Rink at his expense within six months, in return for the leases to operate the rink and an adjacent restaurant to recoup his costs. The final agreement was that the city would reimburse Trump for the costs up to the agreed limit and that he would donate the profits of rink and restaurant to charity and public works. Trump asked his contractors, among them HRH Construction, to also do the work without making a profit, promising them publicity but not mentioning their contributions to the press afterwards. The work was completed two months ahead of schedule and $750,000 under the estimated costs. As part of the agreement to keep operating Wollman Rink, Trump agreed to also take a concession for the Lasker Rink as well, and the Trump Organization won concessions for the rinks in 1987. ===Skating rink operation: 1986–present=== When the rink reopened in November 1986, ticket prices were raised from $2.50 to $4.50, and attendance was up from 130,000 in 1980 to 250,000 in 1987. As part of its agreement with the city, the Trump Organization donated most of the profit to public works, including $50,000 for the rink’s electricity costs, and to charity, among them United Cerebral Palsy, Partnership for the Homeless, and Gay Men’s Health Crisis. The Trump Organization held the concession until 1995. Its subsidiary Wollman Rink Operations LLC won another contract in 2001 to operate the rink through April 30, 2021. Wollman Rink Operations LLC is owned by DJT Holdings LLC which is owned by the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust for the duration of Trump's presidency. In 2019, Trump's name was removed from most signs and logos at both Wollman and Lasker Rinks. ==In popular culture== Wollman Rink has been featured in several films, including Love Story (1970), Carnal Knowledge (1971), The Devil’s Own (1997), Serendipity (2001), and Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992). It was also featured in the video game Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX, in the music video Two Become One, and on Impractical Jokers. ==References== == Works cited == * ==External links== *History and information *Official website Category:1949 establishments in New York (state) Category:1998 Goodwill Games venues Category:Assets owned by the Trump Organization Category:Central Park Category:Former music venues in New York City Category:Robert Moses projects Category:Sports venues in Manhattan Category:Sports venues completed in 1949 ","title":"Wollman Rink"},{"id":"3251471","text":"Hitting the hornuss The hornuss on the bock A schindel (shingle) Hornussen is an indigenous Swiss sport. The sport gets its name from the puck which is known as a \\"Hornuss\\" (hornet) or \\"Nouss\\". When hit, it can whizz through the air at up to 300 km/h (186.4 mph) and create a buzzing sound. Together with Schwingen and Steinstossen, Hornussen is seen as a Swiss national sport. Outside of Switzerland, there are only a few teams. ==History== The sport probably developed in the seventeenth century. The earliest reference to Hornuss is found in the records of 1625 of the consistory of Lauperswil, canton Bern, in a complaint about the breaking of the Sabbath. Two men were fined the sum of 20 francs for playing Hornussen on Sunday. The first recorded competitive Hornussen game occurred in 1655 in Trub. The sport appears in the 1841 Jeremias Gotthelf novel Uli, der Knecht. In the 19th century this amateur sport was very popular in the Emmental and in Entlebuch. In 1902, the federal Hornussen association was founded, which organises a competition every three years. In 2011, there were around 270 clubs in the association, with around 8,300 members. During the season inter-association and inter-cantonal events are held, as well as group and elite events. In 2012, the international Hornussen association was founded, which helps promote the sport in countries throughout the world. Since its founding, more than 20 clubs have been founded in the United States. == Gameplay == A game of Hornussen is played between two teams, each composed of between 16 and 20 players, that take turns in hitting the Nouss from the \\"Bock\\" and defending the trapeze-shaped playing field called \\"Ries\\". The \\"Ries\\" begins from the \\"Bock\\" and is deep. Initially wide, it widens to at the far end. A pair of turns, one at the Bock and one in the Ries by each team forms a \\"Durchgang\\" (translates to \\"transition\\"). In that, the sport is similar to baseball. A normal championship game is made up of two transitions, special events (such as the regional or inter-cantonal tournaments in autumn) might be different. When playing from the Bock, each team member has to hit the Nouss twice per transition, for four hits in total. The further the Nouss flies in the Ries, the more points the player gets. The count starts at 100 meter, measured from the bock, and adds one point for every ten additional meter. The task of the defending team is to spot the Nouss in the sky and prevent it from touching the ground in the Ries by using what is called a \\"Schindel\\". Each Nouss who lands in the Ries awards one penalty point to the defending team. In the end, the team with the least penalty points wins the game. If the two teams are tied (which happens often), the points of each player are added to form the team total. In this case, the team with the most points wins. Aside from the team score, each player is ranked according to his or her personal total from the four hits. At the end of the season, the best players are rewarded. == References == Category:Sports originating in Switzerland Category:Team sports ","title":"Hornussen"},{"id":"3251482","text":"The Asian house shrew (Suncus murinus) is a shrew species native to South and Southeast Asia that has been listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 2008 because of its large population and wide distribution. It has been introduced in several West Asian and East African countries. It is considered an invasive species and implicated in the demise of several island lizard species. It is also called house shrew, grey musk shrew, Asian musk shrew or Indian musk shrew. In India, it is called chuchunder and is mentioned in Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book by the name of chuchundra as a nocturnal inhabitant of Indian houses. However, Kipling's mistaken use of the name 'musk rat' has led to confusion with the unrelated North American muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), and the latter species, not found in India, was (erroneously) illustrated in the Jungle Book. == Taxonomy == Sorex murinus was the scientific name proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1766 for a house shrew from Java. In the late 18th to early 20th centuries, several house shrew zoological specimens were described as distinct species that are considered synonyms today: *Sorex myosurus by Peter Simon Pallas in 1781; *Sorex viridescens by Edward Blyth in 1859 was a house shrew from the Malabar coast, India; ==Description== Illustration of the habit of travelling in family parties from Edward Hamilton Aitken The house shrew has a uniform, short, dense fur of mid- grey to brownish-grey color. The tail is thick at the base and a bit narrower at the tip, and is covered with a few long, bristle-like hairs that are thinly scattered. They have short legs with five clawed toes. They have small external ears and an elongated snout. They also emit a strong odor of musk, derived from musk glands that are sometimes visible on each side of the body. The odor is especially noticeable during the breeding season. Like all shrews, the Asian house shrew is plantigrade and long-nosed. The teeth are a series of sharp points to poke holes in insect exoskeletons. It is the largest of the shrew species, weighing between 50 and 100 g and being about 15 cm long from snout to tip of the tail. ==Distribution and habitat== The Asian house shrew is native to South and Southeast Asia and was introduced by humans to eastern Africa, Arabia, Madagascar, the Philippines and other islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. ==Ecology and behaviour== Baby house shrew The Asian house shrew is a voracious insectivore with little resistance to starvation. It is active during the night, spending the day in a burrow or hiding place in human habitations. They breed throughout the year, with each female averaging two litters per year. The gestation period is one month. One to eight young are born per litter, usually three young, in a nest made by both of the parents, wherein the young stay until they are nearly adult. It starts breeding when it is around one year old. Studies on this shrew have suggested its suitability for use in laboratory studies of reproduction and nutrition. It is widespread and found in all habitats, including deserts and human habitations. The habitat of this species is normally near human settlement, specifically near the house. Some also live on the ground in leaf litter and grass. It has been recorded up to 2825 m above sea level near Darjeeling, West Bengal, but only to up to 300 m in Taiwan. The house shrew has a habit of moving quickly along the edges of the walls when it enters human habitations. As it runs it makes a chattering sound which resembles the sound of jingling money, which has earned them the name ”money shrew” in China. When alarmed, the house shrew makes an ear-piercing, high-pitched shriek, resembling the sound of nails scraping a chalkboard or a metal fork scraping glass, which repels house cats. Predators also leave the house shrew alone because of its musky smell and even when they catch one by mistake they will rarely eat it. National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo, Japan. Coloured pencil drawing by Kawahara Keiga, 1823-1829 Another remarkable habit of this shrew (shared with the white-toothed shrews of Europe) is that it forms a ”caravan” with its young, that is, the young line up behind the mother and follow it while she walks. The first young will hold on to the mother's fur with its teeth, and the subsequent young will do the same with the sibling in front of it. It is often mistaken for a rat or mouse and killed as vermin. In general it is beneficial to humans because its diet consists mostly of harmful insects such as cockroaches, and even house mice. It can therefore be considered as a biological pesticide. Unlike rats, population levels of house shrews remain low.Schmidt, R. H. “Shrews”, Internet Center for Wildlife Damage Management, http://icwdm.org/handbook/mammals/shrews.asp. Retrieved 12.5.2013. Despite its use as an insect control, it can be unpopular due to the strong odour of its droppings, which it may deposit in human dwellings behind kitchen cupboards, etc. It can also take to eating human food such as meat in kitchens, or dog or cat food. It is known to occasionally kill young chicks, making it unpopular with farmers, although rats probably kill more chicks, and more quickly. The way it is said to attack chicks, by first biting a tendon, immobilizing it and then killing and eating it, could indicate that it has a venomous bite that paralyses, as at least two other shrews species have (i.e. the Eurasian water shrew and the Northern short-tailed shrew).Pepling, R.

Line art or line drawing is any image that consists of distinct straight or curved lines placed against a (usually plain) background, without gradations in shade (darkness) or hue (color) to represent two-dimensional or three-dimensional objects. Line art can use lines of different colors, although line art is usually monochromatic. Line art emphasizes form and drawings), of several (few) constant widths (as in technical illustrations), or of freely varying widths (as in brush work or engraving). Line art may tend towards realism (as in much of Gustave Doré's work), or it may be a caricature, cartoon, ideograph, or glyph. Before the development of photography and of halftones, line art was the standard format for illustrations to be used in print publications, using black ink on white paper. Using either stippling or hatching, shades of gray could also be simulated. One of the most fundamental elements of art is the line. An important feature of a line is that it indicates the edge of a two-dimensional (flat) shape or a three-dimensional form. A shape can be indicated by means of an outline and a three-dimensional form can be indicated by contour lines.Sayre, Henry M. A World of Art. Prentice Hall.

It is located on Church Street, opposite Sheffield Cathedral, in Sheffield City Centre. ==History and architecture== The Cutlers' Hall was built in 1832 by Samuel Worth and Benjamin Broomhead Taylor at a cost of £6,500. It was extended in 1865-7 by Flockton & Abbott, and again in 1888 by J. B. Mitchel-Withers.\\"Pevsner Architectural Guides - Sheffield\\", Ruth Harman & John Minnis, , Gives details of architecture. It is Sheffield's third Cutlers' Hall, the previous buildings, which were built in the same location, were constructed in 1638 and 1725. Prior to 1638, the cutlers met in rented accommodation with tradition saying that this was a public house on Fargate, although there is no documentary evidence to back this up. The first Cutlers' Hall, a stone building with a slated roof, was built in 1638 at a cost of £155 15s 10d, of which £57 18s 4d was raised by subscription. The building was quickly found to be inadequate, having to be repaired on many occasions and in 1725, a new Cutlers' Hall was erected on the same site at a cost of £442 (). It was an attractive, narrow Georgian three storeyed building with a string course cornice. Towards the end of the 18th century the Cutlers' Hall was used as an overspill court room as the Town Hall across Church Street could not cope with the increasing number of crimes.\\"Sheffield: Its Story and its Achievements\\", Mary Walton, , Info on 1638 and 1725 buildings. The Hall's front is of the Corinthian order. Behind the classical façade is an intricate series of rooms which reach back almost as far as Fargate. The banks neighbouring the Cutlers' Hall are in a similar style. One was designed by Samuel Worth in 1838, the other was completed in 1867. ==Function== Cutlers' Hall's steel door There is a selection of old Hallamshire knives on show inside the hall, some of which go back to the Elizabethan era. Many of the knives were discovered by Thames mudlarks in the tidal mud of the River Thames in London.National Geographic. Gives details of Thames Mudlarks.

The building is used for many of the grandest events in the city's civic and commercial life, for instance the annual Cutlers' Feast which became an annual event in 1648. For the years up to 2008, there were 372 Cutlers' Feasts, with breaks only for the World Wars and a cancellation in 1921.\\"Mesters to Masters\\", Clyde Binfield, David Hey, Oxford University Press, Gives details of Cutlers Feast.

He is the general music director of the Austro-Hungarian Haydn Orchestra, chief conductor of the Danish National Chamber Orchestra, and chief conductor of the Düsseldorf Symphony. ==Career== Ádám Fischer is an elder brother of the conductor Iván Fischer. The two belonged to the children's choir of Budapest National Opera house, and sang as two of the three boys in Mozart's Die Zauberflöte. Fischer studied piano and composition at the Bartók Conservatory in Budapest, and conducting with Hans Swarowsky in Vienna. He also studied with Franco Ferrara at Accademia Chigiana in Siena. He won first prize in the Milan Guido Cantelli Competition. His career began with opera conducting in Munich, Freiburg, and other German cities. In 1982 he made his Paris Opéra debut, leading Der Rosenkavalier, and in 1986 he made his debut at La Scala, Milan, leading Die Zauberflöte. Between 1987 and 1992, he was the general music director in Kassel. Fischer began a long collaboration with the Vienna State Opera in 1973. In January 2017, he was named an honorary member of the company. In 1987, Fischer established the Austro-Hungarian Haydn Orchestra and started the Haydn Festival in the Austrian city of Eisenstadt. He has recorded the complete Haydn symphonies for the Nimbus label, the first digital recording of the cycle, with the orchestra. In July 1989, Fischer started the first Gustav Mahler Festivals in Kassel. In 1998, Fischer was appointed chief conductor of the Danish National Chamber Orchestra. Fischer has recorded the complete Opere serie by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart with this orchestra, and is currently recording Mozart's complete symphonies. At the end of 2010 Fischer resigned as Music Director of the Hungarian State Opera in protest against the controversial media law introduced in Hungary in 2011. Speaking in Brussels on 11 January 2011 he told reporters: : 'A lot of the attention has focused on the new law but the problems run far deeper. Even more worrying are changes to the national constitution that are being drafted and the rise of anti-Semitism, homophobia and xenophobia in Hungarian society.' Fischer joined with András Schiff, Miklós Jancsó and others in an open letter condemning the Hungarian government's record on these issues. Fischer has recorded commercially for Nimbus, CBS, EMI, Hungaroton and Delta. In 1982, he won the Grand Prix du Disque. In 2018, he was the laureate of the Wolf Prize in Arts. ==References== ==Sources== * Dr. Raab and Dr. Böhm Artist Management (Austria), official artist biography of Adam Fischer * Friends of Ádám Fischer page ==External links== * * Interview with Ádám Fischer, November 11, 1981 Category:Hungarian conductors (music) Category:Hungarian male musicians Category:Male conductors (music) Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:Hungarian Jews Category:Jewish classical musicians Category:20th-century conductors (music) Category:20th-century Hungarian musicians Category:21st-century conductors (music) Category:21st- century Hungarian musicians Category:Musicians from Budapest Category:Wolf Prize in Arts laureates ","title":"Ádám Fischer"},{"id":"3251527","text":"In human anatomy, the greater sac, also known as the general cavity (of the abdomen) or peritoneum of the peritoneal cavity proper, is the cavity in the abdomen that is inside the peritoneum but outside the lesser sac.

Scouting was founded in Pakistan as part of the British Indian branch of The Scout Association. The PBSA was officially founded in 1947, immediately after independence from the British and became a member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement in April 1948. ==History== thumbnail On Scouting, Pakistan's founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah said J. S. Wilson, Director of the Boy Scouts International Bureau, visited Karachi in 1952 as guest of J.D. Shuja, the General Secretary of the Pakistan Boy Scouts Association.John S. Wilson (1959), Scouting Round the World. First edition, Blandford Press. During his visit, he saw Bhit Island, off Karachi, a fishing community primarily of refugees, who had been adopted by a Karachi Scout group, the Rovers and older Scouts of which were staffing a school until a regular teacher could be appointed. In Bahawalpur, Wilson was welcomed by Brigadier M.A. Abbasi, Deputy Chief Scout Commissioner who had been at the 1951 World Jamboree in Austria and would later lead the Pakistani contingent at the 1957 Jubilee Jamboree. At Lahore, Wilson met the Scouts and Bluebirds (Brownies) of the Deaf and Dumb Institute, and visited A.R. Sardar Hussain, Scout Camp Chief for Pakistan, Squadron Leader H.V. Bhatty, Scout Provincial Secretary, Nicholas Rozario, Deputy Camp Chief (East Pakistan), and Mir M. Mohsin, Deputy Camp Chief (West Pakistan), who later succeeded Shuja as General Secretary.John S. Wilson (1959), Scouting Round the World. First edition, Blandford Press. p. 243 Scouting continued in East and West Pakistan as part of the Pakistan Boy Scouts Association until the country was split in the 1970s. Niaz M. Khan served on the World Scout Committee of the World Organization of the Scout Movement from 1963 to 1969. In 1969, Mr. Khan was awarded the Bronze Wolf of the World Organization of the Scout Movement by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting. ==Structure== Pakistani Scout The Scouting movement in Pakistan is governed by the Ordinance No. XLIII of 1959 (known as Pakistan Boy Scouts Association Ordinance, 1959) and the subsequent rules, latest being those published vide SRO 140/KE/93 in the Gazette of Pakistan, Extra July 27, 1993, and known as Pakistan Boy Scouts Association Rules, 1992. These rules of 1992 which define the policies to follow organizational setup for effective management and rules for administration of Pakistan Boy Scouts Association (PBSA) are also termed as Policy, Organisation and Rules (POR) of PBSA. From September 2007, Scouting became compulsory in schools. The aim is to have one million youth volunteers to help out in emergencies. Two per cent of exam fees collected by the examination boards are paid to the various Scouting and Guiding organisations. Scouting is practically managed in Pakistan by the provincial Scout associations; the purpose of the smaller Districts is to manage the movement efficiently and as per the rules and regulations of PBSA. Currently PBSA has Ten provincial associations, namely: *Punjab Boy Scouts Association *Sindh Boy Scouts Association *Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (formerly Northwest Frontier Province) Boy Scouts Association *Balochistan Scouts Association *Gilgit-Baltistan Boy Scouts Association *Azad Jammu and Kashmir Boy Scouts Association *Islamabad Boy Scouts Association *Federally Administered Tribal Areas Boy Scouts Association *Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) Boy Scouts Association *Pakistan Railways Boy Scouts Association ===Sea Scouting in Pakistan=== Flag on Pakistani Scout uniform Karachi Sea Scout is currently the only scout group offering Sea Scouting in Pakistan. It was established in 1938 and is registered with Karachi Open District of Sindh Boy Scout Association. Currently its Skipper and Chief Sea Scout Murtaza Hussain Shamim is leading the group. ===Ismaili District Boy Scouts Association=== The Ismaili District Boy Scouts Association (IDBSA) is a branch of the Sindh Boy Scouts Association (SBSA), one of the nine provincial Scout associations of the Pakistan Boy Scouts Association, comprising 18 districts throughout the Sindh Province. There are four Scouts Districts in Karachi: City Scouts District Karachi, Karachi Open Scouts District, Karachi Private Schools Scouts District and Ismaili District Boy Scouts Association. In 1994, the Executive Committee of SBSA decided to form the fourth district, the Ismaili District Boy Scouts Association, for the management of Ismaili Scouts Groups of Karachi, which were earlier registered with Karachi Open Scouts District. Scouting in Pakistan's Ismaili community was commenced with guidance of the first Ismaili Chief Scout of Ismaili Scout Groups, H.S.H. Prince Ali Salman Khan in 1930. At that time, Scouting in the Ismaili community was lacking in expertise and trained manpower. Mr. Ramchandani Bulchand, a trained and qualified leader was brought in as Group Scoutmaster of Kharadar Scouts Group, as well as Honorary Commissioner for Ismaili Scouts Association, and later became the Scoutmaster of Garden Scouts Group. In 1936, the H.H. Prince Aga Khan Ismaili Scouts Association (ISA) was established, consisting of Scout Groups, Girl Guide Companies, bands and orchestras. Later, upon advice and instruction from Sindh Provincial Scouts Headquarters, the name of the association was changed to H.H. Prince Aga Khan Association for Ismaili Scouts, Guides, Bands and Orchestras, and finally known as Shia Imami Association for Ismaili Scouts, Guides, Bands and Orchestras, Karachi. thumbnail As Bulchand emigrated to India in 1952, Mr. Iqbal Ahmed Qureshi, Skipper and Chief of the Karachi Sea Scouts was appointed as Honorary Organizer of the association in 1954. The present Chief Scout of Ismaili Scout Groups is H.S.H. Prince Amyn Muhammad Aga Khan. There are 26 Ismaili Scouts Groups under Ismaili District Boy Scouts Association. ==National Executives== Emblem on Pakistani Scout The national executive body will be elected upon the next meeting of National Council of Pakistan Boy Scouts Association. ==Program== Scouts have gained the respect of the citizens for their untiring work during floods, earthquake and other human and natural disasters. They have collected and distributed food and clothing. They have evacuated trapped people to safety, and run first aid stations in refugee camps. They have been active in helping rebuild destroyed villages. Scout program emphasis is on community service and conservation. There is a program for handicapped Scouts supported by former Scouts in the Baden-Powell Guild. ===Sections=== *Shaheen Scouts/Cubs-ages 6+ to 11 *Scouts-ages 11+ to 17 *Rovers-ages 17+ to 25 ===Shaheen Motto=== The Shaheen Motto is Buland Perwaz (Fly High). ===Scout Motto=== The Scout Motto is Al-Mustaid (Be Prepared). ===Rover Motto=== The Rover Motto is Khidmat (Service).

It was the replacement for the Mercedes-Benz O305 and was widely used in Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia and Singapore with 12,000 produced. ==Standard floor version== The step-entrance version was known as the O405. A 3-axle articulated version was also built known as O405G and a trolleybus as the O405T.The Mercedes-Benz O405 Range Buses Worldwide issue 214 July 2019 pages 30-33 There were two generations of O405, designated as O405 MkI and O405 MkII. Most of them have their boxy roof dome (slightly arched) with a double- curvature windscreen, separately mounted destination indicator and pantograph system windshield wipers that was used on some buses such as the Dennis Dart, Leyland Lynx, MAN NL262 and the MAN SL202. ===O405 Mark I=== The O405 Mark I was marketed between mid-1980s and early 1990s. It was unveiled in September 1983. It featured a Mercedes Benz OM447h naturally aspirated engine with outputs of either 157kW (210hp) or 184 kW (250 hp). Optionally available was a naturally aspirated compressed natural gas (CNG) engine model M447hG with 150 kW (205 hp) output. The gearbox coupled to the engine was usually the Mercedes-Benz W3E110/2.2R or Mercedes-Benz W4E112/2.2R (the former being able to handle the more powerful 184 kW engine), although there have been other gearboxes such as the ZF 5HP 500 or Allison B300R coupled to the engine. ===O405 Mark II=== The O405 Mark II was marketed from the early 1990s to the late 1990s and into the early 2000s in some parts of the world. It featured a Mercedes-Benz OM447hA turbocharged engine with an output of 184 kW (250 hp), although some examples feature either a naturally aspirated engine (OM447h-II), a turbocharged engine (OM447hA) or a turbocharged, intercooled engine (OM447hLA). The gearbox coupled to the engine was either the ZF 4HP 500 or 5HP 500, or the Voith D864.3. From 1994, this chassis was available with the M447hG Euro II 175 kW (238 hp) naturally aspirated compressed natural gas (CNG) engine. ==Low-Floor Version: O405N== Travel Coventry integral O405N low floor in April 2007 The low-floor version of the regular O405 was known as the O405N (or O405GN for the 3-axle articulated version) was released in September 1989, later a further developed version was also built, it was known as the O405N²/O405N2 (or O405GN²/O405GN2 for the 3-axle articulated version). The O405(G)N do not have steps at the entrances and exits, but the seats are mounted on \\"platforms\\". The GN2 type addressed this problem. These buses are usually fitted with ZF transmissions, but some are fitted with Voith examples. It has a boxy roof dome (slightly arched) similar to the MAN NL202 and the MAN NL262 with a double-curvature windscreen with a separately mounted destination display just that it has a full low floor layout with seats mounted on platforms. ==Low-Entry Version: O405NH== Transperth Volgren bodied O405NH in October 2018 The low-entry version of the O405 was called the O405NH chassis which was produced by EvoBus for the Australian market. Much of its popularity with government and private operators alike can be attributed to the popularity of the Mercedes-Benz O405 MkII chassis that it replaced. The chassis was derived from a combination of the rear modules of an O405 MkII chassis and the front modules of an O405N²/O405GN² chassis. Because of the difference in height between the front and rear modules of the chassis, there are one or more steps leading up from behind the centre door position to a standard O405 floorline. Because the chassis has a horizontally-mounted engine, there's no room for a rear door. This low-entry concept has become very popular in Europe - many integral products using this concept have been released such as the Mercedes-Benz Citaro LE. ==Suburban Version: O407== O407 integral The suburban version was called O407 (or O407G/O405GÜ for the 3-axle articulated version), It had a single door at the front and a pair in the middle, with all of the seats facing towards the front of the bus. It featured a Mercedes Benz OM447h naturally aspirated engine with output 177kW (237hp) and 6-speed manual Mercedes-Benz gearbox. ==Orders== ===Portugal=== * Camo U1001S * Camo Camus * Irmãos Mota Atomic UR95 and UR2000 * Marcopolo Tricana bodies ===Spain=== * Unicar * Hispano Carrocera * Castrosua ===United Kingdom=== First Greater Manchester Wright CityRider bodied O405 in Manchester in July 2007 A total of 365 O405s were built for operators in the United Kingdom, with Travel West Midlands purchasing 204.Mercedes-Benz O405 Bus Lists on the Web A sole O405Gs was bodied by Alexander for Grampian Regional Transport.Mercedes-Benz O405G / O405GN Bus Lists on the WebTop spec artic by Walter Alexander Commercial Motor 6 February 1992 page 16 A total of 204 O405Ns were built for operators in the United Kingdom, with Travel West Midlands purchasing 193.Mercedes-Benz O405N Bus Lists on the Web A total of 15 O405GNs were built for operators in the United Kingdom, with Travel West Midlands purchasing 11. ===Hong Kong=== Discovery Bay Transit Services of Hong Kong acquired four O405 single-decker buses between 1995 and 1998, two were fitted with locally-built bodywork by Asia Auto Body Works and the other two had Hispano Carrocera bodywork.Chan, C.

They were bodied by Alexander PS and Duple Metsec (OAC (original air- con) and NAC (non-aircon)). The non air-con buses were later converted to air- con buses in 1998-99. All were withdrawn from 1 March 2008 to 3 June 2011 with all replaced by Scania K230UB. A few O405s were shipped to Thailand and were rebodied whereas the rest of them were scrapped; one unit, SBS468K, was converted into a \\"Molly\\" mobile library registered as XD2037B by the National Library Board but has since been replaced by an ex-SBS Transit Volvo B10M in 2012. SGBuses.com SMRT Buses Hispano Habit bodied Mercedes-Benz O405G Trans- Island Bus Services bought Mercedes-Benz O405 with Hispano Carrocera (both with and without air-con, although the latter was retrofitted with air-con later on) and Volgren CR221 bodies to replace the ageing Hino RK176, Nissan Diesel U31F and Hino HT228KA from 1994 to 1999. All Mercedes-Benz O405 with Hispano Carrocera bodywork had been retired by 25 September 2016. The Volgren- bodied O405s on the other hand were used as permanent training buses, only fully retiring by late February 2017. TIBS also procured various batches of bendy buses (Hispano Mark 1, Hispano Mark 2, Pininfarina-designed Hispano Habit and Volgren CR221) bodies between 1996 and 2004. 12 buses are still in active service, and this will be retired by 3 March 2021.LTA official website Land Transport Authority ===Russia=== * GolAZ (Golitsynskii avtobusnyi zavod) produced model O405 (АКА-5225) and O405G (АКА-6226) ==Replacement== Production of the Mercedes-Benz O405 ended in 2002 when the last bendy buses were delivered to Trans-Island Bus Services.

It is a shrub known as kinkeliba in Benin, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Mali and Gambia across multiple regional dialects, where it is often found in tiger bush and on hills in West Africa. It is used for making tea and has uses in traditional medicine, and is used by many West African Muslims during Ramadan to break their fast. The name kinkeliba is believed to come from the Fulani language. It is referred to as sekhew in the Wolof language and ŋɔlɔbɛ in the Bambara language. == Uses == Combretum micranthum traditionally used against Malaria Drying seed pods of the combretum micranthum shrub in Benin It is used traditionally in Senegal and Mali for fatigue, liver ailments, headache, convalescence, blood disease, weight loss, cancer, sleep problems, and its especially used for fasting by Mourides in Senegal. It is one of the plants of power in Nigerian medicine and is used to treat liver disorders especially in Senegal and Mali. Kinkeliba means the \\"health tree\\" and the French import kinkeliba and call it \\"tisane de longue vie\\" or infusion of long life. *The branches are quite strong, and are a useful material for building stools, beds, tool handles, etc. *A tea made produced by steeping the leaves in boiling water is a traditional tonic drink in tropical savannah countries such as Senegal, Mali and Burkina Faso. It is believed to be an aid to weight loss and have detoxifying properties. *Among West African Muslims, especially Wolofs, Fulas, and Mandinkas, the leaves, bark, and twigs of Kinkiliba are harvested and sold in bundles during the dry season leading up to and during the month of Ramadan. Kinkiliba is used daily to brew a strong tea that is mixed with sugar and milk and is drunk with bread at sundown as a means of breaking the daily fast. Kinkiliba is used specifically for this purpose because of its sweet flavor and because it is believed to be an appetite stimulant, as those who have been fasting want to be able to enjoy as much rich food as possible in the evening after eating nothing from sunrise to sunset. *In Burkina Faso, a decoction of the leaves is used as a medication for malaria. == Pharmacological Effects == The leaves extract of the plants have been demonstrated to contain a range of polyphenol compounds. These compounds are known for antioxidant activities and have shown potential for the prevention of diabetes. The whole plant is variously used to treat diseases like viral hepatitis and others. In particular, kinkeliba is able to increase urinary secretion and facilitate the evacuation of bile. Almost specific, against hematuric bilous fever. Kinkeliba can be used as a fluid extract for jaundice and gallstones. Thus the wood and the leaves of kinkeliba are used against anemia, tonic, febrifuge due to drinking one liter per day for three days or more, depending on the severity. These are the leaves, the root and the stem that are boiled in water for fifteen to twenty minutes and then left to infuse for a few minutes, adding sugar and milk as desired. It is possible to use a decoction of kinkeliba for cereal porridge for a sick person. Kinkeliba can replace coffee or tea in breakfast. It is also used in the treatment of constipation, stimulation of digestive function and appetite. Treatment of gallstones: stimulating action on biliary function. Anti-inflammatory and antibacterial: soothes people suffering from infectious diarrhea. Urinary disorders: promotes urinary excretion.

He has performed with several notable acts. He is the current lead guitarist of Wovenwar and was a longtime member of As I Lay Dying. == Background == Hipa started his musical career with the band Evelynn. The band was signed to Pluto Records. In 2001, Evelynn toured with As I Lay Dying. As Evelynn started to disperse, Hipa joined As I Lay Dying in 2003. As I Lay Dying ran its course with the same lineup since 2007, up until Tim Lambesis' arrest, when Hipa, Phil Sgrosso, and Josh Gilbert departed from the band. Alongside AILD drummer Jordan Mancino and Oh, Sleeper and Hipa's former band- mate, Shane Blay, the group of friends formed Wovenwar. In a more recent interview, Mancino stated that AILD is still technically five members, himself, Lambesis, Hipa, Gilbert, and Sgrosso. Hipa performed lead guitars for Wovenwar, appearing on both Wovenwar (2014) and Honor Is Dead (2016) to date. In 2017, Lambesis reformed As I Lay Dying, with all new members, stating that none of the previous members, Hipa included, would return. On June 8, 2018, it was confirmed that Hipa along with the \\"classic\\" lineup of As I Lay Dying reunited with Lambesis with the release of \\"My Own Grave\\". On April 12, 2019, the band released a second single, titled \\"Redefined\\", which also features August Burns Red frontman Jake Luhrs. Hipa was featured on Billy on the Street. == Involvement in controversy == Lambesis, after his arrest, said negative things about the rest of the band, Hipa included. Hipa responded to these statements–particularly accusations of the entire band secretly being atheists and lack of contact with Lambesis after the arrest–calling them slanderous. In November 2016, Hipa stated that Lambesis was, at the time, still of the same mind and that the relationship between the two remained damaged. Hipa's tone however, changed in an October 2017 interview with Hatebreed frontman Jamey Jasta when asked about a potential As I Lay Dying reunion with the classic members–Hipa replied: \\"Man, I'm on the spot… people ask us about it a lot. But what it comes down to is what makes sense with what we have going on in our lives. And we've got a lot of important things going on that don't relate to that and we've made commitments to, and that's what we are honoring at this moment.

In the beginning Clarion only published the writing of Boston University students. In 2008, the editors opened submissions to all writers, regardless of their affiliation with the University. In 2011, The Pen & Anvil Press, a Boston-based imprint operated by the nonprofit Boston Poetry Union, took over responsibility for publishing Clarion, in agreement with BULS and the BU Literary Organizations liaison. Through its cooperation with the BULS, the Creative Writing department, and the BU Creative Writing Club, Clarion continues to employ undergraduate editors on its staff, alongside graduate editors and persons independent of the University. In 2013, The Review Review included Clarion on its list of notable Boston-based literary magazines. ==Boston University Literary Society== The Boston University Literary Society was founded as Boston University Students for Literary Awareness in Fall 1997, under the leadership of Jennifer Herron. The original members intended to publish a magazine titled The View from a Window, though it was then renamed, becoming ? (and then Clarion) and ultimately released in Spring 1998. In 2009, the Literary Society started Burn, a students-only showcase of edgier experimental writing, and in 2010 offered the editors of formerly independent publications, Back Bay Review (art criticism) and Pusteblume (literary translation) a home under the Boston University Literary Society administration. ==References== ==External links== * Online archive * Clarion at Duotrope * Clarion in the BU Bridge Category:Poetry magazines published in the United States Category:Annual magazines published in the United States Category:Student magazines published in the United States Category:Boston University Category:Magazines established in 1998 Category:Magazines published in Boston ","title":"Clarion (magazine)"},{"id":"3251656","text":"The Ferguson Rifle (1973) is a novel set in early 19th-century America, written by Louis L'Amour. ==Plot summary== The main character, Ronan Chantry, who is of Irish ancestry, is going into the West away from his troubles.

The show ran for 52 episodes on MTV Latin America. The animation style is very simplistic and the storylines are filled with nonsense humour, running gags and a random comedy tone. The story is about a bunch of kids who likes to do cosplays on each episode, there is no main storyline, each story is based on a different movie or TV show. ==Characters== ===Main=== ====Alejo==== Alejo is a 22-year-old man married to Valentina. His favorite football team is River Plate. He is based on Alejandro Szykula, the series' creator. Alejo always wears a purple shirt and black pants. He has white skin and short black hair. He is patient and inexpressive, always speaking with the same tone and facial expressions. He thinks that he and Valentina have to have sex with their clothes on, unless they are in the bath. When he grows up he wants to be a Playmobil. Sometimes, he becomes aggressive and violent. This happens in the episodes Volver al futurox (Back to the Futurex), Locura extraordinaria (Extraordinary Madness) - where he transforms into a beast resembling The Incredible Hulk- and Volver al futurox EXTENDED (Back to the Futurex EXTENDED). Sometimes, this happens when he eats ketchup. He also is capable of vast reality warping powers, being able to alter or reverse past events to create bizarre and surreal situations. He is very skilled with lightsaber swordfighting, during his trip to a Parallel Universe he met his alter-ego. This version possessed high-level telekinesis. According to a story El Viejo told in Episode 1, La vida misma (Life as it is, or Life Itself), a stork which was going to deliver the baby Alejo was struck by lightning, causing him to fall into a river and over a waterfall. He ended up on a beach where he met Valentina, also a baby at the time. It is never revealed if this story is true or not as in Episode 15 Darth Baston (Darth Cane) and the TV episode Darth Baston EXTENDED (Darth Cane EXTENDED), El Viejo claims that he is Alejo's father. (parodying the scene where Darth Vader tells Luke Skywalker he is his father). ;Catch phrases: * ¿Y si vamos a comer comida? (How about we go to eat food?) * La quiero con mayonesa, sin ketchup y con mostaza. (I want it with mayonnaise, no ketchup and with mustard.) * ¿Y cómo hay que hacer? (And how is it done?) * ¡Que vengan todos los putos, loco! (Literally: Let all 'em fags come at me, man! Although a more accurate translation would be: \\"bring it on, motherfuckers!\\") * ¿Vos Sos Dios? (Are you God?) * Mira la Vieja. (Look the Crone.) * ¿Te haces el malo, gil? (Playing tough, punk?) * ¡Recatate, gil, ¿eh?! (Wise up punk, huh?!) * ¡Che Valentinaaaa! (Hey Valentina!) * Me parece una propuesta differente y buenísima. (I think it's a different and awesome proposal.) * Me pica el culo. (My ass itches.) ====Valentina==== Valentina is a 22-year-old woman married to Alejo. She is 1.75 meters tall (5'9). Her favorite football team is Boca Juniors. Valentina is based on Alejandro Szykula's ex-girlfriend. Valentina always wears a pink dress. She has white skin, long, dark hair and is inexpressive, speaking with the same tone no matter what the situation. She is skilled at martial arts and proficient in the use of the katana. She's also incredibly strong. She would like to be a dancer when she is older. According to a story El Viejo told in Episode 1, La vida misma (Life as it is, or Life Itself), a stork which was meant to deliver the baby Valentina was abducted by aliens, leaving Valentina to fall out of the sky and into a rubbish lorry in Papapipa. As the lorry crosses a bridge, a helicopter crashes, destroying both the lorry and the bridge. Valentina falls into a sewer and is carried to the beach where she meets the baby Alejo. It is never revealed if this story is true or not as in Episode 15 Darth Baston (Darth Cane) and the TV episode Darth Baston EXTENDED (Darth Cane EXTENDED), El Viejo claims that he is Alejo's father. ;Catch phrases: * Yo quiero un sánguche. (I want a sandwich.) * Hay que tener sexo. (We gotta have sex.) * Me tocaron el culo. (Somebody touched my ass.) * ¡Alejo! ====Carlitox==== Carlitox is a short 19-year-old with messy green hair. His favorite football team is Rosario Central. He's about 1.55 meters (5'2\\") tall. He has the ability to float magically. This is later explained in a parody with the Clown from the movie \\"It\\" (based on the book by Stephen King) who tells him \\"Everybody floats...\\". During the trip to the Parallel Universe, he discovers his alter-ego, a tall, serious, muscular man with red hair, who is capable of high-level pyrokinesis and producing energy blasts. He stores several things in his garage, including a UFO, which he later exchanged for a X-Wing ship from Star Wars, martial arts weapons, costumes, a time-travelling DeLorean, a machine that allows his to revisit previous episodes, a helicopter, a battery-compass, as well as numerous objects he has never used (see his catchphrases, below). Due to the lack of space he parks his car outside a TV studio garage. He always wears a blue tank top and black trousers. Usually, he enters people's houses without permission and introduces himself by saying \\"Hola, vengo a flotar\\" (Hello, I've come to float). Carlitox is impatient and hyperactive, and most of the time he is up to something. Whenever he has something new and interesting, he likes to show it off. Carlitox's father supposedly fought in the Malvinas/Falkland War with El Viejo, and died when he saved El Viejo's life. Carlitox lives with his mother and has a blue-haired twin brother. ;Catch phrases: * Houla, vengo a flotar. (Heullo, I've come to float.) * Houla, vengo a (...). (Heullo, I've come to (...) ) * Houla, vengo a revolear las patas. (Heullo, I've come to swing my legs around.) * Houla, vengo a romper las bolas (Heullo, I've come to annoy.) * Bueno, chau. (Well, bye.) * Mirá, mirá, tengo (...), mirá. (Look, look, I've got (...), look.) * ¡Jo-joo-jo! (Carlitox's trademark laughter.) * Ehm, me parece una muy buena idea, pero... (Ehm, I think it's a very good idea, but...) * ¿Qué hacemos? (What are we going to do?) * Tengo un (...) en el garaje, nunca lo use. (I have a (...) in my garage, never used it.) * Pisé una banana y me fui a la mierda, y después apareció un payaso y me dijo... no me acuerdo lo que me dijo. (I stepped on a banana and got messed up, then a clown appeared and told me... I do not remember what I said.) ====El Viejo==== The charismatic Viejo, often called El Viejo del Bastón (The Old Man With the Cane), is an old man who spends a lot of time with Alejo, Valentina and Carlitox. His favorite football team is Chacarita Juniors. El Viejo wears a grey robe. He often appears spontaneously, and acts wise even though he is not smart and his advice is useless. He is known for his Paraguayan accent, ending almost every sentence with 'viteh' (y'see), a word derived from 'viste' (you see). He seems to have a crush on an older lady named La Vieja, and often impersonates Hattori Hanzō or Pai Mei from Kill Bill. He also claims to know Victor Sueiro personally. He is able to teleport. He is skilled in magic. He is in great physical condition, and is as muscular as a bodybuilder. ;Catch phrases: * ...,viteh. (...,y'see.) * Hola, viteh. (Hi, y'see.) * Tengo chaleco, viteh. (I've got (bulletproof) vest, y'see.) * Pero, ¡¿vos sos loco, viteh?! (But, are you crazy, y'see?!) * Lo que hagas puede tener repercusiones en eventos futuros, viteh. (Anything you do may affect future events, y'see.) * Vamo' a matar a los bichos, viteh. (We're gonna kill all them bugs, y'see) ====Gregory==== He is 20 years old and wears a blue shirt and darker pants. He is a friend of most of the characters in the series, and is the fall-guy of many pranks from the other characters. He speaks with the Argentinian \\"Cheto\\" accent (posh or snobby accent). His power is superhuman speed. He owns a bar and is very shy around women. He likes Pop music and often sings in the episodes. He's a fan of River Plate. His role has increased as the series has progressed as he and Matias became more important in the show; he appeared in every episode of the second season as a main character. He is Matias' best friend, despite Matias' often condescending attitude towards Gregory because of his superficial nature. ;Catch phrases: * Uuuy, que divertido. (Ohhh, how fun.) * Me tocaron el culo. (Someone touched my ass.) * Uuuy, bueno ya, dale. (Ohhh, OK, let's do it.) * Che, pónganle algo de onda. (Hey, be a little more cool.) * ¡Paren las rotativas! ¡Paren las rotativas! (Stop the presses! Stop the presses!) ====Matias==== He is the sarcastic and cynical main prankster of the series and often accompanies Gregory. He once dated Gregory's sister, much to his companion's annoyance. He has an anger management problem and often starts shooting indiscriminately with his Uzi submachine gun when angry and uses very rude language towards everyone, always ending his phrases with \\"boludo\\" (dumbass). The word \\"boludo\\" is also used a term of endearment in Argentina when speaking with close friends. Before the series, Matías tried to cast in several films but could not participate in the production of many because of its obscene language, such as Inspector Gadget which originally had a part for him. He wears a red shirt and blue trousers. ;Catch phrases: * Me chupa la pija vo' y (...) boludo! (You and (...) can suck my dick you dumbass!) * Boludo! (dumbass!) * ¿Entendé' como e', boludo? (You got that, dumbass?) ===Recurring=== * Ricardo: A guy in a gray shirt and blue pants. 1.80 m. He is a caricature of Argentine singer Ricardo Montaner. He wears a mask to hide his face, his skin is pale yellow in color, has red eyes and has curlers in his head. He often acts as the main antagonist of the series (although in some episodes acts as a minor character) and people are not loyal to deal with him. It has a mouse named El Ratón that always tricks him and he has a laugh very similar to Muttley's laugh. He works for an unseen villain (sometidos rumored to be Dr. Claw from Inspector Gadget). * El Ratón: A mouse who never stays true to dealings with Ricardo, which calls first and instead of making the agreement runs away with Ricardo's money. Seems to be hyperactive or nervous. His dress is white and muscular, wears blue shorts, and brown shoes. * The Wilkinson Twins (Charles & Mike): Two American twins, both porn actors. They both speak resembling Latin American-dubbed Spanish. * El Negro: A stereotypical tramp, representing Argentina's low classes. He has eight brothers, all from different fathers. He is always begging for pennies for the bus, despite the fact that he owns a Ferrari Testarossa. * Carlos el pibe del noticiero: A reporter who appears in most episodes, reporting tragedies or strange occurrences such as alien invasions and massacres in a calm and uncaring way as if they were everyday occurrences. * El Chino del restaurante: a man with a Chinese accent who works in a Chinese food restaurant. He is constantly annoyed by Alejo's random phone calls to place ambiguous orders. * El Pato Bonavides The owner of the \\"Super TV channel\\". He appears offering the main characters parts in his TV shows, often giving them contracts to sign. He constantly tries to scam whomever he hires to work on his TV shows. * El Pelado: Or El Pelado Del Samba and El Pelado De La Calesita, varies according to his job. He is a bald man with bad luck. Whenever he operates a ride at Parque Park, something knocks him out or injures him, causing the ride he operates to go out of control and kill the people riding it and people nearby. Those accidents clearly make a reference to the ones that happened in the former Ital Park of Buenos Aires, that forced that classic park of the 1990s to stop operating due to the death of one girl after something apparently failed in the \\"Matterhorn\\". * El pajarito: Is a blue talking bird who appears in the opening of all the episodes. He lives with his wife Negra and his sons and daughter Palito, Bombon and Helado in the tree in front of Alejo's house. * El Gobernator: Actually Arnold Schwarzenegger. In the show he is portrayed in his role as The Terminator, but he is at the same time the governor of the Provincia de Buenos Aires. He is often charged with protecting a member of the gang from different threats, such as Aliens and Robert Patrick. In every episode he is featured, a skeptical, innocent bystander asks what he is doing in Argentina if he is the governor of California; Schwarzenegger will immediately reply by shooting them and telling them to shut up. ===Minor and guests=== * Cara de Cocou: a metafictional character that often appears in \\"Cara de Cocou & Pirín\\", a show- within-a-show. * Pirín: Cara de Cocou's friend in \\"Cara de Cocou & Pirín\\". * Urna: Cara de Cocou's girlfriend in \\"Cara de Cocou & Pirín\\". * Cacho: A friend of Alejo and Valentina.

Gregory accidentally kills him in the Halloween episode when he and Matias are sent to hell. * El Paraguayo Alternatonto: Appears in the episode \\"Expreso a Pilar\\" and in the episode \\"Behind the Flash\\" saying \\"¡Qué drogadicto que sos!\\" (You're such a junkie!)\\" . * Kabronero: a parody of one of Alejandro Szykula's friends. * Dumloco: a parody of one of the creator's friends. * Doctor Socolinski: Alejo and Valentina's doctor, based on a TV celebrity by the same name. * Peronemlins (also Menemlins and Alfonsinemlins): They are Gremlins with famous Argentinian politicians heads: Juan Domingo Perón, Carlos Menem and Raúl Alfonsín. * Panchita: A girl with blue hair who acts as a recurring love interest to Gregory. * El Reverendo Hijo De Puta: A reverend whose name is a pun on the Argentine insult \\"reverendo hijo de puta\\" (roughly translated to \\"freaking son of a bitch\\" in English).

Published by LucasArts and developed by Totally Games, the game is composed of 15 objective-based missions set in 1940s European, North African, and the Pacific theatres of war. The story was written by Derek Chester. The music was composed by Michael Giacchino. ==Plot== The player assumes the role of James Chase, an American who has volunteered to serve as a fighter pilot in the Royal Air Force starting in May 1940. After displaying above-average skill and bravery during the evacuations at Dunkirk, he is transferred to the Battlehawks; a special unit in the RAF that operates under Prime Minister Winston Churchill's Special Operations Executive. The Battle of Britain, North Africa, China, the Battle of Midway, the Eastern Front, Norway, and Germany are all featured in one or more missions. The final mission of the campaign is on June 6, 1944, with the Battlehawks flying air support as Operation Overlord begins. The overall goal of the Battlehawks throughout the campaign is to \\"halt the most insidious plans of the Third Reich.\\" The player's principal opponent is the Luftwaffe, in particular the Battlehawk's counterpart, the elite squadron of top German pilots known as Nemesis (similar to the real KG 200), commanded by Oberst Krieger. The player will also face off against the forces of the Japanese Empire. ==Gameplay== The game is almost entirely from a third-person view, with the player's \\"camera\\" set to the rear of the plane looking towards it. Fuel is unlimited, but ammunition and mounted ordnance - bombs, torpedoes, or rockets - are not. In the campaign, the player is often assisted by wingmen. They are friendly pilots who can be ordered to cover Chase's plane, follow it, attack marked units and attack enemy planes. In some missions, it is possible to land on runways and get more ammunition or even change the aircraft. The player can slow down or speed up the time at any moment. However, it also removes voice dialogue. Although most of the gameplay is in the air, certain parts of certain missions are set on the ground and the player must use anti-aircraft weaponry to shoot down enemy planes. The first part of the twelfth mission is in a turret of a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber, and the player uses machine guns to fight incoming fighters. During the campaign, the player can play short challenges that often have unique objectives. The story is not affected if these challenges are skipped, but they also follow the same story of the main part of the campaign. Completion of all secondary objectives during a primary mission can result in a promotion or a decoration being awarded. The player, despite being in the Royal Air Force, is given promotions in American, not British, military rank, and the majority of decorations available are American - some of which did not even exist at the time. The two British decorations that can be earned are the highest available - the George Cross and the Victoria Cross - which, if the player earns them, would make James Chase the first to receive both in history. Throughout the course of the game, the player will have the opportunity to fly many types of World War II aircraft into combat. Most of the aircraft are American, others are British (notably the first few available planes), and the remainder are a handful of German and one Japanese aircraft. Some can be unlocked for multiplayer or single-mission use but not for the campaign, like the Messerschmit Me-163 \\"Komet\\", and others are completely unavailable for player use, like the Nakajima B5N and the Heinkel He-111. F4F Wildcat Secret Weapons Over Normandy is notable for the presence of several prototype designs that never flew in combat, or were used in small numbers, among them the XP-55 Ascender, XP-56 Black Bullet, Chance-Vought Flying Pancake, the Junkers Ju 390, and the Daimler Benz C. Also present are several German weapons projects that were either never completed or failed to make a significant impact on the war, such as the Mistel and the Wasserfall missile launcher. The game features a wide range of actual weapons that were used during World War II. It also features the unlockable TIE Fighter and X-Wing starships from the Star Wars universe in the game's instant action mode. ==Reception== Secret Weapons Over Normandy received \\"favorable\\" reviews on all platforms except the PC version, which received \\"average\\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Steve Butts of IGN praised the sound and gameplay. Kristan Reed of Eurogamer praised the Xbox version, calling it \\"one of the best kept secrets of the year\\". Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot was a little more critical. He praised the simple controls and graphics but noted that they don't excel in any one area, and criticized the lack of challenge. In Japan, where the PS2 version was ported and published by Electronic Arts on January 29, 2004, Famitsu gave it a score of one eight, two sevens, and one eight for a total of 30 out of 40. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2003 video games Category:Cancelled GameCube games Category:LucasArts games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Video games scored by Michael Giacchino Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:World War II flight simulation video games Category:Windows games Category:Xbox games Category:RenderWare games ","title":"Secret Weapons Over Normandy"},{"id":"3251716","text":"Lord Coleridge.

The existing Curtiss SO3C Seamew and Vought OS2U Kingfisher were 1937 designs that, by 1942, needed to be replaced.Bridgeman 1946, pp. 221–222. ==Design and development== recovering a SC-1 in March 1945, during the Iwo Jima operation.

A U.S. Navy SC-1 from over Shanghai, China in 1948 An SC-1 Seahawk being hoisted aboard during a deployment to the Mediterranean Sea from in 1947/1948 Seahawk on board Work began in June 1942, following a US Navy Bureau of Aeronautics request for observation seaplane proposals. Curtiss submitted the Seahawk design on 1 August 1942, with a contract for two prototypes and five service test aircraft awarded on 25 August. A production order for 500 SC-1s followed in June 1943, prior to the first flight of the prototypes.Swanborough and Bowers 1976, p. 153. While only intended to seat the pilot, a bunk was provided in the aft fuselage for rescue or personnel transfer. Two 0.5 in (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns were fitted in the wings, and two underwing hardpoints allowed carriage of 250 lb (113 kg) bombs or, on the right wing, surface-scan radar. The wings were foldable. The main float, designed to incorporate a bomb bay, suffered substantial leaks when used in that fashion, and was modified to carry an auxiliary fuel tank. The first flight of a prototype XSC-1 took place 16 February 1944 at the Columbus, Ohio Curtiss plant.Green 1962, p. 166. Flight testing continued through 28 April, when the last of the seven pre-production aircraft took to the air. Nine further prototypes were later built, with a second seat and modified cockpit, under the designation SC-2; series production was not undertaken. ==Operational history== The first serial production Seahawks were delivered on 22 October 1944, to .Green 1962, p. 167. All 577 aircraft eventually produced for the Navy were delivered on conventional landing gear and flown to the appropriate Naval Air Station, where floats were fitted for service as needed. Capable of being fitted with either float or wheeled landing gear, the Seahawk was arguably America's best floatplane scout of World War II. However, its protracted development time meant it entered service too late to see significant action in the war. It was not until June 1945, during the pre- invasion bombardment of Borneo, that the Seahawk was involved in military action. By the end of the war, seaplanes were becoming less desirable, with the Seahawk being replaced soon afterward by helicopters. Tri-color camouflage and markings on the Seahawk were in accordance with US Navy regulations from 1944, 1945, and later postwar regulations. There are no known surviving examples of the Seahawk today. ==Variants== ;XSC-1 : ;SC-1 : ;SC-2 : ==Specifications (SC-1, float-equipped)== ==See also== ==References== ===Notes=== ===Bibliography=== * Bowers, Peter M.

After Ron's eldest son Ron Jr. quit Scientology in 1959, Ron chose Quentin as his successor to lead the organization. Quentin went to sea with Ron when he established the Sea Organization, living on the flagship Apollo and reaching the highest level of auditor training. He disagreed with his father's plans, sometimes saying that he wanted to be a pilot,Atack (1990); pp. 213-214 and in 1974 that he would like to be a dancer. Soon after this, a friend found him in the midst of a suicide attempt. Quentin survived this attempt and was assigned to the Rehabilitation Project Force.Miller (1987); pp. 314 Former Scientologists have said that Quentin was homosexual,Miller (1987); p. 303Miller, Russell (August 27, 1986). \\"Interview with Kima Douglas\\".

Carnegie Mellon University. \\"Quentin and I came very close to getting involved sexually, but we didn't because he told me that several years earlier, he had become sexually involved with a young woman and she had been sent off the ship when his father found out.

Quentin was assigned to operations there but was often absent. Police discovered him unconscious in his car in Las Vegas on October 28, 1976, without any identifying documents. L.

Curtiss named the SO3C the Seamew but in 1941 the US Navy began calling it by the name Seagull, the same name as the aircraft it replaced (the Curtiss SOC a biplane type), causing some confusion. The British Royal Navy kept the Curtiss name, (Seamew), for the SO3Cs that they ordered. One of the US Navy's main design requirements was that the SOC Seagull's replacement had to be able to operate both from ocean vessels with a single center float and from land bases with the float replaced by a wheeled landing gear. ==Design and development== The Curtiss XSO3C in a wind tunnel, 1940 From the time it entered service the SO3C suffered two serious flaws: inflight stability problems and problems with the unique Ranger air-cooled, inverted V-shaped inline engine. The stability problem was mostly resolved with the introduction of upturned wingtips and a larger rear tail surface that extended over the rear observer's cockpit. The additional tail surface was attached to the rear observer's sliding canopy and pilots claimed there were still stability problems when the canopy was open; the canopy was often open because the aircraft's main role was spotting. While the in-flight stability problem was eventually addressed (although not fully solved), the Ranger XV-770 engine proved a dismal failure even after many attempted modifications. Poor flight performance and a poor maintenance record led to the SO3C being withdrawn from US Navy first line units by 1944. The older biplane SOC was taken from stateside training units and restored to first-line service on many US Navy warships until the end of World War II.Donald 1997, p. ?. ==Operational history== ===Royal Navy service=== A Royal Navy Seamew Mk I. A number of the SO3C-1s, not a floatplane, but a fixed undercarriage version, were ordered by the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm under the terms of Lend-Lease. In RN service the SO3C was given the designation \\"Seamew\\", a name used again in the 1950s for the Short Seamew. Crews gave it the more appropriate name \\"Sea Cow\\". Lettice Curtis, in her book \\"Forgotten Pilots\\", stated 'that although its standard fuel tanks held 300 gallons, it would only just take off with the eighty gallons' fixed as the maximum for Air Transport Auxiliary trips. In addition the tail needed to be raised before becoming airborne, as 'it was possible to take off in an attitude from which it was both impossible to recover and in which there was no aileron control'. The final comment from this experienced pilot was 'it is hard to imagine how, even in wartime, such an aircraft could have been accepted from the factory, let alone given valuable cargo space across the Atlantic'.Curtis, Page 227. The first batch for the RN was to have a centreline bomb rack and arrestor gear. Later versions, known as the Seamew Mk.I, were the SO3-2C variant. 250 Seamews were allocated and some 100 actually delivered,Mondey 1996, p. 95. the last batch was refused in favour of additional Vought Kingfishers. Deliveries to the RN started in January 1944. It was declared obsolete in September the same year and completely removed from service in 1945. The SO3C-1K was to have been taken into service as the Queen Seamew, but an order of 30 was cancelled. Seamews served with No. 744 NAS and No. 745 NAS at RCAF Yarmouth, Nova Scotia Canada, and with No. 755 NAS based in Hampshire, UK. ==Variants== ;XSO3C-1 :Prototype, one built originally as a landplane and later modified as a floatplane. ;SO3C-1 :Production variant, 141 built. ;SO3C-1K :SO3C-1 aircraft modified as target drones, some to the Royal Navy as the Queen Seamew I. ;SO3C-2 :Similar to SO3C-1 but with arrester gear, landplane variant could be fitted with a ventral bomb rack, 200 built. ;SO3C-2C :Lend-lease variant of the SO3C-2 with improved radio and 24V electrical system, for the Royal Navy as the Seamew I, 259 ordered but only about 59 were built. ;SO3C-3 :Reduced weight variant with detailed improvements and catapult operation ability removed, 39 built with a further 659 cancelled. ;SO3C-4 :Proposed variant of the SO3C-3 with arrester hook and catapult capable, not built. ;SO3C-4B :Lend-lease variant of the SO3C-4 for the Royal Navy as the Seamew II, not built. ==Operators== USS Biloxi, October 1943.

It is set between the 15th and the early 19th centuries in the American continents. There is also an expansion pack produced for American Conquest, called American Conquest: Fight Back and a gold edition, which has both the original and expansion pack bundled together. The latest installment in the series is American Conquest: Divided Nation. All three titles are available together as the American Conquest Chronicles. ==Gameplay== American Conquests basic gameplay mechanics and economic factors are shared with the earlier GSC Game World title Cossacks: European Wars and its add-ons. As in Cossacks, American Conquest allows the building of a base with which the player will conduct military and economic activities to prepare for victory in a scenario. While the difference between playing for the European factions and the Native Americans are discernible in terms of military strategy, the basics are the same. The usual chain of activities involve building dwellings for your peasant workforce and to gather resources like wood, food, and gold, stone, coal and iron from mines which the player will have to construct at designated areas. Generally, wood and stone are used to construct buildings whereas the others are primarily used for creating and maintaining the army. Food may be harvested from either a mill or by hunting wild animals with specialized units like the trapper or the buccaneer unit. Wood is gathered by conventional means. Further, the cost of buildings, soldiers and cannons would inflate with each successive one built. Peasants are also now trained from dwellings and not from the town center; the latter now having the role as a scientific upgrade building. American Conquest differs from Cossacks in that peasants are needed in the direct creation of military units. If no peasants are sent into forts, stables or fortresses, no units may be trained. Upgrades which would boost the fighting capability as well as the training time of the army are also conducted at those buildings. Forts and fortresses are central to the defense of any base and garrisoned troops will open fire on encroaching enemy units or wild animals. The common economic and scientific buildings in American Conquest may also be garrisoned by either peasants or by regulars of the army. Similarly, an attacking army may also capture these garrisoned buildings by sending units into them and defeat its defenders in unseen hand-to-hand combat. Players may also construct log cabins if playing for a European power where garrisoned units receive a bonus in its defense. Another feature of American Conquest is the morale factor. Military units would suffer from low morale if the unit is in the vicinity of a mass slaughter of his side and may flee the battlefield. Officers, standard bearers and military drummers are used to create military formations and to increase morale of the troops. The campaign mode covers most of the major European powers' conquest in North America which includes the Spanish, the British and the French as well as the counter-campaigns narrated from the viewpoint of the Native Americans who fought against them. ==Development== GSC Game World designed American Conquest to attract the United States computer game market, which had been unreceptive to its earlier game Cossacks: European Wars, a hit in Europe and Russia. ==Reception== In the United Kingdom, American Conquest sold roughly 20,000 units during the first half of 2003. Kristan Reed of GamesIndustry.biz wrote that these were \\"not figures that spell H.I.T.\\" ==Expansions== ===American Conquest: Fight Back=== American Conquest: Fight Back is a stand-alone expansion pack for American Conquest. It features five new nations: Germany, Russia, Haida, Portugal and the Netherlands, and 50 new units. In addition to new campaigns featuring the Mayas, the Germans, the Haida and the Russians, a new 'battlefield' game mode is available. The German campaign briefly chronicles the expedition of Ambrosius Ehinger and Georg Hohermuth whereas the Russian campaign concerns the Alaskan campaign under Alexander Baranov. The new Haida campaign is from the Haida point of view of the Russian expedition. The Mayas campaign covers details from the Spanish conquest of Yucatán. A total conversion mod for the game was released in 2006, with patches and different versions released up until 2009, called European Warfare: Napoleonica that transferred the player back to 19th Century war-torn Europe during the Napoleonic Wars. The project was undertaken by Gexozoid (helped by the Hawks group and other associates) in 2007 and since then had a fairly active community on GameRanger and forums up until 2015. The Hawks Group recreated a vast database of historical battles that can be played in multiplayer by up to 7 players at the same time, sharing armies or fighting in co-op. It can still be downloaded at their original website or on ModDB. The Mod features over 200 new units and around 20 new buildings that range from a faction's Barracks to fortifications in the form of manned cannon towers and breastworks much like in Cossacks. 12 fully playable nations include: France, England, Poland, Austria, Prussia, Russia, Spain, Italy, the Ottoman Empire, Confederacy of Rhine, Sweden and the USA. ===American Conquest: Divided Nation=== American Conquest: Divided Nation is the second stand-alone expansion to American Conquest. It was released in France in January 2006 and the rest of the world in February 2006. It was developed by Revolution Strategy and features four new nations in three new War periods: The Union, The Confederacy, The Republic of Texas and Mexico, in the American Civil War, Texas Revolution and a single battle in the War of 1812 and more than 120 new units. Old factions are not present in the game but the United States of America can be played against the British Empire in the Battle of New Orleans in the War of 1812. However, due to the lack of buildings and workers, neither can be played in skirmish or multiplayer. The units from the battle can be accessed in a non-multiplayer by writing \\"qwe\\" in the chat and pressing P on the keyboard, an editor window will pop up on the right from which you can choose your player colors and can spawn any unit in the game. The game also brings a host of new features to the game, such as horse artillery, field fortifications, tents, and generals. Players can experience battles entirely new to the RTS Genre, from the Battle of the Alamo to Battle of Gettysburg. Hawks' Divided Nation, another mod project by the Hawks Group emerged which aimed at making the game more realistic by removing building, workers and the other two nations and replacing sounds as well as adding maps based on real battles in the American Civil War in which each side is player controlled. ==References== Category:2002 video games Category:Age of Discovery video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Real-time strategy video games Category:GSC Game World games Category:Video games developed in Ukraine Category:Video games set in North America Category:Video games set in South America Category:Video games set in the United States Category:Video games with expansion packs Category:Windows-only games Category:Windows games ","title":"American Conquest"},{"id":"3251830","text":"Mocky (born October 7, 1974) is a Canadian singer, music producer, multi- instrumentalist, songwriter and composer.The World Provider: Checking In With Mocky (December 12, 2011) ==Biography== Mocky was born Dominic Salole in Saskatchewan, Canada.

Its local name is \\"It-Triq tal-Għajn\\", (the way to the spring), and it took its name from a spring at the bottom of the road leading to Xlendi, known locally as \\"l-Għajn il-Kbira\\", (the big spring). Fontana is the Italian word for a spring. On the lower part of Fontana, on the right-hand side of the road to Xlendi, one cannot help but notice the evergreen Lunzjata Valley going up to the village of Kerċem. Local farmers are busy around all year long in this fertile part of Gozo. ==The People== Most of the fishermen that operated from the fishing village of Xlendi lived in Fontana. Also, some other people used to go hunting in the adjacent Lunzjata Valley. Later in the nineteenth century, they began setting aside part of the proceeds from their catches to construct a church. ==Zones in Fontana== *Is- Saqwi *Tal-Għajn *Wied tal-Lunzjata *Wied Siekel *Ix-Xari *Manresa *Santa Duminka ==The Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Fontana== The foundation stone of the church was laid on 29 January 1893. The church was consecrated twelve years to that day on 29 January 1905, and was dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The church was established as the parish of Fontana on 27 March 1911 under Bishop Giovanni Maria Camilleri. The spectacular village feast is celebrated each year around the 2nd and 3rd week of June. The Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Fontana is also a parish church, and considered to be a national sanctuary of the Sacred Heart. ==L-Għajn il-Kbira - The Big Spring== At times, people can still be found washing their clothes at the Fontana spring. Arched shelters were built in the sixteenth century over the springs for the convenience of people when washing their clothes. A very old irrigation system made up from stone gutters constantly brings water from a spring situated in the Kerċem part of the valley. ==Il-Loghob tan-Nar== The village of Fontana always been known to have fireworks enthusiasts. The start of it all was a certain short and quiet man, Ninu Farrugia, who had brought the skill of pyrotechnics from Malta. He was a prime master in fireworks and performed technical work in this skill with great skill and precision. His children later on continued this work. The Fontana Brothers, a number of youths from Fontana helped Ninu, and by time also turned into experts in this dangerous craft. Over time this group became champions in Gozo for constructing fireworks for the Sacred Heart feast. Although Fontana was a small village, the amount of fireworks that was produced for the festival would be greater than that of other villages in Gozo. Thousands of people attended the feast to follow the infernal box that had a certain rhythm and quality. Fontana Brothers was the Brand name of Fontana and has been famous since the start. Some were obviously very proud because it meant expertise in pyrotechnics and courage which lead them creating bigger and better fireworks which could only be seen in Fontana. Those who make them and set these fireworks off from the fields, both were justifiable to celebrate their 'bravura' or their insanity during the march of the latter at the end of the feast. However a new organisation, 'Għaqda tan-Nar Fontana' was set up in 2014 after the 2010 tragedy at Farrugia Brothers Fireworks Factory that cost the lives of 5 people from Fontana. To this day, it is said that the village of Fontana still leads the pyrotechnics side of Gozo by setting up grand fireworks shows including them with vast variety of spectacular fireworks. ==Iż-Żagħżugħ tas-sena== 2017 - Franklin Cardona 2018 - Thomas Mizzi 2019 - Andre Camilleri ==Shelters== Shelters were built beside the Springs. This was useful for the Fontanin to go for shelter when there were raids during World War II. This shelter started at the Springs and ended on a cliff overlooking Fontana. ==Administration of the Local Council== *Savior Borg (Mayor, PN) *Carmel Farrugia (PN) *Josephine Camilleri (PN) *Horace Micallef (PL) *Jonathan Cefai (PL) ==References== ==External links== * Fontana Local Council Official Website * Sacred Heart Parish Official Website Category:Towns in Malta Category:Gozo Category:Local councils of Malta ","title":"Fontana, Gozo"},{"id":"3251839","text":"Għajnsielem, meaning \\"Peaceful Spring\\", is a municipality on the southeastern coast of the island of Gozo in Malta, including the entire island of Comino. It has a population of 3,200 residents (as of March 2014), and is the first Gozitan village that greets the visitor on leaving Mġarr Harbour towards the Gozitan heartland. Its name originated from the water spring, around which in 1700, Grandmaster Perellos built an arcade containing public wash basins and fresh water spouts. Attractions include Lourdes Chapel with its sharp steeple and underlying niche of Our Lady of Lourdes, Fort Chambray and the towering of Ghajnsielem Parish Church. ==Village Motto and Coat of Arms== The Latin motto of Ghajnsielem is Ob fontem prosperitas, that is Flourishing because of a spring – Nistaghna b’nixxiegha ilma.

The village of Kerċem lies close by to the south-west of Victoria, spread between the picturesque Lunzjata Valley, the green hills of Tal-Mixta, Għar Ilma and Ta' Dbieġi, and stretching up to the Pond of Għadira ta' San Rafflu and Xlendi cliffs. Archaeological discoveries show that the sizeable area of Kerċem was inhabited as early as the Għar Dalam phase (5000–4500 BC). The Roman Baths and an early Christian cemetery at Għar Gerduf, referred to by Gozitan historian Giovanni Pietro Francesco Agius de Soldanis as Roman Catacombs, are also significant discoveries. However, to date, these historic sites are not accessible to the public. Ta' Kerċem evolved into a village community in the late Middle Ages, around an ancient chapel dedicated to Pope Gregory the Great built around 1581. The site gained historical importance due to the annual traditional St. Gregory procession from the Matrix church in Rabat (Victoria) to this medieval chapel, upon the saint's feast, namely on 12 March. The chapel was, however, replaced by the present parish church in 1851, which in turn was enlarged later on to its present state between 1906 and 1910. Ta' Kercem became a distinct parish on 10 March 1885 by Bishop Pietru Pace. The Ta' Kercem parish church is the only Gozitan church which is jointly dedicated to two saints. As referred earlier, it was traditionally dedicated to Pope Gregory, but, since 17 August 1885, the church was additionally co-dedicated to Our Lady of Perpetual Help. The village of Ta' Kerċem has a population of around 1700 people. Cultural activities include the annual Għadira Fair, which is a popular traditional family fair in the countryside area of San Rafflu. The hamlet of Santa Luċija, Gozo, although in itself incorporated within Ta' Kerċem, is quite distinct with its rustic church square. Santa Luċija is inhabited by country folk with a few old houses built around an old chapel dedicated to St. Lucy. In 2018, the former police station in the locality was vacated and put for sale. ==Zones in Kerċem== *Fuq il-Blat *Għajn Abdul *Għar Ilma *Iċ-Ċnus *Ix-Xagħri *Klula *Lekx *Sarraflu *Ta' Berrini *Ta' Ċajplu *Ta' Ġanton *Ta' Katas *Ta' Majru *Ta' Summina *Ta' Xkura *Tal-Warda *Wardija *Wied il-Ġifna *Wied tal- Grixti ==References== ==External links== *Awarded \\"EDEN - European Destinations of Excellence\\" non traditional tourist destination 2008 *Images from the picturesque hamlet of Santa Lucija Category:Towns in Malta Category:Local councils of Malta Category:Gozo ","title":"Kerċem"},{"id":"3251841","text":"Munxar () is a village which lies on the southern side of Gozo, Malta, close to the village of Sannat. It has its own local council. As of March 2014, the Munxar population was 1,454. Close by to this village, there is Xlendi Bay, a popular tourist resort engulfed in a fiord like inlet amongst high cliffs. Xlendi Bay is a small fishing village, but is also an ideal bathing and diving resort especially in summer. Otherwise, foreigners and locals enjoy the late spring and early autumn sunsets often captured by artists or keen photographers. The parish church, a small baroque building built from the typical Maltese stone, is dedicated to St. Paul. It was built between 1914 and 1925 and was consecrated on 18 October 1925. Bishop Giuseppe Pace established it as a parish church on 12 December 1957. As a result, Munxar was the last village in Gozo to become an autonomous parish. The feast officially falls on 10 February which is also a national public holiday; however, the outside festivities are celebrated on the third Sunday of each May. One of the people of note to have been born and lived in this village is Professor Joseph Aquilina. ==History== The first records that were found recording Munxar as an area dates back to the sixteenth century when the area was named Monxiar, which means a bucksaw, taking its name from the two valleys running parallel from the village. From a sixteenth-century census, the village had a population of around 200 inhabitants. The first surnames recorded in the census were Attard, Barberi, Hagius, among a few others which suggests that these were the first Munxarin. In that time, Monxiar and Xlendi were part of the village of Sannat. At the time, the population of Xlendi was only 8 persons – the tower guardian and his family who lived in Xlendi tower. Munxar playing field Remains of a megalithic temple were found in limits of Ta' Marżiena and also Roman remains were found in Xlendi valley. Geographically, Munxar has always formed part of the neighbouring village of Sannat. People of Munxar attended their spiritual needs at Saint Maragret parish at Sannat; however, historical facts and documented evidence points the existence of three other chapels, now completely demolished. Late in the nineteenth century, the present parish priest of Sannat noticed the need for a small chapel for the spiritual need of the Munxarin, so a chapel was constructed in the site where the parish church now stands. In the following years, the chapel became too small since the village grew, and the rector of the chapel presented a petition to build a church to the bishop. The building of a new church was approved by the curia and on 2 February 1914 construction of a new church began on a site donated by two brothers and a sister known as 'Ta Katalla'. The church was finished on 19 February 1921. The church was dedicated to Saint Paul and later a statue of Saint Paul was made by Wistin Camilleri in 1933. Munxar church was made a parish on its own rights on 12 December 1957. ==Zones in Munxar== *Ġnien is-Sultan *Il-mejda *Sanap Cliffs *Ta' Kamleta *Ta' Luvier *Ta' Marżiena *Ta' Rinota *Ta' Valletta *Taksis *Xlendi Valley ==Munxar Main Roads== *Triq Dun Spir Gauci (Fr.

It had a population of 4509 as of March 2014. ==History== The word \\"Nadur\\" which in Maltese means \\"look out\\", is derived from the Arabic word nadara. The town's motto means much the same. There are no documents or archaeological evidence which could shed light on the colonization of Nadur by its first inhabitants. Nevertheless, the plateau and its surroundings, with a few farmhouses scattered here and there, were in existence for many years well before the area became a parish. The only trace of archaeological evidence were a number of large flat stones found in a field between San Blas Bay and Daħlet Qorrot. According to the Gozitan historian Giovanni Pietro Francesco Agius de Soldanis these roofed structures, which are not in existence anymore, once used to serve as a sort of temple to the gods. He also imagined that these slabs of stone couldn't have been placed there by normal people but by very strong people or giants. He also wrote that Nadur may have been founded during the time of the Greeks. One proof of this connection is a bronze statue of Apollo said to be found in Nadur in 1744. Throughout history Nadur played a very important role in the defense of the island from corsairs, hence the name. During the reign of the Knights of St. John, a watch tower was built by Grandmaster Nicolas Cotoner which has been referred to by Dahlet Qorrot Tower or San Blas Tower for the two bays lying on either side of it. The tower is locally known as Isopu Tower. Another watchtower found in Nadur is Ta' Kenuna Tower built by the British towards the middle of the 19th century. It served as a telegraph link between Malta and Gozo. From the top of this semaphore tower, one can see most of the island, Comino and the northern part of Malta with a wonderful view in Winter of the green fields and the blue sea. The area near the tower was constructed into a garden in there are many local plants and trees. ==Nadur today== As of March 2014 Nadur had a population which neared 4500 people, which makes it the third most populated Gozitan town after Xagħra and Victoria. There are about 20 farmers in Nadur, the majority of whom work their fields on part-time basis. From the orchards of Nadur come most of the local fruits such as plums, peaches, apples, oranges and lemons. This produce maintained commercial contacts with Malta for over 3000 years. Today this commerce is still ongoing and a great amount of Maltese citrus is produced from Nadur. More specifically, it was recently put on record that 70% of all Maltese citrus originates from Nadur. The local council lately promoted the planting of olive trees imported from Italy as these trees have consistently decreased in number over a period of years. A good number of others earn their living from the sea as fishermen or sailors. But almost all people work as businessmen, analysts, teachers, etc. ==Regions in Nadur== Although Nadur is spread out, it can be split in various regions, namely: a) main square area, b) Ta' Hida, c) San Blas, and d) Ta' Kenuna area. Main square area centers basically around the parish church, with a host of shops, eateries, snack bars, and mostly residential housing. Important places of interest in the center are: Sacred Heart (Ta' Karkanja) church, Local Council office, police station, parish office, primary school, Mnarja Band Club, Nadur Youngsters football club, Museum branches (male and female), Franciscan Sisters convent & chapel, playing field (whose pitch was recently covered with artificial turf), etc. Ta' Hida's main artery surrounds Ramla Bay's main road, which is particularly busy in the summertime. Ta' Hida's new extension, along Ramla Bay road, comprises a housing estate built in the 1970s and a playing field. A new, albeit controversial, cemetery is being constructed on the way to Ramla. San Blas has both residential areas, relatively old and new, very fertile land and picturesque valleys, full of mainly citrus trees. San Blas takes the name after the little secluded red-sandy bay, called after bishop Blaise, whose veneration still exists in the Catholic Church up to today. A nearby beach is Daħlet Qorrot (an 'inland beach'), with many locals owning caves and garages where many keep their fishing boats. Nearby is San Blas, a tiny, sandy bay on the north-eastern coast. It is a favourite spot for swimming for local residents. Close to San Blas, one finds also a bushy arid area called il- Qortin as well as the Mistra Rocks coastline. Gozo's AFM base is located here, together with Ta' Sopu Tower, which can be found in a restored state. The Ta' Kenuna area was developed in the early 1980s. Previously, the area was barren, except for the Ta' Kenuna Tower, a telegraph structure built under the British era, Nadur cemetery and some vineyards. Although in the past the cemetery seemed to scare off people, and no one dared to live next to it, today the cemetery has become literally a traffic island, surrounded by busy roads and residential areas. ==Nadur Parish== The religious feast of Nadur – Mnarja – is celebrated on 29 June (http://www.june29th.com). The feast was popular with honeymooners and its name seems to suggest that there is a possible connection with the beginning of Summer. It is derived from luminaria (illumination), and in fact it is a festival rooted in Maltese seasonal rituals and customs. The beloved titular statue, that of St. Peter and St. Paul, was made in Marseilles in 1882. It is one of the many masterpieces that grace the grand church. On Good Friday a set of statues are taken out for the holy procession depicting the passion and crucifixion of Jesus. On the morning of Easter a statue of The Risen Lord is also joyfully paraded. The parish church, dedicated to St. Peter and Paul, is a very artistic monument of both architecture and painting, rich in marble works and decorations, erected on the site of a former smaller church and which is also the highest point in town. ==St. Peter & Paul Basilica== Nadur BasilicaThe construction of the present church was started on 28 September 1760 and the design is attributed to the Maltese architect Giuseppe Bonici. In 1907 a refurbishment programme took place to construct the aisles, dome and façade based on the Italian Renaissance design of Prof. F.S. Sciortino. The ceiling, depicting episodes connected with St. Peter and Paul, was painted by Lazzaro Pisani (hailing from Ħaż-Żebbuġ), while the architectural decorations are the work of the Italian Pio Cellini. Principal force behind all these new projects was Archpriest Martin Camilleri (1910–1921). The parish has its own community radio station: Radju Luminarja, established more than 10 years ago accumulating several members since then.http://www.nadurparish.com/ ==Band clubs== *Mnarja Band Club (L-Għaqda Mużikali Mnarja) ==Administration== The Local Council is currently made up of 5 councillors who are: *Edward Said (Mayor) - PN *Eucharist Camilleri - PN *Rita Mifsud - PN *Josianne Cutajar - PL *Michael Camilleri - PL ==Zones in Nadur== *Ta' Ħida *Ta' Kenunan *Ta' Ġebel *Ta' Zejtun *Ta' Sardina *Ta' Spilotti *Ta' Venuta *Ta' Wistin *Tad-Duru *Tal-Ħawli *Tal-Laċċa *Tal-Weraq *Tat-Tiġrija *Tax-Xewka *Tax-Xini *(Wied) San Blas *Ta' Xurdin ==Nadur main roads== *Pjazza San Pietru u San Pawl (St Peter and St Paul Square) *Triq Daħlet Qorrot (Daħlet Qorrot Cove Road) *Triq Għajn Qasab (Ghajn Qasab Street) *Triq il-Ħanaq *Triq il-Knisja (Church Street) *Triq ir-Rabat (Victoria Road) *Triq ir-Ramla (Ramla Road) *Triq it-13 ta' Diċembru (13 December Street) *Triq it-Tiġrija (Tigrija Road) *Triq l-Imġarr (Mgarr Road) *Triq San Blas (San Blas Bay Road) *Triq San Ġwann (St John Street) *Triq Xandriku (Xandriku Street) ==References== ==External links== *Nadur Local Council *Nadur Carnival *Nadur Parish * June29th.com *Awarded \\"EDEN - European Destinations of Excellence\\" non traditional tourist destination 2007 Category:Towns in Malta Category:Local councils of Malta Category:Gozo ","title":"Nadur"},{"id":"3251843","text":"Qala () is a village on the island of Gozo, Malta, with a population of 1,929 as of September 2019. Nearby is Ħondoq ir-Rummien, a coastline with salt pans and caves popular with snorkellers and divers. ==Etymology== The name Qala derives from Siculo-Arabic.p. 88 ==About the town== Qala is first referred to in a fifteenth-century portolan preserved at the Vatican Library. It has taken its name from the ('port') of . It is the easternmost village of Gozo and has been inhabited since early times. The development of the present settlement began in the second half of the seventeenth century. It is a pleasant and rural place with many natural and historic attractions. Though Qala is the farthest village from Gozo's capital, Victoria, it is the closest to the rest of the Maltese archipelago, and the rocky hillsides of Qala enjoy an unobstructed view of the islands of Malta and Comino. The aforementioned islands can be clearly seen from Qala Belvedere and from the small courtyard in front of the church known as (Our Lady of the Rocks). This church faces Comino and legend has it that it was built so that the people of that island could follow Holy Mass from across the straits when rough weather precluded a priest from crossing there. Except for a few sheltered inlets, like the popular Ħondoq ir-Rummien, Qala's coastline is largely rugged. Among the many sea caves found along the coast is Għar Minka, which is accessible only by boat.http://www.getamap.net/maps/malta/malta_(general)/_minka_ghar/ Qala is located at the easternmost point of Gozo, and is the village furthest from the capital Victoria. Its name is both Arabic and Maltese for sheltered haven or bay, and this is reflected in its coat of arms – a Gozo boat sailing on rough seas. The village parish church is dedicated to Saint Joseph, and was built by Dun Guzepp Diacono, between 1882 and 1889. Its style is baroque as in many other churches on the island. Qala became a parish on 3 February 1872, and until 1889 the parish church was that of the Immaculate Conception of Our Lady. The foundation stone of the parish of Saint Joseph was laid on 19 March 1882 and the church consecrated on 8 May 1904. Sites of historical interest in and around Qala include the salt pans, a well-preserved windmill and prehistoric remains. One can find examples of cart ruts, (parallel tracks cut into the rock) which extend over and are some of the longest on Gozo. ==Places of interest== ===St. Joseph Parish Church=== The village parish church is dedicated to St Joseph. It was built by the same architect-priest who built the church of Għasri, Dun Guzepp Diacono, between 1882 and 1889, when he was serving as parish priest of Qala. It is built in baroque, for many churches on the island, whether built in the seventeenth or in the latter half of the twentieth century, were constructed in this style. Qala became a parish on 3 February 1872, the first to be established after the establishment of the Diocese of Gozo. Until 1889, the seat of the parish church was the church of the Immaculate Conception of Our Lady. The foundation stone of the parish of Saint Joseph was laid on 19 March 1882 and the church was consecrated on 8 May 1904. The parish became Archi-presbyteral on 21 April 1965. The village feast to St. Joseph is celebrated yearly in early August. ===Immaculate Conception Chapel=== This Chapel, which is situated in Qala on the way to , is one of the earliest Marian shrines on the island and dates back to 1575. It is dedicated to the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary. The feast is celebrated on 8 December and the statue was sculptured in Marseilles by Gallard et Fils in 1887. In the early 1650s, the chapel was enlarged and on 28 April 1688, it became the parish church of the eastern part of Gozo, Qala, Nadur and Għajnsielem and remained so for about 12 years. It served again as a parish church of Qala from February 1872 to February 1889. It was consecrated on 21 May 1950. Between 1982 and 1988 the inside was gilded and refurbished. The main attraction is the altarpiece, attributed to Federico Barocci di Urbino. It shows God extending his special protection to the Immaculate Conception. The Virgin Mary was crowned on 1 August 1954. ===St. Anthony's Battery=== St. Anthony's Battery, also known as (Qala Point) Battery, was built between 1731 and 1732. Its design is attributed to Charles François de Mondion. It was intended to guard the mouth of the channel between Gozo and Comino. The work was originally designed with a semi-circular gun platform and two blockhouses at the rear; however, it was eventually built with a semi-hexagonal front. Consequently, the landward defenses incorporated a free-standing red-an trace with thick walls and numerous musketry loopholes, which were shielded by two flanking traverses. The land front itself was protected by a shallow ditch. A solid blockhouse with battered walls occupied the center of the enclosure. In 1770, St. Anthony's Battery had an armament of three 8-pounder guns with 427 rounds of roundshot and 75 rounds of grapeshot; and eight 6-pounder guns with 127 rounds of roundshot and 45 rounds of grapeshot. Although most of the landward part of St. Anthony's Battery was in a precarious state of neglect with part of the wall and the entire blockhouse in complete ruins, (a non- profit making organisation) are at present carrying out renovation and reconstruction works on the Block house and the entrance.  bay can be accessed from the village of Qala and lies opposite to the isle of Comino. The small sandy beach and its crystalline water makes Ħondoq Bay very popular amongst the local population especially in summer. Apart from an ideal swimming zone, the bay is also renowned for diving, especially for beginners. During summer evenings a number of local families stay late in Ħondoq to relax by their smoking barbecues enjoying the cool summer breeze. ==Voluntary Groups in Qala==  was set up in 1996. It was 25 July of that year when for the first time a local voice was heard on radio sets in Qala. The mind behind the whole idea was that of Canon Karm Refalo who was archpriest of Qala at the time. Helped along by a group of young people all fired with dynamic energy and enthusiasm they succeeded in transmitting the first schedule of programmes on the occasion of the feast of St. Joseph, patron saint of Qala. It was a totally new idea for Qala and even for Gozo, but which took root and is now spread all over the Maltese islands in a considerable number of community radio stations. One may ask, was it opportune that such a radio station should be set up? The answer is definitely yes. Otherwise how could the station be still functioning thirteen years after it started. The station serves many purposes. In the first place it is a valuable means of transmission. Besides, it forms a link with Maltese emigrants scattered in so many countries overseas; it is a means for spiritual and social teaching; it is also a means of support and consolation to so many lonely old or sick people who listening to the voice reaching them from the small town in the east of Gozo, can follow all that is happening in the world outside their rooms and feel that they are still a part of that world. The beginning was difficult. Resources were limited. None of those involved were experts in the field of transmission. It all started from nothing in a small room on top of the church sacristy. Yet it was from there that the voice which today still echoes first emerged. The first schedule of programmes spread over a few days was successfully completed and all felt happy and proud of the achievement. On the days following the village feast, many were asking \\"Why did you stop transmitting?\\" It was evident that the idea of a local station had been well received in the town and that the community of Qala was in favour that it should be explored further. The enthusiasm of the pioneering group was strong enough not to let the idea die out but instead to make it grow and develop. And that is exactly what happened. From then onwards the schedule of programmes continued to grow in quantity and quality. Originally Radju Leħen il-Qala transmitted on frequency 106.5FM. But when consequently a national radio started transmissions on a frequency quite close, it caused a hindrance to our community radio. People were complaining that the voice of the local radio was no longer clear and they were experiencing difficulty in following the programmes. This was a further proof of the value of the radio. It was a confirmation that it was a good and modern means of bringing the Christian message to the whole community. An official request was therefore made to the Broadcasting Authority and Radju Leħen il-Qala was given a new frequency – 106.3FM. Who could have thought that Radju Leħen il-Qala would start a new page in the field of national broadcasting? Yet that is exactly what happened. Once more the radio took the front lead among community radios in the finals for best programmes in the Maltese islands. Saturday, 16 November 2002 is a date that will be forever remembered and which will be written in gold in the history of the radio and in that of broadcasting in Malta. Not only was the radio among the finalists but also won first place with the programme 'L’edukazzjoni ta’Wliedna' (The Education of our Children). Many just could not believe. They queried how a community radio could compete with national stations. Yet it could. Following its success, the radio figured prominently in the local media when it sought to go further. There were more surprises in the pipeline. The station once more reached the finals in the Awards for the best programmes set by the Broadcasting Authority. In November 2003 Radju Leħen il-Qala won third place out of eighteen nominations in the edition Gharfien Nazzjonali Zghazagh fis-Socjeta' 2003 (National Recognition of Youth in Society 2003) Since its beginning, Radju Leħen il-Qala has changed its transmission studio more than once, always with one aim, to give better service. Unfortunately this did not always turn out to be the truth, but one can only learn through mistakes. Today, Radju Leħen il-Qala has new studios, better equipped, more comfortable, which after all suit the high image the radio enjoys. These studios have been inaugurated in July 2008. They are under the direction of the present archpriest Canon Dr. Joe Zammit and they are committed to grow better and stronger thus laying the way for the future. ===The Qala Fireworks Group=== The Qala Fireworks Group, formed back in 1956, is made up of very dedicated volunteer people who work all year round to collect funds and put up one of the greatest aerial and ground fireworks show on Gozo. Qala has always been renewed for having high quality fireworks and this is what the group strive to achieve year after year. The group heavily depends on the generosity of the village people, whom with their donations finance a large part of the total outlay. As soon as a feast is over, the group looks back at all the work done and then starts its preparations for the following year's show. A thing which this group is famous for and which withdraws people from all corners of Malta and Gozo is without doubt the ground fireworks, where only in this feast one can see such a nice and huge display in Gozo. It all started in 1999, when some Qala fireworks enthusiasts came up with the idea of making 2 new structures (armaturi). And the story continued from there. At that time they managed to make 2 structures, which left everyone amazed by their huge size, technicality and the great performance they gave. And from there, year after year the group continued to produce new structures and thanks to this, we proudly say that no where else in Gozo can one see such an amazing show which is held annually on Saturday evening. Apart from being famous for the ground fireworks show, the same can be said as regards the aerial display put on every year. Believing in quality and not much in quantity, the group offers one of the best aerial displays in Gozo especially the Sunday night show. The show starts with the and continue with a nice spectacle of from a variety of fireworks factories from around Malta and Gozo... ===Għaqda Briju San Ġużepp=== Għaqda Briju San Ġużepp was formed back in July 2007 when a number of enthusiastic youths decided to put their energies together with the main aims being of: *Getting together the village youths by organising activities all year round related particularly to them. *Improving the external celebrations relating to the Saint Joseph Feast celebrated in our village. *Working on new feast decorations. Once the committee was formed on 1 July 2007, work started immediately for the feast which was due to be celebrated at the beginning of the following month. In this relatively short period, the group managed to organize with big success two BBQ Fests at Hondoq ir-Rummien with the aim of raising funds to finance the projects which the committee had agreed to work on. After the 2007 feast was over, the committee prepared a program of activities for the whole year. In fact the group organised transport for the Notte Bianca event in October, a Christmas concert with the collaboration of the Qala Local Council, as well as helped in the carnival celebrations held in our village. In early March, work started on the second phase of the project, which was scheduled to be completed before the 2008 feast. Also the group designed and ordered new feast T-shirts as well as worked on new flags to be used during the marches. Another initiative taken was that of meeting on a regular basis the Qala youths to prepare with them for the feast marches, the aim being of having well organised celebrations. The 2008 Feast was a memorable one not only for the group but for all the people of our village. People were amazed since a small village can put up such an amazing feast. The committee have already started its preparations for the upcoming feast and is currently in discussions to decide on the next project which it promises to be bigger than the one finished this year. ===Qala St. Joseph F.C.=== Qala St. Joseph F.C is a football club from the village of Qala in Gozo, Malta. The club was founded in 1968 and is named after the village patron Saint Joseph. They play in the Gozo Football League. ===Menhir Qala Folk Group=== The Menhir Qala Folk Group, was originally set up to promote the local traditions and culture of the Gozitan and Maltese folklore, with special reference to the village of Qala and its history. The Qala Local Council offered all its means and manpower to sustain the conception and growth of this folk group. The first official group inauguration took place on 18 September 2004 in Ġnien il-Familja where a traditional Maltese night was organized with full co-operation of the Qala Local Council involving the participation of all the members of the group; the repertoire being several traditional Maltese dances and songs. Since its formation in 2003, the Menhir Qala Folk Group has participated in various local, national and international events and activities; mostly those organized by other local councils both in Malta and Gozo. It is worth mentioning here, that the first invitation abroad was to Porto Roz in Slovenia in July 2005 for the Val Piran International Folklore Festival where the group was representing the Maltese Islands amongst other foreign groups such as those from Portugal, Italy and of course Slovenia. Since then, the group has participated in other Folk Festivals, held in Lanciano, Italy, Serbia, Czech Republic and Lefkada, Greece. For the near future the group is being enlarged with the involvement of four male dancers. Traditional costumes are worn and tools are used during the dances and songs to provide a better picture to the audience especially for tourists when performing locally and also when participating in international events abroad. With great success our folk group, in collaboration with the Qala Local Council has organised the Qala International Folk Festival, which this year will be the 6th edition since its inception. This folk festival is the only international folk festival held on the island of Gozo and it is very much anticipated by both the local communities and the tourists visiting the island at the time. Folk groups from abroad who have so far participated in this event hail from countries such as, Slovenia, Serbia, Portugal, Italy, Bulgaria, Sicily and Slovakia to name but a few. During this festival the Menhir Qala Folk Group are responsible in the re-enactment of a traditional Maltese wedding. Another event held during the festival is a half-day conference covering a different subject related with our customs and culture. For this conference, even the foreign groups attending the festival, participate. The Menhir Qala Folk Group has recently acquired premises in the village of Qala, which used to be the old police station and which eventually, with the assistance of the Local Council, these premises will be transformed into a folklore museum, and obviously will be the headquarters for the Menhir group. The Menhir Qala Folk Group committee is made up of 7 members and the president is Mr Paul Buttigieg, Mayor of Qala Local Council. These committee meetings are held in the Qala Local Council premises. ===Ite Ad Joseph=== The Ite ad Joseph Band is the official band of the village of Qala is one of eleven bands on the island Gozo. It was established on 8 December 1996 and just recently marked its first fifteenth anniversary. Since then the band has offered numerous services and most of Gozo's feasts on an annual basis mainly at the villages of Nadur, Ghajnsielem, Xewkija, Xaghra, Fontana, Sannat, St Anthony in Mgarr and at the St. George's feast in the capital Victoria. Also, the band has had services in a number of localities in Malta like in Kalkara. The Band is one which is quite renounced in Gozo. Over the years, the Ite ad Joseph Band grew to become a medium-sized Gozitan band with an emphasis on quality service. It has issued two CDs so far, one in 2001 and another in 2004 on the occasion of the Centenary Celebrations. Between 20 and 26 September 2001 a number of Ite ad Joseph bandsmen participated with the Sicilian Band of Salina at Isola Verde. In September 2005 the band visited and performed in Arvika in the region of Varmland in Sweden. On other occasions a number of bandsmen performed in Siros in Greece. The band is composed of about 35 regularly practicing and attending bandsmen and women and 39 students studying music, all from the village of Qala. As is the tradition in Gozo, a number of bandsmen and women are invited from outside the village to support the band on most occasions. The Ite ad Joseph committee is presided by Raymond Tabone, Joseph Gatt is the secretary and Simeon Spiteri is the treasurer and Steve Bartolo, Lorne Cremona, and Gabriel Vella are members. The band is presently under the direction of Mro. Mark Gauci. All official committee meetings are held at the Ite ad Joseph Band Club at 12 St. Joseph Square, Qala, Gozo. The membership base counts to over 600 members, accounting for half of the village population. Its popularity extends beyond Gozo's shores to hundreds of fans living in Australia, Canada, the United States of America, England and Wales. ==Events== ===St.Joseph Feast (Qala's patron's feast)=== The feast of Qala is celebrated on the first Sunday of August and is dedicated to the beloved patron Saint Joseph.

Its name is derived from Lawrence of Rome who is the patron saint for the village. It has a population of 748, as of March 2014. The Dwejra nature reserve is administratively part of the town. Prominently in the reserve is the Fungus Rock, and formerly also the Azure Window landmark before its collapse in 2017. ==Overview== It is built on a plain surrounded by three hills, Għammar, Gelmus and Ta' Dbieġi. The last mentioned, Ta' Dbieġi, rises 195 metres above sea level and is Gozo's highest point. In the limits of San Lawrenz, there is also the bay of Dwejra, known for its strange geological faults. The village has retained its traditional and rural lifestyle. San Lawrenz is one of the two Gozitan localities that have taken their name from that of their patron saint. The other is the nearby hamlet of Santa Luċija, Gozo. San Lawrenz was established a parish on 15 March 1893. Before this date, the area was known as Ta' Ċangura. Most probably the site derived its name from a local family name or nickname. The date of origin of this area is not known. However the name Ta' Ċangura can be dated back to before the Siege of Gozo, that is, before July 1551. Until San Lawrenz was declared a parish in 1893, it formed part of the neighbourhood of Għarb. However, as time went by the people of San Lawrenz started to form a separate community and as a result they wanted their own church. The foundation stone for this new church was laid and consecrated by the Bishop Peter Pace on 21 November 1886. The relic of Saint Lawrence was placed under this stone. Every villager participated in the building of the church. The village feast of San Lawrenz is celebrated each year, in the warmest part of the Summer, namely around the first week of August. There is one restaurant, the village shop and the local bar (run by the local football club to raise funds). With a population of 748 people (as of March 2014), it is the second least populated village on Gozo and third least in all of the Maltese Islands. The village's football team is called St. Lawrence Spurs. ==Main roads== *Pjazza San Lawrenz (St. Lawrence Square) *Triq Ta' Ċangura (Ciangura Road) *Triq id-Duluri (Our Lady of Sorrows Road) *Triq il-Ġebla tal- Ġeneral (Fungus Rock Road) *Triq il-Wileġ (Open Fields Street) *Triq San Lawrenz (St. Lawrence Road) ===Other streets=== *Daħlet Pawluzzu (Pauluzzu Lane) *Pjazza Dwejra (Dwejra Square) *Trejqa l-10 ta' Awissu (10 August Path) *Trejqet il-Wilġa Ta' Ġidrin (Gidrin's Open Field Path) *Triq Dun Salv Portelli (Fr.

The population of Xewkija is 3,300 as of March 2014, which is the fourth largest in Gozo, after Victoria (6,901), Xagħra (4,886) and Nadur (4,509). ==History== Xewkija, which is situated between Għajnsielem and the capital city, Victoria, is the oldest village in Gozo. It became the first parish outside Victoria on 27 November 1678. It was separated from the Matrix by Bishop Miguel Jerónimo de Molina and Dun Grezz Farrugia from Valletta, became its first parish priest. It became the first district 'contrada' to be known as 'casale' or village. Titular Statue of Saint John The name is derived from the Maltese word \\"\\", meaning \\"thistles\\" or \\"thorns\\". Xewkija is famous for its church, The Rotunda of Xewkija, which is dedicated to St. John the Baptist. It is the Seat of the Knights of the Order of St. John, and was built from Maltese stone by local masons and craftsmen. It is the largest in Gozo and its dome dominates the village. Its architect was Ġużè Damato. It replaced an older church. The titular statue of Saint John the Baptist was sculpted in wood by Pietro Paolo Azzopardi in 1845. On the site where the present church is, it was said that there was a stone known as 'Maqgħad ix-Xiħ'. Near it there is a small ancient chapel known as Madonna tal-Ħniena (Our Lady of Charity) which was dedicated to San Bartilimew. The Santa Cecilia Tower had been in the limits of Xewkija. There is another tower with the oldest sundial in Xewkija. Remains of Tinghi Tower disappeared in the 20th century. These towers date back to 1613. The Gourgion Tower, which was built in 1690, was demolished during the Second World War to make way for a temporary airstrip. Front cuppola of the church being built The Majmuna Stone with an Arabic inscription dating back to 1174 was possibly found in Xewkija. It commemorates the death of an Arab girl named Maymūnah. The inscription is carved in a thick marble slab, on the underside of which there is a Roman symbol. Brother Gabrijel D'Alappo translated it into Italian and it was later translated into Maltese. It was sent to the Public Library in Malta in 1845 and brought to the Gozo Museum of Archaeology in 1960. The Banda Prekursur (Precursor Band) is the oldest organization in Xewkija. It was set up on 13 May 1929. Lorenzo Zammit Haber, Marcell Mercieca, Giuseppe Buttigieg, Giovanni Haber and Tomaso Attard were among its founders. Mr. Lorenzo Zammit Haber was first President and Secretary. The coat of arms of Xewkija is a shield on a gold background with a red horizontal strip between two thorns, one above and one below. The motto of Xewkija is 'Nemo me impune lacessit', that is, 'No one shall attack me with impunity'. A helicopter service once ran between Malta International Airport and the Xewkija Heliport. ==Facilities== On the suburbs of the village there are the University of Malta (Gozo Campus) and the offices of the Employment & Training Corporation. There are also the Gozo Stadium, the Government Farm, St. Mary's Cemetery and Xewkija Cemetery. There is also an industrial estate which employs hundreds of Gozitan workers.

Playing in 40 games for the Capitals during the 1975-76 season, he set club records for seasonal goals against average (4.16) and consecutive scoreless minutes (80:43). He showed flashes of brilliance and was a solid performer on a team that struggled in those early years.\\"Washington Capitals Legends: Bernie Wolfe\\" A former all- Canadian goalie in college, Wolfe was cool under pressure with a poor team in hockey's most difficult position. He retired with one year remaining on his guaranteed contract, saying he \\"just didn't enjoy it anymore\\". In 120 games, his record was 20-61-21, with 424 goals against, a 4.17 goals against average, and one shutout. Wolfe retired from professional hockey in 1979 and began a financial planning practice. He earned his Certified Financial Planner designation in 1981. Bernard R. Wolfe & Associates Inc., which in 2014 managed $14 billion in assets, was recognized in 2009 and 2010 by Washingtonian Magazine as one of the Washington, D.C. area's top financial planning firms as voted by its peers. In 1992 when he was 40 years old, the Capitals attempted to re-sign him in order to make him the goaltender they would expose in the 1992 NHL Expansion Draft. League rules required every team to make a goalie available for the draft who had at least one game of NHL experience.\\"The time the Caps signed a 40-year-old financial planner to circumvent NHL rules\\" - The Washington Post Wolfe agreed to sign for the league minimum salary of $100,000; he promised to donate his salary to charity if his contract were approved by the league, but it never was. The attempt was immediately denied by the NHL for obvious reasons; Wolfe had long retired from the NHL and was well into his career as a financial planner. Phil Esposito, who had recently become part owner of the expansion Tampa Bay Lightning, was quoted as saying about the incident: \\"I didn't just pay $50 million for Bernie Wolfe. He wasn't any good when I played against him\\". Since the Capitals were unwilling to expose any of their current goaltenders, they eventually signed Steve Weeks for that purpose. Wolfe also co-wrote a book, How to Watch Ice Hockey, with journalist Mitch Henkin.American Bookseller Wolfe was the president of the Washington Capitals Alumni Association from 1992 to 2007. In 1999, he had both of his hips replaced. ==See also== *List of select Jewish ice hockey players ==ReferencesBernard R.

David, originally a Victorian, moved his family to Adelaide where Luke attended Rostrevor College. ==AFL career== Luke Darcy started his career with South Adelaide before his recruitment by the Bulldogs in 1993. Debuting in 1994, Darcy became known as one of the Bulldogs' most successful ruckmen/forwards. In 2001 he took out the Bulldogs' Best and Fairest award, the Charles Sutton Medal, and continued to play well in the following seasons. in 2002 Darcy and the Brisbane Lions's Michael Voss were the first players to be awarded the Leigh Matthews Trophy as the AFL Players Association's Most Valuable Player (MVP)1. In 2004 he was the Western Bulldogs's leading goalkicker. In a 2005 match against Geelong, Darcy suffered a season-ending knee injury when he twisted it, depriving the Bulldogs of a quality tall- forward option, something they missed during the year. On 20 December 2005 during the final pre-season training session before the Christmas holidays, Darcy re-injured the ACL during a fall which dislocated his knee, which meant that he would miss the entire 2006 season. The Bulldogs finished the season in eighth place, the first time the club had made the finals in six years. He had been part of a Bulldogs casualty list that included four ACL injuries during the season (up until only the Round 9 mark). During his time on the sidelines, he provided special comments for Network Ten's AFL coverage, and continued to do so after his playing retirement which he announced on 2 August 2007, the end of the 2007 AFL season. Darcy was officially added to Network Ten's AFL commentary team in 2007 (despite still playing football until the end of that season) and remained an Expert Commentator right up until the end of the 2011 AFL season, when the network lost broadcasting rights.. ==Statistics== http://afltables.com/afl/stats/players/L/Luke_Darcy.html - - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1994 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  40  1  0  0  0  2  2  0  1  0.0  0.0  0.0  2.0  2.0  0.0  1.0 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"  1995 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  14  3  0  1  10  5  15  4  2  0.0  0.3  3.3  1.7  5.0  1.3  0.7 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   1996 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  14  20  12  8  160  78  238  92  15  0.6  0.4  8.0  3.9  11.9  4.6  0.8 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   1997 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  14  23  24  13  208  92  300  131  14  1.0  0.6  9.0  4.0  13.0  5.7  0.6 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"  1998 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  14  24  13  8  187  88  275  107  15  0.5  0.3  7.8  3.7  11.5  4.6  0.6 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   1999 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  14  24  19  15  221  104  325  136  17  0.8  0.6  9.2  4.3  13.5  5.7  0.7 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2000 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  14  17  10  5  172  99  271  106  17  0.6  0.3  10.1  5.8  15.9  6.2  1.0 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   2001 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  14  21  14  8  237  145  382  118  30  0.7  0.4  11.3  6.9  18.2  5.6  1.4 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2002 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  14  22  23  8  249  211  460  149  63  1.0  0.4  11.3  9.6  20.9  6.8  2.9 - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\"  2003 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  14  21  9  7  211  165  376  129  46  0.4  0.3  10.0  7.9  17.9  6.1  2.2 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2004 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  14  22  30  13  216  136  352  127  59  1.4  0.6  9.8  6.2  16.0  5.8  2.7 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   2005 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  14  6  11  3  51  30  81  43  7  1.8  0.5  8.5  5.0  13.5  7.2  1.2 - style=\\"background-color: #EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2006 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  14  0  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  — - ! scope=\\"row\\"   2007 style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  14  22  18  8  141  87  228  91  43  0.8  0.4  6.4  4.0  10.4  4.1  2.0 - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! colspan=3 Career ! 226 ! 183 ! 97 ! 2063 ! 1242 ! 3305 ! 1233 ! 329 ! 0.8 ! 0.4 ! 9.1 ! 5.5 ! 14.6 ! 5.5 ! 1.5 } ==Honours and achievements== { style=\\"margin-right:4px; margin- top:8px; float:right; border:1px #000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\\" - fff;\\"  colspan=\\"2;\\" style=\\"padding:3px; margin- bottom:-3px; margin-top:2px; font-family:Arial; \\" Brownlow Medal votes - ! style=\\"width:50%;\\" Season ! style=\\"width:50%;\\" Votes -  1994  — -  1995  — -  1996  2 -  1997  7 -  1998  — -  1999  5 -  2000  3 -  2001  11 -  2002  16 -  2003  6 -  2004  — -  2005  5 -  2006  — -  2007  — -  Total  55 -  colspan=2 Key: - d9f9e9; border:1px solid #aaa; width:2em;\\"  colspan=2 Green / Bold = Won } *Individual **Charles Sutton Medal: 2001 **Leigh Matthews Trophy (AFLPA MVP Award): 2002 (tied with Michael Voss) **All- Australian: 2002 **Australian Football Media Association Player of the Year Award: 2002 **Herald Sun Player of the Year Award: 2002 **Western Bulldogs Leading Club Goalkicker Award: 2004 **Australian Representative Honours in International Rules Football: 2002 **Western Bulldogs Captain: 2005-2006 **AFL Rising Star Nominee: 1996 (Round 3) ==Personal life== Luke Darcy is married to Rebecca and they have four children – Sam, Sienna, William and Max. ==Post- football career== In 2008, Darcy became a member of the AFL rules committee. ==Media== After retiring Darcy continued his work in the media.

The Seventh-day Adventist Church had its roots in the Millerite movement of the 1830s to the 1840s, during the period of the Second Great Awakening, and was officially founded in 1863. Prominent figures in the early church included Hiram Edson, James Springer White (Husband to Ellen G. White), Joseph Bates, and J. N. Andrews. Over the ensuing decades the church expanded from its original base in New England to become an international organization. Significant developments such the reviews initiated by evangelicals Donald Barnhouse and Walter Martin, in the 20th century led to its recognition as a Christian denomination. ==Foundations, 1798-1820s== The Second Great Awakening, a revival movement in the United States, took place in the early 19th century. The Second Great Awakening was stimulated by the foundation of the many Bible Societies which sought to address the problem of a lack of affordable Bibles. The spread of Bibles allowed many who had not had one to be able to purchase and study it themselves rather than just hear it preached, and led to the establishment of many reform movements designed to remedy the evils of society before the anticipated Second Coming of Jesus Christ.Timothy L. Smith, Revivalism and Social Reform: American Protestantism on the Eve of the Civil War (1957) Many religious minority movements formed out of the Congregational, Presbyterian, and the Baptist and Methodist churches. Some of these movements held beliefs that would later be adopted by the Seventh-day Adventists. An interest in prophecy was kindled among some Protestants groups following the arrest of Pope Pius VI in 1798 by the French General Louis Alexandre Berthier. Forerunners of the Adventist movement believed that this event marked the end of the 1260-day prophecy from the Book of Daniel.The Christian Guardian, 1830, Church of England Certain individuals began to look at the 2300 day prophecy found in Daniel 8:14. Interest in prophecy also found its way into the Roman Catholic church when an exiled Jesuit priest by the name of Manuel de Lacunza published a manuscript calling for renewed interest in the Second Coming of Christ. His publication created a stirring but was later condemned by Pope Leo XII in 1824. As a result of a pursuit for religious freedom, many revivalists had set foot in the United States, aiming to avoid persecution.This information comes from Light Bearers by Schwarz and Greenleaf. 1843 prophetic chart illustrating numerous interpretations of prophecy yielding the year 1843 ==Millerite roots, 1831–44== The Seventh-day Adventist Church formed out of the movement known today as the Millerites. In 1831, a Baptist convert, William Miller, was asked by a Baptist to preach in their church and began to preach that the Second Advent of Jesus would occur somewhere between March 1843 and March 1844, based on his interpretation of . A following gathered around Miller that included many from the Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian and Christian Connection churches. In the summer of 1844, some of Miller's followers promoted the date of October 22. They linked the cleansing of the sanctuary of Daniel 8:14 with the Jewish Day of Atonement, believed to be October 22 that year. By 1844, over 100,000 people were anticipating what Miller had called the \\"Blessed Hope\\". On October 22 many of the believers were up late into the night watching, waiting for Christ to return and found themselves bitterly disappointed when both sunset and midnight passed with their expectations unfulfilled. This event later became known as the Great Disappointment. ==Pre-denominational years, 1844–60== ===Edson and the Heavenly Sanctuary=== After the disappointment of October 22 many of Miller's followers were left upset and disillusioned. Most ceased to believe in the imminent return of Jesus. Some believed the date was incorrect. A few believed that the date was right but the event expected was wrong. This latter group developed into the Seventh-day Adventist Church. One of the Adventists, Hiram Edson (1806–1882) wrote \\"Our fondest hopes and expectations were blasted, and such a spirit of weeping came over us as I never experienced before. It seemed that the loss of all earthly friends could have been no comparison. We wept, and wept, till the day dawn.\\" On the morning of October 23, Edson, who lived in Port Gibson, New York was passing through his grain field with a friend. He later recounted his experience: :\\"We started, and while passing through a large field I was stopped about midway of the field. Heaven seemed opened to my view, and I saw distinctly and clearly that instead of our High Priest coming out of the Most Holy of the heavenly sanctuary to come to this earth on the tenth day of the seventh month, at the end of the 2300 days [calculated to be October 22, 1844], He for the first time entered on that day the second apartment of that sanctuary; and that He had a work to perform in the Most Holy before coming to the earth.\\" Edson shared his experience with many of the local Adventists who were greatly encouraged by his account. As a result, he began studying the bible with two of the other believers in the area, O.R.L. Crosier and Franklin B. Hahn, who published their findings in a paper called Day-Dawn. This paper explored the biblical parable of the Ten Virgins and attempted to explain why the bridegroom had tarried. The article also explored the concept of the day of atonement and what the authors called \\"our chronology of events\\". The findings published by Crosier, Hahn and Edson led to a new understanding about the sanctuary in heaven. Their paper explained how there was a sanctuary in heaven, that Christ, the High Priest, was to cleanse. The believers understood this cleansing to be what the 2300 days in Daniel was referring to. George Knight wrote, \\"Although originally the smallest of the post-Millerite groups, it came to see itself as the true successor of the once-powerful Millerite movement.\\"Adventistreview.org This view was endorsed by Ellen White. However, Seeking a Sanctuary sees it more as an offshoot of the Millerite movement. The \\"Sabbath and Shut Door\\" Adventists were disparate, but slowly emerged. Only Joseph Bates had had any prominence in the Millerite movement.Light Bearers, p 55–56 Adventists viewed themselves as heirs of earlier outcast believers such as the Waldenses, Protestant Reformers including the Anabaptists, English and Scottish Puritans, evangelicals of the 18th century including Methodists, Seventh Day Baptists, and others who rejected established church traditions.Arthur Patrick, Adventist Studies: An Annotated Introduction for Higher Degree Students ===Sabbath observance develops and unites=== A young Seventh Day Baptist layperson named Rachel Oakes Preston living in New Hampshire was responsible for introducing Sabbath to the Millerite Adventists. Due to her influence, Frederick Wheeler, a local Methodist-Adventist preacher, began keeping the seventh day as Sabbath, probably in the early spring of 1844. Several members of the Washington, New Hampshire church he occasionally ministered to also followed his decision. These included William and Cyrus Farnsworth. T. M. Preble soon accepted it either from Wheeler or directly from Oakes. These events were shortly followed by the Great Disappointment. Preble promoted Sabbath through the February 28, 1845 issue of the Hope of Israel. In March he published his Sabbath views in tract form. Although he returned to observing Sunday in the next few years, his writing convinced Joseph Bates and J. N. Andrews. These men in turn convinced James and Ellen White, as well as Hiram Edson and hundreds of others.material above summarised from Light Bearers to the Remnant Bates proposed that a meeting should be organised between the believers in New Hampshire and Port Gibson. At this meeting, which occurred sometime in 1846 at Edson's farm, Edson and other Port Gibson believers readily accepted Sabbath and at the same time forged an alliance with Bates and two other folk from New Hampshire who later became very influential in the Adventist church, James and Ellen G. White. Between April 1848, and December 1850 twenty-two \\"Sabbath conferences\\" were held in New York and New England. These meetings were often seen as opportunities for leaders such as James White, Joseph Bates, Stephen Pierce and Hiram Edson to discuss and reach conclusions about doctrinal issues. While initially it was believed that Sabbath started at 6 pm, by 1855 it was generally accepted that Sabbath begins at Friday sunset. The Present Truth (see below) was largely devoted to Sabbath at first. J. N. Andrews was the first Adventist to write a book-length defense of Sabbath, first published in 1861. ===Trinitarianism=== At the formation of the church in the 19th century, many of the Adventist leaders held to an antitrinitarian view, thanks to many antitrinitarian Christian Connexion ministers entering the former Millerite fold. Ellen G. White never entered into debate on this issue, but made some very trinitarian statements in her book the Desire of Ages and transcripts of her sermons in the early 1900s showed her identifying the Holy Spirit as a \\"Person\\" and one of the \\"three holiest beings\\". Modern Seventh-day Adventists that hold to an antitrinitarian view are in the minority, but they argue that these transcripts are inaccurate stenographer reports that do not reflect her true teaching. Pro-trinitarian scholars in the Church point out that these transcripts were in her possession and she could have modified them at any time had they reflected an inaccurate version of what she said, given the perceived doctrinal importance of the topic. In 1855, James White stated in a clear way his view on the subject: \\"Here we might mention the Trinity which does away the personality of God, and his Son Jesus Christ...\\" In 1856, he again makes his stance clear by saying: \\" The greatest fault we can find in the Reformation is, the Reformers stopped reforming. Had they gone on, and onward, till they had left the last vestige of Papacy behind, such as natural immortality, sprinkling, the trinity, and Sunday-keeping, the church would now be free from her scriptural errors.\\" Lemuel Sapian writes \\"...by the dawn of the 20th century it was evident to many that the former position [the Adventists] took [against] the Trinity was erroneous. This came about not by any internal conspiracy or meddling of third parties intent on diluting [the] distinctive [Adventist] message, but because the pen of Inspiration [of Ellen G. White] took action—and men...took heed.\\" ===Post-tribulation Premillennialism=== Beginning with William Miller's teachings, Adventists have played a key role in introducing the Bible doctrine of premillennialism in the United States. They believe the saints will be received or gathered by Christ into the Kingdom of God in heaven at the end of the Tribulation at the Second Coming before the millennium. In the appendix to his book \\"Kingdom of the Cults\\" where Walter Martin explains why Seventh-day Adventists are accepted as orthodox Christians (see pg 423) Martin also summarizes the key role that Adventists played in the advancement of premillennialism in the 19th century. However the unique contribution of Seventh-day Adventists to this doctrine does not stop there. Seventh-day Adventists are post-tribulation premillennialists who accept the Bible teaching on a literal 1000 years in Revelation 20 that immediately follows the literal second coming of Christ described in Revelation 19. In contrast to almost all premillennialist groups they do not believe in a 1000-year kingdom on earth during the millennium. In Adventist eschatology Christ's promise to take the saints to His Father's house in John 14:1–3 is fulfilled at the 2nd coming where both the living and the dead saints are taken up in the air to meet the Lord (see 1Thess 4:13–18 ). John, the author of Revelation, calls this moment the \\"first resurrection\\" in Revelation 20:5–6. Instead of a Millennial Kingdom on earth, Adventists teach that there is only a desolated earth for 1000 years and during that time the saints are in heaven with Christ (See Jeremiah 4:23–29).Adventist.org , Adventist Belief 27 ===Adventist publishing work begins with The Present Truth=== First edition of The Present Truth On November 18, 1848, Ellen White had a vision in which God told her that her husband should start a paper. In 1849, James, determined to publish this paper, went to find work as a farm-hand to raise sufficient funds. After another vision, she told James that he was to not worry about funds but to set to work on producing the paper to be printed. James readily obeyed, writing from the aid \\"of a pocket Bible, Cruden's Condensed Concordance, and an abridged dictionary with one of its covers off.\\" Thanks to a generous offer by the printer to delay charges, the group of Advent believers had 1000 copies of the first publication printed. They sent the publication, which was on the topic of Sabbath, to friends and colleagues they believe would find it of interest. Eleven issues were published in 1849 and 1850. ==Formal organization and further growth, 1860–80== ===Choosing a name and a constitution=== In 1860, the fledgling movement finally settled on the name, Seventh-day Adventist, representative of the church's distinguishing beliefs. Three years later, on May 21, 1863, the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists was formed and the movement became an official organization. ===Annual regional camp meetings=== The first annual regional camp meeting took place September 1868. Since then, the annual regional camp meeting has become a pattern among Seventh-day Adventists and is still practiced today. ===Influence of Ellen G. White=== Ellen G. White (1827–1915), while holding no official role, was a dominant personality. She, along with her husband, James White, and Joseph Bates, moved the denomination to a concentration on missionary and medical work. Mission and medical work continues to play a central role in the 21st century. Under White's guidance the denomination in the 1870s turned to missionary work and revivals, tripling its membership to 16,000 by 1880; rapid growth continued, with 75,000 members in 1901. By this time operated two colleges, a medical school, a dozen academies, 27 hospitals, and 13 publishing houses. By 1945, the church reported 226,000 members in the US and Canada, and 380,000 elsewhere; the budget was $29 million and enrollment in church schools was 40,000. In 1960 there were 1,245,125 members worldwide with an annual budget of over $99,900,000. Enrollment in church schools from elementary to college was 290,000 students. As of the year 2000 there were 11,687,229 members worldwide. The global budget was $28,610,881,313. And the enrollment in schools was 1,065,092 students. In 2008 the global membership was 15,921,408 with a budget of $45,789,067,340. The number of students in SDA run universities, secondary and primary schools was 1,538,607. ===Political views=== Seventh-day Adventists participated in the Temperance Movement of the late 1800s and early 1900s. During this same time, they became actively involved in promoting religious liberty. They had closely followed American politics, matching current events to the predictions in the Bible. \\"Seventh- day\\" means the observance of the original Sabbath, Saturday, is still a sacred obligation. Adventists argued that just as the rest of the Ten Commandments had not been revised, so also the injunction to \\"remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy\\" remained in full force. This theological point turned the young group into a powerful force for religious liberty. Growing into its full stature in the late 19th century and early 20th century, these Adventists opposed Sunday laws on every side. Many were arrested for working on Sunday. In fighting against the real threat of a legally established National Day of worship, these Sabbatarians had to fight for their liberty on a daily basis. Soon, they were fighting for religious liberty on a broader, less parochial basis. ===Worldwide mission=== Adventist effort for a world-wide proclamation of their message began with the mailing of publications. In 1874 J. N. Andrews became the first official Adventist missionary to travel overseas. Working in Switzerland, he sought to organize the Sabbath-keeping companies under one umbrella.See Stefan Hoschele, From the End of the World to the Ends of the Earth: The Development of Seventh-day Adventist Missiology (Nurnberg: Verlag fur Theologie und Religionswissenschaft, 2004) During the 1890s Adventists began to enthusiastically promote a world-wide mission effort. ==A world vision and growing pains, 1880–1915== Graph of church membership over time ===1888 General Conference=== In 1888, a General Conference Session occurred in Minneapolis. This session involved a discussion between the then General Conference president, G. I. Butler; editor of the review, Uriah Smith; and a group led by E. J. Waggoner and A. T. Jones about the meaning of \\"Righteousness by Faith\\" and the meaning of the law in Romans and Galatians. Ellen G. White also addressed the conference. ===Organizational Developments=== From the early 1860s the church had three levels of government: the local church, the conference, and the General Conference. As ideas developed, organizations came into existence to move forward the ideas; i.e. Sabbath Schools, health reform and medical work, printing, distribution of literature, religious liberty, missions, etc. All moved forward under the societies formed to do so. As the work progressed, the managing of all these societies became quite cumbersome. As conferences developed in far off lands, it became obvious that the General Conference could not oversee the day-to-day needs of the conferences. This led to the development of Union conferences in Australia and Europe in the late 1890s and to the development of districts in the United States. The 1901 and 1903 General Conference sessions reorganized the church's structure to include union conferences which managed a group of local conferences in their domain. By the end of 1904, the various societal interests became incorporated as departments in each conference's structure. ===Christ's Object Lessons and Adventist schools=== Ellen White relates how her book Christ's Object Lessons came to be linked to the financial support of Adventist schools, > \\"I am so thankful for the work that Christ’s Object Lessons has accomplished > and is still accomplishing. When this book was in preparation, I expected to > use the means coming from the sale of this book in preparing and publishing > several other books. But the Lord put it into my mind to give this book to > our schools, to be used in freeing them from debt. I asked our publishing > houses to unite with me in this gift by donating the expense of the > publication. This they willingly agreed to do. A fund was raised to pay for > the materials used in printing the book, and canvassers and people have sold > the book without commission. > > \\"Thus the book has been circulated in all parts of the world. It has been > received with great favor everywhere. Ministers of all denominations have > written testimonials recommending it. The Lord has prepared the way for its > reception so that no fewer than 200,000 have already been sold. The means > thus raised has gone far toward freeing our schools from the debts that have > been accumulating for many years. > > \\"Our publishing houses have printed 300,000 copies, free of cost, and these > have been distributed to the different tract societies, to be sold by our > people. > > \\"The Lord has made the sale of this book a means of teaching our people how > to come in touch with those not of their faith, and how to impart to them a > knowledge of the truth for this time. Many have been converted by reading > this book.\\"MR No. 1188, p. 24 Christ’s Object Lessons to Provide Funds for > Schools. part of letter 143, 1902 to Sister Mary > In 1902, those affiliated with Healdsburg College, now Pacific Union College, dedicated a week to sell Christ's Object Lessons. They first read the book together. Then each student was given six books to sell. Territories were assigned and for a week the school suspended classes in order to sell the books. The College Church took the territory immediately surrounding the church while the students were given territory further away from the school.M. E. Cady. Christ's Object Lesson at Healdsburg. Pacific Union Recorder, April 10, 1902, p. 14. ===Message to the world=== After John Andrews venture into Europe, others also went out. Some to Africa, others to Asia and others to Australasia. ==Early 20th century, 1915–1930== ===Fundamentalism and progress=== Ellen G. White died in 1915, and Adventist leaders participated in a number of prophetic conferences during and soon after World War I. The 1919 Bible Conference looked at how Adventists interpreted Bible prophecy and the legacy of Ellen White's writings. It also had a polarizing influence on Adventist theology with leaders such as A. G. Daniells and W. W. Prescott questioning some of the traditional views held by others like Benjamin G. Wilkinson, J. S. Washburn, and Claude Holmes. Fundamentalism was dominant in the church in the early 20th century.Historians such as George Knight, Arnold Reye, Lester Devine, Gilbert Valentine and Mark Pearce document its impact George Knight dates it from 1919 to 1950. The edited transcripts of the 1952 Bible Conference were published as Our Firm Foundation.Our Firm Foundation, Adventist Archives ==Mid-20th century== World War II In Southern Europe, as soon as the war broke out, most of the church's workers of military age were drafted. The church lost union and local conference presidents, pastors, evangelists, and institutional workers. When the Nazis occupied France they dissolved the conference and all the churches, confiscated church buildings, and prohibited church work. In Croatia, all Adventist churches were closed, and the conference was dissolved. All church and evangelistic work were strictly forbidden. Over in Romania, where there were more than 25,000 Adventists, the union conference, the six local conferences, and all the churches were likewise dissolved. Over three hundred Adventist chapels, the publishing house in Bucharest, and the school at Brasov were all taken from the church. All church funds were taken. Three thousand Adventists were put in prison. They were tortured and abused. The work of the church went forward under creative cover. People baptized were reported as students graduating and receiving their diplomas. One minister reported on life insurance policies sold. Another reported on the harvest of 253 baskets of fruit. ==Late 20th century== In the mid-1970s, two distinct factions were manifest within Seventh day Adventism. Defending many pre-1950 Adventist positions was conservative wing, while the more liberal Adventism emphasized beliefs of Evangelical Christianity. During the 1970s the Review and Herald carried articles by editor Kenneth Wood and associate editor Herbert Douglass related to the Questions on Doctrine issue, and articles arguing for a final perfect generation.\\"Righteousness by Faith\\" entry in Historical Dictionary of Seventh- day Adventists by Gary Land The editors began to emphasize views which had been the traditional views in the church before Questions on Doctrine such as sinless perfection of a final generation, which was opposed by many Progressive AdventistsBull, Malcolm & Keith Lochhart, 2006, Seeking a Sanctuary: Seventh-day Adventism and the American Dream, pp.86–87 The General Conference addressed this controversy over \\"righteousness by faith\\" by holding a conference in Palmdale, California in 1976. Ford was the \\"center of attention\\", and the resulting document known as the \\"Palmdale statement\\". The 1980 General Conference session, held in Dallas, produced the church's first official declaration of beliefs voted by the world body, called the 27 Fundamental Beliefs. (This list of beliefs has since been expanded to the present 28 Fundamentals). ===Firing of Desmond Ford=== The year 1980 also saw a minor crisis over the investigative judgment teaching, known as the Glacier View controversy. This precipitated a controversy within the church, but the mainstream believe in the doctrine and the church reaffirmed its basic position on the doctrine,Adventist.org, page 14, 20 for first statistic and original question; p20, 29 for second statistic and original question although some in the church's more liberal wing continued the controversy into the 21st century. Ford expressed questions on the Judgment and later requested that his membership with the Seventh-day Adventist Church be discontinued for other than doctrinal differences. ===Ordination of women=== The year 1990 saw ordination of women reviewed at the General Conference Session in Indianapolis and 1995 at General Conference Session in Utrecht, but turned down. In 2012, 16 women pastors were approved for ordination in the Columbia Union Conference. Also in that year, a Theology of Ordination Study Committee was created by the General Conference to study the issue of women's ordination. In 2015, at the General Conference Business Session in San Antonio, Texas, a majority of delegates voted down a proposal to allow divisions to ordain women.http://www.columbiaunion.org/article/1165/news/2012-news- archives/november-8-2012-16-female-pastors-approved-for- ordination#.VGVETfnF8nF ==Early 21st century== In the new century, Adventists membership continued to increase, and worldwide, members began to use YouTube and other Internet media to communicate. These communications included video addresses from the then-president of the United States George W. Bush, and Hillary Clinton to Adventists. A review of membership revealed an average of about 2,900 people were joining the Seventh-day Adventist Church every day, which show the denomination now has 16.6 million adult baptized members according to church statistics. Denominational membership showed strong growth and membership audits showed for 2009 as the seventh consecutive year the church had a net gain of more than one million members.News.Adventist.org However, David Trim, director of the Archives, Statistics and Research department, who felt the numbers were \\"not entirely accurate,\\" said the record keeping system was not perfect and audits, would most likely result in a lower overall membership number than the 16.5 million. ==Spiritual Formation== In the second decade of the 21st century, retired pastor Rick Howard brought what he considered the dangers of Spiritual Formation to the attention of the Adventist church. Other Adventists such as Pastor Hal Mayer, and Derek Morris raised concerns as well. The official church paper, the Adventist Review, published articleshttp://archives.adventistreview.org/article/4614/archives/issue-2011-1522/formed- in-christ outlining the effects of spiritualism coming into the Christian Church through the teachings of Spiritual Formation.http://amazingdiscoveries.org/AD-Magazine-Archive- Summer-2011-Spiritual-Formation Howard wrote The Omega Rebellion in which he warned of the dangers associated with the “emerging church” movement. He identified the teachings of Spiritual formation, contemplative prayer, postmodern spirituality, the meditation steeped in Eastern mysticism as dangerous.http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-omega-rebellion-rick- howard/1029286721?ean=2940014349840 In his July 2010 keynote sermon, Ted N.C. Wilson, newly elected President of the Seventh-Day Adventist church counseled, “Stay away from non-biblical spiritual disciplines or methods of spiritual formation that are rooted in mysticism such as contemplative prayer, centering prayer, and the emerging church movement in which they are promoted.” Instead, he said, believers should \\"look within the Seventh-day Adventist Church, to humble pastors, evangelists, Biblical scholars, leaders, and departmental directors who can provide evangelistic methods and programs that are based on solid Biblical principles and The Great Controversy theme.\\" Church members were also cautioned to use discernment in worship styles: \\"Use Christ- centered, Bible-based worship and music practices in church services,\\" Wilson said. \\"While we understand that worship services and cultures vary throughout the world, don't go backwards into confusing pagan settings where music and worship become so focused on emotion and experience that you lose the central focus on the Word of God. All worship, however simple or complex should do one thing and one thing only: lift up Christ and put down self.\\"http://news.adventist.org/en/archive/articles/2010/07/03/wilson-calls- adventists-to-go-forward == In creative works == The 2014 documentary film War in Heaven, War on Earth: The Birth of the Seventh-day Adventist Church During the American Civil War by Chris Small and Loren Small looks at the history of Adventism from the Millerite movement through 1865. ==See also== *28 Fundamental Beliefs *The Pillars of Adventism *Investigative judgment *William Miller (preacher) *Millerism *Premillennialism *Prophecy in the Seventh-day Adventist Church *Sabbath in Christianity *Sabbath in Seventh-day Adventism *Second coming *Seventh-day Adventist Church *Seventh-day Adventist eschatology *Seventh-day Adventist Interfaith Relations *Seventh-day Adventist theology *Seventh-day Adventist worship *Ellen G.

Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). Published in 1994. Pages 142 - 143. It is not to be confused with the Clan Fraser of Lovat who are a separate Scottish clan of the Scottish Highlands (though with a common ancestry). Both clans have their own separate chief, both of whom are officially recognized by the Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs.Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs – Select either \\"Fraser\\" or \\"Fraser of Lovat\\" clanchiefs.org. Retrieved 31 August 2013. ==History== ===Origins of the clan=== The Frasers are believed to have come from Anjou in France. The name Fraser may be an altered form of the French patronymic Fresel. The French surname Fresel meant \\"ribbon, braid\\" in Old French and was probably the nickname for such merchants.Albert Dauzat (préface de Marie- Thérèse Morlet), Noms et prénoms de France, éditions Larousse 1980, p. 269b. In fact, the surnames Fresel and Frezel were historically centred on Upper Normandy and Artois/French Flanders, not Anjou.Géopatronyme : repartition of births with the name Fresel before WW I Géopatronyme : repartition of births with the name Frezel before WW I It sounds like a derived form of fraise which means \\"strawberry\\" in French and such popular etymologies explain many badges and coats of arms. The first Fraser to appear in Scotland was in about 1160 when Simon Fraser held lands at Keith in East Lothian. ===Wars of Scottish Independence=== About five generations after the first Simon Fraser, another Simon Fraser was captured fighting for Robert the Bruce and was executed in 1306 by Edward I of England. Simon’s cousin was Alexander Fraser of Cowie who was Bruce’s chamberlain. He married Bruce’s sister Mary. Alexander Fraser’s younger brother was another Sir Simon Fraser, from whom the chiefs of the Clan Fraser of Lovat are descended. One of Simon Fraser’s grandsons was Sir Alexander Fraser of Cowie and Durris. This Alexander Fraser acquired a castle now called Cairnbulg Castle and the lands of Philorth by marriage to Joanna, younger daughter and co-heiress of the Earl of Ross in 1375. ===Frasers of Philorth=== Kinnaird Head Lighthouse, formerly Kinnaird Castle, formerly Fraserburgh Castle. Cairnbulg Castle, formerly Philorth Castle. In 1592, Sir Alexander Fraser of Philorth received charters from James VI of Scotland for the fishing village of Faithlie which later became the town of Fraserburgh. Sir Alexander Fraser was also authorized to found a university in the town but this scheme was short lived due to the religious troubles of the time. The eighth Lord Philorth built Fraserburgh Castle which later became the Kinnaird Head lighthouse. This bankrupted him and Philorth Castle was lost from the family for over three hundred years until 1934 when it was bought back by the 19th Lord Saltoun. ===Lords Saltoun=== ====17th and 18th centuries==== The ninth Laird of Philorth married the heiress of the Abernethy Lords Saltoun. Their son, Alexander Fraser, 11th Lord Saltoun, was severely wounded at the Battle of Worcester in 1651. He survived thanks to his servant, James Cardno, who rescued him from the battlefield. In 1666 the tenth Lord built Philorth House a mile from Fraserburgh which remained the family seat until it burned down in 1915. Sir Alexander Fraser of Durris was personal physician to Charles II of England. He was educated at Aberdeen and accompanied the king on his campaign throughout 1650. After the Restoration he sat in the Scottish Parliament and he featured in the diaries of Samuel Pepys. The Fraser family took no part in the Jacobite risings, although their distant Highland relatives in the Clan Fraser of Lovat were Jacobites. ====19th and 20th centuries==== The sixteenth Lord Saltoun commanded the Light Companies of the First Guards at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The nineteenth Lord Saltoun was a prisoner of war during World War I in Germany. Later, in 1936 he became a member of the House of Lords and promoted the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. ==See also== Clan Fraser Tartan *Clan Fraser of Lovat *Scottish clan *Georgina Fraser Newhall, author of \\"Fraser's Drinking Song\\" ==References== ==External links== *Website of Lady Saltoun, Chief of the Name and Arms of Fraser *Baronage Press's Fraser section *Fraser Heraldry Fraser Societies *Clan Fraser Society of Australia *Clan Fraser Association for California *Clan Fraser Society Scotland UK *Clan Fraser Society of North America Fraser Fraser ","title":"Clan Fraser"},{"id":"3251930","text":"Empress Bian, personal name unknown, was an empress of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period of China.

It derived from the Populous engine but presented using a 3-dimensional game map. ==Gameplay== Screenshot of the Amiga version The game features a 3-dimensional game map, although camera movement is limited to rotating the map by 90 degrees or small discrete intervals and 8 pre-defined levels of zoom. Only the map topography itself is 3-dimensional; people, trees and other game objects are 2-dimensional sprites. The game features a fairly advanced (for its time) \\"artificial life\\" engine. Each person seems to have a mind of their own and will go about his or her job, fishing, farming, shepherding, collecting wood or making items without any input from the player. The player can also use a query tool to view the name, sex, age, allegiance, vital stats, hometown and equipment of any given individual. This aspect of the game has some clear resemblances (though less advanced) with the later Black & White game also designed by Peter Molyneux. While the player cannot form the land like in Populous, actions can still have some limited effect on the environment. For example, if a large area is deforested, the weather pattern will change and more rain or snow (depending on the season) will fall, making movement slower. The player starts out on each map with a small number of soldiers, and maybe a few towns already under control. To win the map, the balance of power needs to be tipped completely to the player's side (represented by a scale below the mini-map), by conquering all (or at least most) of the towns on the map and killing any opposing captains. Once a town is under the player's control, locals can be drafted into the player's army and bigger towns or enemy armies can be taken on. Some of the bigger towns also have neutral captains and if these survive the battle they come under the player's command as well. The player can only control as many armies as captains, so it is important to keep them alive. If a captain is killed, his army is disbanded and his surviving soldiers go back to their town of origin. Unlike the player's main army – which the main character commands – the subordinate captains have a \\"lag\\" time (indicated by a tiny homing pigeon animation next to their command icon) before their commands are executed. The further away from the player's main character they are, the longer it takes for orders to reach them. Food is the single most important resource in the game. Aside from friendly towns the player can also slaughter wandering sheep, barter food from neutral towns, or kill an enemy captain and pillage his food supply. Aside from manpower and food, towns can also provide equipment. Townspeople will occasionally make items but to speed things up the player can order an army to \\"invent\\" at a friendly town. Depending on nearby resources and what posture the army is set to (passive, neutral or aggressive), men will then go to work collecting resources and make items. As the more useful items can usually only be made in one or two towns on any given map these have great strategic importance. There is no micromanagement involved with equipment. Once an army is ordered to equip itself from a pile of equipment it is automatically distributed. If there are bows, swords, and pikes available, soldiers will pick them up in that order. As long as there are soldiers without any weapon in the army no one will pick up more than one weapon. If everyone has something then people with the least valuable weapon will have first pick and so on. The captain carries any excess equipment. There is no limit to how much a captain can carry, but the more he carries the slower he (and his army) will move. ==Expansions== In 1991 an expansion pack titled Powermonger: World War I Edition was released, which changed the setting from the conquest of a medieval kingdom, to World War I. World War I Edition retains the core gameplay of Powermonger, but with more ranged weapons and war-machines. More expansion packs with different settings were planned depending on the success of the World War I expansion, but were never released. The unreleased expansions include a fantasy theme, Feudal Japan, and the American Civil War. The fantasy scenario was planned to have a magic system with the ability to create custom spells, and fantasy races such as elves and gnomes. ==Development== The Amiga and Atari ST versions of Powermonger cost £29.99 in 1990, and were released in October 1990; the DOS version was released in 1991. Magazine advertisements for Powermonger quoted Peter Molyneux, who stated that the game is \\"Better than Populous\\". ==Reception== The game got 5 out of 5 stars in Dragon. Computer Gaming World in 1991 praised Powermonger as \\"simply superb ... a joy to play\\". Reviewing the Amiga version, CGW favorably cited its graphics and realism, but criticized its unusually strict copy protection and the need to load a saved game twice to return to the previous state. In a 1993 survey of pre 21st- century strategy games the magazine gave the game three stars out of five. Reviewing the Sega CD version, GamePro criticized the graphics, commenting that \\"the maps are so pixelated that you can barely see what's going on or who's who. After going through lots of slow strategy, a nice visual payoff of your decisions being executed would've really added to the FunFactor.\\" However, they gave the game an overall recommendation based on its slow-paced strategy gameplay. Electronic Gaming Monthly gave Powermonger an overall score of 6.6 out of 10 from five reviewers, who praised the high detail of the simulation. Powermonger won Computer Gaming World's 1991 Strategy Game of the Year award, and was ranked the 32nd best game of all time by Amiga Power. ==References== ==External links== * *Powermonger at the Hall of Light Category:1990 video games Category:Amiga games Category:Atari ST games Category:Bullfrog Productions games Category:Cancelled 3DO Interactive Multiplayer games Category:DOS games Category:Electronic Arts games Category:Imagineer games Category:Mac OS games Category:Multiplayer null modem games Category:FM Towns games Category:NEC PC-9801 games Category:Real-time strategy video games Category:Sega CD games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Sharp X68000 games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games scored by Barry Leitch Category:Video games scored by Tim Wright Category:Video games with expansion packs ","title":"Powermonger"},{"id":"3251941","text":"The Orion Molecular Cloud Complex (or, simply, the Orion Complex) is a star forming region with stellar ages ranging up to 12 Myr. Two giant molecular clouds are a part of it, Orion A and Orion B. The stars currently forming within the Complex are located within these clouds. A number of other somewhat older stars no longer associated with the molecular gas are also part of the Complex, most notably the Orion's Belt (Orion OB1b), as well as the dispersed population north of it (Orion OB1a). Near the head of Orion there is also a population of young stars that is centered on Meissa. The Complex is between 1 000 and 1 400 light-years away, and hundreds of light-years across. The Orion Complex is one of the most active regions of nearby stellar formation visible in the night sky, and is home to both protoplanetary discs and very young stars. Much of it is bright in infrared wavelengths due to the heat-intensive processes involved in stellar formation, though the complex contains dark nebulae, emission nebulae, reflection nebulae, and H II regions. The presence of ripples on the surface of Orion's Molecular Clouds was discovered in 2010. The ripples are a result of the expansion of the nebulae gas over pre-existing molecular gas. The Orion Complex includes a large group of bright nebulae, dark clouds in the Orion constellation. Several nebulae can be observed through binoculars and small telescopes, and some parts (such as the Orion Nebula) are visible to the naked eye. ==Nebulae within the complex== A labeled map of the Orion Molecular Cloud, with the images taken by IRAS and various telescopes that mapped CO in this part of the sky The following is a list of notable regions within the larger Complex: * Orion A Molecular cloud **The Orion Nebula, also known as M42 (part of Orion's Sword) **M43, which is part of the Orion Nebula **Sh2-279 (part of Orion's Sword) **NGC 1980 (part of Orion's Sword) **Orion Molecular Cloud 1 (OMC-1) with the Becklin–Neugebauer Object and the Kleinmann–Low Nebula **Orion Molecular Cloud 2 (OMC-2) **Orion Molecular Cloud 3 (OMC-3) **Orion Molecular Cloud 4 (OMC-4) **NGC 1981 **NGC 1999 **LDN 1641 **HH 1/2, the first recognized Herbig-Haro objects **HH 34 a Herbig-Haro object with symmetric bow shocks * Orion B Molecular cloud **Flame Nebula (NGC 2024) ** IC 434, which contains the Horsehead Nebula ** The Horsehead Nebula (Barnard 33) ** M78, a reflection nebula (NGC 2068) ** McNeil's Nebula is a variable nebula discovered in 2004 near M78 ** Orion East Cloud (LDN 1621 + LDN 1622) **HH 24-26 this group contains three Herbig-Haro objects **HH 111 one of the most well-known Herbig-Haro objects * Orion OB1 Association ** Orion's Belt ** Sigma Ori cluster ** 25 Ori cluster * Lambda Orionis molecular ring (Sh2-264) ** Lambda Ori cluster ** Barnard 30 ** Barnard 35 *Orion-Eridanus superbubble **Barnard's Loop (Sh2-276) **Eridanus Loop A more complete list can be found for example in Maddalena et al. (1986) Table 1 == Individual components == Herschel and the newborn stars were imaged by ALMA and the VLA. === Orion A === The giant molecular cloud Orion A is the most active star-forming region in the local neighbourhood of the sun. In the last few million years about 3000 young stellar objects were formed in this region, including about 190 protostars and about 2600 pre-main sequence stars. The Orion A cloud has a mass in the order of 105 . The stars in Orion A do not have the same distance to us. The \\"head\\" of the cloud, which also contains the Orion Nebula is about 1300 light-years (400 parsec) away from the sun. The \\"tail\\" however is up to 1530 light-years (470 parsec) away from the sun. The Orion A cloud is therefore longer than the projected length of 130 light-years (40 parsec) and has a true length of 290 light-years (90 parsec). === Orion B === Orion B is about 1370 light-years (420 parsec) distant to Earth. It has a size of about 1.5 kpc² and a mass in the order of 105 . It contains several star forming regions with the star cluster inside the Flame Nebula being the largest cluster. === Orion OB1 association === The Orion OB1 association represents different stellar populations that are superimposed along our line of sight. The oldest group with 8-10 million years is Orion OB1a, northwest of Orion's Belt, and the youngest group with less than 2 million years is Orion OB1d, which contains the Orion Nebula cluster and NGC 2024. === Lambda Orionis molecular ring === The Lambda Orionis ring is a large molecular ring, centered around Lambda Orioinis (Meissa). It was suggested that this ring formed after a supernova happened inside the central star- forming region that once surrounded the Lambda Orionis Cluster, dispersing the material into the ring seen today. Star-formation is still continuing in regions of the ring. === Superbubble === Parts of the Orion-Eridanus superbubble were first seen as Barnard's Loop in Hydrogen-alpha images that warp around the eastern portion of Orion. The other part of the superbubble that is seen in H-alpha is the Eridanus Loop. The walls of the entire bubble are seen in far-infrared and HI. Some features of the Eridanus Loop might be as close as 590 light-years (180 parsec) to the sun. == Gallery == File:Sword of Orion, Orion nebula - Herschel - Nhsc2016-003b.tifOrion A seen by ESA's Herschel Space Observatory File:Herschel’s view of a molecular cloud ESA384010.jpgOrion B seen by ESA's Herschel Space Observatory File:Orion's Big Head Revealed in Infrared.jpgThe Lambda Orionis ring seen by NASA's Wide- field Infrared Survey Explorer File:BarnardLoopHunterWilson.jpgH-alpha image of Barnard's Loop, which is part of the Orion–Eridanus Superbubble File:Hubble Sees the Force Awakening in a Newborn Star (23807356641).jpgThe Herbig-Haro object HH 24, which is located in Orion B ==See also== * Runaway star * Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex *Taurus Molecular Cloud *Perseus molecular cloud * Scorpius–Centaurus Association ==References== ==External links== * Orion Cloud Complex * SEDS website * ESO: Hidden Secrets of Orion’s Clouds incl.

Walter Colton (May 7, 1797 – January 22, 1851) was a Chaplain for the United States Navy, the Alcalde of Monterey, and the author of Three Years in California and Deck and Port. He was also co-publisher of California's first newspaper, The Californian. ==Biography== ===Early life and education=== Walter Colton was born in Rutland County, Vermont, on May 9, 1797. He was the third of 12 children born to Walter and Thankful (Cobb) Colton; his nephew John Jay Colton later became known as a pioneer of anesthesia. Walter went to Hartford, Connecticut, at the age of 17 to learn to be a cabinetmaker. He attended Hartford Grammar School and entered Yale in the fall of 1818. He won the Berkeleyan Prize for the best Latin translation, and delivered the valedictory poem at his graduation in 1822. He entered Andover Theological Seminary and graduated in 1825. He became a professor of moral philosophy and letters at the Scientific and Military Academy at Middletown, Connecticut. ===Career=== He then moved to Washington, D.C. to become the editor of the American Spectator and Washington City Chronicle. He was also elected to preach at a church attended by President Andrew Jackson. The men developed a close acquaintanceship. The president offered Colton the choice of being a chaplain in the Navy or a consul abroad. Colton was nominated chaplain of the West India Squadron in 1831 and visited ports throughout the world. He was married to a Philadelphia woman of the same family name, and he sailed to the Pacific in 1845. He recorded the story of that eventful voyage in his book, Deck and Port. Soon after Colton's arrival in Monterey, Commodore Robert F. Stockton appointed him the first American Alcalde of Monterey, a title he held from 1846 to 1849.Dramov, Alissandra. Carmel-By-The-Sea, The Early Years (1903-1913). Bloomington, IN: AuthorHouse, 2012: 39. This role was a combination of judge, sheriff, and governor over much of Northern California. He served with wisdom and sound judgment in dealing with lawbreakers, built Colton Hall, and fined every gambler $20 to help cover the costs of building California’s first schoolhouse. He won wide acclaim as a fair judge and impaneled the first jury in California to assist in making decisions. During this period, he also met Robert B. Semple and the two launched the first newspaper published in California, The Californian on August 15, 1846.Dramov, Alissandra. Carmel-By-The-Sea, The Early Years (1903-1913). Bloomington, IN: AuthorHouse, 2012: 39–40. The first issue was released only a month after the American flag was raised at Monterey, The Californian carried the news of the declaration of war with Mexico. Colton's book about his experiences, Three Years in California, was published in 1850 after his return to the east. He died in 1851 and was buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.Oberholtzer, Ellis Paxson. The Literary History of Philadelphia. Philadelphia: George W. Jacobs & Co., 1906. p. 306 ==Legacy== Colton Hall Walter Colton has been inducted into the California Newspaper Hall of Fame. His book, Three years in California, is regarded as a principal description of California before the California Gold Rush. Colton Hall, now preserved as a museum, was the site of the 1849 California Constitutional Convention. For a time it served as a grade school. The subsequent Walter Colton Middle School, located some two miles uphill from Colton Hall, was changed first to a 6-8-grade middle school, then back to a K-8-grade school in support of the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District's enforced school closings in early 2002. ==References== ==External links== * California Newspaper Hall of Fame * Colton Hall Museum Category:1797 births Category:1851 deaths Category:Yale University alumni Category:Publishers from California Category:American publishers (people) Category:Mayors of places in California Category:People from Rutland County, Vermont Category:United States Navy chaplains Category:Burials at Laurel Hill Cemetery (Philadelphia) Category:19th-century American politicians ","title":"Walter Colton"},{"id":"3251958","text":"In the sport of Australian rules football, the half-back line refers to the positions of the 3 players on the field that occupy the centre half-back and left and right half-back flank positions. ==Centre half-back== The role of the centre half-back is similar to that of a defensive midfielder in association football. As the first line of defence, the centre half-back must aim to break down opposition attacks before they can get into a scoring position.Pascoe, 1995, p. 28 Given that a centre half-back's opponent is usually the centre half-forward, the role is regarded as a key position in the team, and is usually reserved for tall and well-built players. As one of the team's leaders, centre half-backs must be able to read the play and have good communication skills. Although their first responsibility is to defend, the great centre half-backs have proven to be equally creative in attack as well as reliable in defence. Notable centre half-backs from over the years include: * Albert Chadwick ( and , 1920–1929) * Walter \\"Wacka\\" Scott (, 1920–1932), Magarey Medallist 1921, 1924, 1930 * Albert \\"Leeter\\" Collier ( and , 1925–1941),Pascoe, 1995, p. 29 Brownlow Medallist 1929 * Reg Hickey (, 1926–1940) * Denis Cordner (Melbourne, 1943–1956) * Ron Clegg (, 1949–1960), Brownlow medallist 1949 * Ian \\"Bluey\\" Shelton (, 1959–1965) * Peter Knights (Hawthorn, 1969–1985) * Bill Picken (Collingwood and , 1974–1986) * Jim Jess (, 1976–1988) * Ross Glendinning ( and , 1978–1988), Brownlow medallist 1983 * Paul Roos (Fitzroy and Sydney, 1982–1998) * Glen Jakovich (West Coast, 1991–2004) ==Half-back flank== The half-back flank was traditionally a defensive position, where reliability and toughness were more important than attacking flair. In the modern game, reliability and toughness must now be combined with the ability to run and carry the ball as well as take on the opposition in a counter-attacking style. Notable half-back flankers over the years in Australian football include: * Alec Epis (, 1958–1968) * Barry Davis (Essendon and , 1961–1975) * John Rantall (, North Melbourne and , 1963–1980) * Ian Bremner ( and , 1966–1976) * Bruce Doull (, 1969–1986), Norm Smith Medallist 1981; Named Half-back flank in AFL Team of the Century (1996) * Stephen Wallis (, 1983–1996) * Ken Hinkley ( and , 1987–1995) * Guy McKenna (, 1988–2000) * Andrew McKay * Rohan Smith * Andrew McLeod * Nigel Smart * Luke Hodge * Brendon Goddard * Corey Enright * Shannon Hurn * Beau Waters ==References== ==Bibliography== * Category:Australian rules football terminology ","title":"Half-back line"},{"id":"3251960","text":"The Kenya Scouts Association is the national Scouting association of Kenya. Scouting was founded in British East Africa in 1910 and became a member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement in 1964. It has 323,929 members (as of 2010). ==History== Robert Baden-Powell, and his wife Olave, visited Kenya in 1935 on the way to South Africa, and spent time in Nyeri, near Mount Kenya, where his former personal secretary Eric Sherbrooke Walker ran a hotel. They returned in 1937, and at the end of 1938, he and Olave retired to Paxtu cottage, built specially for them at Nyeri. Lord and Lady Baden-Powell lived there until his death there on 8 January 1941 and are buried at Nyeri. His gravestone bears a circle with a dot in the center, which is the trail sign for \\"I have gone home\\": I have gone home Lady Baden-Powell moved back to England after his death, but is buried beside Lord Baden-Powell. Baden- Powell's Paxtu cottage, now a small museum, stands on the grounds of the Outspan Hotel. For years it served as a WAGGGS World Center. In 1982, J.J.M. Nyagah was awarded the Bronze Wolf Award, the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting fraternity. ==Program== Scouting in Kenya focuses on urban and rural community development needs. Community service is required for the early rank advancement and includes hospital visits, blood donations, helping the aged, planting trees, adult literacy campaigns, road and bridge construction, first aid training, building schools and homes for the aged, as well as many other projects. The conservation of nature is a major program emphasis. The senior conservation badge is a required badge in order to earn the highest rank, Lion Scout. Scouting in Kenya is a co-educational programme, open to both boys and girls. The Scout Motto is Uwe Tayari, which means \\"Be Prepared\\" in Swahili. ===Age divisions=== * Sungura (Cubs) - 6–11 years * Chipukizi (Scouts) - 12–15 years * Mwamba (Senior Scouts) - 16–18 years * Jasiri Rovers - over 18 years ====Sungura Scouts==== An English leader explaining about Scouting in the UK to a group of Sungura Scouts in Karatina. Sungura is the Swahili word for rabbit and the section is the equivalent of Cub Scouts. Sungura Scouts wear a yellow scarf with the Kenya Scout Associations logo printed on it. There are boy and girl versions of the Sungura Scout Uniform as well as an Air Scout and Casual Dress alternative. The Sungura stage is aimed at instilling the fundamental basics of Scouting in the young person and fostering the spirit of brotherhood, respect for God, and patriotism. When a young person shows an interest in joining Sungura Scouts they enter a pre-investiture period where they learn the fundamentals of the section. This includes learning the Sungura Scout: Law; Promise; Motto; Salute & Sign and a brief history of Scouting within Kenya. Ideals A group shot of a school based Sungura Scout section on their camp in Kenya. Sungura Scout Promise I promise to do my best; To do my duty to God and my Country; To help others every day; To obey the sungura laws of scouts. Sungura Scout Law Sungura Scouts obey their leaders, Think of others before themselves, and Always do their best. The Sungura Scout Motto \\"Do Your Best\\" Badges A Kenyan Sungura Scout receiving their badge and certificate during an Award Ceremony at the end of a camp. The principle Sungura Scout Badges are the 3 stages of the Nyota badge. To gain these badges the Scout must demonstrate an understanding of: Scouting Skills; Conservation; Health and Sanitation; Physical Development; Scouting Spirit; Spiritual Development; Citizenship; Education and Literacy; Agriculture and Reproductive Health Education. Each of these badges in turn requires an increased understanding of these areas. (A full break down of badge requirements can be found in the Sungura Scout Leader's Handbook. Sungura Scouts also have the opportunity to gain a number of Proficiency Badges. As with the Nyota Staged Badges many of the Proficiency Badges focus on areas that will help the Scouts care for themselves and to stay fit and healthy. The Sungura Proficiency Badges are: Animal Husbandry; Artist; Athlete; Child Health; Computerist (this covers basic computer usage); Cyclist; Drug Abuse Prevention; Elimu (this is about reading and writing); ; Entertainer; First Aider; Fisherman; Guide; Handicraft; Handyman; Horse Orderly; Linguist (foreign languages); Mkulima (basic agricultural skills); Musician; Mwanainchi (patriotism); Obeserver; Photographer; Reproductive Health Education; Signaller (woodcraft and codes); Sportsman; Swimmer and Utamaduni (culture and traditions). Sungura Scouts can also earn the Link Badge once they have complete their Nyota III badge and three Proficiency Badges (which must include one of the following: First Aider; Mwananchi; Elimu or Handyman). This badge is worn on the right breast above the pocket and may be worn in the Chipukizi Section until the Chui Badge is earned. Upon completion of the Link Badge the Sungura Scout graduates to the Chipukizi Section. ===Extension Scouts=== The KSA runs the Extension Scout Program, or Street Scouts as it is often called. In 2007, about 4000 children were enrolled and the number was growing. The program organises Scout groups for street children. The program also reaches out to children that go to orphanages during the day, but live on the streets at night. Children learn life skills as well as receiving basic health care. They can get practical job training and support to re-enter the education system. In some cases, children have been re-united with their families. The program has been so successful that it has spread to other countries, including Uganda and Tanzania. Scouts Canada has been helping the KSA run the Street Scouts for several years. Ten Street Scouts attended the 11th Canadian Scout Jamboree in 2007. ==Events== Each year on February 22, members of the Association and Kenya Girl Guides Association gather in Nyeri, at the grave of Baden Powell, to celebrate Founders' Day at the grave. ==See also== * Scouting and Guiding in Kenya * Elizabeth Nyaruai * Kinuthia Murugu, former director of World Scout Bureau's Africa Regional Office ==References== ==External links== * Category:Youth organizations established in 1910 Category:World Organization of the Scout Movement member organizations Category:Scouting and Guiding in Kenya Category:Youth organisations based in Kenya ","title":"Kenya Scouts Association"},{"id":"3251972","text":"Love My Way is a Logie Award-winning and critically acclaimed Australian television drama program. It won the AFI award for Best Television Drama Series for each of its three seasons (2004–2007). ==Premise== Set in Sydney, Love My Way was about a group of 30-somethings dealing with the ups and downs of life. The series revolves around an extended family unit - Frankie Paige and Charlie Jackson are the separated parents of Lou, and Frankie also lives with Charlie's brother, Tom. As the series began, Charlie's new wife Julia is about to have their first child. Frankie's mother, Di and Charlie's mother, Brenda, and father, Gerry, also have a strong presence in the ongoing story, as does Julia's ex-lover Howard, who enters into a relationship with Frankie. ==Production== Produced by John Edwards and Claudia Karvan, Love My Way starred Karvan, Sam Worthington, Dan Wyllie, Asher Keddie, Brendan Cowell, and Alex Cook. As the program was made for subscription television in Australia, it contained stronger material than most Australian programs: regular swearing, drug use and sexual references. When the series was launched, much was made of the connection between Love My Way and The Secret Life of Us: both sharing a star, as well as significant creative talent (Edwards and Perske both were involved in Secret Life, as were series writers like Tony McNamara). However, the series is not a continuation of Secret Life, although it does share some thematic concerns. The star of the series, Claudia Karvan, is also a co-producer, along with having written for the series. Brendan Cowell, who appears as Tom, also worked as script writer for two episodes of seasons 1 and three episodes of season 2. On first airing, the theme song originally by The Psychedelic Furs, this time covered by Magic Dirt, played over the title sequence. Some scenes were filmed on location at the infamously dangerous Cromwell Park. ==Subscription television== The series premiered on FOX8 on 22 November 2004 during the late summer months when commercial TV is in a non- ratings period. During the second season it was moved to W. Channel. In 2007, for its third season, it screened on Showtime. Foxtel has been criticised for moving the show to different channels to encourage viewing of the W. Channel and then for moving the program to Showtime which is not included in the basic package of subscription television in Australia. == Cast == ===Main cast=== * Claudia Karvan as Francesca \\"Frankie\\" Paige * Asher Keddie as Julia Jackson * Brendan Cowell as Tom Jackson * Daniel Wyllie as Charlie Jackson * Lynette Curran as Brenda Jackson * Alex Cook as Louise \\"Lou\\" Jackson Paige * Gillian Jones as Di Paige * Max Cullen as Gerry Jackson ===Recurring/guest stars=== * Ben Mendelsohn as Lewis Feingold * Sam Worthington as Howard Light * Mariel McClorey as Katie * Sam Parsonson as Dylan Feingold * Claire van der Boom as Billie * Sacha Horler as P.K. * Damon Herriman as George Wagstaffe * Justine Clarke as Simone * Adelaide Clemens as Harper ==Series overview== ==Episodes== (Episode information retrieved from Australian Television Information Archive). ===Season 1 (2004-05)=== ===Season 2 (2006)=== ===Season 3 (2007)=== == Awards and nominations == ===AACTA Awards=== 2015 Wins * AACTA Subscription Television 20th Anniversary Award for Best Drama (one-off award) ===Australian Film Institute Awards=== The program has won many Australian Film Institute Awards. 2005 Wins * Best Television Drama Series * Best Direction in Television (for Jessica Hobbs) * Best Television Screenplay * Best Actress in Television (for Claudia Karvan) * Best Supporting Actor in Television (for Max Cullen). 2005 Nominations * Best Actor for Dan Wyllie * Best Achievement in Screen Craft - Cinematography - for Louis Irving 2006 Wins * Best Television Drama Series,Australian Film Institute making it the first show to win that title over two consecutive years in AFI history. 2006 Nominations * Best Actress category for stars Claudia Karvan and Asher Keddie * Best Actor for Dan Wyllie * Best Direction in Television * Best Television Screenplay 2007 Wins * Best Television Drama Series * Best Actress in Television (for Claudia Karvan) 2007 Nominations * Best Actor for Ben Mendelsohn * Best Supporting Actress for Justine Clarke * Best Television Screenplay ===TV Week Logie Awards=== 2005 Wins * Most Outstanding Australian Drama 2005 Nominations * Most Outstanding Actor - Brendan Cowell * Most Outstanding Actor - Daniel Wyllie * Most Outstanding Actress - Claudia Karvan * Most Outstanding Actress - Asher Keddie 2006 Wins * Most Outstanding Australian Drama * Most Outstanding Actor - Daniel Wyllie * Most Outstanding Actress - Claudia Karvan 2006 Nominations * Most Outstanding Actor - Brendan Cowell * Most Outstanding Actress - Asher Keddie 2007 Wins * Most Outstanding Australian Drama 2007 Nominations * Most Outstanding Actor - Ben Mendelsohn * Most Outstanding Actor - Daniel Wyllie * Most Outstanding Actress - Claudia Karvan * Most Outstanding Actress - Asher Keddie * Most Outstanding New Talent - Sam Parsonson * Most Popular Actor - Brendan Cowell 2008 Nominations * Most Outstanding Actress - Claudia Karvan * Most Outstanding Actress - Asher Keddie * Most Outstanding Actress - Asher Keddie * Most Outstanding New Talent - Adelaide Clemens ===ASTRAs=== ASTRAs * The series also has been nominated at almost every Australian television awards.

At the , Tarcoola had no people living within its boundaries. Tarcoola was named after Tarcoola the winner of the 1893 Melbourne Cup horse race. The horse Tarcoola had been raised on Tarcoola Station on the Darling River in New South Wales. It means river bend in the aboriginal language of the area around that Tarcoola Station. ==History== Tarcoola railway station, between 1926 and 1940. Tarcoola lies on Kokata land. The Tarcoola Goldfield was discovered and named in 1893, but it was in an isolated arid area, and there was little development until 1900. A Post Office opened on 18 August 1900 and the town was proclaimed on 21 February 1901. The goldfield's heyday was from about 1901 to 1918. A government battery was built to process ore from small mines. Between 1901 and 1954 the field produced about 77,000oz (2.4 tonnes) of gold, most of it from the Tarcoola Blocks mine.J.F. Drexel, Mining in South Australia: a Pictorial History (Department of Mines & Energy, Adelaide, 1982, p. 129) The Trans-Australian Railway was built through Tarcoola in 1915, and in 1980 it became a junction station when the Adelaide–Darwin railway diverged from Tarcoola to Alice Springs. The link from Alice Springs through to Darwin was eventually completed in 2004. The town is almost completely deserted today except for transient railway maintenance staff and geological exploration teams. The original Tarcoola goldfields are long closed. However, there is now new exploration for minerals in the wider area, including the Challenger Mine. The Tarcoola Goldfield, Battery and Township is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register as a designated place of archaeological significance. In 2017, WPG Resources commenced mining an open pit at Tarcoola intending to mine for at least two years, and transport the ore to the Challenger mine for processing in the facilities there. ==Transport== ===Rail=== Tarcoola is now best known as the northern junction of the Sydney-Perth and Adelaide-Darwin railways, which share approximately of track between Tarcoola and Crystal Brook. There is a triangular junction at Tarcoola which joins Crystal Brook, Darwin and Perth. Another triangular junction at Crystal Brook joins Tarcoola, Adelaide and Sydney.

BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) is a high level language with simple syntax that makes it easy for novices to write simple programs. Color BASIC is interpreted, that is, decoded as it is run. Interpreted BASIC is simple to edit and debug but execution is significantly slower than for programs written in assembly language or typical compiled languages of the time (like Pascal, compiled BASIC or C). ==Background== The nucleus of Color BASIC was Microsoft BASIC-69 which Tandy licensed from Microsoft. Color BASIC 1.0 was released with the original 4k TRS-80 Color Computer in 1980. It resides on 8k bytes of ROM, and is responsible for all 'housekeeping' duties on the system. This includes hardware initialization, memory management, interrupt processing, etc. Like most implementations of BASIC, each line of code starts with a line number and consists of one or more statements with variables and operators. 16k of memory is required for the next level of BASIC, Extended Color BASIC. (\\"ECB\\") Extended BASIC is required for the floppy disk controller, which then gives you Disk Extended Color BASIC. (\\"DECB\\") Emulators of the Color Computers running this interpreter and the others are available for modern computers, some of which require a \\"snapshot\\" file of the physical machine.MESS ==Variables== Color BASIC understands one type of numeric variable and string variables. Variable names in Color BASIC have the first two characters significant. The first character of the variable name must be a letter. The second can be either a letter or number. String variables are indicated by adding a dollar sign ($) after the variable name. ===Examples=== A=5 A$=\\"THIS IS A STRING\\" K7=10 BB$=\\"HELLO!\\" ZZ=1.54 Numeric variables have only one type, a binary floating point implementation. Each numeric variable uses 5 bytes of memory and can be in the range from -1E+38 up to 1E+37. Unlike most implementations of Microsoft BASIC, Color BASIC requires the user to reserve space for string variables via the CLEAR statement. Multidimensional arrays are also supported with both numeric and string variables. In the case of an array, the element address is enclosed with a parenthesis: A(1)=1 A$(1)=\\"BOOKS\\" Multiple dimensions are separated by commas A(1,3)=4 A$(2,2)=\\"XYZ123\\" ==Operators and Symbols== Color BASIC provides several operators for both mathematic and, to a lesser extent, string operations. :+ can be used to concatenate strings or for mathematical addition :- is used for subtraction :* is used for multiplication :/ is used for division Parenthesis ( ) are used to override mathematical order of operation :AND is used for logical 'and' operations :OR is used for logical 'or' operations :NOT is used for logical 'not' operations For testing, the following operators are used: := is equal to :> is greater than :< is less than :>= is greater than or equal to (also => is acceptable) :<= is less than or equal to (also =< is acceptable) :<> is not equal to (also >< is acceptable) Other symbols used in BASIC: :\\" \\" indicates string data is a constant (static) :: separates multiple commands on a single program line :A semicolon, when encountered in a PRINT function, will cause the output to remain on the same line :A comma, when encountered in a PRINT function, will tab to the next column ==Key== num indicates a numeric expression is required. This can be a fixed number, a variable, or other operation or function that returns a numeric quantity. str indicates a string expression is required. This can be a static string value (in quotes), a string variable, or other function or expression that returns a string of characters. device number indicates a device. By default, device 0 (screen and keyboard) is assumed. In Color BASIC, device #-1 (cassette) and #-2 (printer) are available to the programmer. ==Edit mode== If you make a mistake typing in a line, you can either retype it from scratch (or DEL it).. or you can EDIT it. When in EDIT mode, you get a reprint of the line, and a second copy that you SPACEbar across chars. You cannot use arrow keys. backspace takes you left, but does not actually erase it in the buffer. 'i' puts you in insert mode. pressing return gets you out of it. 'c' changes one char, 'd' deletes one char. 'x' takes you to end of line, allowing you to e'x'tend it. 'l' redraws the line. ==Functions== ;\`ABS(num)\`: returns the absolute value of num ;\`ASC(str)\`: returns the ASCII code of the first character in str ;\`CHR$(num)\`: returns a single string character with the ASCII code num ;\`EOF(device number)\`: returns 0 if the file has data, or -1 if at the end of the file ;\`INKEY$\`: returns a character if a key on the keyboard has been pressed, or null if nothing is pressed ;\`INT(num)\`: returns the integer portion of num ;\`INSTR(startpos,search str,target str)\`: searches for the first string, in the target str. startpos is optional. ;\`JOYSTK(num)\`: returns the position of the joystick axis (0-3) with a value from 0 to 63 ;\`LEFT$(str,num)\`: returns the first (\\"left\\") num characters of string str ;\`LEN(str)\`: returns the length (in characters) of string str ;\`MEM\`: returns the available free memory in bytes ;\`MID$(str,start num,length num)\`: returns a sub-string of string str beginning at position start num and length num characters long.

C. Wyeth, 1911 The Black Spot is a literary device invented by Robert Louis Stevenson for his novel Treasure Island (serialized 1881–82, published as a book in 1883). In the book, pirates are presented with a \\"black spot\\" to officially pronounce a verdict of guilt or judgement. It consists of a circular piece of paper or card, with one side blackened while the other side bears a message and placed in the hand of the accused.The fullest description is in chapter 29 of the book where the narrator describes still having Silver's Black Spot in his possession. It was a source of much fear because it meant the pirate was to be deposed as leader, by force if necessary—or else killed outright. In Treasure Island, Billy Bones is much frightened by it but remains determined to outwit his enemies; however, he suffers a stroke caused by the overconsumption of liquor and is killed by the blind beggar (Pew). Billy Bones receives the spot - chapter 3 Later Long John Silver receives the spot, but is calm enough to notice that the paper bearing the spot has been torn out from a Bible, and warns his associates of the bad luck this will bring upon them. Long John Silver receives the spot from Morgan - chapter 29 The words on the back of that black spot were spookily from Revelation, like an allusion to the beast's mark and judgement day i.e. Chapter 29: ==Origins== The origin of Stevenson's Black Spot might be in the historical tradition of Caribbean pirates of showing an Ace of Spades to a person condemned as traitor or informer. The card was putting the person dangerously \\"on the spot\\", as the ace bears a single pip. ==Appearances in other works== The Black Spot has since been used in other works of popular culture: Listed chronologically: *1930: In the novel Swallows and Amazons the pirate captain called Uncle Jim (James Turner, also known as Captain Flint) receives the Black Spot from Nancy, a member of his crew. *1938: In the film Algiers Regis draws the ace of spades when forced to cut the deck. Carlos calls this drawing of the black spot \\"very bad luck\\". *1946: In the novel Joy in the Morning by P. G. Wodehouse, Boko Fittleworth commiserates with Bertie Wooster on learning that Bertie, rather than Stilton Cheesewright, has become engaged to Florence Craye by saying, \\"I did think that the black spot had finally passed into Stilton's possession.\\" * 1948: Shirley Jackson's short story \\"The Lottery\\" describes use of the black spot to select the annual victim of ritual human sacrifice. *1964: In the short story \\"Lonelyache\\" by Harlan Ellison, the protagonist Paul has a recurring nightmare in which a different young, good-looking man comes to kill him or \\"tip him the black spot\\". *1969: In A Pirate Utopia the pirate lord, Olaf, is given the black spot by Leonard as he had tortured some people without permission. *1986: In Stephen King's novel It, the doomed \\"Negro nightclub\\" is named \\"The Black Spot\\". *1990: \\"The Black Spot\\" is mentioned by a convict at the end of an episode of \\"The Bill\\" (series 6, episode 71, \\"Where There's a Will\\".The Bill (series 6)) *1996: In the movie Muppet Treasure Island, a retelling of Treasure Island, the black spot is drawn on a piece of paper and given to Billy Bones; when he explains that the black spot is \\"a pirate's death sentence\\" the Great Gonzo utters \\"Fabulous\\". It is also given to Long John Silver on a leaf from a Bible, but he escapes execution by scolding at his crew that they have defiled the holy book and will be severely punished for it before he gives his crew a second chance once he accepts their forgiveness. *2000: The 2000 video-game Skies of Arcadia presented players with a black spot, a message from a bounty hunter that they would soon be hunted down and killed. *2002: Puzzle Pirates, an MMORPG created by Three Rings Design, uses the term \\"Black Spot\\" to refer to a temporary way to silence rude and disruptive players. *2006: In the Disney feature film Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, Captain Jack Sparrow is presented with a \\"Black Spot\\" by Davy Jones as a marker that the Kraken can track; in the film, the black spot appears as a large black boil-like swelling on the palm of his hand. *2007: In the CBS reality television show Pirate Master, the black spot is given by the captain to the three contestants that he nominates to be voted off. *2008: On the indie-Americana band Murder By Death's fourth album Red of Tooth and Claw, there is a song titled \\"The Black Spot\\" in which the singer laments, \\"The black spot, I never thought I'd be the one givin' it to you.\\" *2009: The pirate-themed power/folk metal band Alestorm featured the Black Spot in their song \\"Chronicles of Vengeance\\" on their second album Black Sails at Midnight. *2011: The third episode of Series 6 (Season 32) of Doctor Who, \\"The Curse of the Black Spot\\", takes place on a pirate ship, and the black spot appears on the palm of anyone who is sick or injured, causing a supernatural seductress known as The Siren to hunt them down. *2006–2011: Kate Beaton's Hark! A Vagrant:, on page 265, has a pirate receive a black spot from another pirate before he is shot for pointing out that the practice was invented by Stevenson. On page 281, in the strip \\"Davey Jones, I mean, In the drink\\", a man receives a black spot from gangsters but tells them \\"You've mixed up genres\\". *2012: In the TV series 30 Rock, in Season 6 Episode 3, \\"Idiots Are People Three\\", Jack Donaghy hands Criss (Liz Lemon's new boyfriend) a black spot while telling Liz he is Officially Disapproving of Criss (with no \\"H\\" and two \\"S\\").

It is one of the Primm Valley Resorts, owned and operated by Affinity Gaming. It has 1,242 guest rooms and suites. The hotel is home to the Desperado roller coaster, a hypercoaster with a 225-foot drop and a top speed of 80 mph, as well as a pool in the shape of a buffalo. The hotel- casino has two hotel room towers: the Annie Oakley Tower (the A Tower) and the Buffalo Bill Tower (B Tower). It is named after Buffalo Bill. The casino has over 1,700 slot machines, as well as table games, and a race and sports book. Buffalo Bill's is also home of the Star of the Desert Arena, a 6,500-seat arena designed for concerts. ==History== The casino opened on May 14, 1994 with 592 hotel rooms, and a new tower was added in 1995. Terrible's Primm Valley Casino Resorts logo (2007–2011) The ribbon cutting for the change of ownership for Primm Valley Resorts from MGM Mirage to Herbst Gaming was held at Buffalo Bill's on April 10, 2007. Herbst undertook a marketing strategy of appealing especially to California Latinos, including the addition of Spanish- speaking dealers, charter bus trips from the Inland Empire, concerts by norteño musician Ramón Ayala, and a Mexican restaurant branded with Ayala's name. The interiors and exteriors of the casino were used in the movie Top of the World (1997) starring Peter Weller, Dennis Hopper and Tia Carrere. Today the roller coaster is usually running only on weekends. In March 2019 Cuca's Mexican Food, originally from Redlands, California, opened their first hotel location in Nevada within Buffalo Bill's. This restaurant is an extension of the brand that has 6 locations in the Inland Empire of California. ==Tram to Primm Valley== A tram links Buffalo Bill's to nearby Primm Valley Resort. The multi-car tram was designed by Schwager-Davis to their UniTrak standard. Despite its name, the tram actually runs on two guideways. Each car accommodates 24 people; the four-car trains can seat 96 people with no standees. The system can transport 2,200 people, per hour, per direction (pphpd). An attendant supervises each tram, although the tram is controlled by a computer. After disembarking at the Primm Valley Resort station, passengers can connect to a free single-car tram across the I-15 to Whiskey Pete's, although the connection takes a walk across the entire hotel. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Casinos in Primm, Nevada Category:Hotels in Primm, Nevada Category:UniTrak people movers Category:Affinity Gaming Category:Casinos completed in 1994 Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1994 Category:Resorts in Nevada Category:Casino hotels Category:1994 establishments in Nevada ","title":"Buffalo Bill's"},{"id":"3252046","text":"Boccaccio's De Casibus Virorum Illustrium showing Lady Fortune spinning her wheel. In medieval and ancient philosophy the Wheel of Fortune, or Rota Fortunae, is a symbol of the capricious nature of Fate. The wheel belongs to the goddess Fortuna (Greek equivalent Tyche) who spins it at random, changing the positions of those on the wheel: some suffer great misfortune, others gain windfalls. The metaphor was already a cliche in ancient times, complained about by Tacitus, but was greatly popularized for the Middle Ages by its extended treatment in the Consolation of Philosophy by Boethius from around 520. It became a common image in manuscripts of the book, and then other media, where Fortuna, often blindfolded, turns a large wheel of the sort used in watermills, to which kings and other powerful figures are attached. ==Origins== The \\"Queen of Fortune\\", helped by four other personifications, turns her wheel. The origin of the word is from the \\"wheel of fortune\\"—the zodiac, referring to the Celestial spheres of which the 8th holds the stars, and the 9th is where the signs of the zodiac are placed. The concept was first invented in Babylon and later developed by the ancient Greeks. The concept somewhat resembles the Bhavacakra, or Wheel of Becoming, depicted throughout Ancient Indian art and literature, except that the earliest conceptions in the Roman and Greek world involve not a two-dimensional wheel but a three- dimensional sphere, a metaphor for the world. It was widely used in the Ptolemaic perception of the universe as the zodiac being a wheel with its \\"signs\\" constantly turning throughout the year and having effect on the world's fate (or fortune). In the second century BC, the Roman tragedian Pacuvius wrote: The idea of the rolling ball of fortune became a literary topos and was used frequently in declamation. In fact, the Rota Fortunae became a prime example of a trite topos or meme for Tacitus, who mentions its rhetorical overuse in the Dialogus de oratoribus. Ptolemaic model of the spheres for Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn with epicycle, eccentric deferent and equant point. Georg von Peuerbach, Theoricae novae planetarum, 1474. In the second century AD, astronomer and astrologer Vettius Valens wrote: ::There are many wheels, most moving from west to east, but some move from east to west. ::Seven wheels, each hold one heavenly object, the first holds the moon... ::Then the eighth wheel holds all the stars that we see... ::And the ninth wheel, the wheel of fortunes, moves from east to west, ::and includes each of the twelve signs of fortune, the twelve signs of the zodiac. ::Each wheel is inside the other, like an onion's peel sits inside another peel, and there is no empty space between them. Illustration by Jean Miélot to Christine de Pizan's Epitre d'Othéa; Les Sept Sacrements de l'Eglise, c. 1455 at Waddesdon Manor File:Titulihunteriani00macdrich raw 0143.pngStatuette of the Roman god Fortuna, with gubernaculum (ship's rudder), Rota Fortunae (wheel of fortune) and cornucopia (horn of plenty) found near the altar at Castlecary in 1771. ===Boethius=== The goddess and her Wheel were eventually absorbed into Western medieval thought. The Roman philosopher Boethius (c. 480–524) played a key role, utilizing both her and her Wheel in his Consolatio Philosophiae. For example, from the first chapter of the second book: > I know the manifold deceits of that monstrous lady, Fortune; in particular, > her fawning friendship with those whom she intends to cheat, until the > moment when she unexpectedly abandons them, and leaves them reeling in agony > beyond endurance. [...] Having entrusted yourself to Fortune's dominion, you > must conform to your mistress's ways. What, are you trying to halt the > motion of her whirling wheel? Dimmest of fools that you are, you must > realize that if the wheel stops turning, it ceases to be the course of > chance.\\" == In the middle ages == The Wheel of Fortune by Edward Burne-Jones, 1875-1883 ===Religious instruction=== The Wheel was widely used as an allegory in medieval literature and art to aid religious instruction. Though classically Fortune's Wheel could be favourable and disadvantageous, medieval writers preferred to concentrate on the tragic aspect, dwelling on downfall of the mighty – serving to remind people of the temporality of earthly things. In the morality play Everyman (c. 1495), for instance, Death comes unexpectedly to claim the protagonist. Fortune's Wheel has spun Everyman low, and Good Deeds, which he previously neglected, are needed to secure his passage to heaven. Geoffrey Chaucer used the concept of the tragic Wheel of Fortune a great deal. It forms the basis for the Monk's Tale, which recounts stories of the great brought low throughout history, including Lucifer, Adam, Samson, Hercules, Nebuchadnezzar, Belshazzar, Nero, Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar and, in the following passage, Peter I of Cyprus. :O noble Peter, Cyprus' lord and king, :Which Alexander won by mastery, :To many a heathen ruin did'st thou bring; :For this thy lords had so much jealousy, :That, for no crime save thy high chivalry, :All in thy bed they slew thee on a morrow. :And thus does Fortune's wheel turn treacherously :And out of happiness bring men to sorrow. ~ Geoffrey Chaucer, The Canterbury Tales, The Monk's Tale Fortune's Wheel often turns up in medieval art, from manuscripts to the great Rose windows in many medieval cathedrals, which are based on the Wheel. Characteristically, it has four shelves, or stages of life, with four human figures, usually labeled on the left regnabo (I shall reign), on the top regno (I reign) and is usually crowned, descending on the right regnavi (I have reigned) and the lowly figure on the bottom is marked sum sine regno (I am without a kingdom). Dante employed the Wheel in the Inferno and a \\"Wheel of Fortune\\" trump-card appeared in the Tarot deck (circa 1440, Italy). ===Political instruction=== Burana Codex; The figures are labelled \\"Regno, Regnavi, Sum sine regno, Regnabo\\": I reign, I reigned, My reign is finished, I shall reign In the medieval and renaissance period, a popular genre of writing was \\"Mirrors for Princes\\", which set out advice for the ruling classes on how to wield power (the most famous being The Prince by Niccolò Machiavelli). Such political treatises could use the concept of the Wheel of Fortune as an instructive guide to their readers. John Lydgate's Fall of Princes, written for his patron Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester is a noteworthy example. Many Arthurian romances of the era also use the concept of the Wheel in this manner, often placing the Nine Worthies on it at various points. > ...fortune is so variant, and the wheel so moveable, there nis none constant > abiding, and that may be proved by many old chronicles, of noble Hector, and > Troilus, and Alisander, the mighty conqueror, and many mo other; when they > were most in their royalty, they alighted lowest. ~ Lancelot in Thomas > Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, Chapter XVII. Like the Mirrors for Princes, this could be used to convey advice to readers. For instance, in most romances, Arthur's greatest military achievement – the conquest of the Roman Empire – is placed late on in the overall story. However, in Malory's work the Roman conquest and high point of King Arthur's reign is established very early on. Thus, everything that follows is something of a decline. Arthur, Lancelot and the other Knights of the Round Table are meant to be the paragons of chivalry, yet in Malory's telling of the story they are doomed to failure. In medieval thinking, only God was perfect, and even a great figure like King Arthur had to be brought low. For the noble reader of the tale in the Middle Ages, this moral could serve as a warning, but also as something to aspire to. Malory could be using the concept of Fortune's Wheel to imply that if even the greatest of chivalric knights made mistakes, then a normal fifteenth-century noble didn't have to be a paragon of virtue in order to be a good knight. ===Carmina Burana=== The Wheel of Fortune motif appears significantly in the Carmina Burana (or Burana Codex), albeit with a postclassical phonetic spelling of the genitive form Fortunae. Excerpts from two of the collection's better known poems, \\"Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi (Fortune, Empress of the World)\\" and \\"Fortune Plango Vulnera (I Bemoan the Wounds of Fortune),\\" read: : Sors immanis : et inanis, : rota tu volubilis, : status malus, : vana salus : semper dissolubilis, : obumbrata : et velata : michi quoque niteris; : nunc per ludum : dorsum nudum : fero tui sceleris. : . . . . . . . . . . : Fortune rota volvitur; : descendo minoratus; : alter in altum tollitur; : nimis exaltatus : rex sedet in vertice : caveat ruinam! : nam sub axe legimus : Hecubam reginam. : Fate – monstrous : and empty, : you whirling wheel, : status is bad, : well-being is vain : always may melt away, : shadowy : and veiled : you plague me too; : now through the game : bare backed : I bear your villainy. : . . . . . . . . . : The wheel of Fortune turns; : I go down, demeaned; : another is carried to the height; : far too high up : sits the king at the summit – : let him beware ruin! : for under the axle we read: : Queen Hecuba. '' ==Later usage== Fortune and her Wheel have remained an enduring image throughout history. Fortune's wheel can also be found in Thomas More's Utopia. ===Shakespeare=== Wheel of fortune in Sebastian Brant\`s Narrenschiff, woodcut by A. Dürer William Shakespeare in Hamlet wrote of the \\"slings and arrows of outrageous fortune\\" and, of fortune personified, to \\"break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel.\\" And in Henry V, Act 3 Scene VI are the lines: :Pistol: :Bardolph, a soldier firm and sound of heart :And of buxom valor, hath by cruel fate :And giddy Fortune's furious fickle wheel :That goddess blind, :That stands upon the rolling restless stone— :Fluellen: :By your patience, Aunchient Pistol. Fortune is painted blind, with a muffler afore his eyes, to signify to you that Fortune is blind; and she is painted also with a wheel, to signify to you, which is the moral of it, that she is turning, and inconstant, and mutability, and variation. And her foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone, which rolls, and rolls, and rolls. :Pistol: :Fortune is Bardolph's foe, and frowns on him; Shakespeare also references this Wheel in King Lear. The Earl of Kent, who was once held dear by the King, has been banished, only to return in disguise. This disguised character is placed in the stocks for an overnight and laments this turn of events at the end of Act II, Scene 2: :Fortune, good night, smile once more; turn thy wheel! In Act IV, scene vii, King Lear also contrasts his misery on the \\"wheel of fire\\" to Cordelia's \\"soul in bliss\\". Rosalind and Celia also discuss Fortune, especially as it stands opposed to Nature, in As You Like It, Act I, scene ii. ===Victorian era=== In Anthony Trollope's novel The Way We Live Now, the character Lady Carbury writes a novel entitled The Wheel of Fortune about a heroine who suffers great financial hardships. ===Modern day=== Selections from the Carmina Burana, including the two poems quoted above, were set to new music by twentieth-century classical composer Carl Orff, whose well-known \\"O Fortuna\\" is based on the poem Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi. ==== Literature ==== Fortuna does occasionally turn up in modern literature, although these days she has become more or less synonymous with Lady Luck. Her Wheel is less widely used as a symbol, and has been replaced largely by a reputation for fickleness. She is often associated with gamblers, and dice could also be said to have replaced the Wheel as the primary metaphor for uncertain fortune. In his novel, The Club Dumas, Arturo Pérez-Reverte includes a wheel of fortune in one of the illustrations that accompany the text. Ignatius J. Reilly, the central protagonist of John Kennedy Toole's novel A Confederacy of Dunces, states that he believes the Rota Fortunae to be the source of all men's fate. ==== Popular music ==== Jerry Garcia recorded a song entitled \\"The Wheel\\" (co-written with Robert Hunter and Bill Kreutzmann) for his 1972 solo album Garcia, and performed the song regularly with the Grateful Dead from 1976 onward. The song \\"Wheel in the Sky\\" by Journey from their 1978 release Infinity also touches on the concept through the lyrics \\"Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin' / I don't know where I'll be tomorrow\\". The song \\"Throw Your Hatred Down\\" by Neil Young on his 1995 album Mirror Ball, recorded with Pearl Jam, has the verse \\"The wheel of fortune / Keeps on rollin' down\\". The Trip-Hop group Massive Attack refer to the Wheel of Fortune on their track \\"Hymn Of The Big Wheel\\" on the 1991 album Blue Lines. ==== Folk music==== Several old folk tunes mention the wheel of fortune, most notably 'Fakenham Fair' with its chorus lyrics of 'So spin me around on the merry-go- round/Give the wheel of fortune a whirl'. ==== Film and television ==== Various games of chance involve spinning a wheel marked with preset outcomes, mirroring the \\"wheel of fortune\\" concept. This is notably done on the long- running, internationally syndicated game show Wheel of Fortune, where contestants win or lose money determined by the spin of the wheel. Such a wheel is also featured in the game show The Price Is Right, in the \\"Showcase Showdown\\" segment. In the 1985 film Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, such a wheel was used to determine punishments for criminals. The 1994 film The Hudsucker Proxy refers often to the Rota Fortunae concept, especially in its use of circles as a visual motif. In the TV series Firefly (2002), the main character, Malcolm Reynolds, says \\"The Wheel never stops turning, Badger\\" to which Badger replies \\"That only matters to the people on the rim\\". In the science fiction TV series Farscape, the third-season episode \\"Self-Inflicted Wounds (Part 2): Wait for the Wheel\\" has main character Crichton mention that his grandmother told him that fate was like a wheel, alternately bringing fortunes up and down. In the episode The Bitter Suite of the 1995 television show Xena: Warrior Princess, Xena spins the wheel of fortune at the start of her journey through Illusia, a mystical land where the main characters Xena and Gabrielle will ultimately have to face both their pasts and their relationship in its current state. Later in the episode a rope of flame appears and starts to drag Gabrielle though the Fortune Wheel, then drags Xena along as well. ==== Games ==== The video game series character Kain (Legacy of Kain) used the wheel of fate. In the Fable video game series, the wheel of fortune appears twice, somehow perverted. The Wheel of Unholy Misfortune is a torture device in Fable II. It is found in the Temple of Shadows in Rookridge. The Hero can use the wheel to sacrifice followers to the shadows. In Fable III, Reaver's Wheel of Misfortune is a device that, once activated, sends to The Hero a round of random monsters. The Wheel of Fortune is featured in a Magic: The Gathering card by that name that forces all players to discard their hands and draw new ones. ==References== Category:Greek mythology Category:Medieval legends Category:Metaphors Category:Mythological objects ","title":"Rota Fortunae"},{"id":"3252049","text":"Pedal-powered vehicle may refer to: ==Air== * Human-powered aircraft * Human- powered airship * Human-powered helicopter ==Amphibious== * Amphibious cycle ==Land== * Bicycle * Bicycle trailer * BMX bike * Boneshaker (bicycle) * City bicycle * Cruiser bicycle * Cycle rickshaw * Cyclo-cross bicycle * Fatbike * Flat bar road bike * Folding bicycle * Freight bicycle * Go kart * Hotchkiss Bicycle Railroad * Hybrid bicycle * Model car * Mountain bike * Party bike * Pedelec * Penny-farthing * Porteur bicycle * Prone bicycle * Quadracycle * Recumbent bicycle * Road bicycle * Roadster (bicycle) * Safety bicycle * Small wheel bicycle * Tandem bicycle * Touring bicycle * Trailer bike * Tricycle * Unicycle * Utility bicycle * Velocar * Velocipede * Velomobile ==Water== * Hydrocycle * Pedalo ","title":"Pedal-powered vehicle"},{"id":"3252069","text":"State Line Road is a major north–south street in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area that runs along the Kansas–Missouri state line.
