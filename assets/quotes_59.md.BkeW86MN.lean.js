Dwivedi added the characters of Tarala, Haradas and Ratnadas from his own imagination and gave dramatic twists to the original story in order to make the story more suitable for dramatic retelling. It has been called the most outstanding play of the 19th century in Gujarati literature. Reportedly the play has elements of Sanskrit drama and Shakespearean tragedy reflected in its construction, due to Dwivedi's recent translation of Sanskrit play Malatimadhavam and studies of Shakespeare's plays. Kanta had moderate success on the stage. The Mumbai Gujarati Natak Mandali inaugurated its theatrical activities by staging this play on 29 June 1889. Overview upright=0.9 Dwivedi was a scholar, poet, novelist, philosopher and editor of Priyamvada and Sudarshan. He had translated the Sanskrit play Malatimadhavam by Bhavabhuti into Gujarati just before he started writing Kanta. During 1881–1882, when Kanta was being written, he was translating a second play by Bhavabhuti, Uttararamacarita, at the same time. Also, he studied Shakespeare's plays, which were fresh in his mind. Hence, certain elements of Sanskrit drama and Shakespearean tragedy are reflected in the construction of this play. The play is a mixture of history, imagination, and the author's preference for the traditional values and way of life, and it portrayed, for the first time, a tragic hero in Gujarati drama. Its basis is a historical event, the killing of King Jayshikhari of Patan by King Bhuvad of Panchasar. Dwivedi added the characters of Tarala, Haradas and Ratnadas from his own imagination and gave dramatic twists to the original story. Characters The principal characters are: * Jaychandra – King of Patan * Yauvanashri – queen and wife of Jaychandra * Sursen – friend and brother-in-law of Jaychandra and army chief * Kanta – wife of Sursen * Tarala – maid of Yauvanashri * Bhuvanaditya – King of Kalyan * Karan – son of Bhuvanaditya * Haradas – friend of Sursen * Ratnadas – wicked friend of Karan * Bhils, citizens, soldiers, servants, etc. Plot Jaychandra, the king of Patan, is informed of a surprise attack from his lifelong enemy Bhuvanaditya, who was defeated by him in the past. He asks his trusted friend and brother-in-law Sursen, who is also the chief of the army, to go to a nearby forest and leave the pregnant queen Yauvanashri under the protection of kind Bhils, so that in case of an unfavorable outcome of the battle, the child to be born may survive to take revenge. Sursen, who preferred to face the enemy, unwillingly proceeds to the forest to leave the queen under the care of Bhils. He also leaves his wife Kanta and faithful maid Tarala to look after the queen in the forest. When Sursen leaves, he gives his pearl necklace to Kanta, saying that the necklace, which is a symbol of his devotion to her, would be snapped asunder only when he dies. By the time Sursen returns from the forest, the battle is over. Jaychandra is killed and Bhuvanaditya's son Karan has taken possession of the state. With the help of his wicked associates Haradas and Ratnadas, Karan captures Kanta and Tarala from the forest and tries to seduce them. Tarala yields to the temptation of becoming Karan's favorite queen, but Kanta does not give in. One night Tarala stealthily snaps Kanta's necklace in order to suggest that Sursen is dead. The next morning, Kanta leaves the palace for the cremation ground to commit sati. Meanwhile, Sursen, acting on the advice of his friend Haradas, strategically allows himself to be arrested, but leaves the prison when he senses Haradas's conspiracy against him, and goes to the forest where he laments the loss of his wife. When Haradas brings him back to the cremation ground, Kanta has already jumped in the funeral pyre. Seeing this, he also throws himself on the pyre. Tarala, after killing Karan, also ends her life in self-condemnation of her misdeed. Techniques and theme Dwivedi employed the technique from Sanskrit drama of expressing the thoughts and emotions of characters through verse stanzas or songs, composed in various meters like soratha, doha, anushtup, harigit, indravijay, dindi, upajati and indravraja. The acts of the play, its division of acts into scenes, its dialogues intermixed with verses and its depiction of several rasas, like the Shringara, Vira, Karuna and Bibhatsa (the Erotic, the Heroic, the Pathetic and the Repulsive, respectively), are in the style of Sanskrit drama. Its characterization, the inner conflicts of characters and the tragic end of the play are evidence of the influence of Shakespearean drama. The depiction of Tarala's wavering mind when she stealthily proceeds to break Kanta's necklace resembles Macbeth's mental condition when proceeding to murder Duncan. The play ends like Hamlet, with several deaths. Reception and criticism Kanta is widely considered to be a classic and the most outstanding play of the 19th-century in Gujarati literature. Ramanbhai Neelkanth described the play as 'one of the best specimens of objective poetry in Gujarati literature' and as 'the only solace' in the dry land of Gujarati drama before 1909. Mansukhlal Jhaveri appreciated some of its descriptions, particularly the inner conflict of Tarala when she was on her way to the bedroom of Kanta for cutting the necklace. K. M. Jhaveri acclaimed the play, saying 'Dwivedi has displayed scholarship of no mean order in portraying human nature, in laying down the plot and in poetising the whole subject of the play.' Dhirubhai Thaker, a scholar who has done extensive research on Dwivedi's work, appreciated the use of verses in the play with suitable dramatic effect. Thaker also pointed out some weaker aspects: > There are certain basic deficiencies of dramatic form in Kanta. The plot > construction is loose. The dramatic device of a necklace as a symbol of > Sursen's existence/devotion to his wife is not convincing. There is an > inconsistency between certain actions and events of the play. The author has > failed to set the dialogue in language appropriate to the characters > concerned. Except for the Bhils, all the characters speak the author's > language, which is sanskitised and pedantic with a tinge of charotari > dialect (It may be said that Gujarati prose was not suitably cultivated for > drama at that time). By and large, dialogues in Kanta are not brisk but > dilatory. Thaker further added that, despite these deficiencies, Kanta occupies a prominent place in Gujarati dramatic literature by virtue of its form and poetic expression of sentiments. Performance Kanta had moderate success on the stage. The Mumbai Gujarati Natak Mandali inaugurated its theatrical activities by staging this play on 29 June 1889 under the title Kulin Kanta. It was renamed by Dayashankar Visanji Bhatt after editing and modifying it to make it suitable for the stage. As K. M. Jhaveri observes, 'it was a bold and a unique performance and shone like a gem when it was presented to the public. When it was staged in Mumbai, it proved a great success; the warmth of the sentiments, aided by suitable theatrical properties, kept the audience in a very happy mood from start to finish, and for several years Kanta played by the Mumbai Gujarati Natak Mandali continued to be \\"the rage\\" in Bombay'.

Neil Mackay, AUOB founder, argued that a strategy of marches for independence across Scotland was needed to attract more attention to the independence movement after the 2014 Scottish independence referendum that saw a majority vote to remain in the United Kingdom.  History  In the aftermath of the 2016 EU membership referendum (which saw the majority of voters in the UK as a whole vote to leave the European Union whilst most in Scotland voted to remain), large numbers of people took part in an event on 30 July 2016 at the 6th AUOB March. The following 3 June 2017 saw 25,000 demonstrators. After 2017 there was not another All Under One Banner march until the 5 May 2018, again at Glasgow, with a police estimate of 35,000 protesters. Following this demo AUOB embarked on a national tour: 2 June at Dumfries (around 10,000 attended); 23 June Bannockburn (8,000)); 28 July Inverness (5,000–7,500 according to the police, 14,000 according to the organisers); 18 August Dundee (16,000) with the final march of 2018 taking place in Edinburgh on the 6 October where an estimated 100,000 marched in protest against the outcome of the 2014 vote. The largest march in Scotland was held on 4 May 2019 in Glasgow, attracting up to 90,000 protesters according to some estimates. Police Scotland estimated the attendance at the rally following the march to be 35,000 protestors. On 6 May, AOUB activist Manny Singh was arrested and charged with failing to follow the timing restrictions for the event.  AUOB Cymru  AUOB Cymru is a Welsh independence organisation, inspired by AUOB in Scotland. Their first march was held in Cardiff on 11 May 2019, attracting thousands of participants. On 27 July 2019, AUOB organised an independence march in Caernarfon. Estimates put the attendance at about 8,000.

Fuentes is an American political advisor and businessman who served as Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff in the Trump Administration. He formerly served as a senior advisor and assistant to John F. Kelly, while he served as White House Chief of Staff and Secretary of Homeland Security. He left the Trump administration in January 2019.  Education  A member of the United States Coast Guard, Fuentes earned a Bachelor of Science degree from the United States Coast Guard Academy.  Career  In November 2018, Fuentes was blamed for the decision that Trump would not be able to fly or drive in a motorcade to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and Memorial as part of the First World War centenary. The New York Times reported on December 20, 2018 that Fuentes, an officer on active duty with the United States Coast Guard, had discussed inserting a provision into a House bill that would have allowed him to take advantage of a Coast Guard early retirement program that had previously expired. Homeland Security officials began pressing Congress to reinstate the provision in November 2018. It was abruptly withdrawn from a bill after reporters had inquired about it in December. After Kelly's exit from the white house was announced on December 8, 2018, President Donald Trump rejected Fuentes as being named interim chief of staff. Fuentes told colleagues he was planning to \\"hide out\\" in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building for six months to accomplish the retirement program minimum career length. In the White House, Fuentes' nicknames included \\"Zotus\\", \\"deputy president\\", and \\"prime minister\\". On January 2, 2019 Fuentes' White House title changed to Assistant to The President and Senior Adviser to the Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney. This was reported as a sign of Fuentes' expected departure from the White House. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, Fuentes created the company Zach Fuentes LLC and received a $3 million contract from the Indian Health Service to provide protective face masks to hospitals in the Navajo Nation, 11 days after creating the company. Over 25% of the masks were reported to be unsuitable for medical use, and another 15% were of a type that was not requested. US House of Representatives members Gerry Connolly and Ruben Gallego called for an investigation of the contract, and principal deputy inspector general Christi Grimm of the Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said that the office would contact Connolly for more information on the matter. By July 2020, NPR reported that Congress was investigating the awarding of the contract to Fuentes's company.

When a complex of thoughts, desires and intentions gains such a level of sophistication that it appears to operate autonomously from the magician's consciousness, as if it were an independent being, then such a complex is referred to as a servitor.

Alternatively, a magician may choose to create servitors from negative aspects of his/her psyche, such as \\"habits, shortcomings, faults, revulsions\\", rather than positive desires or intentions. In doing so, he/she can interact with those traits as personal demons, and bind or banish them to eradicate them from the psyche.  History  Carl Jung first developed the concept of the psychological complex as \\"an autonomous, largely unconscious, emotionally charged group of memories, ideas and images\\": > The complex has a sort of body, a certain amount of its own physiology. It > can upset the stomach. It upsets the breathing, it disturbs the heart - in > short, it behaves like a partial personality. According to Jung, the conscious ego itself is such a complex. Austin Osman Spare stated that such complexes could be deliberately created through his sigil technique, referring to sigils as \\"sentient symbols\\".Grant, Kenneth. Austin Osman Spare: An introduction to his psycho-magical philosophy. According to Spare, feeding sigils with free belief incubates \\"obsessions\\", which in turn gives rise to complexes. Peter J. Carroll writes: \\"These beings have a legion of names drawn from the demonology of many cultures: elementals, familiars, incubi, succubi, bud-wills, demons, atavisms, wraiths, spirits, and so on.\\" Hine, in turn, compares the servitor the Tibetan Buddhist concept of the tulpa.

The mother-of-pearl ring, set with gold and rubies, includes a locket with two portraits, one depicting Elizabeth and the other traditionally identified as Elizabeth's mother Anne Boleyn, but possibly her step-mother Catherine Parr. The ring is presently housed at Chequers, the country house of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.  Description  The ring is tentatively dated to the mid-1570s. A mother-of-pearl hoop is mounted with sheet gold set with table-cut rubies, found on the sides of the bezel and on the shoulders. White diamonds on the bezel form the letter E (for Elizabeth), with a cobalt blue enamel letter R (for Regina, meaning queen) underneath. More rubies surround the letters, along with a pearl. The back of the bezel is decorated with an enamel phoenix, symbol of the Seymour family, suggesting that Elizabeth may have received the ring as a gift from a Seymour.  Portraits  The bezel is hinged to form a locket. Two women are depicted in the secret compartment. Elizabeth is the older one, portrayed in an enamel cameo on the leaf of the jewel inset with a ruby. On the shank of the jewel there is a portrait miniature of a young woman dating from 1535–1545. It is made of layers of enamel in an imitation of a cameo. There is a small diamond at the woman's breast. Due to her portrait's juxtaposition with the cameo of Elizabeth, the younger woman has traditionally been identified as Anne Boleyn, Elizabeth's mother, who was executed when Elizabeth was two years old. Elizabeth mentioned Anne very rarely, and the ring is sometimes claimed to be the evidence of her affection for the memory of her mother, or said to have reminded Elizabeth to be more prudent in politics than her mother. The identification of the younger woman as Anne Boleyn has been challenged, however. The red-gold hair of the woman in the portrait does not fit the descriptions or portraits of Anne Boleyn, who was well known for her black hair. One possibility is that the portrait miniature depicts Catherine Parr, Elizabeth's red-haired stepmother. Elizabeth was unusually close to Catherine, who was her mother figure in early adolescence. Catherine later married into the Seymour family, which would explain the phoenix symbol.  History  According to legend, Robert Carey, Elizabeth I's maternal relative, took the ring from her finger when she died at Richmond Palace in 1603, and took it to James I in Scotland as a token of her death. Her jewellery collection was soon dispersed by the new king and queen, James I and Anne of Denmark. Sir John Eliot denounced this as a national loss, lamenting in a speech to Parliament in 1626: The ring is one of the few surviving pieces of jewellery worn by Elizabeth I. It may have been presented by James I to Alexander Home, 1st Earl of Home (c. 1566-1619), and it descended through the Home family until it was acquired by Arthur Lee, 1st Viscount Lee of Fareham (1868-1947). Lee presented his country house at Chequers and its collection to the British nation, for use as the country house of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. The ring is still housed at Chequers. It was loaned for the first time in 2002 to be exhibited at the National Maritime Museum, and went on public display for the first time in March 2003.

In Zaton Obrovački in Benkovac area every third inhabitant had the family name Modrić, where also exist a hamlet Modrići. Today, circa 1930 people carry it, making it 212th most numerous surname in Croatia, almost doubling the 1948 census number, in almost all Croatian counties and many cities and villages, but mostly Zagreb, Glavice near Sinj, Rijeka, Zadar, Split, Obrovac among others, and less in Northern Croatia and Slavonia. According to some sources, the noble part of the family is from Podgorje area on the littoral slopes of Velebit, between Senj in the North and river Zrmanja in the South, where came at least in the 17th century from Dalmatia (Podzrmanje). Outside Croatia, due to migration the surname can be found in Algeria, United States, Germany, Austria, Argentina, Slovenia, France, Serbia, Italy, Australia and so on. Etymology The surname is most probably of nickname origin, possibly of physical trait, and its root modr- derives from Slavic adjective mȍdar meaning \\"which is the color of a bright sky\\", \\"blue\\", while in regard to human body a shade of blue that is closer to purple. Another possibility is to be related to the traditional shirt for the whole body called \\"modra\\", \\"modrna\\", \\"modrina\\", which was of blue color and was mostly wore by young boys until school age when was replaced by trousers, while in Western Herzegovina traditional pants with \\"turom\\" were also called \\"modrine\\", probably because they were of blue color. Of the similar etymological derivation are surnames Modrič, Modrinić, Modrušan, Modrušić, and oeconyms like village Modruš, small littoral settlement Modrič (once seaport over which were two forts) with toponyms Modrič cove and Modrič cave in the Southern part of Podgorje (Velebit channel), hamlets Gornji and Donji Modrič in Rogoznica municipality, hamlet Modrići which is part of village Zaton Obrovački, as well toponyms like Modrić dolac (Modrić dell) in which is located the Velebit botanical garden part of Northern Velebit National Park, Modrića gradina and Modrića gomile at village Ježević near Koljane in Cetina region. History It is considered that the (noble) family is an old Croatian family from the Zadar hinterland in Dalmatia, which ancestors migrated to Lika and Krbava. After the Ottoman invasion of the region by the end of 15th and beginning of 16th century, the family also moved to Hrvatsko Zagorje (Varaždin County, Koprivnica-Križevci County), while a branch at the beginning of 18th century to Senj. According to another consideration, they or some of the surname holders were of Bunjevci origin from Dalmatia and Western Herzegovina. The surname was also present among the Bunjevci-Dalmatini community around Szeged and Baja, Hungary. In North Dalmatia, in 1468, certain Ivan Modrić or Slovinja (Slovigna) led the citizens with the help of Venice to enter the council of Pag because of the conflicts around the many pastures that mostly became the property of the nobility. In the mid 18th century, Lovre Modrić was a Franciscan parish priest in area of Jasenice. In 1777 was mentioned elder Ante Modrich in Zaton. In 1787 was recorded Vincenzo Modrich in Starigrad. In Podgorje-Lika, it is considered Modrići belonged to the first and older migration of Bunjevci from Northern Dalmatia to Velebit Podgorje, which probably happened in 1645. In 1694 was mentioned Rade Modrić, in 1708 died Ivan Modrić, and in 1727 was mentioned Mihovil Modrić aliter Mileta. In 1712/1714 census of Lika and Krbava in Lovinac was recorded certain landless peasant Vid Modrich Bunieuacz (Bunjevac), a migrant from Šugarje, descending from Krmpote. Modrić families had distinctive nicknames, Grlići, Josetići, Jukići, Jurići, Kajići, Mijadžići, Pavlovići, Perići, Vabići, Bralići, Kušljini. In the 20th century, population of hamlet Modrići and near villages on the slopes of Velebit was considered to belong to multilayered regional identity Podgorci being a synonym for Bunjevci. Some members also reached nobility status, in 1649 was recognized and confirmed the nobility to Nicolaus [Nikola] Modrich by Croatian Sabor. A branch of the family, with a surname form Modrović (Modrovich aliter Modrich), was part of the Croatian-Hungarian nobility since the end of 18th century, when Johann [Ivan] Modrovich aliter Modrich, with brother Peter-Martin and children, received the noble title with a bit different coat of arms by Leopold II on 21 July 1791, which was confirmed by Sabor in 1792. The family members mostly served a military- officer role in the Military Frontier, while others were traders and entrepreneurs. In Middle Dalmatia, in the territory of Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Split-Makarska, specifically Kamen of Split, in 1659 were recorded surnames Modrić and Modro. In 1673, in Sućuraj on Hvar was recorded Mihovil Modrić. In the territory of Cetina region they arrived from Livanjsko or Duvanjsko field. In 1698 was mentioned family of Ivan Modrić in banderium of harambaša Jakov Jadrijević who fled from Podhum near Livno to Glavice near Sinj. In 1709, in the same banderium was recorded family of Ilija Modro. In 1710, in the territory of Vrlika was recorded family of Nikola Modrić Petrov (son of Petar), and again in 1725 in the list of believers of the Split Archdiocese, where they still lived in near village Ježević until WWII. In Northern Croatia, a 1519 record of nobles from Zagreb and Križevac county possibly mentions Mirko and Andrija Modrić or Mudrić from Cunovec (Mwdrich de Czunovecz), a settlement which existed until the 19th century. In 1647, Ivan Modrić was mentioned among nobles who received estate in Pišćanovec and Čurilovec according to the charter by Ivan III Drašković, and probably the same Ivan Modrić wrote a letter in Varaždin to Juraj Otmić in 1673. In Međimurje and Palinovec were recorded Modrich and Modrics in 1788, in Črečen Modrits in 1844, and in Jurčevec Modrics in 1900.

He also undertook missions in Canada . He received the Legion of Honor at the age of 28. In 1876, Jules Garnier filed a patent for the industrial exploitation of New Caledonian nickel and participated in the creation of a company (the future Société Le Nickel - SLN), by having the first nickel plant at Pointe-Chaleix in Nouméa. That same year, he filed a patent in February describing the principles and uses of ferronickel. In the meantime, as commander of a battalion of volunteers, he took part in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. He was involved in attacks on bridges, railroads, and so on. He experimented with one of his inventions, torpedoes (50 kg) fueled by flash cotton, with effects as devastating as they were useless in a war lost too quickly. Garnier participated in the defense of Dijon. He led some reflections on urban transport in the capital, proposing construction of an underground train. Later, he did some research in the field both explosives (experienced during the conflict of 1871) and better use of steam (compound system, steam machine gun). Several trips to North America and more specifically to Canada with his son Gilbert Garnier allow him to demonstrate his patents and processes. Since the nickel steel industry is developing, mining companies in Canada work with Jules Garnier because of his reputation. He was involved in the creation of entire plants as consulting engineer for the Canadian Copper Company (forerunner of the Inco mining group).Interview with Alexis Garnier about his relative. https://web.archive.org/web/20081201032811/http://www.forez- info.com/encyclopedie/traverses/alexis_garnier__mon_aieul_jules_garnier__747.html (Archived 1 December 2006, in French) Engineer-inventor, Jules Garnier is also known for the importance and diversity of his writings. Beyond the \\"simple\\" publication of research results and/or various projects, Jules Garnier was also a writer. He published a very large number of articles in the fields of science and technology, but also in journals of geography. His bibliography consists of more than 30 references, including his travelogues, his reference book \\"Le Fer\\" (i.e. \\"Iron\\"), and several inventions in various fields. After 1870, he even became secretary of the Geographical Society of Paris. Jules Garnier died in Gorbio on 8 March 1904. He is buried in the cemetery of Crêt de Roch in Saint-Étienne. Jules Garnier still remains for New Caledonia, a key character in the origin of its industrial development.

For example, if a person is the beneficiary of a disability insurance policy, that person becomes entitled to benefits upon becoming disabled. Proof of disability is an operative fact, because it establishes the beneficiary's legal right to receive the insurance benefits. Any fact that tends to prove or disprove the existence of another fact is classified as an evidential fact. An operative fact may also be an evidential fact, but it is not necessarily the case that it will be evidential. Similarly, additional evidence may be required before a legal relationship is proved. For example, if one person strikes another person that fact may create legal right to recover damages for battery, thus potentially establishing a legal relationship. That same act could be introduced as evidence of the defendant's state of mind. In litigation, both operative and material facts are relevant to a decision to be made by the court. Thus, all operative facts are also classified as material facts. The term \\"operative fact\\" as a descriptor of the factual premise to a legal conclusion appears rooted in Hohfeldian legal semiotics.

Life Tatiana Rosenthal was born in St Petersburg in 1885. A supporter of the Russian Revolution of 1905, she then went to Switzerland, where she studied medicine at the University of Zurich. After gaining her medical diploma, she went to Vienna, where she was a member of Sigmund Freud's Wednesday Group in Vienna, the forerunner of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society. In 1911 she published a paper on the Danish writer Karen Michaelis, 'The dangerous age of Karen Michaelis in light of psychoanalysis', which pioneered the use of psychoanalysis in literary criticism. At the beginning of World War I, Rosenthal returned to St. Petersburg, where she worked as a neurologist at Vladimir Bekhterev’s Brain Institute. Bekhterev, though not himself converted to psychoanalysis, appointed Rosenthal as the head of the outpatient clinic, and allowed her to treat neurotic patients there with psychoanalysis. In that way, she became the founder of psychoanalysis in St Petersburg. Interested in the psychology of art, Rosenthal published a 1920 paper which tried to explain Dostoevsky’s creative writing by his personal suffering. While in St Petersburg, she had a child.

Holly originated from the monsoon trough that extended eastward from its original position in mid- August 1984\\\\. Over a period of several days, the system slowly became better organized as it tracked westward, although the system did not initially develop a well-defined center. On August 15, a tropical depression was declared, and on the next day, the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Holly. Holly slowly gained strength, becoming a typhoon on August 17 as it passed near Okinawa. The typhoon turned northwest and then north as it rounded a subtropical ridge. At noon on August 19, Holly attained its peak intensity of . Shortly after its peak, Holly accelerated northeast due to the westerlies in the general direction of the Korean Peninsula. Land interaction with South Korea triggered a weakening trend, and after entering the Sea of Japan, Holly began to transition into an extratropical cyclone. Thunderstorm activity quickly decreased near the center, and by August 21, Holly had completed its extratropical transition. In advance of the typhoon, ferry service between Jeju and mainland South Korea was called off, prompting 800 fishing boats to seek shelter. Throughout South Korea, nine people were killed or missing and hundreds lost their homes. At least 10 fishing boats were destroyed and hundreds of hectares of farmland were inundated. Across the Ryukyu Islands, 15,000 air travelers were stranded, including 14,000 from Okinawa when 23 flights were canceled. Between the Ryukyu Islands and the rest of Japan, ferry service was discontinued for two days, which resulted in 21,000 stranded passengers. Overall, one person was killed due to high waves in Nagasaki Prefecture, nine were listed as missing, and eleven were wounded. In all, damage was estimated at US$1 million. The extratropical remnants caused significant flooding in the Russian Far East. Water levels around Khabarovsk rose 10 m (33 ft) along the Amur River, resulting in the evacuation of 64 families, although 2,000 cows and pigs remain stranded. Elsewhere, in Arkhara, a dam along the Amur River burst, which caused the worst flooding in the region since 1928 and resulted in the evacuation of many isolated children by helicopter. Meteorological history While Tropical Storm Gerald was forming in the South China Sea, the Western Pacific monsoon trough extended eastward in the middle of August 1984\\\\. By noon on August 13, the monsoon trough extended from Tropical Depression 9W to just northwest of Guam, and within 36 hours, this trough moved northwest and became sharper, with surface barometric pressures of and winds of . Organization of the convection gradually improved and satellite imagery indicated that a surface low was forming. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) at 15:15 UTC on August 14\\\\. At 00:00 UTC on the next day, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigated the system, measuring a pressure of . This prompted the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) to upgrade the low into a tropical depression. At noon on August 15, synoptic data suggested that the system did not have a closed circulation; however, ship reports suggested that it was producing gale-force winds at the time. Early on August 16, a second aircraft investigated the system, finding a pressure of and a closed circulation. This promoted the JTWC to classify the system as Tropical Storm Holly while the JMA upgraded Holly directly to severe tropical storm. Despite its large size, Holly slowly deepened, and was upgraded to a typhoon by the JMA at noon on August 17. Nevertheless, Holly remained fairly disorganized, with aircraft observing light winds near the center and the strongest winds located in a rainband northeast from the center. It was not until August 18 that aircraft observed surface wind gusts of over . At 00:00 UTC that day, the JTWC upgraded Holly into a typhoon while the storm was located near Okinawa. After initially tracking westward under the influence of a subtropical ridge, Holly turned northwest for about a 30 hour period before turning north as it rounded the western side of the ridge. At noon on August 19, the JTWC reported that Holly attained its peak intensity of while the JMA reported that Holly reached its highest winds of and a minimum pressure of . Shortly after its peak, Holly turned northeast while also accelerating in response to the westerlies, which sent the storm across the Korean Straits on a collision course with the Korean Peninsula. Land interaction with South Korea resulted in a weakening trend, with both the JTWC and JMA downgrading Holly to a tropical storm. Upon entering the Sea of Japan, Holly began to transition into an extratropical cyclone. The low-level circulation quickly became exposed from the center, and what little convection remained was far removed from the center, and attached to a cold front. At 06:00 UTC on August 21, Holly was declared extratropical by the JMA, with the JTWC following suit 12 hours later. Two days later, the JMA had ceased tracking the cyclone altogether. Impact Typhoon warnings were posted for Cheju Island and up to inland across South Korea. Ferry service between Cheju and the mainland was canceled due to the impeding threat of rough seas, prompting 800 fishing boats to seek shelter. Throughout South Korea, nine people were killed or missing and hundreds lost their homes. At least 10 fishing boats were demolished, hundreds of hectares of farmland were flooded, and several homes were damaged. In some places of the southern portion of the island of Kyushu, forecasters anticipated that up to of rain could fall. Across the Ryukyu Islands, 15,000 air travelers were stranded. In Naha, the main city in Okinawa, an estimated 14,000 tourists were stranded when all 23 scheduled flights to Japanese main islands were canceled. Between the Ryukyu Islands and the Japanese mainland, ferry service was called off for two days, resulting in 21,000 stranded passengers. Further north, in Itsuki, 31 people lost their homes. Forty-one flights were cancelled in Miyazaki Prefecture, which caused an additional 4,200 stranded travelers. Overall, the storm dropped heavy rainfall across much of Japan. A peak rainfall total of occurred at Ebino, including in a day. Within 24 hours, of rain fell in Mount Yonaha, including an hour. Moreover, a wind gust of was recorded in Mount Yonaha while further south, wind gusts of were recorded in Okinawa. Nation- wide, one person was killed due to high waves in Nagasaki, nine were listed as missing, and eleven were wounded, including nine in Okinawa and the western prefectures of Kumamoto, Nagaski, Yamaguchi, and Hiroshima while two in Aichi Province sustained injuries after strong winds toppled a tree. Property damage was estimated at US$1 million. The extratropical remnants caused significant flooding in the Russian Far East. Water levels around Khabarovsk along the Amur River rose to , marking one of the few times the river reached that high since records began in the area in 1895. Due to the subsequent flooding, 64 families were evacuated, although 2,000 cows and pigs were left stranded. Further west, in Arkhara, a dam along the Amur River bursts its banks along a stretch, resulting in the river's worst flooding since 1928 and the evacuation of many stranded children in helicopters.

The two historical organizations, the Mission Peak Heritage Foundation (MPHF) and Washington Township Historical Society (WTHS), formed the Museum of Local History Guild to focus on education, archival research and preservation of the historical resources of Washington Township. The Washington Township was created in 1853 from the southwestern part of Alameda County. For many decades, Washington Township consisted of agricultural fields dotted with eight towns, many now part of Fremont and some with local historians publishing their stories. The eight towns were the town of Newark, the two towns that became Union City, viz., Alvarado and Decoto, and the five towns that became Fremont, viz., Centerville, Niles (Vallejo Mills), Mission San Jose, Irvington, and Warm Springs. Cecilia Weed was one of the people who led the effort to create the museum. Philip Holmes was the museum's first president. The historical collection of Dr. Robert Fisher found a home here, which includes local record books, documents and 7500 photographs. The museum is located in a historic fire station building which was built in 1954 for the Mission San Jose Fire District. Volunteer fire- fighters operated the fire station until the City of Fremont took over. It served as a fire station until 1994, then was remodeled and was leased to the Mission Peak Heritage Foundation and The Washington Township Historical Society for use as a museum. Volunteers have landscaped the garden around the museum. The Washington Township Museum of Local History offers tours for classes and other groups at museum and at the Higuera Adobe Historical Park. Walking tours explore local history from the settlement of Washington Township through the development of the Tri-cities: Fremont, Newark and Union City.

Portland, Oregon: The Morning Oregonian, February 20, 1927.  Formative years  Born in Oxford, Ohio on July 28, 1858 (alternate birth date June 29, 1859), Carrie Belle Wilson was the oldest child of Allie (Myers) Wilson and David Wilson, a songwriter and music educator. Her mother was also a musician. As the American Civil War was waged across a major portion of the United States during the early 1860s, Carrie Wilson was studying music with her father. By the time the war was over, she had made her debut. A child prodigy, she sang for a convention of musicians in Millville, Ohio, when she was just seven years old. According to biographer Jacob Henry Hull, she was also \\"a brilliant pianist and accompanist from her girlhood days.\\" In 1872, she and her parents and five siblings moved to Paris, Illinois, where her father founded the Paris Musical Institute. Three years later, at the age of 16, she published an anthem – the first of many compositions she would pen over the years. By 1876, she was serving as the organist and choir director for the Paris Presbyterian Church.  Family life and professional music career  On July 21, 1880, Carrie Belle Wilson married amateur playwright Allyn G. Adams. She then relocated with her husband to Terre Haute, Indiana in 1882. Their son, Stanley, was born on October 18, 1887. From 1887 to 1896, she was employed as a professor of music at the Indiana State Normal School (now Indiana State University), and also chaired the music department there. In addition, she served as conductor of The Choral, Rose Polytechnic Glee and Treble Clef clubs and The Terre Haute Oratorio Society. In 1893, she published her musical play, \\"The National Flower.\\" By the time of her retirement from the university three years later, she had completed work on 12 cantatas, 4,000 anthems, and 28 operettas. Following her husband's retirement, she relocated with him in 1920 to Portland, Oregon to be closer to her son, Stanley. After 16 years together in Portland, her husband widowed her in 1936. In addition to playing the pipe organ for the First Congregational Church (Portland, Oregon), she became an associate editor with The Choir Herald, and continued to compose music into her early 80s. According to a 1936 article in Time magazine, \\"In Portland, Ore. last week Mrs. Adams sent off to her publishers four new anthems, baked a jelly cake, [and] celebrated her 77th birthday.\\"\\"Music: Anthem Lady.\\" New York, New York: Time, August 3, 1936. Among the works completed in later life was the cantata, \\"The Easter Triumph.\\" Completed in 1940, it was published posthumously.  Illness, death and interment  Suffering from a heart condition, Carrie Belle (Wilson) Adams was admitted to a private hospital in Portland, Oregon, for treatment sometime in late November or early December 1940. She remained there for several weeks until her death on December 15, 1940. She was 81 at the time of her passing. According to a statement made to The Oregonian by a representative of her longtime publisher, Lorenz Publishing Co., \\"Adams' compositions [were being performed] each Sunday by an average of 300,000 choir singers\\" at the time of her death. Dr. Raymond B. Walker, the pastor of Portland's First Congregational Church officiated at her funeral services, which were held at J. P. Finley & Son on December 18, 1940. She was survived by her brother, Charles E. Wilson, and sister, Merle Wilson, who were both residing in Portland, as well as a daughter-in-law, nieces, nephews, and grandchildren. Her son, Stanley, had preceded her in death six months earlier.  Titles of works created  1890s: * \\"The National Flower\\" (cantata in three acts).

She has been credited with \\"...pioneer[ing] the statistical techniques which continue to ground the trenchant nature/nurture debates about intelligence in American psychology.\\" Early life and education Burks was born on December 22, 1902 in New York City, New York, to Jesse and Frances Burks. When she was a child, her family moved to many different locations before eventually settling in California. There, she started her undergraduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, where she worked with Edward C. Tolman. Under Tolman's supervision, she became skilled at conducting statistical analyses based on his research on rat breeding. In her senior year, she transferred to Stanford University, where she began studying under Lewis Terman. She received her bachelor's degree from Stanford in 1924. Terman was so impressed with her performance as an undergraduate that he recommended that she immediately enroll in graduate school. She then did exactly that, enrolling in Stanford's Ph.D. program in psychology, where she worked with Terman on his \\"Genetic Studies of Genius\\" project. Career In the early 1930s, Burks worked as a consulting psychologist at various schools in the city of Pasadena, California. From 1933 to 1935, she worked at the Institute of Child Welfare at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1935, she was a member of a Social Science Research Council committee, on which she was tasked with compiling research on personality traits relative to competition and cooperation. Also in 1935, she was given a fellowship by the General Education Board to study psychology in Europe, where she collaborated with Jean Piaget, Carl Jung, and Charlotte Buhler. In 1936, she returned to the United States, where she was named a research associate at the Carnegie Institute of Washington at Cold Spring Harbor. While there, she was tasked with analyzing the utility of human pedigrees in the Institute's Genetics Record Office. She also supervised Claude Shannon during a summer research program at the Institute in 1939, where Shannon conducted the research on genetic algebra that led to his dissertation. Also in 1939, she was named the chairwoman of an \\"abnormal human characters\\" section meeting at the Seventh International Congress of Genetics, making her one of only two women to be so named. She became a research associate at Columbia University in 1940. In 1943, she received a Guggenheim Fellowship for 1943–1944, but she died before her fellowship could begin. After her death, she was named to the 1944 edition of American Men of Science. Research Burks is particularly known for her 1928 Ph.D. dissertation, which examined the relative effects of genetics and environment on the IQ scores of foster children in California. This dissertation, completed at Stanford University, has been described as \\"a pioneering study in the field of behavioural genetics\\". Her dissertation concluded that between 75 and 80% of variation in IQ scores was due to genetic factors. The data would be used by Sewall Wright for path analysis of heritability issues.Wright 1931, \\"Statistical Methods in Biology\\"; Wright 1934, \\"The Method of Path Coefficients\\", Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 5: 161-215 The study was cited favorably by Arthur Jensen in support of his hereditarian views, but it has been criticized for having a biased sample and for its limited measurements of environmental factors. While working as a graduate student at Berkeley, she was one of Terman's research assistants on his \\"Genetic Studies of Genius\\" project from 1924 to 1929, and served as the lead author of its third volume, The Promise of Youth: Follow-up Studies of a Thousand Gifted Children, which was published in 1930. These studies followed up a group of children who had been identified as being highly intelligent early in life, and found that they were still exceptionally intelligent many years later. At the time of her death, she had recently received a Guggenheim Fellowship to study identical twins adopted apart.Terman, L. (1943). \\"Barbara Stoddard Burks 1902-1943\\". Eugenical News, 28, 3-5. Personal life Burks married Herman Ramsperger, a National Research Fellow in chemistry at Stanford, in 1927; they remained married until his death in 1932. In 1943, she became engaged to longtime friend Robert Cook, but she died before they could be married. Death Burks, then a research associate at Columbia University, died on May 25, 1943, when she \\"either fell or jumped to her death from the George Washington Bridge\\" in New York City, New York. King et al. (1996) cite letters in the Terman archive to the effect that \\"She had also become engaged to marry Robert Cook but, according to her mother, had continually struggled with depression following a “severe nervous breakdown” in 1942 (Burks, F. W., 1943).\\" (Paul J. Nahin has suggested that Vannevar Bush's decision to close the eugenics program at Cold Spring Harbor in 1940, may have caused depression, which then led to suicide.)

The R marque refers to \\"Refined\\", since Volvo markets R-designated vehicles as being the most performance-oriented trim level. The first vehicle in the Volvo R marque lineup, the Volvo 850 R, was introduced in 1995, followed by the Volvo S70 R and Volvo V70 R in 1998. A related performance trim line, Volvo R-Design, was launched for 2008. Volvo's high-performance vehicles are now developed by their Polestar division, although most Volvo models are offered in an R-Design trim level. R marque models Volvo 850 T-5R Further information: Volvo 850 T-5R Volvo 850 T5-R was the first Volvo branded with the R marque. For 1995, the special limited edition 850 T-5R was offered, and was a commercial success, leading Volvo to produce a second run in 1996. Originally, it was to be called 850 Plus 5. The vehicle was based on the 850 Turbo, utilizing the B5234T4 engine with a special ECU (Bosch #628 in U.S and #629 in EU) that added an additional 2 psi (0.1 bar) of turbocharger boost pressure, giving the engine an extra 18 hp (13 kW; 18 PS) for a total of 243 hp (181 kW) and 250 lb⋅ft (340 N⋅m) of torque. The engine was mated to a 4-speed automatic transmission or 5-speed manual transmission, the latter of which was not available in the United States. The T-5R was renowned as a sleeper car; despite its boxy, understated appearance, it boasted a drag coefficient of 0.29 and was capable of accelerating from 0 to 60 mph (97 km/h) in 6.8 - 7.0 seconds (depending on transmission and body type). The top speed was electronically limited to 152.2 mph (244.9 km/h). The vehicle came standard with Pirelli P-Zero tyres, providing lateral grip of 0.88 g. The engine tuning was co-developed with Porsche, and the transmission and other powertrain components. Porsche also aided in designing some of the interior, such as the Alcantara seat inserts. These cars came as standard with nearly every feature available, only a handful of options - such as heated rear seats - were available. On the North American market only two options could be chosen, a trunk-mounted Alpine 6-CD changer and no-cost 16\\" wheels for a smoother, more comfortable ride and driveability in snow when using all- season tires. Volvo 850 R Further information: Volvo 850 R sedan and a wagon. In the spring of 1996, Volvo introduced a new high-performance Volvo 850 as a replacement for the hugely successful limited edition T-5R. Volvo decided there should be no direct successor to the T-5R, but due to its success, Volvo decided to develop a new high-performance model. The new car, based on the T-5R, was called the 850 R, which again came in either saloon or sport wagon editions. Volvo S70 R Further information: Volvo S70 R The Volvo S70 R was produced for the 1998 model year. An S70 'R' version was introduced in 1997 for the 1998 model year and offered the highest performance of all S70 models. The engine was rated at and for models fitted with a five- speed manual gearbox and limited slip differential. Models fitted with a four- speed automatic gearbox were rated at and . Only FWD versions were produced. The model was only available in Europe and few select other countries. Volvo S60 R Further information: Volvo S60 R The Volvo S60 R was the replacement for the Volvo S70 R First introduced in 2004, Volvo's S60 R used a Haldex all-wheel-drive system mated to a / inline-5. The 2004–2005 models came with a 6-speed manual transmission, or an available 5-speed automatic which allowed only torque in 1st and 2nd gears. The 2006–2007 models came with a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission (which was no longer torque- restricted). Volvo V70 R Further information: Volvo V70 R (1998-2000) First generation Volvo V70 R As the replacement for the popular 850 T-5R and 850 R, the V70 R was unveiled in May 1997. Similar to the previous generation R models it featured a unique leather/alcantara interior with diamond stitching on the seats. Further styling touches were a special front bumper, blue gauge faces for the instrument cluster, two special colours and special alloy wheels. All US cars were equipped with 16 inch alloy wheels, other markets had 17 inch wheels available at extra cost or as standard equipment. Standard equipment was substantially upgraded over normal models with a few options available such as a trunk mounted CD-changer, Volvo's self developed Road and Traffic Information (RTI) navigation system, or an upgraded stereo system. Further information: Volvo V70 R (2004-2007) Second generation Volvo V70 R As with the previous generation, Volvo offered a high-performance variant called the V70 R AWD. Based on the PCC2 concept car from 2001, the model was unveiled at the 2002 Paris Motor Show on 26 September. Released in 2003, the model pioneered many firsts for Volvo. It was only available with a Haldex based all-wheel drive system and a 2.5L turbocharged five cylinder engine rated at and of torque. This allowed for a time of 5.9 seconds. It had an electronically limited top speed of 250 kilometres per hour (155 mph). The R was available with a six-speed manual or a five-speed automatic transmission. The 2005 facelift saw the five-speed automatic replaced by a more modern six-speed unit. Large brakes made by Brembo provided high- performance braking capabilities in line with the car's high-performance characteristics. The V70 R came as standard with Volvo's 4C multi-mode suspension developed with suspension experts Öhlins. The driver could choose from three different settings to vary the car's handling depending on driving style and conditions.

Key cases Animal Liberation ACT v Conservator of Flora and Fauna [2014] ACAT 35 In 2014, Animal Liberation ACT contested the decision of the ACT’s Conservator of Flora and Fauna to issue licenses that would allow for the killing of over 1,600 kangaroos in nature reserves in the ACT region. The Animal Defenders Office represented Animal Liberation in the case at the ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal, arguing that the scientific evidence in favour of the culls was not strong enough and had been presented by a potentially biased source, and that there were other, non-lethal options available to address to perceived problem of kangaroo overgrazing. The case was decided in favour of the Conservator, with a resulting 1,519 kangaroos and 514 in-pouch joeys subsequently killed.Voiceless 2015, “Case Study 20: The ACT’s annual kangaroo kill”, The Animal Law Toolkit, 2nd edition, p.46 Law reform The ADO frequently makes submissions to governmental inquiries that directly or indirectly concern animal issues.

Unlike that of other beard orchids, there is no prominent ridge between the eye spots. Description Calochilus therophilus is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single fleshy, channelled, linear to lance-shaped, dark green leaf, long and wide with a reddish purple base. The leaf is fully developed when the first flower opens. Between three and fifteen dull greenish flowers with bold red stripes are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is erect, long and wide. The lateral sepals are a similar length but narrower. The petals are long and about wide. The labellum curves forwards and is long and wide with short, thick, purple calli near its base. The middle section of the labellum has coarse hairs up to and the tip has a glandular \\"tail\\" long. The column has two purple coloured \\"eyes\\" joined by a faint ridge. Flowering occurs from December to March. Taxonomy and naming Calochilus therophilus was first formally described in 2006 by David Jones and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research from a specimen collected on Black Mountain in the Australian Capital Territory. The specific epithet (therophilus) is derived from the Greek words theros meaning \\"summer\\" and philos \\"loving\\", referring to the summer flowering period of this orchid. Distribution and habitat The late beard orchid grows in open forest or with grasses and shrubs on mountain slopes.

After successfully capturing the mayorship and a majority of council seats, the female-led administration implemented several reforms with the intention of reversing the town's decline into disrepair. Background Women had received the right to vote in Oregon four years earlier, in 1912. Upset by the deteriorating condition of the town and lax law enforcement, Lola and Robert Merrick invited seven women to a card game at their house and encouraged them to run for office. They secretly spread word to others, while keeping their candidacies a secret even from their own husbands. Election Because turnout in the town's elections was typically low, and candidates were not required to declare their candidacy in advance, the women were able to capture the positions of mayor, treasurer, auditor, and all four of the six city council seats up for election. Laura Jane Stockton Starcher, wife of incumbent mayor E.E. Starcher, was elected mayor by a vote of 26–8, even as her husband only discovered that she was running on the afternoon of election day. The newly elected women were: *Mayor: Laura Starcher *Treasurer: Lola Merrick *Auditor: Betha Cherry *Councilor: Florence Brownell *Councilor: H.C. Means *Councilor: Gladys Spinning *Councilor: Stella Paulu The election received national attention, including for Mayor Starcher's inaugural address, which was described by the New York Herald as a satirical speech \\"largely devoted to a skillful dissection of mere man’s foibles, weaknesses, faults, shortcomings, vices, general uselessness, and worthlessness.\\" Administration The new administration took office in January 1917 and undertook several reforms aimed at cleaning up the town, opened a library, and appointed women to several law- enforcement posts. Starcher served eight months before suffering a nervous breakdown, and leaving office. The city council appointed a new woman as mayor, H.T. Duncan, only for her to resign after a month, and then appointed the newly elected councilwoman Stella Paulu to serve the remainder of Starcher's original term. Paulu was reelected in her own right with about 80% of the vote in an open campaign in 1918 for a full two-year term. Legacy None of the women originally elected in 1916 sought reelection in 1920, and after the 1920 election all of the town's offices were again held by men. A similar secret campaign created an all-female city council in Yoncalla, Oregon, and replaced the unsuspecting mayor with his wife in 1920. In 1933 Bertha Cherry, who was elected auditor in 1916, successfully ran for Mayor of Umatilla. The election is noted at a museum in Umatilla, and formed the basis for a 2004 children's book and a local play called \\"Operation Clean Sweep.\\" References Category:1916 in women's history Category:1910s in Oregon Category:December 1916 events Category:1916 Oregon elections Category:Umatilla County, Oregon * Category:Women's suffrage in the United States ","title":"Petticoat Revolution"},{"id":"57751749","text":"Chongsheng Temple () is a Buddhist temple located at the foot of Mount Xuefeng in Dahu Township, Minhou County, Fujian, China.

Owned by Gray Television, it is a sister station to CBS affiliate KOLN (channel 10) and its semi-satellite KGIN (channel 11) in Grand Island, and Superior-licensed dual NBC/MyNetworkTV affiliate KSNB-TV, channel 4 (which are simulcast on KOLN/KGIN's second digital subchannels). KCWH-LD and KOLN share studios and transmitter facilities on North 40th Street in Lincoln. For most of its history, KCWH-LD, under the call sign K18CD, served as a translator for KSNB- TV, whose signal is weak in Lincoln. In 2018, Gray converted the station into a standalone CW+ affiliate, simulcast on the third subchannel of then-Sonlife Broadcasting Network affiliate KNHL (channel 5) in Hastings (which was acquired by Gray in 2019 and became a satellite of KSNB) and the second subchannel of Fox affiliate KIIT-CD (channel 11) in North Platte. NBC programming (via KSNB) remains available in Lincoln on KOLN's second digital subchannel. History The original construction permit for a translator station on channel 18 in Lincoln was granted on January 4, 1988, and issued the call sign K18CD; the station was a translator for KSNB-TV (channel 4) in Superior. K18CD filed for a license to cover on August 9, 1999, which was granted on September 27. At the time, KSNB was a Fox affiliate, simulcast with KTVG (channel 17) in Grand Island. By 2007, K18CD was receiving its programming from KTVG instead of KSNB. The time brokerage agreement between Pappas Telecasting and KSNB's owner, Colins Broadcasting, expired on November 30, 2009. As a result, KSNB and its two translators, including K18CD, shut down on December 1. On December 19, 2011, the station converted to digital operations as K18CD-D. By then, the Colins stations were broadcasting intermittently with programming from the Three Angels Broadcasting Network.FCC: COLINS BROADCASITNG CORPORATION, KSNB-DT TV4, Superior, Nebraska, Quarterly List of Issue – Responsive Programming (Third Quarter 2012 – July 1, 2012 thru September 30, 2012) On November 21, 2012, it was announced that Gray Television, the owners of KOLN/KGIN, would acquire KSNB for $1.25 million.Gray Lines Up 2nd Station In Lincoln, NE, TVNewsCheck, November 26, 2012.

On June 11, 2014, Gray moved the market's NBC affiliation from Hastings-based KHAS-TV (channel 5, now KNHL) to KSNB and the second subchannels of KOLN and KGIN. KHAS' owner, Hoak Media, had recently merged with Gray, and original plans called for it to be sold to Excalibur Broadcasting to satisfy duopoly rules. Gray would have operated the station under a local marketing agreement. However, increased FCC scrutiny of LMAs prompted Gray to shut down KHAS. KSNB's MyNetworkTV and MeTV programming moved to its second digital subcarrier, as well as a third digital channel on KOLN and KGIN, with all channels being broadcast in high definition. Over-the-air viewers actually benefited from the switch, as it gave NBC a full-market affiliate for the first time ever. For most of the broadcasting era, WOWT in Omaha (a sister station to KSNB and KOLN/KGIN) had doubled as Lincoln's NBC affiliate as well. On October 20, 2017, the broadcast tower for K18CD-D, which was shared with Fox affiliate KFXL-TV (channel 51), collapsed, rendering the translator out of commission.http://journalstar.com/business/local/foot-communications-tower- collapses-in-north- lincoln/article_4ee94047-79c8-5a9c-8136-57323310d0df.html#tncms-source=home- top-story-1 On May 18, 2018, the call letters were changed to KCWH-LD.

According to jewishgen.org, common usage was Gołogóry while the place belonged to Poland, then Gologory while in the Soviet Union, with Holohory being the current accepted spelling in modern Ukraine. The population is approximately 658 people. Holohory has a rural council as local self-government. The name literally means \\"bare hills\\". Geography Holohory is located within the wooded Holohory hill range on the bank of the Zolota Lypa River where its right tributary, , flows in. History The earliest settlement in Holohory date back to 1099 and are first mentioned in the Laurentian Codex in 1144 and in 1232 – in the Galician–Volhynian Chronicle. At first, Holohory belonged to the Zvenigorod principality, and from 1140 – to Galician principality. Mongol invasion of Rus' took place here for centuries, resulting in destroyed structures built out of wood and after these raids only some fortifications were left standing. The Holohory castle was first built of broken stone (the exact date of construction is unknown), after the damage done by the Golden Horde it was rebuilt in 1441. The castle had hidden tunnels that led to exits in the forest. These tunnels were fairly spacious and have survived until recent times. A famous battle of Bohdan Khmelnytsky took place here in 1792. During the Soviet Union in 1950s, its remaining stones were used for the construction of a road for a collective farm (kolkhoz). Saint Mark Statue in Holohory Holohory revived and became a major trade center from the 15th century and attained the Magdeburg rights (in 1365 and in 1469). In the 17th- century due to increased trade, the Jewish population has increased. In every community, there was a position of Rabbi whose duties consisted of maintaining the list of vital records and supervision of education. Thus in 1895 Maurice de Hirsch established a private Jewish primary school, which in 1901 became a technical school open to children of all creeds. Its students made tin cans for sale in exchange for their education. After the World War II the village was damaged and a lot of the human potential lost. Between 1939 and 1940 a lot of the local intelligentsia including the Poles (Masurians) who were settlers from Poland were deported to Gulag in Siberia. During the German occupation Reichskommissariat Ukraine 300 youths were taken as Ostarbeiter and 700 Jews were killed in a Ghetto on the outskirts of Lyatske village. Between 1945–1950, Ukrainian patriots, particularly those who did not want to join the kolkhoz were packed into freight wagons and from the railroad in Krasoe village were sent to the Far East: Irkutsk, Karaganda. Others left the village to escape the NKVD prisoner massacres or joined the UPA Ukrainian Insurgent Army. Gologory cemetery In 1968, the population decreased to 2,339 people and in 1983, to 737 people. After the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine, a ceremony of interment of the remains of Ukrainian soldiers of The Galician Division (14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Galician)), found in a vacant lot and buried with military honors at the entrance to the cemetery. They built a monument to the victims of Mass killings under communist regimes (1939–1953) in its place. The Holy Trinity Church (built in 1630) was reopened in 1991 and is active today.

The historic chapter house of the Basilica of Santo Domingo was the place where the University of San Marcos, officially the first Peruvian university and the oldest university in the Americas, began to function in the 16th century.  History  Monk holding clapper of bell in the belfry of the Basilica of Santo Domingo, circa 1923 The construction of the Convent of Santo Domingo took about 50 years. Its construction began during the foundation of Lima and concluded at the end of 16th century. It was the provincial Friar Tomás de San Martín, who began to carry out the construction of the first church of the Order, being later the superior Friar Sebastián de Ayllón that received aid of the King, finishing the work in the year of 1578. The first building was completely destroyed by the earthquake of 1678. A new church was erected by Dominican architect Diego Maroto, and the convent was rebuilt, which had six cloisters and several courtyards before the earthquake of 1687. The church was rebuilt from the transept to the choir, the arches were changed and the number of windows was expanded. As a result, the church acquired breadth, simplicity and uniformity. The materials used in the construction were adobe, brick and calicanto, among others. The quincha served to lighten the weight, to make the structure more flexible and to increase the resistance to the earthquakes, so frequent in this region. Because the earthquakes of 1687 and 1746 the set necessitated further modifications, such as the reconstruction of the tower, the main portal of the church and part of the convent, which included changes in the distribution of the cloisters, which is currently can appreciate. The church was elevated to the category of Minor Basilica in 1930. The structure of the church was some damaged ten years later by an earthquake and restored in the later years. Years later different environments and the convent's orchard would be lost, when the north section of the apple was demolished, that gave to the Rímac River.  The church   Exterior  The exterior of the church was originally covered by bossage, as can be seen still at the base of the bell tower. A primitive portal, two bodies and three streets, was carved in the second half of the 17th century. In later years a new portal would rise because of the earthquakes that destroyed the church. The church was largely restored after the Earthquake of Lima and Callao of 1940, that supposed the application of cement in the walls and the restoration of the portal and the facade of the church. = Bell tower = Cloister and bell tower The first bell tower of the church, of baroque style and three bodies, was designed together with the church by Diego Maroto in the second half of the 17th century and was destroyed during the earthquake of 28 of October 1746. The present bell tower was conceived and designed by the Viceroy Manuel d'Amat i de Junyent in 1766 in the Rococo style, being in the bottom of octagonal form. It is divided into a lower body and two tall bodies with small balconies on corbels. At the top is the sculpture of a figure holding a trumpet, representing the angel who announces the Final Judgment. The total height is 46 meters, and is considered one of the most characteristic elements of the religious complex. The base of the bell tower still preserves the bossage that once covered the facade of the first church. The total height is 46 meters. Its original color is white and pink, becoming the most characteristic and striking element of the religious set.  Description of its interior  The church is divided in a main nave covered by rib vault and two lateral naves of interconnected and lantern chapels, in which also is the lateral portal of the church, the access to the tower and, next to the epistle, an entrance to the main cloister of the convent. The main nave has an additional entrance to the feet preceded by the narthex (space where religious instruction was given to the natives or those who were not baptized), on which is the high choir of the church. = Choir = In the chorus of the church is the one that is considered the oldest ashlar masonry of the country. Completely worked in wood of cedar brought from Nicaragua, it is of Renaissance style, with Mannerist elements. It has two sets of stalls: the first level was modernly sculpted, with the design based on the old. The originals are in the back, bearing in the back carvings of saints and other biblical characters. In the central part of the ashlar is the main seat of the prior of the convent, with carvings of Saint Dominic and Saint Francis of Assisi founders of the Dominicans and The Franciscans, respectively. The seat of the choir was carved by several artists among which Juan Martínez de Arrona (1562 -1635) would be outstanding. = Nave = Chapel Altarpiece and apse As mentioned previously, the enclosure is formed by three naves, of which the lateral ones are composed by chapels in which are located several reredos. On the side portal from left to right we find the following reredos or altarpieces: Next to the Gospel, the altarpieces of St. Hyacinth of Poland, Saint Joseph, Saint Dominic and Our Lady of the Rosary; and on the side of the Epistle those of the Peruvian Saints, the Souls, St. Thomas Aquinas, Sacred Heart, Chapel of the Lord of Justice and the Chapel of the Co-fraternity of the Rosary. The most important is the altarpiece of the Peruvian Saints, of neoclassical style, located in the right transept of the church. In the center is the effige of St. Rose of Lima, to the left side this of St. Martin de Porres and to the right St. John Macias, that in spite of being born in the Iberian peninsula, is considered Peruvian because he developed his religious life in Lima. At the bottom of these images are reliquaries where the remains of each saint mentioned above rest. In the lower part of the altar there is a sculpture of St. Rose of Lima, made by the Maltese artist Melchor Caffá in 1669, on behalf of the Pope Clement IX to give it to the Dominican fathers for his beatification. In the left transept is the altarpiece dedicated to the Patroness of Lima and titular of the church, Our Lady of the Rosary. In neoclassical style, it conserves in its main niche the effigy of this invocation \\"que fue la primera de este Reyno\\" (that she was the first one of this Kingdom). According to tradition it was given to Lima by King Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. It was specially venerated by Rose of Lima and Martin de Porres, among others, and was crowned solemnly in the year 1927. = Presbytery = The altar is of neoclassical style with decoration in turquoise and gold.  The Convent   Chapter house  It is called Chapter because all the friars were gathered by chapters in order to choose their authorities and solve their problems, the room was made in the 17th century, in Baroque style by the Friar Diego Maroto member of the Order, architect born in Camarena (current province of Toledo, Spain). In 1551 in this same stage the University of San Marcos is inaugurated. Its existing tribune or chatedra is used in the 17th century to dictate classes or support thesis, made in the baroque style, has solomonic columns, presents a painting of St. Thomas Aquinas, to the front is a small reredos where the Christ of the agony is venerated, before which Martin de Porres was ecstatic and embraced to whom it was seen.  Guest room  The Mudéjar artesonado dated to 1580 in the guest room Here the fathers receive their authorities and relatives. The beauty of this room is its coffered ceiling in Mudéjar style dated to 1580, with three thousand pieces under pressure without nails. In this place was composed the musical notes of the National Anthem of Peru by José Bernardo Alcedo.  Main cloister  Composed of four galleries, decorated with Sevillian azulejos dating from 1604 and 1606; the paintings that present passages of the life of Saint Dominic, founder of the Dominican order, were contracted in 1608 by the provincial superior of the Order of Saint Dominic in Peru with the Sevillians Miguel Güelles, disciple of Juan de Uceda and his collaborator, Domingo Carro.Halcón, Fátima, «El pintor Juan de Uceda: sus relaciones artísticas con Lima», Laboratorio de Arte, 15 (2002), pp. 373-381, p. 379. At every corner of this cloister there is a reredos with biblical representations. The roofs of these galleries are of oak from Panama, carved in Mudéjar style; also stands out in this cloister the presence of a bronze home stoup, ordered to be built by the Dominicans, very famous for being where St. Martin de Porres, according to the writer Ricardo Palma, washed the bread of blond sugar turning it into white.

In its power are the oldest books that the Dominicans used, being among these, incunables. The Library of the Convent has around 25,000 books, among them several bibliographical collections of great value. Currently it is in the space of the old dining room.  Second cloister  Of simpler construction, in a corner you can see a sculpture in marble from Carrara (Italy) that represents the Christ of the Column. Cloister composed of two floors; the first one presents arches with bossages, and the second floor with baluster of trilobulated arcs.  Chapel of St. Martin de Porres  Lateral nave where the remains of St. Rose of Lima, St. Martin de Porres and St. John Macias rest. Place where St. Martin de Porres had its cell being destroyed by the earthquake of 1746. Due to the faithful and donations of the Church, a chapel is built in the place where he also had his nursery. It has an altar where its effige is venerated, having to its sides to Saint Dominic and St. Francis of Assisi and in the superior part the Virgin of the Rosary. In the burial rest his remains and an urn where the timbers of his bed are conserved. On the walls you can see paintings depicting Martin de Porres's miracles. In the back of the Chapel is located his bedroom. Also it emphasizes the Oratory of the saint, small atmosphere under the stairs where Martin frequently prayed and was tempted by the devil. Today you can see the great amount of gifts brought to him by his faithful devotees. At the top is a wooden cross with which it is remembered that in this same place St. Martin removed the temptations of the evil one.  Tomb of Santa Rosa de Lima  Located in the place that was an old cemetery where the first religious of the order were buried. An ossuary of several meters of depth where the bones of the time were placed. The tomb of marble where the remains of St. Rose of Lima are buried, are in the center of the environment that is decorated with mosaics. On a memorial plaque it reads: \\"Hago donación de mi cuerpo a mis hermanos Dominicos\\" (I make a donation of my body to my Dominican brothers). This phrase explains the gratitude of having belonged to the Tertiary Dominican Order. View at the entrance of the basilica  Colegio de Santo Tomás de Aquino  It was the year 1892 when the Dominican Order inaugurated the Colegio Santo Tomás de Aquino (College St. Thomas Aquinas), next to the convent of Santo Domingo, in the center of Lima. One hundred and twenty-five years later, the college retains its original location: Pasaje Rinconada de Santo Domingo 209, and still has a direct access from its main courtyard to the convent. It is the first and only educational center in Lima to be founded by the Dominican fathers, being its first director Friar Jordán Revilla. The college is marked by the history of the city. In the jirón Camaná, the street parallel to the Pasaje Rinconada de Santo Domingo, are located the facilities of the Post Office of Lima and the Iglesia Santo Domingo, in turn, in the calle Conde de Superunda, behind the college, is what was the Post and Telegraphs Office of Lima, now Museum of Gastronomy. The cloisters of the Convento de Santo Domingo, which are separated from the college only by a door, have a close relationship with the history of Education in Peru. It was founded in 1535 along with the city of Lima. There were the first classes of what is now the National University of San Marcos (UNMSM), also known as the Dean of the Americas. The frontis of Santo Tomás de Aquino has been mute witness of changes in the city. Several decades ago there was a parking car in front of the school; but later, the frontis was invaded by merchants that would form in that place the commercial center Polvos Azules. In 1997, during the management of the defunct Alberto Andrade, this center would be relocated and the space would at today the Alameda Chabuca Granda. Another recent change in the infrastructure surrounding the college was the construction of the Puente Rayitos de Sol bridge, during the management of former mayor Luis Castañeda Lossio. This bridge connects to the Chabuca Granda mall with the Santa Rosa whereabouts on the Vía de Evitamiento road. Today, a track is being built underneath the Rímac River, located opposite the college, which is part of the Vía Parque Rímac. But the Colegio Santo Tomás de Aquino has also varied with time; in the beginning the college was only for men during more than 100 years; only from the year 1994 the admission for women was accepted, becoming a mixed educational center. In addition, since 2010, Inés Rossi Rossi is the director of the college, a fact that for Aquinense college is a milestone in its history, since its creation always had only directors and belonging to the Dominican Order.

One legend involves an Indigenous person who tortured a young fawn so the screams would attract the mother. When she came near, he killed her just to realize that the Anhangá had used an illusion and he had just killed his own mother. In the mythology of the Tupi (a tribe of indigenous Brazilians) of pre-Columbian America, Anhangá are the general spirits that wandered the earth after death, tormenting the living. They could take any shape, but the deer with fiery eyes is the most known. According to some myths, Anhangá protected animals against hunters. When the prey could escape, the Tupi would say that Anhangá had protected them and helped them escape.

Christian version of the myth  The Jesuit catechists of the Indians used the word Anhangá to refer to the Christian demon. This on account of Anhangá (which means \\"old soul\\") is similar to the term \\"Anhanguera\\", which means \\"old devil\\". Meanwhile, in indigenous mythology, the one who most resembles the Christian devil is Jurupari, the evil spirit.

It was designed by Melbourne architectural firm Terry and Oakden and built from 1886 to 1888, with construction attributed to local builders/architects Perry and Hawken. The building now operates as the Gidgee Guesthouse. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  In 1862, prior to the first sale of land at Bourke, William Sly, Joseph Becker and John Kelly are thought to have constructed the first buildings in Bourke on the banks of the Darling River on what was to become Lots 245 and 6 of Section 1 and Lots 1, 2, 3 and 5 of Section 2 located next to the punt. Sly and Kelly established the first Bourke hotels on their land and Becker established a store. Sly also owned Lot 6, which is the site of the Old London Bank. Bourke was proclaimed a township in 1862 and quickly grew and developed. By 1872 the township's businesses included bakers, cordial manufacturers, tailors, jewellers, market gardeners, and a blacksmith and wheelwright.The growth and development of Bourke continued throughout the 1890s and the early decades of the twentieth century. The telegraph system of communication was supplemented with telephone in 1911 and electricity became available in the early 1930s. With development grew numerous industries. There were two Bourke breweries operating by 1881 as woolstores, and the meat processing and export industry was established in 1889. The local meat business, Bourke Meat Works closed in 1900 and it was not until 1938 that it was replaced by Tancred Brothers Pty Ltd who established an abattoir in Bourke in 1938. This business prospered and continued to operate through the 1970s. The industry and business interests in the Bourke community were supported by a growing financial and banking sector. The first bank to open in Bourke was the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney in 1865, this was followed by the Australian Joint Stock Bank in 1875, the Bank of New South Wales in 1877 and by 1881 the London Chartered Bank of Australia was established in the town, the bank was restructured in 1888 becoming the London Bank of Australia. Most of these banking operations had started their operations in rented rooms in the business district. As they firmed their position in the community most banks purchased property and constructed imposing premises from which to operate. In April 1887 the London Chartered Bank purchased Lot 6 Section 1, which had by this time passed from the ownership of William Sly to Henry and George Colless and eventually to George Allen, Charles Cowper and Jane Becker. By 1887 a prominent firm of architects from Melbourne, Terry and Oakden had been commissioned to design the new London Chartered Bank building and residence. The building was completed by 1889 and the bank operations and the then Bank Manager's family, the Gledhills, moved into the premises on 12 February 1889. The building housed the operations of the London Bank of Australia from 1889 to 1942. In 1920 the bank was amalgamated with the English, Scottish and Australian Bank (ES&A;) bank. During these years the bank and its managers became part of the fabric of the political social and business life of the Bourke community. The bank managers' families were involved in community affairs such as local sporting event, council business and charitable activities. One bank manager, Mr Gledhill, became Mayor of Bourke and inevitably the Bank as part of its business operations came to hold substantial interests in local pastoral land through the process of administering mortgages on properties. In 1942 the Bank closed its operation in Bourke due to the wartime rationalisation scheme which aimed to free up personnel so they could enlist or contribute to the war effort. The building was purchased in 1942 by the a Sylvia Faith Randall, who immediately transferred ownership to Tancred Brothers who by this time had built a boarding house or hostel on the adjacent property to house their abattoir staff. The hostel was run by a series of managers who were either women or couples. It operated as a hostel until the 1970s. Initially rent was paid directly to the Tancred Brothers who then paid the managers. Later a system was established where the manager collected rent and paid a portion of it to Tancred Brothers. While initially confined to the hostel or barracks building, with an increasing demand for accommodation not only from Tancred employees but also itinerant shearers and others, the boarding house operations gradually encroached onto the nank premises. In 1943 a dining room building was built directly adjacent to the living room and kitchen of the original residence. The manager and her family lived in the original residence and eventually some of Tancreds' more senior employees also lived in rooms in the original residence. In 1946 the Commonwealth Bank leased the former banking chambers at the Old London Bank. The design of the building ensured that secure banking operations could be maintained even if other parts of the original residence continued to serve as a boarding house and accommodation for the boarding house managers family. The chambers had by this time been partitioned into accommodation quarters and Tancreds agreed to remove these, repair and paint the walls, windows and doors, clean the area, and install certain fittings for the bank. The verandah was enclosed for bathroom facilities in the 1950s. The Commonwealth Bank operated from the Old London Bank's chambers until 1956 when it was again used to accommodate the seasonal surges in Tancred staff numbers. Tancred's operations in Bourke were affected by the periods of drought, industrial action and shifts in the market demand for their products during the 1960s and 1970s. During this period the bank building's use as accommodation quarters ceased and the hostel quarters adjacent closed in 1972. In 1981 the Bank building was bought and used as a residence and secondhand furniture repair shop. In 1988, the Bourke Historic Buildings Co-op purchased the building with a grant from the New South Wales Heritage Council. Some restoration was undertaken at this time. In 1993 a Permanent Conservation Order was gazetted for the Old London Bank. Between 1993 and 1997 the Cornerstone Community established backpacker accommodation on the premises. Some maintenance work and renovations were undertaken during the lease period, but towards the end of their tenure some structural problems were identified which required quite extensive maintenance and replacement work. Between 1998 and 1999 vandalism exacerbated the maintenance problems. In 2001 an agreement was struck between Chris Ware and Kristie Smiles and the Bourke Shire Council (for the Historic Building Co-Op) which allowed for the conservation and repair of the building \\"in consideration of future ownership\\". The work began in 2001 and the premises was opened as the Gidgee Guesthouse in 2002.  Description  The former London Chartered Bank is located at 17 Oxley Street, Bourke and is bound on the north by a laneway, the southern side by Oxley Street, the eastern side by Sturt Street. The site today consists of 5 buildings. ;1. A two-storey brick Victorian Filigree Style commercial building facing onto Oxley Street and Sturt Streets. This building has a single story wing extending to the west of the property. The brick construction of the two-storey wing is tuck-pointed Flemish bond. The single storey wing is of stretcher bond. The roof of the two storey wing of the building is hipped with gabled roof vents and constructed of slate. The single storey wing roof is hipped and is constructed of slate except for a section on the northern section which is of corrugated sheet metal. The two storey section of the building is surrounded on 3 sides by deep verandah on both levels. The ground floor verandah consists of a brick baluster with piers at intervals and a stone copping. Paired, fluted cast iron posts are positioned above each brick pier. The columns have a faceted base, decorative capitals, infill panel and brackets. Double sided cast iron panels with a Gothic tracery motif from a railing between the paired columns. The upper verandah follows the same theme without the brackets. The arched portico entry to the banking chamber from Sturt Street is position centrally in the eastern facade and is approached by white marble steps. The entry to the former Bank Manager's residence is located toward the western end of the southern facade of the building off Oxley Street. Its arched door opening with highlight window and side lights and timber mouldings give the entrance suitable prominence. The interior of this building comprises the former banking chamber (now used as common area for guests) accessed through an entrance hall and also the bank managers office (now used as part of the accommodation for the guesthouse manager). These rooms retain many original features such as original joinery and a black marble fireplace, although the original plaster lathe ceilings are covered by a new ceiling. The rear wing contains the former residence kitchen and living and dining room complete with pressed metal ceilings and servery, parts of an internal bell pull system and the original Metters kitchen stove. Other rooms on this level include the bathroom and former bedroom and store. The upper level of the building is accessed by the original decorative timber staircase and the second storey rooms retain much of their original detailing, such as cornices and doors. The former bank and residence has suffered some masonry cracking through poor drainage and the results of vandalism and neglect. Upper floor verandah collapsed and is being reinstated. Timber window shutters are similarly being repaired or reinstated. Some of the interior of the bank and residence has sustained damage through neglect and work has begun to repair this and restore original features. ;2. A single storey concrete block building located adjacent to and north of the original kitchen. This was added in 1943 and functioned as the kitchen for the boarding house established on the site by the Tancred Brothers to house their Bourke employees. It is now a kitchen/dining room for the current backpacker accommodation (in what is described here as Building 3) It can be accessed through an opening between the residence dining/living room and this room and has a deck at its eastern end, which has replaced a narrow verandah running between this building and the verandah of the residence. The former Tancreds dining room requires maintenance to remediate masonry cracking and external timber deterioration ;3. Accommodation wing, formerly known as Tancred Brothers Boarding House. This is an L shaped, painted, concrete block building with a half gabled hip corrugated iron roof located on the east and northern boundaries of the property.The building contains a series of 11 bedrooms opening onto a verandah that runs along the building and opens onto a garden. The Accommodation wing has sustained damage to the barge boards and the half gable at the end of the roof. ;4. Ablutions block At the north western end of this building is a relatively newly constructed toilet and shower block. ;5. Laundry Store Room A single storey brick building located at the north west corner of the residence.  Heritage listing  The Old London Bank in Bourke was built on the site of the town's first land sale in 1862. The bank reflects the opulent buildings that sprang up during the town's boom period when Bourke was a major river port for the expanding wool trade.AHC press release, 5/04 The site of the old London Bank is able to demonstrate the planning of the township of Bourke and its early subdivision. The old London Bank is an important and rare example of Victorian style bank architecture resulting from a period of prosperity in the region and the prediction of continuity. It demonstrates Bourke's recognition of financial institutions and business people and position as a significant inland riverport, rail head and business centre important in the further development of western NSW at the turn of the century and in the early decades of the twentieth century. The combined banking chamber and residence retains its two-storey Victorian character, form and planning and contributes to the historic streetscape. It is the only surviving example of nineteenth century banking in Bourke. The barracks and dining room are reminders of a period of ownership by Tancred Brothers, a significant local industry, and its use as a boarding house for their employees, many of whom were migrants. The old London Bank is a major landmark in Bourke. The site's successful adaptation as backpackers accommodation is evidence of the growth of two new industries in Bourke - that of tourism and heritage. Old London Bank Building was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The configuration of the site of the Old London Bank of Australia demonstrates the first subdivision of allotments for the township of Bourke in 1862. It is evidence of a period of economic expansion in Bourke in the nineteenth century that encouraged banks to establish larger more permanent officers in the Darling River Town thus facilitation the settlement and development of the then remote areas of western NSW. The premises were operated exclusively as a bank and managers residence for 53 years. Closure of the branch in 1942 was evidence of the pressure on Australian financial institutions to rationalise staff and resources in support of the war effort. The construction of the \\"barracks\\" and Tancred's dining room 1943 on the site is evidence of Tancred Brothers' provision of accommodation for their employees, including many new migrants. The continuing, though sporadic use of the buildings for accommodation reflects ongoing demand for casual lodging for itinerant workers and tourists. The site and its buildings continue to meet the needs of the local tourism industry at the same time emphasising several phases of Bourke's rich heritage and its contribution to the opening up and development of the State during the late nineteenth century and early decades of the twentieth century. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Old London Bank, Bourke is associated with the rapid development and gradual implementation of controls on the Australian Banking industry in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The building is associated with the managers, the staff and their families who came to Bourke for professional reasons and participated in and contributed to community activities. It is also associated with the banks local clients who relied on the bank for financial advice and to support their business interests. The Old London Bank has a strong association with Tancred Brothers Pty Ltd through the boarding house that they established on the site 1943 to accommodate meatworks employees. Fluctuations in the need to accommodate the rural workforce reflected cycle of boom and bust in the Australian Meat and Livestock industry. The design of the Old London Bank is associated with Terry and Oakden, prominent bank architects based in Voctoria. The design of the building is not typical of the style for which they are best known. although the face brick treatment is reminiscent of Oakden. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Old London Bank is a good example of the character and style of financial institution architecture of the Victorian era. Like other bank building the combined banking chamber and residence demonstrates the scale planning, symmetry and landmark qualities associated with public buildings. The scale and detailing of the impressive edifice demonstrates the social and economic importance of banking and banks. The building is evidence of the status that nineteenth century banks with to convey to customers and their optimism about the town's future. As such the building is a landmak building in the streetscape and provides a link with ither nineteenth and early twentieth century elements in Oxlet Street such as the Post Office and Court House. The deep verandah, sliding timber shutters and closable wall vents are important in demonstrating the methods architects Terry and Oakden, to deal with a hot and dusty environment such as that found in areas in western NSW The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Old London Bank is held in high regard by the community as demonstrated by its inclusion on the Register of the National Trust, the State Heritage Register, State Heritage InventoryNo. 1220004 and Bourke Shire Council's LEP Heritage Schedule. The old London Bank has a strong association with the Bourke community as a reminder of the significance of the bank as an institution integral to rural investment. It has a special association with the families of Bank Managers who were posted to Bourke, for whom it was often the first experience of life in western NSW. The building's survival into the twenty-first century, adaptation for tourist accommodation and restoration is evidence of the community's awareness and appreciation of Bourke's heritage. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Old London Bank has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the building materials and methods used in building in hot and dusty, outback environments such as Bourke in western NSW. Some of the site is relatively undisturbed and has the potential to provide evidence of prior occupation in addition to superseded structures such as the stables, coach house, drains, cisterns and wells. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Old London Bank is a rare example of a nineteenth century banking building institution in Bourke. It is a rare reminder of Bourke's boomtime period and reputation as a key inland port, railhead and pastoral centre crucial in the opening up and development of western NSW in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The scale, form and planning of the Old London Bank is broadly representative of regional bank architecture of the late nineteenth century.

Common form of active student response techniques are choral responding, response cards, guided notes, and clickers. While they are commonly used for disabled populations, these strategies can be applied at many different levels of education.Tincani, Matt; Twyman, Janet S.

PMC 2689152 . PMID 19487494  History  Active student response techniques are grounded in the field of behaviorism, a movement in psychology that believes behaviors are responses to stimuli and motivated by past reinforcement. The field has its origins in experiments of Edward Thorndike, who pioneered the Law of effect, which is now known as reinforcement and punishment. Thorndike explained that behaviors that produce a positive effect become more likely to reoccur, given the same scenario. Conversely, behaviors that produce a negative effect become less likely to reoccur.G.,, Myers, David. Psychology. DeWall, C. Nathan, 1954- (Twelfth edition ed.). New York. . OCLC 1018431994. Psychologist B.F. Skinner applied the principles of behaviorism to influence education. Skinner believed that students must be active in the classroom and that effective instruction is based on positive reinforcement. According to Skinner, teachers should avoid punishment, as it only teaches students to avoid punishment. Instead, lessons should be broken into small tasks with clear instruction and positive reinforcement. His beliefs led him to invent the teaching machine.Holland, James G. (1992). \\"B. F. Skinner (1904-1990): Obituary.\\" American Psychologist. 47 (5): 665–667. doi:10.1037//0003-066x.47.5.665. ISSN 0003-066X. Active student response techniques use Skinner's model to provide rapid reinforcement for desired responses. This increases the likelihood the responses will occur again. Also, these techniques may give instructors an opportunity to embrace technology in the classroom. The foundation of active student response techniques is behaviorism's stimulus-response-reinforcement paradigm. A stimulus is any environmental change that may produce a response. In an academic setting, a stimulus is often a verbal cue. The response may be any change by the subject, such as an emotion or a behavior. Reinforcers are either positive or negative. In an academic setting, confirmation of a correct answer may be a positive reinforcer. So, active student response techniques aim to arrange the paradigm so the response is most correct. This includes separating instruction into small, achievable steps, providing clear and quick feedback, and including many repetitions. As a result, the correct response will have a strong relationship to the stimulus, creating more learning.  Methods   Choral responding  Choral responding is a low-tech, high-ASR strategy that paces instruction throughout a class. In this strategy, students are prompted to respond orally in unison to questions posed by an instructor. For choral responding to work, questions must be presented clearly, be able to answered briefly, and have one correct answer. Choral responding is useful for reviewing subject matter, solving problems, or spelling words. It may be used to review previously covered content or provide feedback throughout a class period.Twyman, Janet; Heward, William (2016-05-01). \\"How to improve student learning in every classroom now\\". International Journal of Educational Research. 87. doi:10.1016/j.ijer.2016.05.007. Choral responding is effective in both small- and whole-group instruction, for students from preschool through secondary grades, in both general education and special education, as measured by learning outcomes. The instructional format for choral responding is the following: # Instructor poses a question (e.g. \\"What is 9x9?\\") # Appropriate wait-time pause # Instructor uses a clear signal (e.g. \\"Tell me.\\") # Instructor provides feedback for the majority answer (e.g. Correct! 9x9 is 81.\\")  Response cards  Response cards are cards, signs, or other objects held up by students in unison in response to a question posed by an instructor. Write-on response cards, such as whiteboards, allow students to write their answers on the spot and erase between learning trials. Pre-printed response cards are pre-made and are often true/false or colors to indicate answers. Both types of response cards promote high-ASR by allowing all students to respond to all questions, instead of one student responding to each. Instructors can easily gauge learning using response cards.Heward, William L (Spring 1997). \\"FOUR VALIDATED INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES\\". Behavior and Social Issues. 7. The instructional format of response cards is similar to choral responding, as follows: # Instructor poses a question with a clear, quick response (e.g. \\"What is the atomic number of carbon?\\") # Appropriate wait-time pause for students to write answers # Instructor uses a clear signal (e.g. \\"Show me your boards!\\") # Instructor provides feedback (e.g. \\"That's right! The atomic number of carbon is 6.) Occasionally, the instructor may want to address some of the incorrect responses that were given. Implementing response cards in a classroom may increase questions posed by the instructor, increase academic performance, and be favored by students. The technique is effective in both general education and special education. Response cards may also increase on-task behavior in the classroom and decrease disruptive behavior. Response cards are most effective when paired with brisk instructional pacing. Instructors have been easily able to implement response cards and achieve a response rate of approximately one response per minute. The brisk instructional pace maximized responses in a class period without sacrificing accuracy and while minimizing problem behavior.  Guided notes  Notetaking serves both a process and product function. But, traditional notetaking is dependent on attendance, criterion knowledge, and attention. Often, students may be inefficient note takers by recording incomplete, verbatim notes. Distributing instructor's notes increases academic performance.Kiewra, Kenneth A. (1987-09-01). \\"Notetaking and review: The research and its implications\\". Instructional Science. 16 (3): 233–249. doi:10.1007/BF00120252. ISSN 0020-4277. Guided notes aims to improve notetaking behavior by ensuring complete and accurate notes. Guided notes are prepared handouts containing standard cues to guide a student through a lecture. The handouts are often based on the instructor's notes with blank spaces throughout for the student to fill in. In the blank spaces, the student is to complete the information or concept, creating a high-ASR strategy with many response opportunities throughout the lecture. The blank spaces should be varied and may allow for many different types of responses, such as drawing pictures or graphs. While mostly low-tech, guided notes has the option to use many high-tech applications, such as software that makes guided notes from completed notes. Guided notes are used in both K-12 level and college levels. The active student response technique improves assessment scores, accuracy of notes, and student responses during lecture. Most students prefer guided notes over traditional notetaking. The instructional format of guided notes is as follows: # Instructor makes an outline of the lecture, and should contain clear typographical cues, such as bullet points # Instructor replaces some sections with blank spaces where the student will write in the information # Guided notes are distributed to students for the lecture Example of guided notes: The space between two neurons is the _________. Neurons most often exhibit _______ signaling within cells and _______ signaling between cells. The generation of the _______ potential produces an ______-or-none response. So, greater intensity stimulation produces higher ________.  High-tech strategies  Response strategies can be implemented using commercially available technologies, such as clickers or mobile phone apps. Similar to response cards, the instructor would pose a question and ask for a response from the class. Some of the process may be automated with a software that uses a clear signal for response and collects student responses. Though, high-tech strategies are not as well researched.  Applications  Active student response techniques can be applied to nearly all levels of education. Also, the techniques can be used with multiple populations. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) prioritizes accessible general education that includes individuals with disabilities, including those with autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disabilities, learning disabilities, and behavior disorders. Active student response benefits the inclusion of students with disabilities in classrooms by facilitating all students' participation in the classroom. Higher education may also benefit from active student response techniques.. Undergraduate classrooms would often benefit from implementing the techniques. While traditional lectures serve a function in higher education, such as setting context and synthesizing information, the reliance on passive learning is not as effective as active student learning. Active student response strategies can be either low- or high-tech. High-tech strategies, which use electrical devices, may utilize mobile phones, clickers, or other devices. Low-tech strategies do not require any electrical devices and may not require anything more than pencil and paper. Examples include guided notes and response cards. The range of technology that can be used broadens the applications of active student response.  Compared to traditional teaching styles  Traditional lecturing, in which an instructor speaks uninterrupted for the majority of the class, is often less effective than active student response techniques. Without active participation from students and contingent positive reinforcement for correct responses, traditional lecturing does not reinforce desired behaviors. Traditional lecturing may allow disorganized delivery of information. Implementing active student response techniques into lectures ensures the lectures function to assess, instruct, plan, and evaluate. Active student response techniques have been shown to increase learning, compared to traditional lecture. During lectures with active student response, students exhibited more on-task behavior, and instructors received more feedback. Frequency of active student responses is correlated with performance on evaluations. Instructors also remarked that active student participation provides instructors with clear feedback and promotes a more inclusive nature of the classroom. However, active student response also demands a higher cost. Instructors must supply or prepare any necessary materials. For example, to implement guided notes, instructors must write and print the notes to distribute to students. Similarly, the techniques demand more time from instructors. It may take added preparation to plan all of the questions throughout class. If an instructor chooses to use response cards, the instructor must prepare questions to which the class can respond.

Melbourne Theatre Company performed there from 1960 to 1994, using it as their main city venue in the 1960s and early 1970s and their secondary venue from the late 1970s to 1994. The building was first constructed as an engineering workshop in the 1880s and was extended as a church in 1920. In 1955, the building was sold to the Council of Adult Education and converted into a theatre seating 420. The then Union Theatre Repertory Company (later the MTC) used the building for half the year as their city venue from 1960, and took over the building five years later. Architect Robin Boyd renovated the theatre and decorated it in shades of red. The theatre closed in 1994 when the MTC moved fully to the then Victorian Arts Centre.

He was a vassal of the Rashtrakuta king Krishna III.  Early life  Arikesari III was a grandson of the Chalukya king Arikesari II. His father Bhadradeva and his uncle Vagaraja (who succeeded Arikesari II) were half-brothers. Bhadradeva (r. c. 941-946) probably ruled jointly with Vagaraja (r. c. 941-950), and Arikesari III (r. c. 946-968) ascended the throne after them. Bhadradeva probably died before Vagaraja, and Vagaraja probably died without an heir, which may explain why Arikesari III succeeded Vagaraja.  Reign  Like his predecessor, Arikesari III was a feudatory of the Rashtrakuta king Krishna III. His 946 CE Karimnagar inscription records a land grant to a brahmana. His 966 CE Parbhani copper- plate inscription records the grant of a village to the Jain leader Somadeva- suri for the maintenance of Shubha-dharma Jinalaya shrine, which had been built by his father Bhadradeva. The granted village was Kuttumvritti- Vanikadupulu, which was located in the Repaka-12 subdivision of the Sabbi-1000 administrative division. His 968 CE Repaka inscription records a land grant to a Jain shrine (Jinalaya) by the chief Vujaya; the temple is said to have been built by Arikesari. Arikesari III bore several titles inherited from his grandfather, including Pambarankusham, Ammana-gandha-varanam, Gandhebha- Vidyadharam, Arudha-Sarvajnan, Udatta-narayanan, Nodutti-gevlom, Guna-nidhi, Gunarnava, Sharanagata-vajra-panjara, Priyagalla, Tribhuvana-malla, and Samanta-chudamani. It is not certain how and when the reign of Arikesari III ended. By the year 966-967, the Kalyani Chalukyas had made inroads into the territory of the Vemulavada kings, as attested by an inscription discovered at Uppili in the Maktal taluka of the Mahboobnagar district. Another 973-974 inscription of Permumadi, an officer (ankakara) of the Kalyani Chalukya king Taila II, has been discovered at Koraprolu in the present-day Nalgonda district. This suggests that the Kalyani Chalukyas conquered the Vemulavada territories during 966-973.

She is best known for having obtained a triple platinum certification for her song \\"Loca\\", with more than 300,000 copies sold. She has also appeared on television series with high ratings. Career Malena Gracia has worked in film, television, music, theater, and advertising. She has been a model and appeared in several magazines and Spanish TV programs. She was discovered by director and producer Valeriu Lazarov. She was a student at the Daniel Cicaret dance school. She studied solfège, singing, and acting with Luis Arnedillo and the professor of the Madrid Royal Conservatory, Inés Rivadeneira. Later she continued her classes with José Sepúlveda, at Ángela Carrasco's school, specializing in musicals. She shared a singing teacher with Shaila Dúrcal. Her early years in the world of dance and entertainment were not easy; her family was of humble origins and for seven years she was a victim of mistreatment of one of her ex-partners. During the 1990s, Gracia worked on various television shows and began a musical career, as a singer of copla and Spanish songs, studying with maestro Julián Bazán. In 1992 she released her first Spanish song album Vete con él. Her style would later change to pop, although she always aspired to be a lyric singer. Her television popularity grew on shows like De lo bueno el mejor and in sketches on the popular Antena 3 program Arévalo & cia, a Spanish adaptation of The Benny Hill Show. She participated in the first chapters of ' with Lina Morgan, a series that obtained audience levels of 46% and 8,500,000 spectators for its premiere. She also gained notoriety in the tabloid press. She presented Pase lo que pase on Telemadrid with Catalan comedian . She also participated in several Christmas specials on Telecinco with Lina Morgan. At the end of the 90s, she formed the group Sex Bomb with Yola Berrocal and , which she would leave shortly afterward due to her incompatibility with Berrocal and Monroy. In 1998 was chosen Playboy's European covergirl. She has posed nude or seminude for the magazines Playboy, Man, and Interviú (she appeared on seven occasions, one of them posing with Yola Berrocal). Gracia had a romantic relationship with lawyer Emilio Rodríguez Menéndez, who was sentenced to nine years and six months in prison for fraud against the Public Treasury. After their breakup she suffered strong harassment and media persecution by the lawyer. In the year 2000, Malena Gracia filed a defamation lawsuit against his magazine Dígame, through which she obtained a judicial order to seize the magazine. The singer requested help from the detective agency, which cooperated with the police to arrest him in 2005 in Argentina for having escaped to Paraguay to avoid the condemnation of the Spanish justice system. According to Gracia, the lawyer blackmailed her knowing that in the past she had briefly engaged in prostitution. Two years after the separation of Sex Bomb, Malena joined the popular reality series ', where she was third finalist, and thanks to this she was able to get funding to start her musical career, with various summer and dance songs. 2003 saw the market launch of her successful song \\"Loca\\" on the Vale Music label. It achieved high levels of popularity on the radio and at events in Spain. Due to its high sales volume, it reached triple platinum status, becoming the quintessential song of that summer, was played for more than a decade in Spain, and was published in several compilations. In 2005 she premiered the play Las corsarias in Barcelona together with and . Its run only lasted three days, and it was later discovered to have been financed by the Gürtel plot, with €481,000 supplied by Francisco Correa Sánchez and his partner \\"El Bigotes\\". Malena Gracia has tried to represent Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest on several occasions. She was presented to the Spanish preselection of 2008 with the song \\"Un poquito más\\", but was passed over in favor of Rodolfo Chikilicuatre. In 2009 she tried with \\"Quiero volar\\". In 2010 she once again presented her candidacy for the Spanish Eurovision preselection with her song \\"La Vida\\". She has had numerous appearances on television as a contributor to the program ' with Jorge Javier Vázquez, and '. Among other reality TV appearances, she was the fourth finalist on the 2010 season of Supervivientes. This edition featured both famous and unknown contestants, with Gracia being the last famous one to be voted off. In April 2012, she appealed on television regarding the possible abduction of her sister at birth. She was born prematurely on 30 August 1960, and for that reason she was taken to the Hospital Clínico San Carlos to gain weight in an incubator. The family went to see her on several occasions, but on the twelfth day they were told that she had died, without allowing the parents to see the body, which was consistent with procedures carried out in the kidnapping of children in Francoist Spain. In March 2015 she presented her new album Miénteme on the Telecinco network, becoming a trending topic on Twitter. In February 2016 she was romantically linked in the press with the well-known humorist , a friend of the artist for over 20 years. Arévalo lost his wife in December 2015, and the story was later denied by both, which caused discomfort in the comedian for confusing a deep friendship. In 2016, she was part of the cast of a theatrical adaptation of the 1962 film Atraco a las tres, directed by José María Forqué, premiered on 5 March at the Federico García Lorca Theater in Getafe.

Pitfield was arrested five times in relation to her suffrage activities, and was force- fed in 1909 after going on hunger strike in prison. After being released in 1909, she is reported to have said: \\"There are only two things that matter to me in the world: principle and liberty. For these I will fight as long as there is life in my veins. I am no longer an individual, I am an instrument.\\" Pitfield had been given a Hunger Strike Medal 'for Valour' by WSPU. On 18 November 1910, Penfield was injured during the police attack on women at the Black Friday protest outside the House of Commons; according to Sylvia Pankhurst, she sustained a wound on her thigh that did not heal. She was later told she had cancer and that it was incurable. As a result, wanting to be useful to the suffragette movement, she set fire in 1912 to a basket of wood shavings in a post office, broke a window, and gave herself up to the police. She was sentenced to six months in prison on 19 March 1912 after being carried to the court from the prison hospital. According to Pankhurst, she was released in May, after the Men's Political Union for Women's Enfranchisement started a petition on her behalf, and was cared for at Pembroke Garden nursing home by Nurses Catherine Pine and Gertrude Townend, and died three months later.

Stackhouse is a graduate of Stanford University, where she was a four-year All-American, and majored in communications. She helped the Cardinal to an NCAA title in 2015. In 2011, at the age of 17, she became the youngest African American woman to earn a spot in the field at the U.S. Open. In 2014, she became the first African American woman to make the Curtis Cup team, which the United States won that year. Early life and amateur career Stackhouse is the daughter of Ken Stackhouse, formerly a partner in an architectural firm, and Sharon Stackhouse, a hospital administrator. When Stackhouse was a 2-year old, her father cut down a set of golf clubs for her. \\"I began to practice alongside him, and he never stopped taking me. I guess I developed a liking for the game, I kept practicing, and here I am now,\\" says Stackhouse. She played in her first tournament at age 6 and tied for first. Stackhouse graduated from North Clayton High School in Riverdale, GA, where she was elected class president two years in a row. In 2013 as a freshman at Stanford, Stackhouse shot a 61 at the Peg Barnard Invitational Tournament which set an NCAA scoring record. Her round of 61 included a front nine score of 26 (−9). At the 2015 NCAA Division I Championship, Stackhouse finished 6th in the individual competition and led her team to the team title.

The series stars the Dance Princess Maja Salvador, as Lily Cruz and Ivy Aguas, together with an ensemble cast consisting Tirso Cruz III, Aiko Melendez, Sunshine Cruz, and Wendell Ramos. The first season of Wildflower chronicles the life of Lily Cruz, a girl whose parents were murdered by Emilia Ardiente, the matriarch of the Aridente clan. She was almost murdered, too, but managed to escape. Lily was adopted by Prianka Aguas, a billionaire businesswoman and philanthropist, and changed her identity to Ivy Aguas. After the death of Prianka, Lily returns to Poblacion Ardiente as Ivy Aguas, and this time stronger, braver, and ready to pursue her plans to avenge the deaths of her parents. She creates chaos in the family, while portraying as an ally to them, and also manipulating them.  Plot  This story follows Lily Cruz (Maja Salvador), a beautiful and smart heiress who wants justice for her parents’ deaths by seeking revenge against the evil Ardiente family, a powerful political dynasty in the fictional province that bears their name. Lily’s mother, Camia (Sunshine Cruz) is a school teacher and her father Dante (Christian Vazquez) is a public attorney. The Cruz family moves to the thriving and wealthy province of Poblacion Ardiente, where Dante gets an associate position in the Public Attorney’s office. Lily easily finds friends including Diego Torillo (Joseph Marco), the youngest son of the Ardiente family, one of the students who Camia tutors. The Ardiente family is the most powerful political dynasty in the province under the jurisdiction of Governor Julio Ardiente (Tirso Cruz III) and his daughter Emilia (Aiko Melendez), Mayor of the province. Emilia is married to businessman and known serial womanizer, Raul Torillo (Wendell Ramos). They have two sons, Arnaldo (RK Bagatsing) and Diego. Complications follow when Raul is attracted to Camia. With the entitlement of the powerful, Raul assaults Camia prompting Dante to file rape charges against him. Unfortunately, the Ardientes do not take threats lightly. Lily's world crumbles when Dante suspiciously dies from a heart attack and she witnesses her mother’s rape. Though targeted to be killed herself, the assassins feel compassion for the 9 year old and frees her instead. Lily fends for herself in another city until a wealthy woman, Prianka Aguas (Priscilla Meirelles) rescues her from life in the streets. Prianka legally adopts Lily and raises her to become tough, providing her with the resources to seek justice for her parents. Prianka later died from ovarian cancer and Lily inherits her fortune and returns to Poblacion Ardiente as Ivy Aguas. With a billion dollar conglomerate behind her, Ivy is a magnet for the Ardientes who are preparing their campaign for the gubernatorial and congressional reelections. Ivy is reacquainted with Diego, who turns out to be the bastard son of Raul. Nonetheless, they fall in love and Diego renounces his family.

Wink, André. Al-Hind, the Making of the Indo-Islamic World, Volume 1: Early Medieval India and the Expansion of Islam, 7th–11th Centuries. 3rd ed. Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1996. . He started invading Indian kingdoms. After subduing Sindh, Junayd sent campaigns to various parts of India. The justification was that these parts had previously paid tribute to Bin Qasim but then stopped. The first target was al-Kiraj (possibly Kangra valley), whose conquest effectively put an end to the kingdom. A large campaign was carried out in Rajasthan which included Mermad (Maru-Mala, in Jaisalmer and north Jodhpur), al-Baylaman (Bhillamala or Bhinmal) and Jurz (Gurjara country—southern Rajasthan and north Gujarat). Another force was sent against Uzayn (Ujjain), which made incursions into its country (Avanti) and some parts of it were destroyed (the city of Baharimad, unidentified). Ujjain itself may not have been conquered. A separate force was also sent against al-Malibah (Malwa, to the east of Ujjain), but the outcome is not recorded; probably unsuccessful. Towards the North, the Arabs attempted to expand into Punjab, but they could not advance beyond Multan. While the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate was a factor in this, art historian Hermann Goetz theorizes that the resistance from Lalitaditya Muktapida, the emperor of Kashmir, may also have played a part in this.* Historian Mohibbul Hasan theorizes that Junayd marched towards Kashmir, but was defeated by Lalitaditya. Another force was dispatched south. It subdued Qassa (Kutch), al-Mandal (perhaps Okha), Dahnaj (unidentified), Surast (Saurashtra) and Barus or Barwas (Broach). The kingdoms weakened or destroyed included the Bhattis of Jaisalmer, the Gurjaras of Bhinmal, the Mauryas of Chittor, the Guhilots of Mewar, the Kacchelas of Kutch, the Maitrakas of Saurashtra and the Gurjaras of Nandipuri.

It was also known as Barwon Mission, Brewarrina Mission and Brewarrina Aboriginal Station. Built from 1880, it was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 21 July 2006.  History  Plaque recording the location of the mission's church For the first Protector of Aborigines and the Aboriginal Protection Board, the problem of the large group of Aborigines camping around Brewarrina seemed to be one of the most pressing in the State. In 1882 a census listed 151 Aborigines and 24 \\"half-castes\\" at Brewarrina, many reported to be suffering from venereal diseases and \\"addicted to the habits of intemperance\\". In 1885 the Aboriginal Protection Board removed the Aboriginal population to an Aboriginal reserve 2 miles from town but urged the need for a home for Aboriginal people in the area. In 1886 the Aborigines Protection Association established a mission on a reserve of 5,000 acres, 10 miles east of the town on the opposite bank of the Barwon River.Aboriginal settlements, pg 76 The new Mission did not attract all the Brewarrina people. In 1891 only 41 and in 1897 43 people were recorded as residents of the mission. In 1897 the Board took over the mission from the Protection Association as they were making small contributions to the enterprise of the mission. During the 1920s and 1930s many Aboriginal people were brought in from places such as Tibooburra, Angledool, Collarenebri and Walgett due to other stations were closed down. (Aboriginal Settlements) Only a few families lived out on the reserve in 1882 and had their homes near the river bank. When Aboriginal people began to arrive or were relocated, the Aboriginal Protection Board built houses from corrugated iron with board or concrete flooring. When the Aborigines from Tibooburra were relocated to Brewarrina mission their houses were made of weatherboard and were located in 2 rows at the back of the mission, next to another 2 rows of houses for the Angledool people. The Mission Church was built by Duncan Ferguson from bush timber and corrugated roofing iron with an earthen floor. The church was used for Sunday school and funerals. In the early period the Mission contained a Managers House, Butchers Shop, School, Church, small treatment-room and hall. The school never had proper teachers, and classes were taught by either the mission manager, mission managers wife, the clinic sister or even the bookkeeper. Mission schools only had to teach to the standard Grade three. The Education Department maintained a one-teacher school in 1965. There was a girls dormitory at the Brewarrina Mission. Once girls reached the age of 13 or 14 the Aboriginal Protection Board would remove the girls from their families to house them at the dormitory. Here they were taught how to become maids and then sent out to stations to work. The Mission had a number of Station Managers, and the Managers house was referred to as the \\"Big House\\". On the arrival of a new Mission Manager, the families were allowed to make a garden to grow their own vegetables and fruit. These included turnips, onions, cabbages, tomatoes, cucumbers, strawberries and carrots. Everyone was required to grow orange trees, lemon trees and mandarin trees. And some stone fruit trees peaches, apricots and plums.Over My Tracks, Crawford pg 74 The last Mission Manager was William Hopkins who died in December 1900. His grave site is within the Brewarrina Mission Cemetery. The Aboriginal people were required to wash in sheep dip. Every morning each child was required to go to the Clinic to get pink eye drops and cod liver oil. A small lump of hard soap was allocated once a month. Twice a week meat rations were supplied from the butchers shop, the first would consist of enough to feed a family chops, lump of fat or kidney with fat, piece of liver and half a neck. The other would consist of 2 shanks and a kidney to feed for a week. On ration day once a fortnight a supply of vegetables such as potatoes, onions, sugar, tea leaves, rice, flour, salt, pepper, syrup and half a bar of soap. If the Mission Manager felt that anyone was making trouble on the station, everyone in that family had their rations reduced. To obtain more food, many Aboriginal peoples would fish in the Barwon River and gather mussels. Water was pumped up from the Barwon River and reticulated to the houses but only some of them had taps inside the dwellings. Most had outside coppers and tubs for washing and bathing and only 2 had bathrooms . The reserve was reduced from 4,638 acres to 638 acres in 1953 and only a few acres of this were used in 1965 for the station buildings and a small cemetery. In November 1965 11 small cottages and a school, a garage, a small treatment room, a hall, and the managers house and office remained. The last burial at the cemetery was in 1971.  Description  Mission cemetery Today there are no buildings standing. The cemetery is located within a large pasture and is enclosed by a fence which is need of repair. There are approximately 90 graves with 50 of those being marked by wooden crosses and headstones. Near the cemetery there are 2 small burial sites which were recently done in a reburial ceremony of returned ancestral remains. Over the old mission area, approximately 16 small interpretation panels are scattered, providing information as to what was once there. Remains of the rehabilitation centre are also on the site, including the concrete slab. The community would like to further improve the condition of the cemetery as it is need of urgent repair. The community would also like to further enhance the interpretation signage to include a driving trail around the signs to enable better viewing. The rehabilitation centre, which is now demolished, needs to be cleaned up and possibly a new shed could be built on the existing concrete slab.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries The Brewarrina Aboriginal Mission was the oldest institutional-type community in the state that was still managed in 1965. Brewarrina Mission was the first institution formally established by the Aborigines Protection Board as part of its policy to segregate Aboriginal people. Over the years, the Brewarrina Mission was used to house other Aboriginal people from Tibooburra, Angledool, Goodooga and Culgoa to form the reserve which operated between 1886 - 1966 and was one of the longest running reserve stations in NSW. During the reserve period many Aboriginal people died and were buried in the reserve cemetery. The cemetery is no longer used by the community its integrity is held high within the values of the Aboriginal people. The entire site of Brewarrina Mission including its cemetery is a significant place to the many Aboriginal tribes including Ngemba and Murrawarri tribe as a \\"place of belonging\\". The place retains its high integrity in its cultural, spiritual, social and historical values to many Aboriginal people across NSW. Brewarrina Aboriginal Mission Site was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 21 July 2006 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Brewarrina Mission is the oldest institutional type community in the state. It is associated with the significant historical phase as being the first institution formally established by the Aboriginal Protection Board in 1886. While there are no remaining buildings left, the original cemetery remains within the mission site which maintains the continuity of the historical activity of an Aboriginal settlement. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The site of the Brewarrina mission and the cemetery is evidence of the occupation of Aboriginal people. The station was the oldest institutional-type community in the State that was still managed as such in 1965. Established in 1886, Aboriginal people were relocated 10 miles east of the town on the opposite bank of the Barwon River. The mission is associated with the removal of many Aboriginal people from their \\"homes\\" from as far as Tibooburra, Angledool, Walgett, Goodooga and Collenanebri and relocating them to the Brewarrina Mission during the 1930s. The girls dormitory was also significant as it was utilised by the Aboriginal Protection Board to house young girls who were forcibly removed from their families to be educated in domestic work and then sent out in NSW to work. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Brewarrina Mission has a strong and special association for many Aboriginal people for its historical, social and cultural values and is a place of belonging to those of the Ngemba and Murwarri tribes. While many Aboriginal people were removed from their traditional home lands and forcibly removed to the Mission, Brewarrina Mission remains an important part to the community's sense of place. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Brewarrina Mission is highly significant to many Aboriginal people within NSW to their cultural heritage values. The area is able to demonstrate the principal characteristics of the many Aboriginal people who lived at the mission during 1889 - 1966. Being the site of the first Aboriginal Protection Board institutionised community the area has the attributes to demonstrate the way of life and customs of those who lived and died on the Mission. Although there are no physical buildings remaining, the original cemetery is all that remains and it is maintained by members of the community.

Kogler has also been serving as the federal spokesman of the Green Party since October 2017. He was a member of the National Council of Austria from 1999 to 2020. Early life and career Kogler was born in the small east Styrian town of Hartberg. He took his university entrance exams in 1980 and subsequently studied economics and law at the University of Graz. He graduated with his degree in economics in 1994. Political career Early beginnings Kogler formed the Alternative List Graz and, in 1982, he was one of the founders of the Alternative List Austria, which merged with the United Greens of Austria to become the current Green Party. In 1985, he was elected to the municipal council of Graz. Member of the National Council In 1999, Kogler won election to the National Council. He served the Greens in various positions, including as a member of the federal executive board, and as a representative for the Styrian Greens in 2010. In 2010, Kogler, who was the Greens spokesman on budget issues, delivered a 12-hour, 42-minute speech in opposition to the government's proposed budget, a record breaking filibuster. He spoke against proposed transatlantic trade agreements and, after the government takeover of Hypo Alpe Adria Bank, traveled the country referring to the affair as Hypo-Krimi, the \\"Hypo whodunnit\\". In 2017, the Greens failed to capture the minimum 4.0% of the vote to be seated in the Austrian parliament. Kogler, having lost his seat, took over as the interim party leader from Ingrid Felipe, which was made permanent in 2018. Following the Ibiza affair, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, terminated his coalition agreement, which led to a vote of no-confidence and a new election in 2019. During the 2019 election campaign, Kogler expressed a willingness to go into a coalition with the Austrian People's Party, which was expected to win the election. The Greens' campaign pushed for an end to government subsidies of fossil fuel and larger investments into environmental initiatives, including public transport and renewable energy. In 2019, the Greens re-entered the Austrian parliament, achieving their largest vote total in the party’s history with 14% of the vote. From 2019 to 2020, Kogler led coalition negotiations with the Austrian People’s Party and with former chancellor Sebastian Kurz. The parties agreed to a legislative program going forward that included the Greens' desire to make Austria carbon neutral by 2030, an overall increase in the air passenger tax and a €3 day ticket for public transport. The program included additional restriction on migrants, an extension of the ban on Islamic headscarves in school and lower personal and corporate tax rates. On 7 January 2020, he became the new vice chancellor of Austria.

Described as one of the \\"pillars of modern Iraqi art,\\" he was responsible for executing a number of high-profile public monuments in Baghdad in the mid-20th century.  Life and career  Born in Baghdad in 1926 into a poor family, Khaled al-Rahal grew up on Baghdad's streets and alleyways which became an important influence on his life and art.Jabra, J.I., Grass Roots of Iraqi Art, Wasit Graphic and Publishing, 1983, p. 68; Dougherty, B.K. and Ghareeb, E.A. (eds), Historical Dictionary of Iraq, Scarecrow Press, 2013, p.495 He was an acute oberver of daily Iraqi life, and a regular visitor to the Iraqi Museum, established in 1939, where he showed great interest in Iraq's ancient sculptures, particularly Assyrian and Mesopotamian reliefs. Even before he studied art academically, his sculpture had developed a mature artistic vision, grounded in Mesopotamian art traditions.Jabra, J.I., Grass Roots of Iraqi Art, Wasit Graphic and Publishing, 1983, p. 69 During the second world war, he was just a teenager when the first signs of an art revival began in Baghdad. A group of Polish artists, mainly impressionists, had sought refuge in Baghdad, where they introduced local artists to European art. While, this created considerable enthusiasm for modern abstract art, it also left many local artists, including al-Rahal, searching for a way to integrate their ancient art traditions within modern, abstract artworks.Jabra, J.I., Art in Iraq Today, London, Embassy of the Republic of Iraq, 1966, p. 68 Online: Throughout the 1940s, al-Rahal maintained a studio in Baghdad's commercial district, where he made and sold busts of the Iraqi monarch and other works, all of which were very popular with the public.Shabout, N. \\"Collecting Modern Iraqi Art,\\" in: Sonja Mejcher-Atassi, John Pedro Schwartz (eds), Archives, Museums and Collecting Practices in the Modern Arab World, Routledge, 23 May 2016 pp 198-199 The Iraqi artist, Jabra Ibrahim Jabra, described his visit to al-Rahal's studio in the following terms:Jabra, J.I., Art in Iraq Today, London, Embassy of the Republic of Iraq, 1966, p.6 Online: At war's end, al-Rahal, by then in his early twenties, was part of a small group of talented, local artists who were granted scholarships to study art at the Baghdad Fine Arts Institute or abroad in either Paris or Rome.Bahrani, Z. and Shabout, N.M., mosm and Iraq, Miriam and Ira D.

During this period, he was commissioned to reproduce a bust of Sumerian Queen, Shuba'ad. He dressed her in royal jewellery from the Cemetery at Ur.Brown, B.A. and Feldman, M.H., Critical Approaches to Ancient Near Eastern Art, Walter de Gruyter, 2014, p. 5 and p.xix The bust went on public display at the Museum, where it became an iconic image of Iraq's Sumerian past. Replicas of the bust were sold in tourist outlets and the figure became one of the most reproduced images in Iraqi art, being used on postcards, posters, souvenirs and in popular art.Bajjaly, J.G.

See section M52. The group, which would have a far-reaching impact on Iraqi art sought to bridge the gap between modernity and tradition, by developing a distinctive Iraqi art aesthetic which employed modern techniques, but at the same time referenced its ancient heritage and tradition.Ulrike al-Khamis, “An Historical Overview 1900s-1990s,” in: Maysaloun, F.

Around the time of his return to Baghdad, the reigning monarch was murdered, the monarchy abolished and a republic established. While many artists fled Iraq at this time, al-Khaled decided to remain in Baghdad.Brown, B.A. and Feldman, M.H.

Under, Saddam Hussein, the Ba'ath Party co-opted the Baghdad Modern Art Group because its objectives aligned with their vision of a National Arab identity. Artists who were members of Baghdad's art groups were offered lucrative positions at the Ministry of Culture.Baram, A., Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq,1968-89, Springer, 1991, pp 70-71 Sculptors, architects and engineers, in particular, benefited from Hussein's program to beautify the city of Baghdad as numerous public art works were commissioned.

Berkeley, University of California Press, pp 72-75 Al-Khaled, who more than any other artist, incorporated ancient Iraqi motifs in his artwork, flourished in Ba'athist Iraq. Throughout the 1970s, he designed several monuments commemorating historic Iraqi figures including: Abu Jafar al- Mansour,\\"Mosque blast blow to Iraq treasures,\\" Aljazeera, Online: the 8th- century Abbasid Caliph and founder of Baghdad, the Lady of the Marshes, the March of the Ba'ath and Abd al-Karim Qasim, the Iraqi brigadier who overthrew the monarchy and established a republic in 1958 and also executed sculptures of everyday people such as Shaqawiyya (an Arab girl from southern Iraq)Makiya, K. and Al-Khalilm S., The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq, pp 1-2 and the Mother and Child statue.

The designs for both monuments included ancient and modern Arabic symbols of victory.Brian A. Brown, Marian H.

In an interview with the Government Daily, al-Rahhal expressed the view that the Iraqi people were the direct offspring of the ancient Sumerians, and was quoted:Khaled al- Rahal, quoted in: Baram, A., Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq,1968-89, Springer, 1991, p. 73 For sculptures, he worked primarily in wood, plaster and metal.Jabra, J.I., Art in Iraq Today, London, Embassy of the Republic of Iraq, 1966, p.6 Online: His themes are people of the streets and alleys, the poor men and women of everyday life as well as historic characters.Jabra, J.I., Grass Roots of Iraqi Art, Wasit Graphic and Publishing, 1983, p. 54 Although he trained as a sculptor, Al-Rahal also enjoyed painting and exhibited many of these.

Each arch consists outstretched arms which appear to be exploding out of the ground and holding a sword which meet at a central point. The swords, which are made of stainless steel, are based on the weapons carried by Sa\`d ibn Abi Waqqas, the Arab leader at the 7th-century, Battle of Qadisiya (from where the monument derives its Arabic name).Bloom, J. and Blair, S., Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art & Architecture, Vol. 1, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 25; Davis, E., \\"The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,\\" [Book Review], Middle East Journal, (Washington), Vol. 46, No. 1, 1992, p. 102 A small flagpole rises from the point where the swords meet, at a point about above the ground. : The origins of the concept are not entirely clear. Some sources suggest that the idea for the monument originated with a sketch by Saddam Hussein, while others suggest that it was primarily the work of the sculptor, Khaled al-Rahal in close collaboration with Hussein.Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq, p. 136n Certainly, Saddam Hussein's torso served as inspiration for the work. Al-Rahal used photographs and plaster casts of Saddam's forearms as a model for the design of the hands. Toward the end of the project, after al-Khahal's death, the new project coordinator, Mohammed Ghani assumed control of the project and personally took an impression of one of Saddam's thumbs, with the resulting fingerprint added to the mould for one of the arches' thumbs. The arms rest on concrete plinths, and each plinth holds bronze nets containing some 2,500 helmets (a total of 5,000 helmets) which, Saddam claimed, belonged to Iranian soldiers killed during the war.Al- Khalilm S. and Makiya, K., The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq, pp 1-5 : Dimensions: 40 metres in height; span of 30m : Date: Commenced in 1986 by Khaled al-Rahal, and completed in 1989 (after the sculptor's death) by Mohammed Ghani Hikmat, who had previously been al-Rahal's assistant on the project.Al-Khalilm S. and Makiya, K., The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq, pp 1-2; Bloom, J. and Blair, S.S.

In addition to studying, the school also provides an area for recreational and athletic activities including the very larger playground, football grounds, and a multi-purpose sports center to be built in the next coming years.  Education  Tam Nong High School offers each grade 10th, 11th, and 12th special education to help students perform well with their own talents. Students must wear uniforms when we go to school. The uniforms for boys consist of blue or dark-colored pants and white shirts. Especially, the girls wear Ao dai. The school functions from 7.00 A.M. to 5 P.M. During the recess hour students often go to the playground or go to the library to read books or newspapers. At break time, they also play sport, etc. The tuition fee is at the same level as public schools in Vietnam. Apart from the statutory fee. Admission  Students who want to be admitted must take a written examination consisting of three tests: Mathematics, Literature, and English.

It is a prodrug of estradiol and appears to be partially protected from first-pass metabolism in the liver and intestines with oral administration, showing greatly improved oral potency compared to estradiol. E2SME has been found to be 9-fold as potent as estradiol by the oral route in rats. Similarly, its bioavailability (16%) was 5-fold greater than that of estradiol via the oral route in rats, and the elimination half-life of released estradiol was 5- to 7-fold longer than that of regular estradiol. Conversely, when E2SME and estradiol were given intravenously in rats, there was no difference between them in terms of potency. In vitro studies revealed that E2SME is not hydrolyzed to estradiol enzymatically but rather is hydrolyzed chemically in biological media such as plasma, apparently dependent on the concentration of protein.

Course The Rio San Jose headwaters are in the Zuni Mountains, near the continental divide in Cibola County, where it is known as Bluewater Creek; about 400 feet of the course is in McKinley County. Bluewater Creek is dammed to form Bluewater Lake, with a capacity of . The name Rio San Jose is used starting from the confluence of Bluewater Creek and Mitchell Draw near Bluewater Village. Entering Valencia County, it flows southeast, through Grants, then turning east near McCartys, flowing through the Acoma Indian Reservation and Laguna Pueblo. The remains of an ancient dam constructed by the Laguna people sometime between 1370–1750 AD is situated within Laguna Pueblo. Below Mesita the river turns southeast again, flowing through a narrow canyon before joining the Rio Puerco in Bernalillo County. The entire course of the river below Bluewater Creek is roughly paralleled by the BNSF Railway tracks (formerly the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad, built around 1882, later absorbed into the AT&SF;). Between Bluewater Village and Mesita the river valley provides the route for old U.S. Route 66 and I-40. Hydrology The water level and streamflow of the Rio San Jose has been measured at a number of sites in Cibola County, New Mexico. Stream gauges have been operated by the USGS near Laguna, Correo, and at Acoma Pueblo, near Grants. The gauge at Acoma Pueblo has a record that commenced in 1937, and is the only one still active. It measures flow from a contributing area of , from a larger drainage basin of . The mean flow between 1937 and 2016 was , with the lowest daily flow recorded in July 2014 at . The highest river level recorded occurred in September 1963 with a height of through the gauge, giving a corresponding flow of , although this peak flow was affected by diversion or regulation. Since the 1870s the flow of the upper river has been substantially modified by demands for irrigation, groundwater abstraction and a dam on the Bluewater Creek. A report in 1982 showed that the natural flow was estimated to be between and , as opposed to the measured mean flow of .

The region has been described as a “sea of grass that forms the best and most intact example of an undisturbed steppe ecosystem and is also one of the last areas in the Palearctic that still supports stable herds of larger vertebrates” in a semi-mountainous area. The area also has flat wetlands that are important to migratory birds. The ecoregion is in the Palearctic realm, with a Cold semi-arid climate. It covers .  Location and description  The ecoregion circles around half of the Khentii Mountains, then stretches over 1,000 kilometers east of Ulan Bator into northeasteastern Mongolia through the semi-arid region south and east of Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai, Russia. A prominent feature is the Onon River flowing east through mid-sized mountains (1,400 - 1,800 meters in height) to the Amur River.  Climate  Because of its altitude and distance from the ocean, the ecoregion has a Subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification Dwc). This indicates a continental climate characterized by short, cool summers, and very cold, long winters, with wide differences between day and night temperatures. This region is also heavily influenced by the high barometric pressures over Mongolia. Mean temperatures range from -30° C (January) to +24° C (August). Average annual precipitation is 150 mm.  Flora and fauna  The steppe lands of the ecoregion are characterized by sedges (family Carex) and grasses (family Poaceae), forming meadow steppe, herbs steppe and sandy saltmarsh steppe. Along the lake shores are salt-loving plants and reed beds. The forests of the area are mostly Asian black birch (Betula dahurica), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), and Siberian larch (Larix sibirica). Aspen groves are found in some mountain areas. Herds of Mongolian Gazelle (Procapra gutturosa) roam the grasslands of the region, which is at the northern edge of their territory. The broken terrain of mountains and ravines support small mammals, including the Lesser white-toothed shrew (Crocidura sauveolens), Eurasian harvest mouse (Micromys minutus), and Maximowicz's vole (Microtus maximowiczii). Predators include the wolf, polecat, Eurasian badger, and Pallas's cat (Otocolobus manul).  Protections  The federally protected areas in the region are: * Alkhanay National Park. An IUCN class II National Park located in the Zabaykalsky Krai region of southern Siberia, covering a forested, mountainous area surrounded by steppe terrain. (Area: 1,382 km2). * Daursky Nature Reserve. An IUCN class Ia \\"strict ecological reserve\\" (a Zapovednik) located on the border of Russia and Mongolia, protecting wetlands and lakes.

Built in 1904 in the Romanesque Revival architectural style, the building today serves as office space. In 2019, it was listed as a contributing property in the Lawrenceville Historic District.  History  The original idea for the bath house came from the Clothing and House Furnishing Bureau. The group was organized by parishioners from local churches, including St. James Episcopal Church, in 1895. The organization spent the first years of its life providing working-class families with clothing at fair prices. They soon realized that since several families often lived in single-family homes, that this meant that regular and proper bathing was hard to come by. This encouraged the group to purchase land for a bath house in 1901, and construction began in April 1903. Two prominent philanthropists, Henry W. Phipps Jr. and George Westinghouse, helped make the building's existence possible. Phipps grew up in Allegheny City, now Pittsburgh's North Side, and was a neighbor of Andrew Carnegie. Phipps worked as a business partner with Carnegie, and when Carnegie Steel Company was sold, Phipps began making philanthropic donations, although he did not publicize this. One of these donations was to the Pittsburgh Wash House. Phipps initially offered the group constructing the bath house $1,000, but after investigating further and becoming more interested, he offered to fund half of the cost of the building, and half of the first year's expenses.First Report of Public Wash House and Baths Association of Pittsburgh, 5. Westinghouse was generally against philanthropy as he believed it wasn’t beneficial to the giver or the receiver.I.E. Levine, Inventive Wizard: George Westinghouse, New York: Julian Messner, 1962, pg. 136. Nonetheless, he donated the electric generator and other related equipment which allowed the bath house to also operate a laundry facility.Henry G. Prout, A Biography of George Westinghouse, pg. 295. After funding for the project was secured, the Building and Advisory Committees chose the architectural firm Rutan & Russell to design the building.“New Wash and Bath House.” The Pittsburgh Gazette. 2 Apr 1903. Pg. 9. Construction of the building finished the next year, with the public opening held on June 1st, 1904, making it the third public wash house in the United States.“Need of Public Baths,” Pittsburgh Daily Post, 9 June, 1905, pg 19. The building was unique among bath houses, because in addition to offering bathing facilities for men and women, it also offered a means to wash ones clothes, and a clothing exchange and sewing facility. The building also included an assembly room, men's clubrooms, and a day kindergarten.“Public Baths to be Erected.” Pittsburg Daily Post. 1 Feb. 1903. Pg. 27. After World War I the number of patrons dropped and by 1928 the bath house had to ask the city council for $2,000 for repairs.“Repairs asked from Council.” Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. 1 March 1928. Pg. 15. In 1929 nearly 1,500,000 baths had been taken in the house, and many others had used the building for other purposes.“Monday’s Wash—Saturday’s Bath Possible by Community House.” The Pittsburgh Press. 15 March 1929. Pg. 33. By the 1950s use started to slow as the Pittsburgh City Council made indoor plumbing and bathing facilities mandatory in every house, and the bath house closed for good on December 7th, 1961. Since then the building has been vacant at times and occupied by several different businesses at others. In 2001 it was renovated to house office spaces. The building was nominated in January 2018 to become a City Historic Landmark by Preservation Pittsburgh.  Architecture  The building was designed by architectural firm Rutan & Russell in the Romanesque Revival style. Elements of this style can be seen with the buildings massing, springing arches, as well as the recessed entrance. Rutan & Russell were later recognized for their work contributing to the continuation of this particular style in Pittsburgh.Margaret Henderson Floyd, Architecture After Richardson: Regionalism Before Modernism— Longfellow, Alden, and Harlow in Boston and Pittsburgh. U of Chicago P, 1994, 242. The construction for the building was done by George A. Cochrane, and the plumbing by McFadden & Craig, both of whom had worked on numerous buildings in Pittsburgh previously.George Thornton Fleming, History of Pittsburgh and Environs, American Historical Society, 1922, 276.

She is also the leader of the party's parliamentary group in the National Council since 2018. Previously, she was a member of the National Council and from 2015 to 2018, and a member of the Gemeinderat and Landtag of Vienna, where she also led the NEOS group. She returned to the National Council after the resignation of Matthias Strolz in 2018. Education and personal life Meinl-Reisinger was born Beate Reisinger on 25 April 1978. She attended the Wasagasse grammar school, then studied law at the University of Vienna and completed her Masters in European Studies at the Danube University Krems. She then completed a trainee program for EU academics at the Austrian Economic Chamber. In this context, she worked for the European Commission and as an assistant to Othmar Karas in the European Parliament. After the trainee program, she worked as a deputy managing director at \\"Women in the Economy\\", a department of the Economic Chamber. She held further positions at the Federal Ministry of Economics and Labor and the Federal Ministry of Economics, Family and Youth. Subsequently, she worked as a consultant for women's, family, and integration policy in the cabinet of State Secretary Christine Marek. In 2009, she became a political advisor for the Vienna branch of the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP). Meinl-Reisinger is married and has three children. Political career From 2010 to 2012, Meinl-Reisinger was a member of the Vienna branch of the ÖVP women's association.ÖVP internal database, accessed on August 9, 2015 (entry: 18 March 2010, member until: 13 September 2012) After the birth of her second daughter in 2012, Meinl-Reisinger became involved with the new party NEOS. She was elected to third place on the party's federal list in the 2013 federal election, and was elected to the National Council. After NEOS merged with the Liberal Forum in 2014, she was elected as one of two federal deputy leaders of the party; she also became chairwoman of its Vienna branch. In the National Council, Meinl-Resinger served as chair of the culture committee and was a member of the judiciary committee, the consumer protection committee, and the family committee. In February 2015, Meinl-Reisinger was selected as the top candidate for the 2015 Viennese state election. On 24 September, she announced her resignation from the National Council to commit time to Viennese politics; she did so on 9 October, two days before the election. She led the party to significant success, winning 6.16% and five seats. She subsequently became chairwoman of the NEOS parliamentary group in the Viennese parliament. In the 2017 federal election, Meinl-Reisinger was again third on the federal list. She did not take her seat after the election, choosing instead to remain active in Viennese politics. Federal NEOS leader Matthias Strolz announced his resignation on 7 May 2018. At a party congress on 23 June 2018, Beate Meinl- Reisinger was elected at his successor with 94.8% of the delegate votes. Upon his resignation from the National Council on 18 October, she took his seat, and replaced him as NEOS group leader. Ahead of this, she resigned from her positions in Vienna, and she was replaced as chairperson and group leader by Christoph Wiederkehr. At a party conference in Vienna on 6 July 2019, Meinl- Reisinger was elected as the top candidate for the 2019 federal election with 96.1% of votes. NEOS won 8.10% of votes in the election, and won 15 seats, an increase of five from its 2013 result.

Wilkinson told The Washington Post that, after conferring with her employees, she told Sanders that the restaurant upholds standards \\"such as honesty, and compassion, and cooperation\\" and asked Sanders to leave, which Sanders did. Wilkinson related that the other people at Sanders' table had been served appetizers and were invited to stay, but they also left, Wilkinson saying their appetizers were on the house. In the morning press briefing of Monday June 25, Sanders said that she and her husband went home.  Political and journalistic responses   Restaurant co-owner  A June 25 Washington Post article quoted restaurant co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson as saying she was \\"not a huge fan of confrontation\\" and wanted her business to thrive, but that this felt like \\"the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals.\\" Wilkinson explained that she believed Sanders—significantly, a public official—served in an “inhumane and unethical” administration and \\"publicly defended the president’s cruelest policies.\\"  Trump administration  After a server made a social media post that caused wider media attention, at 10:53am the next day (Saturday June 23) Sanders tweeted, \\"Last night I was told by the owner of Red Hen in Lexington, VA, to leave because I work for @POTUS, and I politely left. Her actions say far more about her than about me.\\" In the press briefing of Monday, June 25, Sanders spoke out against \\"hate and vandalism\\" against the restaurant and also said that \\"calls for harassment and push for any Trump supporter to avoid the public is unacceptable.\\" On about August 2, in the context of her accusation that the press verbally assaults the president and members of his administration, Sanders said that as far as she knew she is \\"the first press secretary in the history of the United States that’s required Secret Service protection.\\" At 7:41am on Monday, June 25, President Donald Trump tweeted that the restaurant should focus more on cleaning its \\"filthy canopies, doors and windows (badly needs a paint job) rather than refusing to serve a fine person like Sarah Huckabee Sanders,\\" adding that \\"I always had a rule, if a restaurant is dirty on the outside, it is dirty on the inside!\\" (Virginia health department records show the restaurant \\"easily passed its most recent inspections.\\") After comments made by Congresswoman Maxine Waters calling for her supporters to confront Trump Cabinet officials in public spaces like restaurants, President Trump responded on Twitter saying \\"Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!\\"  Other political and journalistic responses  Following the incident, Congresswoman Maxine Waters encouraged her supporters to act similarly saying, \\"Let's make sure we show up wherever we have to show up. And if you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd. And you push back on them. And you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere\\" and “For these members of his Cabinet who remain and try to defend [Trump], they’re not going to be able to go to a restaurant, they’re not going to be able to stop at a gas station, they’re not going to be able to shop [at] a department store. The people are going to turn on them, they’re going to protest, they’re going to absolutely harass them.” House Minority Leader and fellow Democrat Nancy Pelosi publicly disagreed with Waters' statements regarding harassing Trump administration officials calling this \\"unacceptable\\" and calling for civility saying \\"we must strive to make America beautiful again.\\" The controversy caused numerous commentators to write on the issue of civility toward political figures. Karl J. Salzmann wrote in The National Review that \\"in the absence of civility, democracy becomes mob rule\\" and that \\"without civility we turn toward chaos, anarchy, and ultimately constitutional perdition.\\" In contrast, Professor Gerald Postema distinguished political implications from moral considerations, writing that \\"we must resist rushing to the judgment of incivility. Norms of civility can be oppressive, a potent means of muzzling legitimate demands of accountability. Civility should not rule out vigorous articulation of one’s moral views.\\"  Similar incidents  The incident ignited a political debate about civility and invoked comparisons to similar incidents. Commentators referenced the 2012 Masterpiece Cakeshop incident in which a Colorado baker refused to make a custom wedding cake for a gay couple, the 2012 Crumb and Get It bakery incident in which a Virginia baker declined to host a campaign media event for then-Vice President Joe Biden, and the 2015 refusal by county clerk Kim Davis to issue a marriage license to a same-sex couple in Kentucky. Subsequent occurrences The restaurant's Yelp page was quickly flooded with mostly one- and five-star reviews created by opponents and supporters of Wilkinson's action. As of June 25, Yelp was actively monitoring the listing and deleting postings that were perceived as being motivated \\"by the news coverage itself [rather] than [by] the reviewer's personal consumer experience with the business.\\" Fortune magazine reported that, as a result of a tweet by Donald Trump, an unaffiliated District of Columbia restaurant with the same name was targeted by conservatives with negative Yelp reviews and denunciations on Twitter. Other unaffiliated restaurants with the same name in Swedesboro, New Jersey and Old Saybrook, Connecticut, as well as against the Olde Red Hen in Ontario and the Little Red Hen in Muntinlupa, the Philippines, were similarly targeted with negative reviews and criticism on Twitter. Supporters and opponents demonstrated outside the restaurant on June 26, resulting in one arrest and closure of the street in front of the business for two hours. The restaurant remained closed for almost two weeks after the incident, experiencing a protest on its July 9 re-opening but receiving an increase in business in succeeding days. By June 27, the URL of the restaurant's website had been redirected to a site selling erectile dysfunction medication, a Malwarebytes security specialist indicating that the redirect was likely from scammers seeking to \\"capitalize on heightened internet traffic to the website because of the headlines\\" rather than for political purposes. It was reported on June 26 that Sanders was to receive temporary Secret Service protection at her home, protection that Sanders confirmed on about August 2. On September 2, The Roanoke Times reported that the Rockbridge Regional Tourism Board had agreed to spend $5,000 per month from July through September to increase positive digital marketing in response to negative national media coverage after the incident. The money was taken from an emergency fund that constitutes about 20% ($160,000) of its $800,000 overall annual budget. In May 2019, co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson wrote in the Washington Post that the restaurant had been receiving hate mail for nearly a year, but \\"[f]or every hateful message, there was one of gratitude.\\" She reported that \\"business is still good,\\" and \\"to everyone who might be fearful about taking a stand, I say don’t be. Resistance is not futile, for you or your business.\\" Legal issues On Saturday, June 23, Walter Shaub, past director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics under Presidents Obama and Trump (through July 2017), wrote that Sanders' June 23 tweet violated federal law pertaining to Standards of Ethical Conduct / Misuse of Position. Shaub wrote that Sanders used her official government Twitter account, having three million followers, \\"to condemn a private business for personal reasons. Seeks to coerce business by using her office to get public to pressure it. Violates endorsements ban too, which has an obvious corollary for discouraging patronage.\\" In the press briefing of Monday, June 25, Sanders said that over a dozen reporters had contacted her and that multiple news stories had already been issued, so she considered it to be \\"news of the day\\" to which she responded on her official government Twitter account. Some commentators perceived a parallel between the Red Hen incident and the facts underlying the Supreme Court's June 4, 2018, Masterpiece Cakeshop decision, ruling in favor of a Colorado baker who refused to make a custom wedding cake for a gay couple based on the baker's religious opposition to their marriage. However, in contrast to the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 which bars discrimination based on race, religion, national origin and color, Virginia state law does not provide that political affiliation is a protected trait against discrimination.

Music was done by Lucio San Pedro. It starred Alicia Alonzo, Robert Arevalo, Hilda Koronel, Pancho Magalona, Bembol Roco, Gloria Romero, Rosa Rosal, and Tony Santos. The movie spent three weeks in theaters before Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos ordered the military to seize copies of the film. The director was also arrested under the order of Marcos. Sakada was first screened on Philippine television in 2005.

Unrest ensues after a sakada is shot to death by one of the plantation's security guards. As the story unfolds, the movie reveals the exploitative feudal agricultural system of the time.  Production  Sakada was the first film by director Behn Cervantes and scriptwriter Lualhati Bautista. It was filmed under time pressure and budget constraints. As a first-time film director, Cervantes said that he had to deal with technical problems. Time and budget constraints prevented the production from doing reshoots. Sakada was produced and screened in 1976 while the Philippines was under martial law under Ferdinand Marcos. After Sakada's third week of screening in Philippine cinemas, copies of the film were seized and the director was arrested and detained under the order of Marcos. After Cervantes' detention, he wrote in a letter to his family dated January 19, 1978, \\"My movie, Sakada, and my plays, especially the last one, Pagsambang Bayan, show the exploitative nature of this system, the evils the ruling class commit on the many, the need to change the order of things.\\" Sakada was first shown on television on June 25, 2005, on ABCinema, three decades after prints were seized by the military from movie theaters. ABCinema aimed to feature \\"only the best local and foreign films that will make the Filipino audience more aware of their culture.\\" In an interview, Cervantes was asked about how young audiences in 2005 could relate to Sakada. He said society's problems \\"remain the same and most of the time we change leaders but they’re the same dogs with different collars.\\"  Reception  Musical scorer Lutgardo Labad described Sakada as \\"a major cinematic coup that unearthed the inhuman conditions of our people then.\\" Film critic Mel Tobias wrote that \\"any book on Filipino films would be incomplete without mentioning Sakada.\\" He wrote that the film \\"was a cry to the people and the government to awaken to the serious labor problems in the Philippines. In the process, it stimulated the often infantile movie producers to acknowledge this unorthodox film, made contrary to the traditional formula of Philippine moviemaking.\\" He also praised the performance of the star-studded cast, particularly of Rosa Rosal, \\"a versatile actress, [who] made a sensational comeback in her portrayal of a sentimental widow. She is driven to become a leader of the sakadas in their fight for reform.\\" \\"The film, with its searing focus on the desperate plight of seasonal sugarcane workers, was an eye-opener for most viewers lulled by the martial law era’s siren call of 'the true, the good and the beautiful,'\\" wrote an Inquirer editorial. Sakada was made at a time of strict censorship, according to Philippine national artist for literature Bienvenido Lumbera, yet \\"the ingenuity of scriptwriters and directors was able to offer movie-goers works that went beyond entertainment and tackled subject matter with social implications.\\" In the essay \\"Terror and Culture under Marcos' New Society,\\" Lumbera wrote that Sakada \\"exposed the abuses and injustices committed by landlords in cahoots with the military in the suppression of the peasant struggle for higher wages and better treatment.\\" Sakada, in 1981, won a Dekada Award for Best Film of the Decade.

He fought in the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese Civil War, and the Korean War, and was Commander of the PLA's 61st Division in the Battle of Dengbu Island (1949). He later served as Commander of the 21st Army, Deputy Commander of the Lanzhou Military Region, Deputy Director of the Revolutionary Committee of Shaanxi Province, Director of the General Office of the Central Military Commission, and Deputy Chief of Staff of the PLA.  Biography  Hu was born Hu Shoude (胡守德) in Yudian Township, Xincai County, Henan Province in August 1920. In the 1930s, he participated in student protests against Japanese aggressions in China. When the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out, he joined the Communist resistance forces in southern Henan and later the New Fourth Army. He fought in many battles against both the Japanese and the Kuomintang (KMT) forces and rose to the position of regimental political commissar. During the Chinese Civil War, he served as Political Department Director of the Fourth Brigade, Second Column of the East China Field Army, and fought in the battles of Subei (宿北), Ningxiang (宁象), Menglianggu, Linqu (临朐), and Huaihai. In 1949, he was appointed Commander of the 61st Division of the 21st Army of the PLA at the age of only 29, becoming the youngest commander of the division. In early November 1949, Hu commanded the 61st Division in the Battle of Dengbu Island, in an attempt to take the island of the Zhoushan Archipelago from KMT forces. PLA forces would rapidly take the island's heartland from Nationalist forces by the second day of the battle, however, would falter in the following two days and nights with the arrival of multiple regiments of Nationalist reinforcements. Recognizing the enemy's numerically superior strength, Hu's forces feigned several attacks before safely withdrawing on the night of November 5th. While KMT forces would ultimately secure the strategically important island, Hu Wei's command demonstrated strong control over the course of the battle and exemplified his talent as a commander. The Communists safely landed on the island, fought as they wished (even striking the Nationalist's headquarters at one point in the battle) and retreated when they realized the situation was not in their favor. According to the Kuomintang, the Communist PLA forces suffered 3,700 casualties and 1,500 soldiers were captured, whereas 1,919 KMT soldiers were killed and more than 900 wounded. The battle, together with the Battle of Guningtou, is celebrated in Taiwan as a victory that helped save it from Communist occupation. According to the PLA, Hu retreated due to the lack of reinforcements and his forces killed, wounded, or captured 3,396 KMT troops. In 1953, Hu Wei fought in the Korean War as Chief of Staff of the 21st Army of the People's Volunteer Army. After returning to China, he served successively as Deputy Commander, Political Commissar, and Commander of the 21st Army. He attained the rank of major general in 1961. During the Cultural Revolution, Hu was promoted to Deputy Commander of the Lanzhou Military Region in 1969 while concurrently serving as Commander of the 21st Army. He also served as Deputy Director of the Revolutionary Committee of Shaanxi as well as Party Secretary of the province. In December 1974, Hu was appointed Director of the General Office of the Central Military Commission and Deputy Chief of Staff of the People's Liberation Army. He was also an alternate member of the 9th and 10th Central Committees of the Communist Party of China. He retired in 1984. Hu died on 20 June 2018 in Beijing, at the age of 97.

Date, genre and sources  Yuki-onna Monogatari is a work of the otogi-zōshi genre in two books (one volume). It was probably composed in the Azuchi-Momoyama period or the beginning of the Edo period. It is one of a number of works depicting the defeat of a monster and the legendary origin of a famous sword, other such works including the Heike Tsurugi no Maki (平家剣巻). This particular work portrays a marriage to a ghostly figure (怪婚 kai-kon), which is not an uncommon theme in such stories. The work shows the influence of the yōkyoku (Noh libretti) Kokaji. In his article for the Nihon Koten Bungaku Daijiten, Motoichi Kinoshita also notes the apparent influences of setsuwa such as Izumi Shikibu Inari-mōde (和泉式部稲荷詣), Rashōmon Modori-bashi (羅生門戻橋), Tsuchi-gumo Taiji (土蜘蛛退治) and Tamamono Mae (玉藻前), as well as the Noh play Momiji-gari, on the work. The word yuki-onna appears in the kōwakamai Fushimi Tokiwa (伏見常盤), and the motif of people being taken by old raccoons is also seen in a story in the Kokon Chomonjū.  Plot  In the first year of Chōtoku (995), Emperor Ichijō is told in a dream to commission the forging of a sword by Sanjō no Kokaji Munechika (三条小鍛冶宗近). Munechika, with the assistance of the god Inari, forges the valuable blade '. That winter, a malevolent female raccoon dog manifests as a yuki-onna and starts spiriting people away. Several warriors, including the retainers of Tada Mitsunaka, are commissioned to eliminate the beast, and manage to injure it but fail to capture it. The following spring, Taira no Kanenobu encounters a beautiful woman on and takes her home with him. Kanenobu's former lover realizes the woman's true nature and attempts to warn him, but is strangled to death. A fortune-teller tells Kanenobu that this was the work of the yuki-onna, and Kanenobu uses the sword Kogitsune-maru, with which he is entrusted by the emperor, to slay the creature.  Textual tradition  In the holdings of the Katei Archives (霞亭文庫) in the University of Tokyo, there is a Shōkaiban (松会版) printed edition dating to Kanbun 5 (1665). The 1909 Kinko Shōsetsu Kaidai (近古小説解題) also reproduces a Manji 3 (1660) edition printed by Ishizu Hachirō Uemon (石津八郎右衛門).

Surfbuzz.com  In November 1999, Meshkin co-founded Internet incentives company Surfbuzz.com with his brother, Alex Meshkin. Surfbuzz folded the following year after spending between $3 million and $4 million in seed money.  Salugen, Inc.  Salugen, Inc., incorporated in April 2005, sold dietary supplements and direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic tests -- a relatively new business model that was lightly regulated at that time. In June 2008, the California Department of Public Health issued cease- and-desist notices to 13 genetics companies, including Salugen, for improper marketing of DTC tests. Salugen was ordered not to test Californians until it was licensed as a clinical laboratory in California, and to perform only validated tests ordered by a licensed physician. On September 10, 2008, Salugen executives other than CEO Meshkin resigned, citing the firm's inability \\"to raise capital, adequately perform operational activities or compensate employees and vendors\\" under his direction. Soon afterwards Salugen was acquired by Sherbrooke Equity A.G. Despite raising further capital on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Salugen was wound up the following year.  Proove Biosciences  Meshkin founded Proove Biosciences in December 2009. Proove Biosciences began marketing a test called the \\"Proove Opioid Risk test\\" (POR) which it claimed could predict with high accuracy which patients would become addicted to or misuse prescribed opioid pain pills. Other Proove products included Proove Pain Perception, Proove Opioid Response, and Proove Drug Metabolism. Proove Bioscience's business model involved practices that appeared to generate potential conflicts of interest. Proove Biosciences was running research programs out of hospital clinics. In fact, more than 90% of patients tested were enrolled on clinical studies administered by Proove. Proove offered a payment to clinicians for each patient recruited to these studies. This arrangement could have given clinicians a financial incentive to enroll patients to research program, and thereby enrich Proove Biosciences by allowing insurance reimbursement for those patients. Further concerns were raised when scientists and clinicians expressed reservations about the quality of the evidence supporting the POR. Former employees said that Meshkin, who has no background in science, asserted control over the company's research program: \\"It was marketing. It wasn’t science.\\" In May 2017, a whistleblower lawsuit filed against Proove Biosciences in 2015 by Bruce Gardner, a former employee, was unsealed. The complaint alleges that Proove submitted false claims to Medicare in violation of the False Claims Act and federal Anti- Kickback Statute. The suit asserts that Proove billed for medically unnecessary genetic tests and engaged in a sophisticated kickback scheme with physicians. On June 7, 2017, the FBI raided the offices of Proove Biosciences in Irvine, CA, in relation to an investigation of health care fraud. On August 7, 2017, Proove Biosciences was placed into court-ordered receivership. On August 31, 2017, it was reported that Meshkin was no longer CEO at Proove Biosciences. On August 4, 2020, the former Vice President of Market Development for Proove, Donald Joseph Matthews, pled guilty in federal court to conspiring to pay physicians kickbacks to order genetic tests for Medicare beneficiaries in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute.

Along with Xu Xi, Huang is considered a founding master of the bird-and-flower painting. Huang Quan was highly prolific: the 1120 catalog Xuanhe Huapu alone critiques 349 of his works. Unfortunately few are extant. Early life Huang Quan was born in 903, when the Tang empire had irretrievably collapsed into warlordism and civil strife. Around this time, many painters took refuge in Chengdu, Huang Quan's hometown and the capital of the relatively peaceful Xichuan Circuit, then controlled by the warlord Wang Jian. (Wang Jian founded the Former Shu empire in 907 after the Tang dynasty ended.) When Huang Quan was 12, he began his study of painting with the bird-and-flower painter Diao Guangyin (刁光胤), who had arrived in Chengdu from the Tang capital Chang'an in 903. Whereas Diao's other student Kong Song (孔嵩) never progressed beyond faithful reproduction of Diao's technique, Huang Quan sought to develop his own. He studied the water paintings of Sun Wei (孫位), another refugee from Chang'an, as well as the landscape paintings of Li Sheng (李昇), a leading local painter. By combining the strengths of all his teachers Huang was able to create a superior style. In 919, the 16-year-old Huang Song became an imperial attendant (待詔) in the Painting Academy of Former Shu, which probably lasted until 925 when the Former Shu was conquered by the Later Tang empire.

The company operates outpatient diagnostic imaging centers. RadNet is the largest provider of outpatient imaging services in the United States.  History  RadNet was founded in 1981 as a small imaging center in Los Angeles. The nascent company was concerned with providing billing and administrative services to large medical care providers, with the initial RadNet imaging center being located near Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. In 1992 the company was bought by Primedex Health Systems, a California-based management company that catered to small medical clinics. In addition, much of Primedex's business was focused around dealing with workers' compensation claims. At the time of Primedex's acquisition of RadNet, the larger company was going through a period of rapid expansion; however, this growth was cut short in 1993 when the State of California implemented statuary changes to the way workers' compensation was managed. The changes made by California forced Primedex to switch its business focus, resulting in more funding being allocated for other services. Many of the company's new initiatives were centered around diagnostic imaging services, which were managed by RadNet. This growth within the greater Primedex conglomerate resulted in RadNet gaining considerable influence. By the end of the 1990s, RadNet had replaced effectively Primedex as the parent company, with many of Primedex's assets being folded into subsidiaries of RadNet.The History of Workers' Compensation in California, Rand Corporation, Monograph reports URL:https://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR919/mr919.sec2.html In the early 2000s RadNet began a period of business expansion by acquiring smaller radiology firms and incorporating said firm's practice into RadNet's growing list of assets. The company repurchased its debt in 2005 and in 2006 worked with General Electric to secure a $450 million syndicated loan with which to continue its corporate acquisitions. 2006 also saw RadNet and Primedex split their stock, resulting in RadNet becoming the official parent company and Primedex becoming a subsidiary. RadNet joined the S&P; 600 in November 2019, replacing American newspaper provider Gannett Co.  Operations  As of 2020 RadNet has continued to execute its plan for the strategic acquisition of new assets, namely smaller imaging centers. The company has also begun to open new outpatient centers to work with existing healthcare networks. RadNet also moved to acquire DeepHealth, a machine learning firm working to develop radiology artificial intelligence.

He later engaged in business in Maine and Barbados. Early life Leader was born in 1609. On October 11, 1628, he married Elizabeth Stacy of Uckfield. They had two children together. He was a merchant in Salehurst and engaged in trade between England and Ireland. Saugus Iron Works It is unknown how Leader acquired his knowledge in metallurgy, but it is likely that he had some contact with the Irish ironmaking industry. In 1645, the Company of Undertakers for the Iron Works in New England hired Leader to replace John Winthrop the Younger as manager. He was given a seven-year contract with a salary of £100 a year from the Undertakers. After arriving in Massachusetts, Leader reviewed site survey for the iron works in Braintree and looked into some other locations. He selected a location in Lynn (now part of present-day Saugus) on the Saugus River. The new iron works, which was called Hammersmith, began operations in 1646. Leader leased the site from Thomas Dexter for £40, until May 1647, when Leader bought him out. In 1650, Leader, who had encountered difficulties with the Undertakers, left the Iron Works and was replaced by John Gifford. Religion In 1646, when Robert Child, Samuel Maverick, and William Vassall were imprisoned by the Massachusetts General Court for their petition for freedom of religion, they were confined to Leader's house. Child wrote that Leader had more \\"curious books than I, especially about Divinity businesses.\\" In May 1651, Leader was found guilty of reproaching the church and government. He was fined £200, later reduced to £50. He made an acknowledgment and paid the fine. Maine and Barbados After leaving the iron works, Leader attempted to mine copper at John Endecott's farm in Salem, Massachusetts (now part of present-day Topsfield). The business was not successful. In 1650, Leader moved to South Berwick, Maine (then part of Kittery), where he had been granted the exclusive right to use the Little River to erect mills. The sawmill, which had nineteen saws, was called the \\"Great Works\\" and did a great deal of business until it was stopped due to a legal dispute with the heirs of John Mason. In 1652, Leader became a magistrate. When the Massachusetts Bay Colony extended their jurisdiction into the Province of Maine, Leader went to London to protest on behalf of the government of Edward Godfrey. On April 3, 1652, Leader purchased a house and farm in Strawbery Banke (New Hampshire) for £180. He sold the property in 1655 to the Cutts brothers. He was described by the Cutts as \\"brother Leader\\", so it is supposed that he was married to a member of that family by this time. By 1656, Leader was in Barbados, where he engaged in sugar-refining and salt manufacturing. In a letter from 1660, he complained about the island's climate and stated that if it wasn't for the slave labor available in Barbados, he would prefer to reside in New England. He also wrote that he intended to leave \\"this western world\\" for Ireland, as he saw \\"no place either for profit or pleasure so good as Ireland\\", which was remarkable considering that conditions there following the Cromwellian war were very poor. Illness prevented Leader from leaving Barbados until the spring of 1661. He died in Kittery on December 27, 1661. He was survived by two daughters, Elizabeth Hole, who was killed by Native Americans on May 4, 1705, and Anna Clark of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, who lived until at least 1723.

He was imprisoned in 1926 and executed in 1931.  Biography  He was born in a peasant family in Bochkarevo, now in the Kirensky District of the Irkutsk Oblast. He found an opportunity to study at the . In 1915–17, he served as a mechanic at the Kharkov Telegraph Office. At the outbreak of the October Revolution of 1917, Kozhevnikov became a member of the Communist Party and was soon appointed commissar of the Kharkiv postal and telegraph district. In February 1918, he became an extraordinary commissioner for five southern postal and telegraph districts, and from May to September 1918, Kozhevnikov became extraordinary commissar for communications of the entire Donets-Krivoy Rog Soviet Republic. In August 1918, the Revolutionary Military Council decided to send an expeditionary partisan detachment to the rear of the White Guard troops on the Eastern Front. In September 1918, Kozhevnikov was chosen to organize the partisan struggle in Tatarstan and Bashkortostan. The detachment of Kozhevnikov, formed mainly from volunteers of the Kursk, Nizhny Novgorod and Astrakhan postal and telegraph districts, numbered initially some 500 men. By November 1918, his detachment already had 12,000 men and became known as the . In early December 1918, an order was sent from Moscow to redeploy the Partisan Army through the Bugulma railway station to the Southern Front and concentrate it in the area of Novy Oskol in the Kursk province. In January 1919, Kozhevnikov detachments numbered more than 30,000 men who fought in the battles for Kupyansk, Starobelsk and Lugansk. Soon on the basis of these forces, the 13th Red Army was formed under the command of Kozhevnikov. The bulk of the army's personnel consisted of natives of Tatarstan. In a telegram, Yakov Sverdlov reported in February 1919: \\"In the Kozhevnikov army there are over 10,000 Muslims\\". On April 16, 1919, he was replaced by Anatoliy Gekker at the head of the 13th Army. In 1920, Kozhevnikov served in the , as commissar of the detachment. In May 1921, Kozhevnikov sent an emissary to the Primorsky Krai for the organization of the partisan movement. In 1922–23, Kozhevnikov became Ambassador in the Bukharan People's Soviet Republic and Lithuania, and in 1924–1926, worked in the People's Commissariat for Posts and Telegraphs of the USSR. Kozhevnikov's career ended on January 21, 1926, when he was arrested by the OGPU and sent to the Solovki prison camp. At Solovki, there was a camp for juvenile offenders (for children aged 12–16), of which prisoner Kozhevnikov became the director. In 1931, Kozhevnikov fled the camp, but was soon caught and severely beaten. He was examined by a commission of psychiatrists, which concluded that Kozhevnikov was mentally paranoid. After that, Kozhevnikov was taken to Moscow and shot around April 15, 1931.

It is a rare example of a rammed earth structure totally contained within later extensions, representative of the type of dwelling built in the York area, and elsewhere, during the early settlement years. Eliza's Cottage is a simple, Victorian Georgian style building with a central two room \\"core\\" constructed from rammed earth, later extensions constructed from soft fired bricks that surround the original two rooms, and more recent extensions at the rear of the building constructed from hard fired bricks. The exterior of the cottage has been rendered. The single storey structure has a broken pitched, hipped roof covered with corrugated galvanised iron. Three simple brick chimney stacks protrude through the roof on the northern side of the cottage. Assessment Documentation The widespread use of rammed earth as a construction method during the 1830s and 1840s probably places Eliza's Cottage somewhere within this time frame. At this stage however, it is impossible to say who built the cottage or for whom it was built. As it was located on Rivett Henry Bland's land it is possible that the cottage was built by Bland to house labourers or possibly an overseer. It is considered that there was definitely a house on the property when Burton purchased it in 1860, as bricks had replaced rammed earth as the preferred material. The cottage was built in several stages. The first stage is represented by two core rooms and is thought to date to the early 1840s. The first alterations probably occurred in the 1870s when the cottage was considerable enlarged. The next known alterations occurred in 1988 when additions were added to the rear. The name of the original owner or occupant is not known, though the land was owned by Bland and it is likely that he lived here at some point. In 1855, the land was sold to Stephen Stanley Parker, who also may have lived here for a while before building Bridge House. Parker sold off a portion of Avon Location t (3 roods) to Henry Burton in 1860.DOLA Memorial Book VII, No. 189. Burton had arrived in Western Australia on 1 June 1850 aboard Scindian. He was an enrolled pensioner guard and was listed as a labourer living in York in the 1859 census. Burton sold the cottage to Harden York, a victualler at York, in March 1870 for the sum of £35.DOLA Memorial Book VII, No. 189 dated 17/11/1870 York soon moved on to Beverley, where he set himself up as a shopkeeper, and he sold the cottage in 1874 to Thomas Tomkinson, a carpenter in York, for £40.DOLA Memorial Book VIII, No. 67 dated 30/12/1874. Tomkinson was born in 1830 and had arrived in Western Australia . He married three times and was widowed twice. At the time of his purchase of Eliza's Cottage he had five children. Tomkinson had owned the cottage for nine years when he sold it in 1883 to George Bird of Albany. He obtained a price of £120.DOLA Memorial Book IX, No. 342 dated 18/10/1883. The considerable increase in the resale value of the property suggests that major improvements had been made to the building by Tomkinson prior to the sale. Tomkinson may possibly have made the additions himself, as by 1883 he was described as a builder. Bird sold the property in 1886 to Richard Chipper, a publican at York.DOLA Memorial Book IX, No. 1516 dated 25/2/1887. It is highly likely that both Bird and Chipper had purchased with a view to its investment value, rather than to occupy it themselves. Chipper died in 1888 and the property spent a while in limbo while his trustees ordered his estate.DOLA Memorial Book XIV, No. 29 dated 2/12/1901. The cottage was sold by George Stirling (operating on behalf of the trustees) for £120 in 1901 to William Cox, a teamster living in York. To purchase the cottage, Cox borrowed £50 from Mary Neville.DOLA Memorial Book XIV, No. 30 dated 26/5/1902. Cox defaulted on his payments and the property passed into the possession of Neville, who sold the cottage in 1920 to Janet Clement.DOLA Memorial Book XXV, No. 54. The cottage had several owners following on from Clement and it was in 1988, during the occupancy of Michael and Alice Woods, that additions were made to the rear of the cottage.Plan submitted to Shire of York dated October 1988.

Cooley, The Cambridge Manual of Latin Epigraphy (Cambridge: University Press, 2012), p. 468 The expert consensus agrees that Rufus should be identified with the Acilius Rufus whom Pliny the Younger mentions in his letters on the trial of Varenus Rufus who was prosecuted for malfeasance while governor of Bithynia and Pontus.Epistulae, V.20; VI.13 There is disagreement over identifying Acilius Rufus the consul with one Lucius Acilius Rufus, a senator known from an inscription from Thermae Himeraeae. This inscription attests that this Acilius Rufus held the traditional republican magistracies of quaestor of Sicilia, plebeian tribune, praetor, and prefect of the frumenti dandi ex senatus consultum. Although there appears to be no reason not to identify this person with the consul, Ronald Syme objects arguing that the first suffect consul of a year was a very prestigious post, and that having been quaestor of Sicilia and prefect of the frumenti dandi, Acilius Rufus lacked sufficient esteem for him to achieve that prestigious rank of suffect consuls.Syme, \\"Superior Suffect Consuls\\", Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 58 (1985), pp. 239f As a result, he notes the existence of one Marcus Acilius Rufus of Saguntum who was an imperial procurator, and proposes that a hypothetical descendant of this procurator was suffect consul for this nundinium of 107.Syme, \\"Superior Suffect Consuls\\", p. 241 Despite his proven discernment for the evidence, Syme appears to depend too heavily on an argument from silenceespecially as we know so little about many consuls of this timeto not allow for the vagaries of life. In this case, Licinius Sura vanishes from the record after this consulate, so it is possible he died in March 107 and the consular Acilius Rufus, who is attested as replacing a single consul, may have been selected at the last moment to complete the nundinium. Nevertheless our lack of evidence in turn prevents us from confidently accepting this surmise.

It has been found to have a dramatically prolonged duration of action with oral administration in animals, similarly to the related compound quinestrol (the 3-cyclopentyl ether of ethinylestradiol). A single oral dose of EBCO sustained high uterus weights for 3 weeks in rats. This long-lasting activity may be due to storage of EBCO in fat. It appears that EBCO is absorbed satisfactorily from the gastrointestinal tract, at least partially survives first-pass metabolism in the liver and intestines, and is then sequestered into fat, from which it is slowly released and activated into estradiol. In contrast to quinestrol, the oral activity of EBCO is greatly improved when it is delivered in an oil solution as opposed to an aqueous vehicle.

The simple Norman church is now remote from the village it served. It has some of the best preserved medieval wall paintings in Britain.

The small village has two notable Anglican churches, the other, St Edward's Church, is Grade II* listed. The church, dedicated to Edward the Confessor, was built (1903–4) as a chapel of ease by the Lord of the Manor and major landowner, William Lygon, 7th Earl Beauchamp, because St Mary's was too far away from the main centres of population in the parish and liable to flooding. The newer church was built to the design of Randall Wells. St Edward’s became the parish church following the redundancy of St Mary's in 1975.

In this election, Putin-led United Russia party, which also nominated him as a presidential candidate, worsened its result compared to the 2007 elections. United Russia though took first place, gaining 49%, but lost 77 places. In the 2007 elections, United Russia scored 64%.

Life Bannister was born in 1757. She came from a notable family - her uncles were Francis Rundell, a successful actor and Philip Rundell who was a financially successful goldsmith. Her aunt was Maria Eliza Rundell the early cookery writer. However her own mother had been disowned by that family. Her mother is only known by her married name as Mrs Harpur and that she was an entertainer. In 1777 she appeared singing at Marylebone Gardens. where coincidentally Charles Bannister was also on the programme. She would in time marry his son. The following year she was at the Haymarket Theatre and she went from there to George Colman the Elder's Little Theatre. She was known for singing and playing the guitar but In 1778 she was also appearing in The Beggar's Opera as Polly. Bannister commanded high salaries of £12 a week and contracts worth \\"one thousand pounds\\" whilst also enjoying a genteel reputation. She was the principal soloist at the Haymarket where she was supported by Margaret Martyr, Giovanna Sestini and Mrs Kennedy, although it was said that they never found a male singer of the same quality of voice and appearance to sing with her. Bannister married Charles Bannister's son John Bannister on 26 January 1783 who was a skilled and successful actor. Her new husband was concerned about the rise of John Philip Kemble as a competitor and his Elizabeth taught John to sing to help him compete. They had four daughters and his wife retired in 1792 to concentrate on their family. In 1799 John Russell completed a pastel of her playing her guitar which is in the National Portrait Gallery. In 1827 she saw Paris whilst touring with her husband. She died a widow on 15 January 1849 at her home in St Giles in Middlesex and was buried with her husband.

Description Colletes cinicularius is a large species of Colletes which has an unbanded, hairy, black abdomen which contrasts with the thorax which is covered with brown hair. The most likely confusion species in Britain is Andrena scotica as this also has an early flight period but C. cunicularius is larger than A.scotica with longer antennae and does not have a fovea on the face. The males are smaller and paler than the females. Distribution Colletes cunicularius is widespread in the Palearactic from Great Britain in the west to the Pacific coasts of Siberia and China in the east. In Great Britain it was restricted to the western coastal areas between south Wales and Cumbria but it has been expanding its range inland. it had recently colonised Jersey from the nearby continent and this may also be the source of Colletes cunicularius which have begun to breed in southern England. Habitat and ecology Colletes cunicularius is a species associated with sparsely vegetated sandy areas, in Britain it was associated with large, mature coastal sand dunes which were near to areas where creeping willow (Salix repens) grows. Bees from Europe tended to be associated with alluvial area where rivers in flood has removed most of the vegetation and in both Britain and Europe this species has colonised man-made habitats such as sand pits. The British population was restricted to areas of dunes where it nests in erosion hollows within old dunes. It is univoltine, i.e. there is one generation per year, and it has a flight period of March to May, sometimes into June, which is earlier than most other species of Colletes. C. cunicularius forages from a wide variety of flowers but in Great Britain, the most important is creeping willow with other species of Salix being used if creeping willow is not present. Elsewhere it is much more catholic in the plants it forages from, although in Finland it has also been reported as mainly specialising on willows while in Italy at was recorded as specialising in pollinating species in the family Fabaceae. The male C. cunicularius are the only species which pollinate two species of sexually deceptive orchids which mimic females bees Ophrys exaltata and Ophrys arachntiiformis, although they have been recorded as attempting to pseudocopulating with other species in the genus Ophrys. A male of the solitary bee Colletes cunicularius pseudocopulating on the flower labellum of the orchid Ophrys lupercalis - 1471-2148-10-103-S1 To create the nest the female excavates a tunnel into the sand of around in length which is slightly sloping and has a number of side tunnels towards the deepest part of the tunnel each with a cell at the end. The adult males emerge from the upper cells en masse a day before the females, normally in the afternoon. The brood cells are lined with a cellophane-like membrane that is waterproof, has antifungal properties, and is thought to aid in the maintenance of the appropriate level of humidity as the bee's larvae develop. The membrane is made from a liquid secreted by the Dufour's gland and the female bee uses her short, two-pronged tongue like a paintbrush to smear the oily secretion around the walls of the cells, it then dries into the clear membrane. The females often nest together in large, and noisy, aggregations and when the females first emerge from their cells \\"mating balls\\" can be formed as many males try to mate with a single newly emerged female. In Britain this species has no known parasites but on continental Europe the cuckoo bee Sphecodes albilabris is a cleptoparasite of this species. and the blister beetle Apalus bimaculatus is also recorded as a nest parasite. Subspecies The population of C. cunicularius in western Britain is morphologically and biologically distinct from the continental populations and have been given subspecific status as C. c. celticus.. The chemistry of the secretions of the Dufour's gland have also now been shown to be distinctive in the British subspecies too.

It has greyish, seated, oblong, 2–3 inch long leaves with two to four teeth near the tip and large, showy two-toned flower heads that are bright orange at first by and age to brilliant crimson. From the center of the perianth emerge long styles, higher up bending towards the center of the head, that jointly give the impression of a pincushion. It is called silky-haired pincushion in English and bergluisie in Afrikaans. It can be found in the Western Cape province of South Africa, and flowers from July until January, peaking October and November.  Description  Leucospermum vestitum is a stiff, upright to spreading, evergreen shrub of up to 2½ m (9 ft) high and 3 m (10 ft) in diameter, that grows from a single stout stem with a smooth grey bark. The flowering stems are 5–8 mm (0.20-0.32 in) in diameter, stiff upright to horizontally spreading, with a thin covering of powdery hairs. The seated and hairless leaves are oblong, elliptic or narrowly oval, 5–7½ cm (2–3 in) long and 1–3 cm (0.4–1.2 in) wide, cut-off or heart-shaped at the foot the tip pointy or with two to four teeth, arranged alternately and somewhat overlapping. The flower heads are egg- to globe-shaped, 7–9 cm (2.8–3.6 in) in diameter, mostly set individually on the flowering branch. The common base of the flowers in the same head is very narrowly cone-shaped with a pointy tip, 4–5 cm (1.6–2.0 in) long and ¾–1 cm (0.3–0.4 in) across. The bracts subtending the flower head are broadly oval with a pointy to pointed tip, 1–1½ cm (0.4–0.6 in) long and ½–1 cm wide, loosely spreading, membranous, hairless, pale green and shiny, and with a regular row of hairs along the edge. The bract subtending the individual flower is pointy oval, membranous, enveloping the flower at its foot, about 1½ cm long and 5–7 mm wide, hairless or with a very fine powdery covering and with a row of hairs along the edge. The 4-merous perianth is about 3½ cm (1.4 in) long, initially orange but changing to brilliant carmine later. The lower part of the perianth called tube, that remains merged when the flower is open, is about 6 mm (¼ in) long, cylinder- shaped, somewhat compressed sideways and hairless. The middle part (or claws) is crescent-shaped and coiling back on the base. The claw facing the center of the head is hairless, the two sideways facing claws have protruding silky hairs, while the claw facing the edge of the head is entirely covered in protruding silky hairs. The upper part (or limbs), which enclosed the pollen presenter in the bud, are oval, each 4–5 mm (0.16–0.2 in) long and set with long protruding silky hairs. Implanted on the inside of each of the four limbs is an oval anther of about 3 mm (0.12 in) long, on a filament of about 1.0 mm (0.04 in) long. From the centre of the perianth emerges a slender tapering and the upper part slightly curved to the center of the head, style of 5–6 cm (2.0–2.4 in) long that is curved toward the center of the head in the upper third. The thickened part at the tip of the style called pollen presenter is yellow, skewed, egg-shaped with a pointy tip, about 3 mm (0.12 in) long, with the groove that functions as the stigma in a raised papilla at the very tip. The ovary is subtended by four white, blunt, line-shaped scales of 1½–2 mm (0.06–0.08 in) long.  Differences with related species  L. vestitum can be distinguished from related species by the hairless, membranous, loosely spreading involucral bracts, the very narrow, pointy, cone-shaped common base of the flower head, the hairless oblong leaves and the skewed egg-shaped pollen presenter.  Taxonomy  Joseph Martin, a French plant collector who was gardener at the Jardin du Roi in Paris, probably was the first to collect the silky-haired pincushion in 1788. Although there seems to be no written record of his Cape visit en route to Mauritius, the collection of Proteaceae he sent to Jean-Baptiste Lamarck makes it evident that he at least reached the upper Breede River Valley between Worcester and Tulbagh. Lamarck was the first to describe the silky-haired pincushion in 1792 and he named it Protea vestita. Based on another specimen, English botanist Richard Anthony Salisbury described Leucadendrum ellipticum in 1809 in a book titled On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae, that was officially authored by Joseph Knight. Robert Brown published a paper in 1810 called On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae, wherein he created the genus Leucospermum and described Leucospermum medium. In 1816, Jean Louis Marie Poiret, who lumped species that had been assigned to new genera like Leucadendrum and Leucospermum. He assigned Brown's species to Protea, made the new combination Protea media. Edwin Percy Phillips in 1910 distinguished Leucospermum incisum. John Patrick Rourke considered all of these names synonymous, and made created Leucospermum vestitum in 1967 combining the earliest species name with the correct genus name. L. vestitum is the type species of the showy pincushions, section Brevifilamentum. The species name vestitum is Latin and means clothed or covered, probably a reference to the silky hairs that surround the perianth.  Distribution, habitat and ecology  Flowerhead in the bud, showing the involucral bracts and bracteoles. Photo: Tony RebeloThe silky-haired pincushion can be found between Heerenlogementberg (halfway between Klawer and Graafwater) in the north, through the Clanwilliam, Ceres, Piketberg and Tulbagh districts to the Breede River Valley, several kilometers north of Worcester in the south. It was collected on three occasions on the Cape Peninsula (Table Mountain, Lion's Head and Green Point but since 1886 it seems to have disappeared. It also went extinct on the Paarl mountain, close to Paarl. The silky-haired pincushion seems to agree with a range of ecological circumstances, apart from a well-drained rocky slope of Table Mountain Sandstone. It grows at an altitude of 70–1400 m (200–4000 ft), where it mostly appears on slopes facing north or west. It is very tolerant of drought, which frequently occurs in the arid type of fynbos where it grows, with average annual precipitation as low as 250 mm (10 in). In the Tulbagh valley plants will mostly have a stiff upright habit while in northerly populations the shrub are rather more sprawling. The flowers of Leucospermum vestitum are pollinated by birds like the Cape sugarbird and several species of sunbird, that come to feed on the nectar. When the fruits are ripe, about two months after flowering, these fall to the ground, where they attract the attention of ants with the fleshy pale coating called the elaiosome. The ants carry the fruits away to their nests and eat the elaiosome, while the smooth, hard seeds that remain do not fit within the ants' jaws and so remain stored safely underground. The mature plants are killed by the wildfires that naturally occur in the fynbos where it lives. The seeds germinate because of the increased daily temperature fluctuations caused by the removal of the overhead vegetation, and chemicals that wash out of the char during the winter rains, so regenerating the local population.  Use  L. vestitum is one of several species of Leucospermum that are used as cut flower, in particular because it combines showy flowers heads with long straight stems. It is used as a parent for creating Leucospermum hybrids fit for both the garden and the cutflower market.

An anime television series adaptation by Project No.9 premiered from July 5 to September 20, 2018. Sentai Filmworks have licensed the anime and are streaming it on Hidive.  Plot summary  A normal girl is transported to another world, known as the Dream World. Here, dreams are the energy of all beings living within it. The protagonist is revealed to be the long-lost Princess of Traumere and therefore the princess of the Dream World, and she must defend the world from creatures known as Dream Eaters, who steal people's dreams. Using a special ring, she must rescue the various princes of the world, trapped in eternal slumber within their own rings, and team up with them to save the Dream World.  Gameplay  The game is a time-based match-3 strategy puzzle game. Players assemble a team of 5 princes and combat Dream Eaters in quests of varying difficulty. Princes are divided into 5 attribute categories: Sexy, Passion, Cute, Gentle, and Cool. The pieces on the game board reflect these attributes and erasing 3 or more pieces of the same color adds to the attack of princes on the player's team of the matching color. Players have a limited amount of time each turn to erase as many pieces as they can. Princes also have special skills that can be used during combat that can improve a player's chance of clearing the challenge. Weekly events and gacha allow players many opportunities to recruit more princes for their teams, and each event releases new variations of the princes. Part of gameplay also involves a role-play element. Players will have the opportunity to name the protagonist at the beginning of the game, and this is the name that will appear throughout the game when referring to the player in their role as Princess of Traumere. Each prince has their own story interacting with the protagonist that can be read in its entirety when a prince is completely leveled up and 'awakened'. As players read through a prince's story, they will be given a dialogue choice at various points. Certain answers will award Sun Drops and others will award Moon Drops. Whichever there are more of at the end of the story will determine which route the prince can awaken to: Sun or Moon. At this point, the story will split and the conclusion for the Sun Route will be different from the Moon Route. This awakening will also affect a prince's stats and skills.

In Korean society, Hoesik has been established as a subculture of an organization or enterprise.  Origin  The origin of the Hoesik was based on the word \\"Hoe- min\\" of the Joseon Dynasty. It is said that the word \\"Hoe-min\\" was used in order to make the kings and officials of Joseon become 'Let's be one'. It seems that the most likely theory has changed from the word \\"Hoe-min\\" to \\"Hoesik\\". In this way, Hoesik is not a place for the individual, as it can be interpreted as an interpretation that the king and his subjects should live together and eat together.  History   1980s~1990s  Under the influence of Korean traditional military cultures, those lower than the superior must drink. Binge drinking was mainly encouraged by the 'bomb shot' or 'poktanju,' including beer+spirits and soju+spirits. In the 1990s, however, the campaign for sound drinking started, and the culture to avoid social gatherings spread due to the IMF economic crisis.  2000s~the present  Companies and organizations are trying to improve their Hoesik culture as a reaction to the prevailing social atmosphere surrounding the issues of 'bombshot', drinking glasses, and sexual harassment. Instead of focusing on just drinking and dancing, other forms of entertainment and cultural gatherings, such as watching movies and bowling are becoming increasingly common.  Changes in Hoesik with the enactment of the new law  Kim Young- ran Act(Korean: 김영란법), also known as the anti-graft law, refers to the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act. After this law was enacted, various Hoesik practices and after work entertainment culture have significantly decreased, while the percent of individual leisure activities has increased.  Changes in Hoesik with Me Too movement  In 2017, the Me Too movement was widespread in Korea. And the Me Too movement is changing the Hoesik inside Korean companies. The senior employees that were leading the Hoesik had fewer Hoesik as they left early. Some companies and public organizations are trying to reduce or eliminate events that their subordinates are uncomfortable with due to the Me Too movement. In other words, the Heosik that were forced on subordinates is decreasing.  Function   Positive function  Hoesik is a place where members of an organization can relax their tension and stress, increase their closeness to each other, and resolve conflicts. Enhance understanding among team members and help them become closer to each other. By reducing stress on members and eliminating inter-person and interdepartmental conflicts, it is possible to create harmony among members and increase efficiency of production.  Adverse effect  = Excessive drinking and forced drinking = One cannot get away from alcohol at a Hoesik. Heavy drinking is a cause of embarrassment to people that are unable to drink well. This is because the boss or other office superiors are present and can witness one's drunken behavior. Because of the difficulty of refusing, people are forced to drink excessively. The next day's hangover can make them feel very tired and they can not go to work or spend the day in a bad mood. = Forced attendance at hoesik = Many company employees are forced to attend, although their attendance is often passive and uncomfortable. Supervisors may lead the conversation while subordinates follow the conversation. = Loss of human relations with late hoesik = Most conversations at a hoesik may be with colleagues and supervisors and focus on company's shortcomings and company gossip. Negative talk and gossip can extend outside the hoesik, leading to a breakdown of relationships and the internal atmosphere. = Lack of intent = Most of them only have food and drink and refuse to express their inner feelings. = Conflicts with law = Intoxication as a cause of a hoesik can lead to a loss of inhibitions and judgement. Cases of sexual harassment and drunk driving have been associated with hoesik events.  Other Countries   China  Chinese people enjoy dining at restaurants on holidays with family or friends. Such dining culture serves to exchange feelings each other and make conversation in positive ways. Most of the restaurants that Chinese people visit are popular restaurants, which are relatively cheap. Popularity of the restaurant is the first condition that identifying the restaurant. Some special restaurants are less expensive, but they are not included in the category of popular restaurants because the menu is not diverse. Popular restaurants refer to Chinese traditional dishes that are popular and common to the public, such as cold, fried, soup and stock. It is also the most common restaurant on Chinese streets. Some popular restaurants will reveal Shanghai cuisine and Guangdong cuisine on their signboards to show which food system they serve. Therefore, an area that does not identify the region's cuisine on the sign serves dishes that are to the taste of the local people.  Japan  Half of the Japanese drinks alcohol, but the number keeps increasing. Japanese men enjoy drinking and it is common for a small number of people to drink at a pub without going home directly after work. Japanese say, \\" Silence is gold \\" as their motto, but when confronted with something that is worrying, they still drink away their worries. It's polite to toast together at the beginning and drink whatever you want next. In Japan, Geonbae means holding glasses and drinking only the amount you want. In Japan, when a woman drinks well at a dinner party, she gets praised. Japanese people usually like to drink in the evening to relieve stress after a day's work. In addition, Japanese people often change places where they drink and do not drink in the same places to feel different tastes at their regular dining parties.  Foods  Korean food jeon  Rainy day  Koreans enjoy hoesik with Makgeolli (raw rice wine) and Jeon on a rainy day. There is a hypothesis that this is because the sound of the rain is similar to the sound of making the Jeon. And there is a hypothesis that on rainy days, your body's blood sugar level drops, helping to increase your blood sugar level. On rainy days, sales of flour and Makgeolli were also found to have risen sharply in large discount stores. A comparison of the rainy and sunny sales of Makgeolli and flour in Korean marts shows that sales of flour and MakgeollI rose 36.5 percent and 17.9 percent, respectively. This shows that Koreans eat a lot of Makgeolli and Jeon on rainy days.  Yellow dust day  samgyeopsal and soju Koreans eat a lot of samgyeopsal in yellow dust. It was a popular food among Korean miners, who ate it after work. This is because the miners have believed that after working in lots of dust, samgyeopsal washed the dust with their fat. And Koreans who enjoy Hoesik usually drinks soju with samgyeopsal. Because of its good taste and cheap price. For these reasons, eating with samgyeopsal and soju is popular on yellow dust days. However, there is no scientific evidence that samgyeopsal is good for yellow dust.  Health  Alcohol consumption is a prerequisite for a hoesik in Korea. There is no such thing as a non-drinking hoesik.  Liver  Since most people with liver cancer drink alcohol, alcohol accounts for a significant portion of liver cancer. In Korea, almost everyone drinks alcohol unlike other countries, but in foreign countries, there is a clear distinction between those who drink and those who do not. Among American liver cancer cases, alcohol accounted for 30 to 40 percent.  Brain  Alcohol and health, especially brain health, are closely related. Therefore, many health damage occurs and national loss occurs. Direct brain damage caused by alcohol is Alzheimer's, Bernice's syndrome, alcoholic peripheral neuropathy, alcoholic cerebellum contraction, and cerebral bridge (part of the left and right brain) contraction.  Stomach  Alcohol is quickly absorbed from the stomach and 80 percent is absorbed before going to the intestines. High concentrations of alcohol can also damage the stomach's mucous membrane. When alcohol goes straight Stomach, it reduces the secretion of gastric juices. It can also cause interference to the mucous membrane of the stomach.

It has a single tubular, dark green leaf and up to fifteen scented, greenish- brown to brownish-red flowers with a white and green labellum. It grows in grassy woodland on the Northern Tablelands.Prasophyllum basalticum whole plant Description Prasophyllum basalticum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single dark green, tube-shaped leaf, long and wide with a purplish base. Between five and fifteen flowers are arranged along a flowering spike high. The flowers are greenish-brown to brownish-red and sweetly scented. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is narrow egg-shaped to lance-shaped, long, about wide and has three fine dark veins. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, long, about wide and curved. The petals are white with a reddish line along the centre, linear to narrow lance-shaped, long and about wide. The labellum is white, oblong, long, about wide and turns sharply upwards and backwards. There is an egg-shaped green callus in the centre of the labellum, extending to slightly past the bend. Flowering occurs in November and December. Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum basalticum was first formally described in 2018 by David Jones and Lachlan Copeland from a specimen collected in Werrikimbe National Park and the description was published in Australian Orchid Review. The specific epithet (basaltica) is derived from the Latin word basaltes meaning \\"basalt\\", referring to the soils of basaltic origin in which this species usually grows. Distribution and habitat This leek orchid grows in grassy woodland at altitudes of between in the Barrington Tops, Ebor and Dorrigo districts.

Turner was born in London, England, October 23, 1810; died in Washington, D.C., 29 November 29, 1859. He came to New York in 1818, and, after a public-school education, was apprenticed to the carpenter's trade, but subsequently became a printer. At the age of twenty-six he was master of French, Latin, German, and Hebrew. Afterward he studied Arabic with Professor Isaac Nordheimer, and they proposed to write together an Arabic grammar, but, receiving no encouragement, they prepared instead A Critical Grammar of the Hebrew Language (2 vols., New York, 1838) ; and Chrestomathy: or A Grammatical Analysis of Selections from the Hebrew Scriptures, with an Exercise in Hebrew Composition \\" (1838), also a Hebrew and Chaldee Concordance to the Old Testament (1842). In order to superintend the printing of these books, Turner removed to New Haven, as the only sufficient supply of oriental type was to be found there and at Andover. He was engaged in setting the type during the day, and spent his evenings in preparing the manuscript. On the completion of the works, Turner added to his linguistic attainments a knowledge of Sanskrit and most of the other chief Asiatic languages, and later he turned his attention to the languages of the North American Indians. He edited a Vocabulary of the Jargon or Trade Language of Oregon (1853), and Grammar and Dictionary of the Yoruba Language (1858), which was issued by the Smithsonian institution. In 1842 he was elected professor of oriental literature in Union Theological Seminary, New York City, and he continued in that office until 1852, when he was called to Washington by the commissioner of patents to take charge of the library of that department. He was a member of the American Oriental Society, and secretary of the National Institute for the Promotion of Science. Turner was considered in his day the most skillful proof-reader in the United States. In addition to the literary labors that have been already mentioned, he translated from the German Friedrich Ludwig Georg von Raumer's America and the American People (New York, 1845), and was associated with Dr. P. J. Kaufmann in the translation of the 12th German ed. of Ferdinand Mackeldey's Compendium of Modern Civil Law (London, 1845). He also translated William Freund's Latin-German Lexicon for Ethan A.

Montaño attacked random strangers from behind, stabbing them in the neck. In total, a total of seven attacks occurred, two of them fatal. She was nicknamed \\"The Decapitator of Chimalhuacán\\" by the media. She was a disorganized killer, highlighted by the fact that her attacks were committed \\"body to body\\", an unusual modus operandi in female spree killers.  Life  Itzel Montaño was born in 1995, in Chimalhuacán, State of Mexico, to a poor family in which she was the second of six children, her father working unofficially as a \\"car washer\\". Her childhood was spent in a marginalized area of her home municipality, sharing a house with her parents, siblings and several relatives. She used to take care of her younger siblings while her parents worked, and was described by relatives and acquaintances as \\"quiet and calm\\". She attended school only until the third grade, as her childhood and adolescence were marked by poverty. At the age of 14, she moved in with a man and entered into a domestic partnership. At a young age she got pregnant for the first and only time—she suffered from an ectopic pregnancy, making it a necessity to undergo a hysterectomy in order to save her life, leaving her sterile. At age 16, she separated from her partner and began to consume alcohol, tobacco, and inhalants excessively. She maintained herself by selling sweets outside the Mexico City Metro. She had difficulties with reading, writing and maths. At age 17, she met her second husband, a man named Rafael who drove a minibus. She moved in with him only after a few months of relationship. Their relationship was difficult, with fights which often ended in physical aggression.  Crimes  The first attack attributed to Montaño occurred on September 14, 2015. The victim was a man named Antonio Soto Leyva. The 43-year-old was attacked at 5:30am by a woman who approached him from behind and stabbed him in the neck. Despite a injury to his neck, no vital organs were damaged and the victim survived. Soto was able to pursue his attacker for , but could not catch her. The first fatality attributed to the killer came just a day later, on September 15, when a 40-year-old woman named Rosario Laureano Ventura was attacked. The woman was travelling on a bus when she was repeatedly stabbed in the neck by a young woman. That same day there was a second attack, that of Rosa María Jímenez Martínez, who managed to survive. The second murder attributed to the murderer occurred on September 17, 2016, when a 16-year old woman, Brenda Chantal Mondragón Martínez, was assaulted while walking to her school. The killer cut her jugular vein. Throughout September 2015, there were at least three more attacks on two men and one woman, which were non-fatal. One of victims was José Alberto Pichardo, 36, who was stabbed in the abdomen and then in the neck; Pichardo came to declare that his attacker was \\"very fast,\\" like a \\"ninja\\".  Reaction and investigations  Soon the rumor began to spread that there was an active murderer in Chimalhuacán randomly attacking people on the streets. The neighbours began to form vigilante groups, arming themselves with blunt and sharp weapons, as well as firearms. Soon the media also began to cover the case and dubbed the alleged murderer as \\"The Decapitator of Chimalhuacán\\". A mass hysteria developed. With the collaboration of victims and some witnesses, the police developed a profile of the attacker—she was described as a woman between 20 and 25 years of age, with light brown skin, long dark hair, thin, well-dressed and with two tattoos of the Santa Muerte. At first, it was theorised that the attacker could be a man dressed as a woman, because the killer's style of attack is atypical to female murderers, but this hypothesis was rejected. There was no clear pattern in the victims, but the modus operandi was the same in every attack—the suspect approached the victim from behind in a public space and stabbed their neck from the back with a pocket knife. The perpetrator's characteristics made the victims feel not threatened. All attacks occurred in the neighbourhoods of tanners, farmers, cabinet makers, artisans and fishermen, and occurred mostly in the morning. Patrols were started by police on a recurring basis in order to arrest a suspect.  Arrest and trial  On October 2, 2015, after 20 days of investigation, Montaño was arrested in the vicinity of her home in Chimalhuacán, after being reported by her partner and a by a fellow street vendor. Both men reported that she tried to kill them by cutting their necks. She admitted to these two attacks and confessed to have committed them under the influence of alcohol and inhalants. Both attacks occurred on September 13, 2015; the aggression towards the partner occurred in the context of a domestic fight and the second, against a man named \\"Jorge\\", known as the \\"leader of the street vendors\\", who demanded Montaño pay him so that she could sell her sweets. At first the police denied that Montaño was related to the Decapitator's crimes, but by October 9, 2015, they reversed that statement and claimed that she was a suspect in the murders. On July 2017, Montaño was sentenced to 20 years in prison on a charge of attempted murder, and is still awaiting trial for other charges. Her motives remain unknown, but according to declarations of relatives, when she consumed inhalants her behaviour changed drastically, becoming violent and uninhibited. She is believed to have been on drugs in all the attacks, as well as the two attacks she confessed to.

Droggn is originally local dialect for \\"to play Tarock\\" (in standard German usually \\"tarockieren\\"), but it has become the proper name of this specific Tarock variant. An unusual feature of the game compared with other Tarock games is the use of a 66-card deck and that there is no record in the literature of a 66-card game and no current manufacturers of a such a deck. The structure of the game strongly indicates that it is descended from the later version of Tarok l'Hombre, a 78-card Tarock game popular in 19th-century Austria and Germany, but with the subsequent addition of two higher bids.  History  During his research into The Game of Tarot, Michael Dummett learned that 66-card Tarock packs had been made during the 19th century in the Tyrol, but could find no record of any games played with 66 cards. Equally curious was that Piatnik had continued to manufacture 78-card packs into the 1980s, even though Austrian literature suggested that games played with more than 54 cards had died out in the early part of the 19th century. In 1992, card game researcher, Remigius Geiser, found out from Piatnik that, towards the end, 78-card packs had been sold exclusively in the Stubai valley near Innsbruck. In their follow-up work, Geiser and McLeod tracked down a number of players who had played the game of Droggn in the past and were able to demonstrate its rules. Some of the players called it French Tarock (Französisches Tarock). Droggn players were divided over whether the game was introduced to the Tyrol by French soldiers during the Napoleonic Wars at the time of Andreas Hofer or was imported to the area from northern Italy. The game has a number of features in common with older forms of French Tarot and with Tarok l'Hombre, an Austrian descendant of the Italian game of Taroc 'Ombre. McLeod and Geiser conclude that \\"Stubai Droggn clearly belongs within the family of Tarok l'Hombre games which were current in the 19th century\\", but go on to acknowledge that there is \\"a strong possibility\\" that it was derived from a French game played by Napoleonic soldiers from eastern France.  Aim  To win the 37 of the 74 card points available as the declarer or 38 as the defending team.  Players  The game is played with three players. Four can play if the dealer \\"takes a holiday\\" (er feiert) i.e. when it is their turn players deal but do not participate in that hand. at www.pagat.com. Retrieved 24 Jun 2018.  Cards  The game is played with a 66-card French-suited Tarock card deck. In practice, players used a 78-card variant of the Industrie und Glück pattern deck and stripped out the lowest 3 cards of each suit. These packs are no longer made, but alternatives include the French Tarot Nouveau pattern deck or, appropriately, the facsimile Tiroler Tarock pack depicting historical Tyrolean battle scenes and produced by Piatnik.  Card pack  The pack thus comprises: * 21 trumps numbered XXI to I. * 11 cards per suit as follows: ** K D R B 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 ** K D R B A 2 3 4 5 6 7 * The Gstieß (the Fool, L'Excuse or Sküs) The court cards are the King (König), Queen (Dame), Rider (Reiter) and Jack or Valet (Bube) hence the lettering.  Card values  The values of the individual cards in card points (Augen) are as follows: * Trull cards (Gstieß, XXI and I) - 5 points * Honours or Kings - 5 points * Queens - 4 points * Riders - 3 points * Valets - 2 points * Other tarocks and pip cards - 1 points  Card names  Card names, which sometimes vary from other Austrian Tarock games, are as follows: * Tarocks - Trümpfe (\\"trumps\\") or Addude (from the French atout) * Trump XXI - Mond or der Große (\\"the big one\\") * Trump I - Pagat or der Kleine / dar Kloane (\\"the littl' un\\") * Sküs - Gstieß * King - König or Honor (\\"honour\\") * Queen - Dame / de Dam * Rider - Reiter * Valet - Bube / dar Bua * Pip cards - leere / laare Karten * Court cards - Mandlen * Long suit - der Ritt * Singleton - der Fuchs (normally a suit card in declarer's hand other than the King)  Dealing  The dealer is chosen by cutting the pack; the highest card wins. Dealing and play are clockwise, unlike other Tarock games. After shuffling the cards, the dealer offers the pack to the player on his right, who cuts. The dealer then deals 3 packets of 7 cards to each player and places the last 3 cards face down on the table to form the talon.  Bidding  Bidding is clockwise and each player gets one bid. The bids, in order starting with the lowest, are: * Ansager - normal game announced by saying \\"bid\\" (\\"ich sage an / i sag on\\"). Declarer exchanges with the talon and 'buys' a nominated card from the player who holds it (see below). Game value = 20 game points. * Solo - declarer exchanges with the talon only. Game value = 40 game points. * Super - declarer does not use the talon or buy a card. Game value = 80 game points. * Super Mord - declarer offers to take every trick and the talon is his also. Game value = 130 game points. Players may \\"pass\\" (weiter). If everyone passes the cards are thrown in and re-dealt.  Exchanging with the talon  For normal games and Solos, the declarer is allowed to exchange 3 cards with the talon, but may not discard the trull cards. The discards count as one of the declarer's tricks. A King must be discarded with a trump. In normal contracts, the declarer is allowed to 'buy' a card by placing a card on the table and ask for a card of his choice. The player with that card must hand it over and take the discard.  Bonuses and announcements   Bonuses  The following bonuses are permitted: * Pagat ultimo - a player wins the last trick with the Pagat. Doubled if announced beforehand by placing the Pagat face-up by the talon at the start. * Gstieß ultimo - ditto for the Gstieß but this is only permitted in a Super Mord.  Announcements  After the declarer has exchanged, discarded, bought a card and laid off a Pagat or Gstieß, the defenders in clockwise order, may now \\"stick\\" or \\"double\\". If they want to stick they say \\"good\\" (gut) or \\"pass\\" (komm) and the opportunity passes to the left. If they want to double the game or bonus value they may declare schiessen or a schwacher. This doubles the value for both defenders. The declarer may respond \\"good\\" or double the stakes again with a \\"retour\\" (Retour). The higher stakes apply to both game and bonus even they may go to different players.  Playing  The declarer leads to the first trick (werfen) and play is then clockwise. Players must follow suit if possible or trump if unable. They do not have to head the trick. If they can neither follow nor trump they may discard. Tricks are won by the highest trump or, if no trumps are played, the highest card of the led suit. The trick winner leads to the next trick. The Gstieß may be played at any time, but can neither capture nor be captured. Instead it is reclaimed by its holder and place with his tricks. If it is led, the next player may play any card. An exception to its lack of trick-taking powers is that, in a Super Mord, if it is declared in advance it may be played to the last trick whereupon it will win. If the Pagat is captured during the game, it earns 5 points for its captor(s). If it wins the last trick it earns 20 points for Pagat Ultimo announced or 10 points if unannounced. If it fails to win the trick the points go to its captor(s). Tricks are kept face down and the defenders share a common trick pile. Players may review their own tricks.  Scoring  Scoring is effected by grouping the cards taken in tricks into threes, adding up the score for each triplet and deducting 2 points e.g. a King, Valet and Three of Hearts score 5 + 2 + 1 -2 = 6. A total of 37 card points is required to win the game. The total game points won is the sum of the basic game value plus overshoot points (points above 37) plus any bonuses e.g. a declarer who plays Solo, takes the last trick unannounced with the Pagat and wins with 40 card points scores 40 + 3 + 10 = 53 game points. Winning a Super Mord automatically scores a total of 167 game points or 187 if a Gstieß Ultimo or Pagat Ultimo is announced and won. If a player wins every trick without having announced a Mord, it is a Matsch and he scores the game value plus 37 points.  References   Bibliography  * Dummett, Michael (1980). The Game of Tarot.

As a juvenile in 1897 he showed considerable promise by winning the Champion Breeders' Foal Plate at Derby Racecourse and then finishing second in the Middle Park Plate. In the following spring he recorded his biggest win in the 2000 Guineas but disappointed when favourite for the Epsom Derby and later ran unplaced in the St Leger. He made no impact as a breeding stallion in France. Background Disraeli was a \\"good-looking, well-set-up\\" bay horse bred at the Sledmere Stud in East Yorkshire by Sir Tatton Sykes, 5th Baronet. As a yearling he was consigned to the Doncaster sales and bought for 1,000 guineas by Wallace Johnstone. The colt was sent into training with John Dawson, the younger brother of Mathew Dawson, at Warren House stables at Newmarket, Suffolk. Dawson had established his reputation in the 1870s when he trained Galopin and Petrarch. His sire Galopin was an outstanding racehorse who won the Derby in 1872 and went on to be a successful and influential stallion, being Champion sire on three occasions. Disraeli's dam Lady Yardley was a full-sister to The Swan, whose descendants included Mondrian and Hansel. Racing career 1897: two-year-old season Disraeli made his debut in the Champion Breeders' Foal Plate on 31 August over five furlongs at Derby Racecourse. Ridden by Fred Allsopp, and starting at odds of 100/8 he led from the start and won \\"somewhat easily\\" by one and a half lengths from the odds-on favourite Champ de Mars. In the Middle Park Plate over six furlongs at Newmarket on 15 October, Disraeli started at odds of 100/15 (approximately 6.7/1) in a fourteen-runner field. With Allsopp again in the saddle he briefly took the lead in the last quarter mile but was overtaken and beaten three lengths by the Duke of Devonshire's colt Dieudonne with Wildfowler a head away in third place. On his third and final start of the season six days later Disraeli was assigned a weight of 136 pounds for the Great Sapling Plate at Sandown Park and finished as Ninus won from Nun Nicer and Sheet Anchor. He was eased down in the race by his rider John Watts when his chance of winning had gone. 1898: three-year-old season Sam Loates, who rode Disraeli in 1898 The 90th edition of the 2000 Guineas was run over the Rowley Mile on 27 April and saw Disraeli, ridden by Sam Loates start at odds of 100/8. Ninus went off the 100/30 favourite while the other twelve runners included Batt, Jeddah, Hawfinch (Dewhurst Plate) and Wildfowler. Disraeli settled behind the leaders before moving intothird behind the 40/1 outsider Wantage and Ninus a furlong from the finish. He \\"put in some very strong work\\" to take the lead in the closing stages and won by one and a half lengths from Wantage, with Ninus a neck away in third place. At Epsom Racecourse on 25 May Disraeli, with Loates again in the saddle, started the 2/1 favourite for the Derby Stakes. He led the field in the early stages but dropped out of contention approaching the straight and finished tenth as Jeddah won from Batt, Dunlop and Dieudonne. According to press reports the colt failed to stay the distance and Loates was described as looking \\"a picture of misery\\" after the contest. In the St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse on 7 September Disraeli started at odds of 100/6 and finished unplaced behind Wildfowler. In December 1898 Disraeli was put up for auction at Newmarket and bought for 850 guineas by a Mr Jones, acting on behalf of a group of French breeders. Stud record Disraeli was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion in France. He appears to have fathered very few foals and had no success as a sire of winners. Disraeli died in 1911 at the stud of the Marquis de Tracy. Pedigree *Disraeli was inbred 4 × 4 to Birdcatcher and Voltaire, meaning that both of these stallions appear twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

In Upper Egypt it replaces eish baladi as the local staple, although the latter is common as well. The name, which translates to \\"sun bread\\", is thought to derive from the practice of letting the dough rise in the sun. The bread is traditionally baked at home in domed clay ovens with openings at the top, although this tradition is fading with pre-made bread becoming increasingly common. Shape The shape of the bread is determined by the pattern of the scoring, which is done with a needle. The common way to do it is making slits all around the top-edge for a round bread. Another common way to do it is making crescent-shaped slits in the dough which results in a triangle-shaped bread. Christians tend to score the dough in a way that achieves a rough cross-shape. These bread shapes resemble those on depictions of bread offerings on tomb paintings dating back to ancient Egypt. Although it is uncommon in Lower Egypt, some bakeries in Cairo make it especially for their Upper Egyptian clientele.

At present the Championship Cup is scheduled to take place for at least two seasons. History Between 2009 and 2018, English tier 2 clubs had played in the British and Irish Cup. The British and Irish Cup was initially a strong and interesting competition, but this started to change at the end of the 2013-14 when the Scottish clubs decided to pull out due to fixture congestion, and then in 2014-15 the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) made the controversial decision to switch their club representatives to select XV sides based on the Pro14 clubs. These changes saw a decline in interest in the competition, mirrored by falling attendances. The death knell sounded when the English Championship clubs pulled out at the end of the 2017-18 season, deciding to create their own competition. At the same time as the demise of the British and Irish Cup, the Anglo-Welsh Cup also had its final season with the Welsh Pro14 sides pulling out due to difficulties faced with putting out competitive teams. With both competitions ending there seemed to be an opportunity for both the English Premiership and Championship clubs to form their own competition. Unfortunately, this never materialised as the Premiership sides announced the new Premiership Cup competition, featuring tier 1 sides only. In June 2018 the RFU announced the Championship Cup. While the RFU hailed the new competition as a positive step for the second tier, with a regionalised format encouraging derby rivalries, reaction from Championship club supporters was muted, with many feeling an opportunity was missed to create a meaningful competition combining the 24 professional sides in England, and others expressing dissatisfaction with a format that would see some clubs face each other four times a season. More positive reactions included the cup being used by clubs as a mid-season break in which first team players can be rested, with fringe players getting game time.  Format  The current competition format is a group stage followed by a knockout stage. The group stage consists of three (roughly) regional groups of four teams each playing home and away matches. Group matches run for six consecutive weeks through November to December following a break in the RFU Championship league campaign. The top two sides in each group, plus the two best third-placed teams, progress to the knockout stage, with the best-ranked sides receiving home advantage in the quarter-finals. The four winning quarter-finalists progress to the semi-finals with the winners playing in the final in May.

A series of excavations have shown that this site has been occupied by a variety of cultures since the Early Neolithic period. The site was first officially excavated in 1988 under Christian Adamsen. It was most recently excavated in the summer of 2018 by a joint task force of the Harvard University Viking Studies Program and Moesgaard Museum, led by Peter Jensen. Location Map of Samsø showing Endebjerg Endebjerg is located on a hill on the southern side of Stavns Fjord. Dating to the 19th century, the name means Final(ende) Mountain/Hill (bjerg). While not notably tall or steep, a wide view of the neighboring fjord is visible from atop Endebjerg. Throughout the Viking Age, possibly later, the water likely stretched down the west side (closer to Jutland) of the hill, creating a close connection from the settlement to the fjord. This made Endebjerg an ideal location for a settlement. Inhabitants had easy coastal access for trade and fishing; furthermore, they could easily see would-be traders or attackers from afar and prepare the proper response. Discovery In the late 1980s, the land owner of the farm noticed his wheat grew taller and healthier in small, specific areas. These unnatural clusters of darker, fertile soil indicated previous human activity. Filled in holes will create spots of rich soil visibly different from the rest of the topsoil and subsoil. The farmer contacted the Samsø Museum for guidance. Further investigation showed that aerial photographs from the late '70s revealed dark spots and pits that could potentially have an archaeological context. Around some of these spots, farmers reported turning up charred material and fire-cracked rocks while plowing. Lis Nymark, then director of the Samsø Museum, conducted a preliminary examination of Endebjerg, finding and partially excavating the pithouse marked C1 in the 2018 excavation plans. These discoveries led to the 1988-1990 excavations. The site was first officially excavated in 1988 by student-archaeologist Christian Adamsen, via the Samsø Museum. Further excavations under this group occurred in 1989 and 1990. In 2017, Moesgaard Museum searched for anomalies signaling buildings under the mud layer. In 2018, the Harvard University Viking Studies Program spent three weeks excavating the site. 1988–1990 excavations 1988 season The first excavation at Endebjerg occurred in the Fall of 1988. Three and a half pithouses were excavated, as well as two of the roof-bearing post holes and some of the wall posts belonging to a longhouse dated to the Late Iron Age or Viking Age. The longhouse was estimated to be around 27 meters long, and contain six sets of roof-bearing posts. This longhouse was the first one found on the island of Samsø. This excavation was led by Christian Adamsen, then a student at the University of Copenhagen. It also employed a metal detector, which found very little of note. According to Adamsen's article, \\"Stavns Fjord i jernalder og vikingetid\\" (1995), there were a number of significant finds unearthed during this excavation. Most importantly, pithouse C4 contained hundreds of fish bones, which were the first ones found in a rural settlement in Denmark. This was due to the use of a sieve during excavations. The fish bones were found to belong to medium-sized cod, fish which were likely caught in the bay near Endebjerg rather than out at sea. Other notable finds included 2 1/2 glass beads. The 1988 excavation also turned up several artifacts that were evidence of trade: a hooked tag, from either York or Winchester, in England; a cutting knife, made from iron that came from Norway; and a rim shard made of glass that was Frankish in origin. In addition to these finds, there were many pieces of ceramic, some land animal bones, and artifacts made of iron, including a key, nails, and rivets. 1989 season The second excavation occurred the following year, in 1989, when the Samsø Museum and University of Copenhagen returned to Endebjerg after the promising returns of the previous year. Students excavated multiple pithouses as well as some postholes that were part of a longhouse. There were multiple loom weights found in one of the pithouses. In addition, the excavation found multiple whetstones made of black shist that looked to be Norwegian in origin. Other finds from the sieve included additional glass beads and more fish bone fragments. 1990 season In 1990, Samso Museum returned to the site at Endebjerg, this time to dig 6 test trenches in a nearby field, in order to determine if there were any other signs of human habitation in the area. The pattern of features exposed by the trial trenches suggested that Endebjerg had multiple settlements throughout its history. Multiple cooking pits, and several post holes that were suspected to belong to the longhouse were also found. During this excavation, the most significant find was that one of the cooking pits was filled with Bronze Age ceramics. 2017–2018 excavations 2017 season In 2017, archaeologists from Moesgaard Museum conducted a magnetometer survey on the site in Endebjerg to see if there were any traces of a building underneath the top soil. During the survey some clear anomalies were detected that were interpreted as possible pits. The anomalies were mostly clustered on the eastern side of the hill, near where Christian Adamsen had previously found the settlement. On five of these anomalies, test holes were dug to determine if there was any archaeological context to be found. In three of the test holes, archaeological context was discovered, which meant these areas were of particular interest. A cut through half of a pithouse. One side is excavated, leaving the soil layers visible. 2018 season =Pithouse C1= Located just southeast of the longhouse discovered in 1988, C1 was the first pithouse excavated. Location of Pithouse C1 Major finds from the excavation of the pithouse included a fairly intact ceramic handle piece as well as several disruptions in the outer edge of the pithouse. While one of the disruptions appears to be a mouse's burrow, the other is much more systematic and deliberate: likely a remnant of the Nymark excavation. In addition, there were several Modern era shards of glass found that were probably left from that excavation. On the floor layer of the pithouse, there was a pig's tooth, a piece of iron slag, multiple ceramic pieces and rim shards. It is likely that some of the artifacts that may have been in the pithouse were excavated by Nymark. For information on the excavation procedure for pithouses, see Pithouse Excavation Procedure. =Pithouse C2= Located on the southern edge of the dig site, C2 was undisturbed until the 2018 excavation. This pithouse had two distinct floor layers, possibly due to the seasonal usage of pithouses; workers would create a fresh floor layer to cover previous one. In the first layer excavated, a glass bead from the Viking Age was discovered through sieving. A long trench running north from the pithouse was also discovered; soil colorization determined it to be younger than the pithouse, running over it instead of into the structure. In the second layer excavated, the number of bone and ceramic finds increased. The northeast quadrant of C2 yielded many animal teeth and a jawbone, most likely belonging to a horse. The first piece of ornamented, stamped ceramic found on Samsø was also excavated from the northern half. In the third layer excavated, a loom weight was found on the northern half, while a large deposit of ceramic pieces and a small limb bone were found on the southern half. In the younger floor layer (about 55 cm below the topsoil), a large piece of iron, presumably a handle, was found on the southern half. The second floor layer (about 62cm below the topsoil) yielded more ceramics. In both floor layers, unfired loom weights were also found. Throughout the entire excavation of the pithouse, pockets of charcoal, animal teeth, and fire-cracked rock were discovered. =Pithouse C4= Located on the western edge of the dig site, pithouse C4 was chosen to be excavated based on the 1989 excavation reports, which reported half of C4 being excavated and the other half left undisturbed. Location of C4 In the 1988 excavation, fishbones and ceramics were reported to have been found in the side that was excavated. However, the 2018 excavation found that it was probable that the whole pit had been previously excavated, with the discovery of a plastic coffee stirrer and cigarette butts in the \\"unexcavated\\" portion of the pithouse providing clear evidence of modern era activity. While half a glass bead was also found in the pithouse, it is likely that it was merely missed by the previous excavation. When the old profile wall was excavated, teeth and ceramics were discovered, indicating that the pithouse did contain a wealth of finds when it was excavated initially. In addition, an iron piece that may be a key was found during the excavation of C4, which could potentially match an iron lock found by Lis Nymark. =Longhouse C5= In the 2018 excavation, the excavation of the previously unknown longhouse started with a series of postholes that had once held roof bearing posts. The excavation found only three pairs of roof bearing posts, even though additional postholes were searched for on both sides of the existing three pairs. This suggests that the longhouse at Endebjerg was a very short longhouse. While excavating these postholes, a piece of ceramic dating to the late Iron Age was found. This and the shape of the longhouse suggest that the longhouse was likely Viking Age. =Posthole A12= A goat mandible among other animal bones found in posthole A12 During the excavations a series of postholes were discovered in and around some of the pit and longhouses. In archaeology, a post hole is a circular patch of discolored dirt lying underneath the topsoil that once may have held a wall, supporting, or roof bearing post. One of the more interesting postholes was Posthole A12. What made this posthole hole unusual was the discovery of a series of bones from a variety of different animals including a well preserved goat mandible as well as the fact that it was not found in context with any of the longhouses or pithouses. =Cooking Pits= During the course of the 2018 excavation, multiple cooking pits were excavated a short distance away from the longhouse and pithouses. Cooking pits were holes dug into the ground and filled with stones that were heated and used to cook meat, factors that can help date when the site was inhabited. Any organic materials remaining in the cooking pit, including animal products or grains, can be assessed using carbon-14 dating to approximate the time period the cooking pit was used. During the excavation, the darkest soil, almost pitch black in color, was saved and flotated. Unfortunately, no dateable artifacts were found after flotation. Significance Occupation The difference and breadth of the finds found in all four excavations suggests that this settlement was occupied by a series of cultures. A series of flint finds were found that showed evidence of flintknapping that can be dated to the Funnelbeaker culture of the Neolithic period. Ceramic shards found in one of the pithouses can be dated to the Germanic Iron age, further backed up with the discovery of a series of iron nails. In addition to this the excavation teams found artifacts including the ceramic handle of pithouse C1 that could be dated to the late iron age and Viking age periods. Trade Endebjerg is important to the study of Viking activity on Samsø because of the evidence of trade found in the excavations. The discovery of these relatively high-end trade goods points to an unusually well off upper middle class settlement rather than a normal, lower class rural settlement. The strategic positioning of Samsø meant that Endebjerg was probably an important trading site that exerted some control over the sea routes that ran through the channels on either side of the island. One notable feature of Samsø is the Kanhave canal that ran through Samsø to connect the channels on either side. Using this canal, the construction of which has been dated to about 726 AD using dendrochronology, the inhabitants could easily deploy their fleets to control trade and for defense. Endebjerg was ideally situated to survey the activity around the canal and in the fjord. The building of the Kanhave canal and other construction projects during the same time period may have signified that power in Denmark was much more centralized earlier than previously thought. Finds The finds and the architectural features of the site also point to the special significance of the site in understanding the history of Samsø itself. The longhouse excavated in 1988-89 was the first longhouse discovered on the island. The fish bones found in pithouse C4 were the first discovered in any Danish rural settlement. In the 2018 excavation, the discovery of the first ceramic shard with ornamentation on the island also pointed to the presence of the ceramic industry. In post hole A12, the unusual discovery of the bones of a goat (including a relatively well-preserved mandible) may point to religious activity. The loom weight found in pithouse C2 also supports the idea of a textile industry that likely made clothes for trade and sails for ships. The iron slag found at pithouse C1 also demonstrates that there was an active metal treatment and smithing industry at the settlement. The presence of multiple pithouses and artisan industries provides further support the evidence of this site being a wealthier settlement.

In this case, Foulcher, who was the prime suspect, denied the facts during his custody and detention on remand. Being free before his trial, he did not appear and ran away. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in absentia. It was during his trip that he distinguished himself on 8 January 2001 near Narbonne, where he killed four people in the same day. First was Pascal Herrero, the husband of a former mistress. Then there were two policemen and finally Maurice Michaud, the insurer he thought was in cahoots with Meffray. Until 17 January, during his run, he became public enemy number 1. At that date, he hid in the apartment of his mistress Isabelle Susic in the district of Grangette in Béziers. But cornered by the police and RAID, he committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. The police eventually found his body in the early morning after entering the apartment. Foulcher is still legally considered innocent because of his death which has extinguished the public action.  Murder of André Meffray   Facts  On 21 January 1993, in Pailhès (near Béziers), André Meffray was about to dine, but heard the doorbell ring around 20:30. He went to open the door and once outside, five shots sounded; André collapsed to the ground. The killer fled by car. Gendarmes were alerted by neighbours.  Investigation  Upon arrival, the gendarmes noticed that Meffray was shot with five large calibre bullets. The shots were grouped on Meffray's body, suggesting that the killer was mastering the shooting technique. In addition, neighbours saw the killer. Unclear descriptions were established by witnesses (wearing a cap, brown jacket) and none of them were able to draw a facial composite of the killer. But investigators knew that the killer's car was dark in color with red side protection strips. On 26 January 1993 André Meffray's autopsy was performed. The medical examiner said the bullets were fired up and down. This is all the more blatant because his body was found on the third step to the path going to the gate was sloping and the latter went to his residence trying to escape. In addition, the killer had to be within two meters of the victim. The bullets found in Meffray's body were sent to the IRCGN's laboratories. After the findings made on these projectiles, it was determined that 22 possible weapons could be used for this crime. The first track was made by the press at the same time, settling of accounts followed one another in the sector. Indeed, there were murders committed in Marseillan- Plage and Nîmes. The most disturbing thing was that these executions took place around 20:00 and made with heavy weapons. But that gave nothing. That's when the gendarmes tried to find out more about the life of André Meffray. They discovered that he was a retired insurer and that he was doing financial investment counseling to round up the end of the month. And he had taken over his old business a little by taking over clients with risky investments. Thus the second track lead to a dissatisfied customer who wanted revenge. Because of this investment, his capital has fallen. Mais cela ne donne rien non plus. Finally, the third track led to an unhappy competitor who sought revenge. This hypothesis was reinforced by the progress of the search for the murder weapon. All gunsmiths in the area were asked to search among their customers, those who possess one or more the 22 types of weapons possible. It is then that an armorer of Béziers told a fascinating story to the gendarmes. He told the investigators that one day a person came to his store with a special collection weapon (Dan Wesson) to have it neutralized. The person wanted to be in good standing without possession of a weapon, as nobody could have a weapon of such category at home. But the salesman felt that he was not dealing with a collector or member of a shooting club. He thought that this neutralization would not continue and that the weapon was going to be put back into activity. That's when the salesman gave the person's name to the investigators. The man with the Dan Wesson was called Albert Foulcher. In investigating this person, the gendarmes discovered that he did not have a good reputation in Mr. Meffray's environment. And since he had a Dan Wesson (the probable murder weapon), the investigators favoured this lead, especially since Foulcher was also an insurer and did not have professional relationships with Meffray. Indeed, Foulcher complained that Mr. Meffray was withdrawing clients from him to send them to other insurers and he was holding Meffray responsible for the failure of his insurance firm. Eventually, Foulcher threw in the towel and he became unemployed. It became more and more likely for the investigators that he was angry with André Meffray. It is then that Albert Foulcher was placed under surveillance and that he became suspect number N°1.

The National Center of Oncology has been led by Jamil Aliyev since 1990.  History  On December 11, 1940, a resolution made by the Council of People's Commissars and the People's Commissariat for Health established the Scientific Radiology Institute in Azerbaijan. The Azerbaijani Scientific Research Institute of Roentgen Radiology (SRIRR) was created in 1941 to research and treat cancer. SRIRR was later renamed the Scientific Research Institute of Roentgenology, Radiology and Oncology (SRIRRO) in compliance with a 1964 order from the Ministry of Health of Azerbaijan SSR. In the late 1980s, SRIRRO collaborated with several institutions located in other Soviet cities, including Kiev, Leningrad (Saint Petersburg), and Moscow. Beginning in 1974, many organizational changes began under the leadership of well-known oncologist R. N. Rahimov. These changes were followed by improvements in maintenance and quality of service. In 1988, SRIRRO was renamed the Republican Ontological Scientific Center (ROSC) by the Ministry of Health. After Azerbaijan gained independence, prevention and treatment programs were organized. In 1995, the institute's name was changed to the National Center of Oncology (NCO). There are now eight oncology dispensaries in Azerbaijan. The first regional Pediatric Oncology Clinic was created within the National Center of Oncology in 2012 with the support of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation and Mehriban Aliyeva. In 2014, two important departments were established within the NCO: the Medical Treatment Building and the Laboratory of Molecular Oncology. Several departments such as Outpatient Chemotherapy, Chemotherapy, Invasive Diagnostics, Oncohematology (Hematology), and Endoscopy can be found within the Medical Treatment Building.  International relations  On March 11, 2010, the National Center of Oncology of Azerbaijan and the Cancer Aid International Onlus signed a bilateral memorandum, as part of which Italian surgeons were invited to Azerbaijan to attend surgical operations and training classes. The NCO of the Ministry of Health of Azerbaijan and the Turkish Bayandir Healthcare Group signed an agreement in 2013. The agreement was designed to increase cooperation between the two organizations through the exchange of scientific research programs and organized training in oncology. Other cooperative relations with Turkey are realized according to the agreements with the Council of Higher Education of Turkey and Turkish Gynecological Oncology Association. The National Oncology Center has an agreement with the Belgian Health Fund in the field of scientific research cooperation in prevention and medication of cancerous tumors. The signing ceremony was attended by the general directors of the NCO of Azerbaijan and the Belgian Health Fund respectively, Jamil Aliyev and Herwig Fleerackers, in 2012. In the spirit of provision and implementation of technology and medical equipment for radiation therapy, NCO cooperates with Belgian Orfit Industries, a provider of in medical equipment. The NCO also cooperates with the government of Israel in the field of health. This is in accordance with an agreement signed by the general director of the National Center of Oncology of the Ministry of Health of Azerbaijan and Israeli ambassador Rafael Harpaz in 2013.

He was the son of Hans Hanebuth, a cotter in Groß-Buchholz. Jasper Hanebuth became a mercenary in Swedish service during the Thirty Years' War. Even during the war, he acquired the Hanover citizenship, but soon lost it again as he did not pay his tax debts. Later he preyed mainly in the Eilenriede, a forest near the present-day Hanover Zoo. He partly carried out his raids with others, including Caspar Reusche and Hänschen von Rode, a descendant of an old Hanoverian patrician family. He often shot his victims from afar without knowing whether they could find money. Hanebuth was described as a rude man whose tantrums were feared. He is considered as an example of the everyday violence and brutality of morals after the end of the Thirty Years' War. His victims included his \\"robber bride\\". Hanebuth was last hired as a horse dealer until he was reported for a horse theft and arrested on November 14, 1652. But then he confessed to 10 thefts and 19 murders.

Nor was his home a robber's den in the Eilenriede. Similarly, it has not been proven that he supported the poor from the nearby village of Groß-Buchholz with his prey. * A cross that existed at the beginning of the stone gate field from the time before Hanebuth's execution was later incorrectly assigned to the event, but then in 1929 it was given the name White Cross Square on the Lister mile.Carl-Hans Hauptmeyer: 1653 , in: Hannover Chronicle , p. 52 * \\"Hanebuth's gang\\" on the high bank \\"is probably the remainder of a passage under the city wall to the leash\\", which was filled up after a short distance.Foto von Stefan Arend * At the turn of the 19th century there were still postcards with the motif of \\"Hanebuth's Block\\" on the Schiffgraben in front of the former entrance building of the zoo.Picture postcard number \\"283\\" by Karl F.

Its goal was to reduce alcohol consumption and bring attention to the Alkoholfrage (English: The alcohol question). The book contains 25 sections that deal with different alcohol issues, ranging from the explanation of the alcohol question, to an elucidation of the alcohol's devastating health consequences and to the general economic impact of alcohol in the 20th century. Orel primarily aims to establish an abstinence movement against the existing drinking customs in order to save society from the devastating consequences. He frequently quotes experts' opinions on health and economic consequences in order to underline his statements. He particularly appeals to the youth as representing the basis for the planned revolutionary movement against the widespread alcoholism.  Context  After studying law, Anton Orel became redactor of several magazines, among others Arbeiterjugend and Unserer Jugend. Famous for his anti-capitalistic views, Anton Orel founded the Bund der deutschen Arbeiterjugend in 1905, which was known as Verband der christlichen Jugend Österreichs from 1907 onwards. Orel values the possible impact youth can have on society; his book Der Alkoholismus: Einführung in ein soziales Problem (Alcoholism, introduction to a social problem) aims to impact the self- education and ability of the youthful generation to save society from its cultural ruin: \\"Ihr seid die Träger einer großen Zukunft die uns vom Kulturniedergang emporführen wird\\" (English: \\"You are the carriers of a great future that will bring us up from the cultural ruin\\"). Alcohol consumption represented a controversial societal issue, as shown by the growth of the movement against alcohol during the 19th century. The movement started in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. All anti-alcoholic organizations expressed hostility towards alcohol, even though their direct goals were different. Some, such as Anton Orel, fought for a voluntary abstinence, others for the moderation of drinking only. Overall, the health risks, as well as adverse social and national impact, of alcohol were emphasized. The greatest success by means of prohibition took place in the United States. Shortly after Anton Orel's publication, First World War (1914-1918) broke out, causing governments to introduce new and rigorous regulations that limited alcohol consumption. These regulations were largely maintained after the end of the war and were even intensified and extended throughout the Western world.  Content  In total, the book consists of 25 sections. In each section, Orel describes a specific adverse consequence of alcohol consumption on either a personal or societal level, emphasizing the importance of an abstinence movement. Orel first presents the general alcohol problem that societies in the 20th century are faced with. Alcohol was strongly linked to daily life so it was necessary to inspect the linked social issues. Orel presents his plans of a movement against habitual alcohol consumption and the overall goal is the entire elimination of alcohol from daily life. The alcohol question asks how the total elimination of alcohol will be possible. He highlights that people's consumption cannot be excused as normal and rooted in human history, as in his view consumption has become more frequent and people are less resistant to the risks than many decades ago. In the following sections, Orel emphasises the adverse health consequences. Due to the toxicity of alcohol , its impact on the body is devastating. Among others, alcohol has an adverse effect on the body's organs, metabolic system, immune system, nervous system and life expectancy. Additionally, most of the given adverse consequences are highly heritable causing a single alcoholic to have a negative impact on multiple generations. One possible impact is the inherited inability for women to breast-feed their children, causing child malnutrition in young age. Moreover, crimes are commonly committed by alcoholics. Trying to investigate factors that facilitate society's alcoholism, Orel highlights that the production and sale of alcohol is especially profitable and that greed is a main factor increasing the prevalence of alcoholism. He portrays the paradoxical relationship of the consequences of alcohol consumption and the destruction of tons of foods in the process of producing alcohol. In order to fight alcoholism, Orel says it is indispensable to fight existing drinking customs such as “Kein Leben ohne Freude, keine Freude ohne Alkohol” (English: \\"There is no life without happiness, no happiness without alcohol\\") and people's negative conception of an abstinent person. He also discusses the importance of empowering youth as they are able to have an actual impact on existing customs. Orel proposes to start the abstinence movement by creating abstinent subgroups within existing associations to create a widespread basis for the movement. He concludes that it will overall take a long time to create an alcohol free society and the most important sub-goal to reach is to create a strong anti-alcohol movement in schools and reach a general alcohol ban for children and youth.  Reception  Anton Orel's book Der Alkoholismus: Einführung in ein soziales Problem (English: The alcoholism, introduction to a social problem) was praised for the density of information provided. The Christliche Arbeiterzeitung valued that the book provided an overview of the alcohol problem and outlines the impact of alcohol on society. The Reichspost praised the empirical background of the book combined with its easy-written overall character. Anton Orel was able to separate himself from the pressure of society and criticize the societal habit of alcohol consumption, aiming to entirely ban alcohol consumption. However, caused by its rigor, Orel's publications are seen as utopic and he is criticised for his intransigence. Receptions such as \\"Es ist schade, dass das sonst tüchtige Werkchen mit solch Übertreibungen beschwert ist (…).\\" (English: \\"It is a pity that the otherwise efficient little work is burdened with such exaggerations (…).\\") confirm this extreme tendency. Several of Orel's suggestions and warnings are confirmed and still important in the 21st century. Strikingly, the proposed adverse health effects were quite accurate. One possible health consequence already introduced by Orel in 1908 and confirmed by research, is alcohol's depressing effects on the central nervous system (CNS) which can range from mild euphoria to a condition of coma and death. Another health consequence impacting society today is altered immune regulation leading to immunodeficiency and autoimmunity, causing lower resistance to bacterial diseases. Another example of this is Orel's proposed destructive impact of alcohol consumption on life expectancy. This is now supported in research showing that excessive alcohol consumption is associated with increased mortality. Even though Anton Orel's work highlights issues in the early 20th century, alcoholism still appears to be a major social problem in the 21st century.

Crimes  In 1975, Corwin abducted a classmate, Brenda Evans, at knife point from their high school parking lot while she was getting into her car. He drove her to a remote location in her own car and raped her. He then dragged her out of the car, knocked her down, slit her throat, and stabbed her in the stomach and heart. As she lay in a dirt pit bleeding, he covered her head with a board and covered with dirt and leaves. She survived, and managed to reach the road where she was eventually seen and saved. Corwin was sentenced to forty years in prison for kidnapping, rape and attempted murder. Corwin was released early after nine years. In February 1987, he abducted 72-year-old Alice Martin, who was walking to her home in Normangee, Texas. He drove her to a field in Robertson County where he raped, gagged and stabbed her. In July 1987, he kidnapped 26-year-old Debra Lynn Ewing from her Huntsville workplace and drove her to Montgomery County, where he raped and stabbed her. On October 31, 1987, he attempted to kidnap 36-year-old Mary Carrell Risinger at a car wash in Huntsville. She resisted and screamed for help, which resulted in Corwin slitting her throat in front of her 3-year-old daughter. In October 1988, he abducted another woman Wendy Gant, in her own car, raping, beating and stabbing her several times. He slit her throat and left her for dead. Gant was feigning death and after he left she was able to untie her hands and make her way to a road, where she was found by a driver who summoned police and medical aid. Corwin was tracked down using an artist's sketch from Gant, whose throat was cut so deeply she could not speak to describe the assailant, but described him in writing to the artist and nodded yes or no to the artists questions about the attacker's features. A corrections officer who knew Corwin from prison recognized the sketch when he saw it on the local television news and reported Corwin's name to police. Police subsequently found a fingerprint from Corwin on the driver's side door of Gant's vehicle. During his trial, Corwin confessed to another rape, that of a 13-year-old girl that took place in 1972 when he was only 13 or 14. The police were notified at the time, but the victim couldn't identify her attacker. In 1990, he was sentenced to death by a Montgomery Court. Corwin was executed by lethal injection at the Huntsville Unit on December 7, 1998. His case was shown on Forensic Files II.

It is located in central Vantaa, in the Tikkurila major region. It is bordered to the north by the Ring III beltway, the west by the Tuusulanväylä highway, and south and east by the Helsinki neighbourhood of Siltamäki. The district is regarded as an important cultural and historic site, as it remains one of the best preserved parishes in southern Finland and the original settlement within Greater Helsinki. The Church of St. Lawrence, the oldest building in Greater Helsinki, is located there. In 2009, the Finnish National Board of Antiquities declared the parish an official culturally significant site. In terms of land area, the district is the smallest in all of Vantaa, covering a total of . Its population is also among the smallest, with 147 inhabitants in January 2014. Roughly a third of the population is Swedish-speaking, and all schools in the district are taught in Swedish. History The area was first settled around the 12th century by Swedish colonials sailing up the Vantaanjoki river. The parish was established at the meeting point of the Vantaanjoki and Keravanjoki rivers. It expanded as the coastal King's Road connecting Turku and Vyborg connected to the town. The Church of St. Lawrence was established in the mid-15th century as the center of the parish, and remains the oldest building in all of Greater Helsinki. The parish was the largest township in the area, until the port city of Helsinki was established along the coast in 1550. In 1865, when the Grand Duchy of Finland established municipalities, the area became known as Helsingin maalaiskunta (\\"Rural Municipality of Helsinki\\"), which later became the city of Vantaa. The mining of ore deposits around Malmi gradually transferred industry and housing toward central Vantaa, leaving Helsingin pitäjän kirkonkylä a sparsely populated historical site. Today, Helsingin pitäjän kirkonkylä remains one of the best preserved townships in Uusimaa. Its area has been narrowed by the construction of both the Ring III and Tuusulanväylä highways, which intersect in the area. In 2009, the Finnish National Board of Antiquities declared the parish an official culturally significant site.

Its chief geographical features are the Rag River, small streams, quarries and forestry plantations. Killygreagh is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 166 acres. History From medieval times up to the early 1600s, the land belonged to the McKiernan Clan. The 1609 Plantation of Ulster Map depicts the townland as Keilnagraghan. A grant of 1610 spells the name as Kilnegreighan. A lease of 1611 spells the name as Kilnegrahan. In the Plantation of Ulster King James VI and I by grant dated 27 June 1610, granted the Manor of Keylagh, which included one poll in Kilnegreighan, to John Achmootie, a Scottish Groom of the Bedchamber. His brother Alexander Achmootie was granted the neighbouring Manor of Dromheada. On 16 August 1610 John Aghmootie sold his lands in Tullyhunco to James Craig. On 1 May 1611 James Craig leased, inter alia, 1 poll of Kilnegrahan to Ferrall oge McKernan. On 29 July 1611 Arthur Chichester, 1st Baron Chichester and others reported that John Auchmothy and Alexander Auchmothye have not appeared at the lands awarded to them. James Craige is their deputy for five years, who has brought 4 artificers of divers sorts with their wives and families and 2 other servants. Stone raised for building a mill and trees felled, a walled house with a smith's forge built, 4 horses and mares upon the grounds with competent arms. Sir James Craig died in the siege of Croaghan Castle on 8 April 1642. His land was inherited by his brother John Craig of Craig Castle, County Cavan and of Craigston, County Leitrim, who was chief doctor to both King James I and Charles I. In the Cavan Poll Book of 1761, there were two people registered to vote in Killygreagh in the Irish general election, 1761 \\\\- John Brown and Edward Devinport. They were each entitled to cast two votes. The four election candidates were Charles Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont and Lord Newtownbutler (later Brinsley Butler, 2nd Earl of Lanesborough), both of whom were then elected Member of Parliament for Cavan County. The losing candidates were George Montgomery (MP) of Ballyconnell and Barry Maxwell, 1st Earl of Farnham. Absence from the poll book either meant a resident did not vote or more likely was not a freeholder entitled to vote, which would mean most of the inhabitants of Killygreagh. The 1825 Tithe Applotment Books list six tithepayers in the townland. The Killygreagh Valuation Office books are available for 1838. Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists seven landholders in the townland. In the 19th century Killygreagh was owned by Captain Bedel Stanford. The Stanford Estate papers are in the National Archives of Ireland. Stanford leased 38 acres in Killygreagh to the Thornton Estate. In 1863 this leasehold was sold by the Thornton Estate to Lord Charles Beresford. It was described as-IN THE LANDED ESTATES COURT IRELAND COUNTY OF CAVAN: In the Matter of the Estate of WILLIAM ROBERT THORNTON, Esquire, Owner and Petitioner TO BE SOLD in Lots, on an early day hereafter to be named, the Estate of the late Perrot THORNTON, Esquire, of Greenville, in aid COUNTY OF CAVAN consisting of the Townland of Callaghs, Kiltynaskellan, Roy, Aughaweenagh, Killygreagh, and Ardlogher, situate in the baronies of Tullyhunco and Tullyhaw, and County of Cavan.

Armour has been described in religious texts; including the Itihasa epics Ramayana and Mahabharat, as well as in the Puranas. Vedic period Armour coat made of pangolin scales gilded and lacquered from India, 17th century. Defensive armour was introduced into India by Indo-Aryan peoples, and was most likely unknown to the passive Indus Valley Civilisation. The Vedic age recorded in- fighting among Aryan clans for supremacy over the Indus. In the Battle of the Ten Kings prominent Vedic clans clashed along the Ravi River. The Vedas and the other texts of the period record these struggles in detail and provide a clear picture of the military set up of during those periods. The concept of a warrior class had already gained ground and the kshatriya claimed to have originated from the arms of Purusha. They tried to maintain this distinct identity of their own through their garments and attire. The common attire for the kshatriya warrior was deer skin, in contrast to leather and goat skin used by other castes. Their under-garments were made of flax and cloak dyed with madder. They also wore hemp thread and a bow string as a mark of distinction. Armour was prominently mentioned in the Rigveda: The defensive armors became the integral part of military costume. They were worn after duly sanctified by mantras. It appears that they were used only by the nobility. The average soldier wore deer skin, and is mentioned in the Atharvaveda, stating that the shield and outfit made of deer skin struck terror amid the enemies of god. The nobles and elite warriors wore a coat of mail called a drapi, kavacha, or varman. They covered their back, chest, and lower parts of their body. Certain warriors in the Vedic period wore metal armour called varman. In the Rig Veda the varman is described as sewn armor or a coat of mail that covers the whole body. Historians such as Edward Washburn Hopkins deduce that the armour was metal that covered the body and was connected by wires. On the head multiple metal pieces were connected together for helmets. The kavacha is described to be plate armour and tightly fitted, and covered the chest. The word kavaca is used in Atharva Veda in the sense of a corselet breast plate as opposed to the varman: The use of helmets is frequently mentioned in the vedas. Shirastrana was a helmet or head guard worn by soldiers to protect the head. Siprin would mean a person wearing a helmet. Common soldiers would go bare headed, some kept long hairs and wore animal horns. Indra is described as the golden helmeted hero: Hastaghna was and arm guard used to protect the hands. It was worn on the left arm to avoid friction of bow strings. It was made of leather but later on metal gauntlets seem to have used instead. For the protection of the legs; greaves, anklets, and shoes were used. The noble warriors wore ornaments like armlets, bracelets, clasps, necklaces, and various garlands.  Mythological armour  Karan offering an old poor man, bent with age and destitution, a Kavach that is embedded in his arms and is retrieved by culling with a knife In Mahabharata, there are much evidence of using armour during the battles. ;Kavacha * Karna Kavacha - The armour of Karna that was granted by his father Surya at birth. It was impenetrable even to heavenly weapons.Website dedicated to the story of Karna * Shiva-Kavacha - The armour of Lord Shiva which will make its wielder invincible. ;Khetaka * Jaivardhan - A shield of Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva. * The shield of Shamba. * Srivatsa - The shield of Vishnu, a symbol worshiped and revered by the Hindus, said to be manifested on the god's chest.Sarat Chandra Das (1902). Tibetan-English Dictionary with Sanskrit Synonyms. Calcutta, India: Bengal Secretariat Book Depot, p. 69  Antiquity  Kumara/Kartikeya in scale mail armour with a Kushan devotee, 2nd century CE Armour is discussed in Chanakya's Arthashastra (320 BCE). The Kingdom of Magadha rapidly expanded its military infrastructure under King Ajatashatru, creating the foundation of later empires in Pataliputra. He introduced the rathamusala, an armoured chariot with protruding blades. The Bharhut Stupa depicts the use of leather scale armour. Furthermore, on the Sanchi Stupa, soldiers are depicted wearing quilted armour. There are references by historians noting the armour King Porus used in battle against Alexander. The scholar Arrian recorded that the armour was shot-proof, and remarkably well fitted. Gupta period Gupta era soldier in scale armour. During the Gupta period scale mail armour used as composed of metal and sometimes leather. Guptas were more than two centuries more advanced than the equipment and technology being depicted here and that their armour was built to withstand torsion-driven steel bows. Siva-Dhanur-Veda discusses the military of the Gupta Empire. The Guptas relied heavily on armoured war elephants; horses were used little if at all. The use of chariots had declined heavily by the time of the Guptas, as they had not proved very useful against the Greeks, Scythians, and other invaders. Guptas utilised heavy cavalry clad in mail armour and equipped with maces and lances, who would have used shock action to break the enemy line. During the Satavahana period the armour was inspired by the armour used by the Indo-Scythians and the Alchon Huns. Medieval period  Group of Indian Armour  Early Medieval period (1206 CE-1526 CE)  During 12th century chainmail armour is first introduced in the Indian subcontinent and used by Turkic armies. A reference of chainmail armour was found in the inscription of Mularaja II and also at the Battle of Delhi where it was used by the armoured war elephants. Udayaprabha Suri, in his Sukrita-Kirti-Kallolini, states that Naikidevi gave Mularaja an army to play with. With this army, Mularaja defeated the Hammira (Sanskrit form of Emir) and his mlechchha army, whose soldiers were covered from head to toe in order to protect themselves.  Later Medieval period (1526 CE-1757 CE)  Mughal armour  In the 16th century the armour in the Indian subcontinent developed very much. Armour such as chainmail and scale mail are widely used by the Mughals. The use of armour continues until the Battle of Plassey in 1757. Mughal helmets Despite the similarity in their design, the Khula Khud helmets were decorated with a wide degree of variations depending on the cultures from which they were created. Decorations often appeared in the skull and the nasal bar, which were often heavily decorated with patterned motifs of inlaid brass, silver or gold; or decorated with figurative images. One Mughal top helmet featured calligraphic inscriptions from the Quran, supposedly to gain \\"Help from Allah and a speedy victory.\\" A top discovered in Gwalior, India, featured a motif of the skull and crossbones sign of European influence. Another part of the Khula Khud helmet that was often a focus of artistic decoration, was the leaf-shaped finials of the nasal bar. A Sikh top featured the figure of Ganesha carved onto the nasal bar. The Khula Khud helmet was only decorated with some metals, and usually no organic decorations. Maratha armour Maratha armour is very similar to the Mughal armour but in the Maratha army, the infantry used armour while the cavalry is always lightly armoured, such as the leather armour. Maratha armour is mostly inspired by the Mughal armour. References Further reading  * Roy, Kaushik.

After the withdrawal of the Universities' Mission to Central Africa those Makololo remaining in the Shire valley used firearms provided by the Europeans to attract dependants seeking protection, to seize land and to establish a number of chieftainships. At the time that a British protectorate was established in 1891, there were seven Makololo chiefs of which six were recognised by the government. Five survived to be given local governmental powers in 1933, and these powers continued after Malawi became independent. Although called Makololo or Kololo, after the ruling group in Barotseland in the 1850s, the majority came from peoples subject to the Makololo who adopted the more prestigious name. As, regardless of their origin, they took wives from among the inhabitants of the Shire Valley, their modern descendants have little connection with the Kololo people apart from their name. Makololo arrival in Malawi The missionary activities of David Livingstone in Botswana for the London Missionary Society effectively ended in 1851 when he left Kolobeng Mission after failing to convert more than a few local people. During his last two years at Kolobeng, Livingstone had made three journeys well to the north of the mission which convinced him that the successful evangelisation of the interior of Africa would be achieved through exploring and mapping its navigable rivers as highways for missionaries and traders to enter the continental interior. Between 1852 and 1856, Livingstone mapped most of the course of the Zambezi, and made a transcontinental journey from Luanda on the Atlantic to Quelimane on the Indian Ocean between 1854 and 1856.Jeal, (2013). pp. 93, 103–105. This journey was accomplished with the help of 27 Africans provided as porters by Sekeletu, the King of Barotseland and chief of the Makololo or Kololo people, which had conquered Barotseland in the previous decade, for the passage from Luanda to Linyanti, now in Namibia, and later with 114 men from the same source for the journey from Linyanti to Quelimane. Bennett, (1970). p. 42.Jeal, (2013). pp. 147-8. From Sekeletu's perspective, establishing a secure route to the Atlantic or Indian Ocean, rather than relying on the dangerous and insecure one southward to the Cape Colony was well worth the loan of these men and they contributed significantly to Livingstone's success. Bennett, (1970). pp. 58-9. Although, following the name Livingstone gave them, these men are conventionally called \\"Makololo\\" after the ruling group in Barotseland, most of them probably belonged to the Lozi people or other subject peoples of Sekeletu's kingdom that inhabited the Caprivi Strip around Linyanti,McCracken, (2012). p. 39. and who were usually described as Makalaka.Graham-Jolly, (1966). pp. 7. Around 100 of these men were left at Tete in 1856 when Livingstone made his way to Quelimane and then to Britain. The local governor at Tete oversaw their welfare and they hunted elephant and cultivated land to support themselves there.McCracken, (2012). p. 41. Although on one level, the individuals involved were working for both Sekeletu's and Livingstone's goals, those that the Makololo contemptuously dismissed as Makalaka, vassals or serfs, saw the expedition as a way to gain, wealth, authority, and power that their social position denied them in their homeland.Kalusa, (2009). p. 59. The Makololo conquest had been completed barely a decade before Livingstone's arrival and the senior Makololo indunas had gained control of the traditional sources of the country's wealth, making emigration or association with new sources of wealth the Europeans promised and the firearms that they provided the best options for the young men of the subject populations seeking advancement.Kalusa, (2009). pp. 62, 68-9. After he had completed his first Zambezi expedition, the London Missionary Society told Livingstone it was unable to support him in exploration rather than missionary work, and he resigned from the society in 1857. Livingstone's second Zambezi expedition that started in 1858 was diverted up the Shire River in January 1859 after it was found that the Zambezi was not navigable beyond the Cabora Bassa rapids, which he had bypassed on his first expedition.McCracken, (2012). pp. 39-40. On reaching Tete, he was reunited with the porters he had left there in 1856 and attempted to repatriate them all to Barotseland. However, by this time Sekeletu was facing increasing opposition from the Lozi majority, and a number of porters decided to remain on the middle Zambezi. These included two Makololo who had a superior status and their servants, the remainder being porters or canoemen from the subject peoples,Northrup, (1986). p. 71. and there were either 15 or 16 of them. They were used from 1859 onward, first by Livingstone and then by missionaries of the Universities' Mission to Central Africa (UMCA), as porters and armed guards to support their activities in the Shire valley and Shire Highlands including the freeing of slaves, and were paid in guns, ammunition and cloth.White, (1987). pp. 17, 21, 39. In 1861, after the original UMCA mission site at Magomero in the Shire Highlands was abandoned, the Makololo relocated with the missionaries to the Shire valley, from where the missionaries withdrew in January 1864. The Makololo decided to remain.White, (1987). pp. 61, 64-5, 67. Formation of chiefdoms What is now southern Malawi was relatively peaceful, prosperous and densely populated by the Mang'anja people at the time of Livingstone's first visit in early 1859, but was about to become the focus of disruption caused by the large-scale migration of Yao people. The early Yao migrations from the 1830s involved few people and were relatively peaceful but, whether forced out of their earlier territory in Mozambique by the Makua people, by famine, by slave traders, by internal Yao conflicts or some combination of these, larger numbers of Yao moved, firstly, into the Niassa Province of Mozambique east of Lake Nyasa and then into the Shire Highlands in the 1850s. These incursions disrupted agriculture and caused widespread famine in the Shire Highland in the early 1860s as the local people abandoned their farms.Northrup, (1986). pp. 60-2 .White, (1987). pp. 27-9, 56-7. The Mang'anja were one of the Maravi cluster of peoples who moved into the Lower Zambezi and Lower Shire river valleys before the end of 16th century and coalesced into a number of loosely connected chieftainships which, under pressure from the Portuguese in the Lower Zambezi valley, recognised paramount chiefs with the titles of Lundu, Kalonga and Kaphwiti.Newitt (1982), pp. 147-8, 152-3, 157-60. These paramount chiefs derived some of their prestige through guardianship of the main shrines of the M'Bona Cult, and the Lundu kingdom, which included most of the Mang'anja people, controlled the main M'Bona shrine until the early 19th century. At that time, pressure from supposedly subordinate chiefs controlling other shrines and attacks from Afro-Portuguese chikunda raiding for slaves left the Lundu state with little real power over what had become a loose confederation of local chiefdoms.Schoffeleers (1972), pp. 74-5. In the early 1860s, members of Livingstone's expedition or UCMA missionaries described the Mang'anja as being ruled by a hierarchy of chiefs and headmen of varying power and influence. In theory, the Lundu was still the paramount ruler with the power to appoint local chiefs, but his influence was limited. Several major chiefs within the Lundu sphere had more real power the than the Lundu himself, although their inability to defend their people against attacks by the Yao and chikunda was beginning to reduce their prestige.White (1987), pp. 46-7. As a result of those attacks, some of the Mang'anja in the Shire Highlands were killed or exported as slaves to the Indian Ocean coast, others died of famine or famine-related disease and yet others fled to the Shire valley or the uplands beyond.McCracken, (2012). pp. 33-4.White (1987), pp. 56-7. The loss of population in the Shire Highlands was very great, and much land went out of cultivation and reverted to forest.McCracken, (2012). p. 35.White (1987), pp. 65-6. Even thirty years later at the start of the colonial period, large areas of the Shire Highlands were underpopulated and remained so until the large-scale immigration of Lomwe people fleeing famine and forced labour in Mozambique at the end of the 19th century.Pachai, (1978). p. 36.White (1987), pp. 80-1, 87-8. Those Mang'anja remaining in the Shire Highlands were either slave wives or domestic slaves in Yao households or occupied defensible hilltops and inaccessible lakeshores.McCracken, (2012). pp. 35-6.White (1987), p. 79. Once the Makololo had relocated to the Shire valley, they maintained themselves though hunting elephants for ivory and attracted Mang'anja dependents seeking protection, many of whom were slaves liberated from slave caravans who had lost contact with their original homes. The freed women became polygamous wives of the Makololo and the men cultivated farmland seized from its original inhabitants.Northrup, (1986). pp. 72-3. After the 1864 departure of the UMCA mission, which left behind supplies of arms, munitions and trade goods, the Makololo and their armed dependents attacked local Mang'anja chiefs and established chieftaincies in the present- day Chikwawa District.McCracken, (2012). pp. 41-2. Graham-Jolly records the names of 16 original Makololo, but nothing is known of six of them beyond their names, and they were probably absorbed into the local population, losing their Makololo identity. The other ten became chiefs or headmen: two of these, Kasisi and Mloka, were said to be true Makololo rather than coming from subject peoples, and these were the first leaders of the group.Graham-Jolly, (1966). pp. 7-8. The chiefs or headmen that were not originally Makololo soon also adopted what they considered the more prestigious, if fictitious, name of Makololo.Northrup, (1986). p. 62. The Mang'anja put up little resistance to Kasisi, Mloka and their men and, apart from the deaths of the Lundu and Kaphwiti paramounts and a few followers, the takeover was relatively bloodless. Some Mang'anja chiefs were willing to cooperate with the Makololo against other Mang'anja who were their enemies, whereas the Makololo remained united among themselves and determined to build up their power.Northrup, (1986). p. 74. At first, Kasisi and Mloka divided the land they had occupied between them, with Kasisi as senior ruler. Kasisi enjoyed reasonably good relations with the Yao which, together with his guns, kept him and his dependents safe from Yao attacks. The Makololo were also some distance away from two other potential enemies. The more powerful and active were the Maseko Ngoni in present-day Ntcheu District, and Kasisi set up fortified villages at fords along the Shire River as protection against Ngoni raids. Several Makololo and some of their Mang'anja dependents were installed as headmen in these villages and, on the death of Mloka, Kasisi divided his former territory between three of the original Makololo.Graham-Jolly, (1966). p. 8. Until the death of their leader, Paul Marianno II in 1863, the Afro-Portuguese chikunda had considerable power and influence in the Lower Shire valley. However, as Marianno's son was then only 8 years old, he required a long minority, during which there were power struggles between the child's mother, his aunt and a prominent chikunda leader, which made it difficult to resist growing power of the Makololo, and the chikunda retreated further down the Shire.Newitt, (1970). pp. 91-3. Later history The territories of the two largest Makololo chiefdoms were each about 500 square miles in extent, the others being smaller. Between the 1870s and 1910s, the original ten Makololo that became chiefs or headmen died and several of their lines of descent died out or merged with others, so that there were seven Makololo chiefs in 1891.McCracken, (2012). pp. 41, 73. Since 1888, the most powerful of these was Mlauri, who tried to use the position of his village on a hill above the Shire River to dominate traffic on the river in the 1880s and impose tolls on European steamers using it. He became increasingly hostile to both British and Portuguese influences and, in 1889, he attacked a Portuguese military force under Major Alexandre de Serpa Pinto and was severely defeated, later fleeing from his village. As he had previously shown hostility to British as well as Portuguese forces, the British government did nothing to restore him and declined to recognise him as a chief. Mlauri was never restored although he lived until 1913.Graham-Jolly, (1966). p. 9.McCracken, (2012). pp. 41, 54-6 73. The other six Makololo chiefs were recognised, and five of their chiefdoms survived to be recognised as a Native Authority by the Nyasaland government in 1933 under the policy of Indirect rule,McCracken, (2012). pp. 73, 88. their titles were Kasisi, Makwira, Katunga, Masea and Mwita.Graham-Jolly, (1966). pp. 10-14. Apart from Mlauri, most of the Makololo chiefs valued their former connection with Livingstone and were favourably disposed to British missionaries and traders entering their area. They traded ivory in exchange for guns, ammunition and trade goods from the 1870s until a protectorate was established by John Buchanan in 1889 and extended into the British Central Africa Protectorate in 1891.White, (1987). pp. 67, 76. The Makololo had a virtual monopoly over the collection of ivory in the lower Shire valley, which they sold to the African Lakes Company as they were unable to use the Shire- Zambezi route to the coast through Portuguese territory. There was a certain amount of friction between the Makololo and the African Lakes Company by the mid-1880s, because the company was unwilling to supply them with firearms and ammunition, which it did supply to independent African hunters competing with the Makololo. The Makololo in turn tried to bypass the company by trading with independent European traders, until one of these killed a Makololo chief in a dispute over trade goods and was in turn killed by the chief's men.Graham- Jolly, (1966). p. 10.McCracken, (2012). pp. 41, 49 73. Relations with the Portuguese were difficult because they controlled the main access route to the coast and also laid claim to the Shire valley and Shire Highlands. The guardians of the young Paul Marianno III had been forced to withdraw south of the Ruo River on the eastern bank of the Shire, and their power on the western bank of the Shire virtually ended. In an attempt to regain these lost territories, an alliance of the prazeros of the middle Zambezi attacked the Makololo and were heavily defeated in 1877. In the same year and until 1881, the Makololo chiefs attacked the prazos of Marianno III and his allies, which were in areas of Portuguese jurisdiction. Fears that the Makololo were part of a British attempt, also including the Scottish missions and African Lakes Corporation, to claim the areas attacked persuaded the Portuguese government to reinforce its claims to the area by sending a number of expeditions there.Newitt, (1970). pp. 93-4. As a result, the Scottish missionaries in Blantyre protested to the British government, asking it to oppose any Portuguese claim the Shire Highlands.Newitt, (1970). p. 96. After Serpa Pinto's battles with Mlauri, Serpa Pinto's second-in-command took two armed steamboats up the Shire River to overawe the Makololo and some of their chiefs fled to the European settlement of Blantyre for safety, provoking the declaration of a British protectorate over the disputed area.McCracken, (2012). pp. 41, 54-5. The first two colonial administrators of the British Central Africa Protectorate, Harry Johnstone and Alfred Sharpe, did not wish to involve African chiefs in the governance of the protectorate or to acknowledge their authority, but the small number of colonial officials in the protectorate and its poverty meant that many chiefs continued to exercise their traditional powers unofficially.Rotberg (1965), pp. 22-3. As the administration did not recognise chiefs, it only removed those that had opposed them and made no attempt to replace Yao, Ngoni or Makololo chiefs that ruled people of different ethnicity.McCracken (2012), p. 68. A government Ordinance of 1912 sanctioned the governmental appointment of Principal Headmen, with limited authority as government agents in their areas. Most were prominent local chiefs, including six Makololo chiefs.McCracken (2012), pp. 72-3. In 1933, a form of Indirect rule was introduced by the governor of Nyasaland, Sir Hubert Young, who appointed chiefs as local government officials with wider powers than in 1912, but with no jurisdiction over European-owned estates and no financial responsibilities.Rotberg (1965), p. 50. The Provincial Commissioner in the south of Nyasaland wished to deal with the anomaly that the five Makololo chiefs in Chikwawa District ruled over predominantly Mang'anja populations, whereas seven Mang'anja chiefs in the neighbouring Nsanje District had a majority of Sena immigrants as their subjects, but no changes were made.McCracken, (2012). p. 224. The Native Authority scheme generally worked well until the mid-1940s, but in the post- Second World War period, most chiefs lost legitimacy by enforcing unpopular government policies. By the early 1950s, Indirect rule was barely operating in many areas and the political initiative had passed to the Nyasaland African Congress.McCracken (2012), p. 230. However, after the country gained independence as Malawi in 1964, the Malawian government halted the decline of Indirect rule and, under the presidency of Hastings Banda, the chiefs, including the five Makololo chiefs, regained their lost status and became an essential part of the state apparatus.Cammack, Kanyongolo and O’Neil (2009), pp. 5-6.

It is produced by Subrata Roy, Joydeb Mondal and stars Sonamoni and Rahul Majumdar in lead roles. Sujan Mukherjee, Tanima Sen, Rayati Bhattacharya among others play supporting roles. Since its launch, Debi Chaudhurani became one of the most-watched shows on its airing channel, Star Jalsha. The show is an onscreen adaptation of Bankim Chandra Chattapadhyay's renowned novel with the same name. Bankimchandra renewed the call for a resurgent India that fights against oppression of the British Empire with strength from within the common people, based on traditional Indian values of austerity, dedication and selflessness. He championed the tryst of a female protagonist who fought for her people against the oppression of vile zamindars and British Raj. Plot Based on a novel by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, this period drama follows Prafulla's journey, starting as an innocent young girl, and eventually becoming Debi Chaudhurani, a powerful bandit queen. The show charts the journey of Prafulla an ordinary girl to become an iconic woman, an aspirational leader and a legendary warrior. Prafulla's journey to becoming ‘Debi Choudhurani’ is nothing short of iconic, she's the savior of the poor, she's revered and respected by all. Like a true queen she fought for her people against the oppression of the British empire and the cruel zamindars. Bankim Chandra championed the struggle of a woman protagonist at a time when women were still behind the purdah, which inspired so many women to gradually join in on the independence movement. How Prafulla, a woman from an orthodox Bengali backdrop turns into a name feared by the British rulers hold relevance to Bengalis across generations and timelines. A revered leader, a moral compass, a savior to her peasantry, an epitome of austerity and selflessness, very few icons uphold the Bengali feminine spirit as Debi Choudhurani does.

It is an archaeological site situated at the outskirts of the capital of the First Bulgarian Empire, Preslav. At its heyday in the 9th and 10th centuries, the monastery was among the leading centres of the Preslav Literary School, as well as one of the most prominent centres of production of painted decorative ceramics.  Location  The monastery is situated high on the right bank of the Golyama Kamchiya River within the territory of the Patleina Reserve in Dragoevska Mountain at the foothills of the eastern section of the Balkan Mountains. It is located about 6 km south of the town of Veliki Preslav and 2.5 km from the outside fortress walls of the old city.  History  The renowned icon of Saint Theodore Stratelates discovered at the monastery The monastery was established after the Christianization of Bulgaria in the 9th century during the reign of Boris I (r. 852–889). It was destroyed in 971 by the Byzantines when they seized Preslav in the aftermath of the Sviatoslav's invasion of Bulgaria and was repeatedly plundered and devastated by the Pechenegs and the Cumans in the 11th and 12th centuries during the Byzantine rule of Bulgaria. According to researchers, the monastery was an important literary centre during the First Bulgarian Empire and of the most important sites of the Preslav Literary School, there the disciples of the Saints Cyril and Methodius, Clement of Ohrid and Naum of Preslav had worked. The Patleina Monastery was also an artistic-production centre. During the excavations of the site carried out between 1909 and 1914, a 10th century mosaic ceramic icon of Saint Theodore Stratelates was discovered. It has since become one of the symbols of the medieval Bulgarian heritage and is now kept at the National Archaeological Museum. Other artefacts dates from the 9th and 10th centuries excavated at the site include ceramic icons of Saint Philip and Mark the Evangelist, crucifixes, a bronze matrix of an icon of blessing Christ sitting on a throne. The monastery was declared a monument of culture. In the 1940s a new monetary was constructed on the slope over the medieval site. However, it was never consecrated as it was nationalised after 1944 by the new Socialist authorities and converted into a vacation home.  Description  A view to the crypt The Patleina Monastery is ruined. The complex included of cross-shaped church, residential and commercial buildings. The edifices are set on a narrow terrace at the foot of a steep mountain slope overgrown with linden, hornbeam and oak trees. There are three courtyards – one for prayer, one facing the residential building and one with ceramic and glass workshops. The church with the residential quarters south of it occupied the western part of the terrace; the rest of the buildings used to against the slopes from the west and north. A few metres to the north of the church was the monastery crypt consisting of six burial chambers. The church had been refurbished. It was originally cross-domed with a narthex and an apse and a total length of 12.60 m. After the reconstruction, the side walls are reinforced. There were two lateral apses next to the altar, was well was two rectangular premises adjacent to the western façade. The interior of the church was richly decorated with marble plinths with ornamental friezes. The cladding on the walls was of painted ceramic tiles; the floor was covered in multicoloured mosaics.Енциклопедия: Шуменска област, Изд.

Background The Ionian Islands (Corfu, Paxoi, Zakynthos, Kefalonia, Lefkada, Ithaca, and Kythira) along with a handful of exclaves on the Epirote mainland, namely the coastal towns of Parga, Preveza, Vonitsa, and Butrinto, had been Venetian possessions for centuries, thereby becoming the only part of the Greek world to escape conquest by the Ottoman Empire. Following the Fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797, the islands came under French control, with French troops disembarking on Corfu on 28 June 1797. The French were welcomed by the populace, and the radical ideas of the French Revolution were implemented with the abolition of the local nobility and the installation of democratic regimes and local self-government on the islands. In the Treaty of Campo Formio, the islands were annexed as French departments. Map of the Septinsular Republic in orange, in 1801; Ottoman territory in green The French presence was resented by the local aristocracy, now deprived of its privileges, while the heavy taxation and anti-clericalism of the French soon made them unpopular with broad sections of the common populace as well. Following the French invasion of Egypt furthermore, the French presence in the Ionian Islands aroused the opposition of the Ottomans and the Russian Empire. In autumn 1798, a joint Russo-Ottoman fleet evicted the French from the other islands and finally captured Corfu in March 1799, while the autonomous Ottoman strongman Ali Pasha of Yanina took the opportunity to seize Butrinto, Preveza, and Vonitsa from the French. In all the islands they occupied, the Russians installed provisional administrations of nobles and burghers. Very soon, the Russian authorities invited assemblies of the nobles to undertake the governance of the Ionian Islands, thereby restoring the previous status quo. On 6 May, the commanders of the two fleets announced that the Ionian Islands would comprise a unitary state, governed by a Senate (Γερουσία) in Corfu city, composed of three representatives each from Corfu, Cephalonia, and Zakynthos, two from Lefkada, and one each from Ithaca, Kythira, and Paxoi. The Venetian nobleman , the last Venetian provveditore of Argostoli, was appointed head of the Senate, and entrusted with the creation of a constitution for the new state. Orio's constitution envisaged a thoroughly aristocratic regime, with each island headed by a Great Council composed of the nobles and the upper bourgeoisie. The Great Councils would elected the senators. Each island would retain a local administration and a treasury, but a central treasury would exist in Corfu. The Senate was the ultimate executive authority, and its chairman the head of state. A Small Council of 40 would be elected by the Great Councils of the three largest islands, and would be responsible for justice, the selection of officials, and advising on legislation. On 21 June 1799, the Senate decided to send a twelve-member delegation to Constantinople and Saint Petersburg to express its gratitude to the Sultan and Tsar, but also press for the restoration of the Islands' maritime and land frontier with the withdrawal of Ali Pasha from Butrinto, Preveza, and Vonitsa, and their recognition as an independent state. As Angelo Orio participated in the delegation, he was replaced as head of the Senate by Count Spyridon Georgios Theotokis. Once in Constantinople, however, the delegation quickly realized that the Porte was not interested in recognizing the Islands' independence, but rather in creating a vassal state under Ottoman suzerainty. At the suggestion of the Russian ambassador, , the delegation submitted a memorandum to the other ambassadors, requesting the recognition of the Islands as an independent and federal state, under the protection of the European powers. Two of the delegates, the Corfiot Count Antonio Maria Capodistrias and the Zakynthian Count Nikolaos Gradenigos Sigouros Desyllas remained in Constantinople to conduct negotiations with the Porte, while Orio and another delegate, Kladas, were to represent the Ionian cause in Saint Petersburg. Provisions of the treaty The negotiations and mutual rivalties between Russia, the Porte, and the Islanders, led to the signing of the Treaty of Constantinople on 21 March 1800, which created the first autonomous Greek state since the Fall of the Byzantine Empire. According to the provisions of the treaty, the Ionian Islands would be a unitary, autonomous state, under the name Republic of the Seven United Islands (). It would follow the long- established model of the Republic of Ragusa, being an aristocratic republic led by the \\"primates and notables\\", and under Ottoman suzerainty, as token of which they would pay an annual tribute of 75,000 piastres to the Sultan. This was a victory for the Sultan, and a disappointment for the Islanders, who had been promised the right to choose their own form of governance in the proclamations of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, Gregory V, and the head of the Russian fleet, Admiral Fyodor Ushakov. The new state's constitution, once agreed, would be approved by the signatory powers. As the new state lacked military forces, Russian and Ottoman forces would remain to garrison its forts and guarantee its security until the end of the war against France. The mainland exclaves of Parga, Vonitsa, Preveza, and Butrinto, would come under Ottoman control but would enjoy a special status similar to that of the Danubian Principalities: they would enjoy special privileges as to the practice of the Christian religion and administration of justice, and no Muslim would be allowed to own land or settle there, apart from the Ottoman commandant. Taxation was also set at no more than had been under Venetian rule, and a two-year tax exemption was announced to recover from the effects of French rule and the war. The \\"Byzantine\\" Constitution and ratification Flag of the Septinsular Republic Capodistrias and Sigouros Desyllas also composed a draft for the new constitution, and designed the new flag of the state. The so-called \\"Byzantine\\" Constitution, as it was composed in Constantinople (Byzantion), comprised 37 articles. It envisaged an aristocratic federal republic, with a local administration on every island, headed by three syndics, to be chosen annually from the Great Council of the nobles of each island. The syndics elected a prytanis as head of administration for four-month tenures. The Senate in Corfu remained the highest authority of the federal state, composed of the representatives of the islands. Its chairman, the archon, was the head of state. In keeping with the reactionary ideas embodied in the constitution was also the new flag, sporting the Venetian Lion of Saint Mark holding a bundle of seven arrows, symbolizing the islands, and a Bible; more radical suggestions, such as the rising phoenix, were rejected. On 1 November 1800, the delegates were received by the Grand Vizier, who presented them with the new constitution, a diploma recognizing the autonomy of the Republic and regulated its relations to the Porte, and the new flag. Then a solemn procession brought them to the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Phanar, where Patriarch Neophytus VII blessed the flag of the new state. The treaty was recognized, and adhered to, by the United Kingdom in January 1801. Aftermath The new regime envisaged in the \\"Byzantine\\" Constitution proved short-lived, as popular reaction led to the adoption of new constitutions in 1801 and 1803. The Septinsular Republic survived until the reimposition of French rule in 1807, following the Treaty of Tilsit. The British soon challenged the French for mastery, and in 1809 took control of most of the islands; Corfu surrendered following the resignation of Napoleon in 1814. In 1815 the British established the United States of the Ionian Islands.

Life   Childhood and first jobs  Christa Lehmann was born in 1922 as Christa Ambros in Worms. She grew up almost without parents, and her mother lived in a health and nursing home in Alzey. After attending elementary school, Christa found work in a leather goods factory, later moving to Hoechst AG. During this time she was sentenced to probation for stealing and theft.  Marriage  At Hoechst she met Karl Franz Lehmann, whom she married in 1944. Due to stomach sickness and his slight limping, Karl was deferred from military service. The couple moved to Lehmann's parents' house in Worms. They earned their living with a tiling business, but also through the black market trade. However, the currency reform put an end to this, a fact with which Christa could hardly arrange, resulting in disputes and brawls with her alcoholic husband, as well as violent clashes with her in-laws. Christa Lehmann entered into short-lived relationships with American occupation soldiers and other men.  The murders  Karl Franz Lehmann died unexpectedly on 27 September 1952 within a half hour of violent convulsions. The doctor determined the cause of death as peptic ulcer disease, which seemed quite plausible given the known stomach disease and alcohol dependency. After the death of her husband, Christa Lehmann met more often in her apartment with her ever-changing love affairs. The confrontations with her husband were replaced by bitter arguments with father-in-law Valentin Lehmann, who saw the reputation of his house in danger. On 14 October 1953 Valentin Lehmann fell clinically dead from his bicycle during a trip to the city. The doctor summoned by passers-by diagnosed the death as heart failure. Christa Lehmann made friends with Annie Hamann, a war widow who lived in a common household with her mother Eva Ruh, her brother Walter and her 9-year-old daughter. Hamann also had changing relationships with American soldiers and went out a lot with Lehmann, a circumstance that Eva Ruh profoundly disapproved of. On Sunday 14 February 1954 Lehmann came to visit and brought five chocolate mushrooms with liquor filling. She shared four of the chocolates with Annie, her brother, a neighbour who happened to be around, and offered the fifth one to Eva. She politely declined and put it aside. The next day Annie came home, found the praline in the kitchen cupboard, bit into it, swallowed a part and spat the other half out disgusted on the floor. The family dog ate the rest of the praline immediately. A short time later, Hamann paled, stumbled and said she could no longer see anything. She staggered into the bedroom, accompanied by her mother, and lay plagued on the bed. She lost consciousness and Eva Ruh sought help. When the doctor called by the neighbours arrived, Annie Hamann was already dead, as was the dog in the kitchen. After describing the events, the doctor informed the police.  Conviction  Annie Hamann's body was confiscated and brought to Mainz in the forensic institute. After long investigations (inter alia on strychnine), Prof. Kurt Wagner tested Hamann's stomach contents on the plant protection product E 605, a poison that had been invented in Germany but was used until then mainly in the USA. The poisoning effect was very similar to that of hydrogen cyanide. By that time, however, there had been no proven case of murder or suicide using E 605. The 168 cases of poisoning documented in the USA until 1953 were due to gross negligence and were rather mild, with the exception of nine cases. Therefore, there was not method to prove E 605 forensically. Christa Lehmann was arrested and interrogated. On 23 February she made a confession. It was not meant for Annie, but for her mother. On 19 March the bodies of Karl Franz and Valentin Lehmann were exhumed. Both showed signs of E 605. On 20 September 1954 the trial of Christa Lehmann began. She was sentenced to life imprisonment. In Neuwied prison Lehmann tried several times to take her own life. In 1971 she was transferred to the women's prison in Frankfurt. After 23 years of prison, she was released and since then has lived freely under a new identity.  Aftermath  The crop protection product E 605 was given the name Wormser Gift in the extensive press coverage of Lehmann's trial and subsequently enjoyed great popularity as a \\"fashion poison\\" in Germany and Austria. It was used for many murders and suicides until the 1950s. This also meant that the previously colorless and almost odorless poison was denatured and colored.

Jacques Plumain would have stunned her from behind and dragged away from prying eyes. He would then stab her and slit her throat before lowering her panties, without committing any rape. He has always denied this murder and has never been found guilty in his two trials. * Barbel Zobel, a 38-year-old woman, was assaulted in Kehl as she was leaving her home to work early in the morning of November 23, 1999. Zobel was hit from behind but had time to call for help; this is when her husband intervened and Plumain fled. * Gisela Dallmann, a 66-year-old woman who was also killed in Kehl around 3 AM on December 4, 1999, while distributing newspapers in mailboxes. Jacques Plumain said that he was looking for a nightclub and that he was lost in small roads; he claims to have seen Dallmann distributing newspapers, approaching her from behind. But Dallmann got scared and Plumain put his hand against the woman's mouth, which she bit and to silence her, he killed her by and dragged her body into an isolated corner where he cut off her carotid and lowered her panties. He also stated that he put his finger in the vagina of the woman to imitate a rape. Dallmann's body was found in the backyard of a building. * Ursula Brelowski, 44 years old, was killed on May 15, 2000 in the La Wantzenau forest near Strasbourg; Plumain recounts crossing the road and seeing Brelowski, a teacher, cycling by and asked her how she was doing. Brelowski told Plumain that he was clearly mistaken and according to him, Ursula told him: \\"I do not have negroes in my relationship\\". Jacques Plumain became enraged and hit the woman until she fainted, then dragged her into the forest where he stabbed her a dozen times (to the chest, arms and legs) before he slit her throat. As with the previous victims, he lowered Ursula's panties to simulate a rape. Given the insistence of the victim's family, anxious to rehabilitate the memory of Ursula, Plumain eventually admitted that the victim had in fact never made the racist remarks at him.  Arrest  In January 2001, Plumain was arrested for assaulting a motorist with a katana. He claims he had an account to settle with the motorist with whom he violently disputed a few months earlier. During his interrogation on the crimes Plumain quite quickly confessed and told at the same time that the on the evening of Brelowski's murder he went out to kill because he felt impulses which grew stronger and stronger. Moreover, he admitted that he never wanted to kill Barbel Zobel but that he had attacked her because he was stealing bicycle tires and that she surprised him. On the other hand, he denies any involvement in the murder of Hatice Celik.  Trial and sentence  In September 2003, the trial of Jacques Plumain began at a cour d'assises of Bas-Rhin in Strasbourg, for the attempted murder on the motorist in 2001. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison. On May 18, 2005, the trial of Jacques Plumain for murders began at the cour d'assises of Bas-Rhin. The defense of Plumain was provided by Emmanuel Karm and Jean Guibert. Gioia Zirone was the lawyer of Barbel Zobel, Thomas Mutter was the lawyer of Marc Fisher, the former companion of Ursula Brelowski and Brice Raymondeau-Castanet was the general counsel. Jacques Plumain was cold, detached and hardly spoke. It was also established that Plumain had invented a character name \\"Maïve\\" and that it is this Maïve (in the words of Plumain) who would have killed all those women. Jacques Plumain also states that he assaulted Zobel partly because she looked like his own mother. The lawyer of the family of Ursula Brelowski claimed that the latter never treated Plumain as a 'negro' and that he had killed her only by impulse and not for racism. Psychiatric experts noted that Plumain was a mythomaniac, that he has a normal sexuality but having sexually assaulted these women showed a desire to debase the victims. On June 3, 2005, Jacques Plumain was sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment with a 20-year prison sentence. He was acquitted of Celik's murder. The prosecution appealed the decision. On March 27, 2006, the appeal process for Plumain began at a cour d'assises at Bas-Rhin court in Colmar. On April 12, 2006, Plumain was resentenced to life imprisonment with a 20-year sentence of imprisonment.

He ended up being fired for threatening to set the station on fire because he was annoyed by a remark made to him by his boss. His father died in 2002.  Events and the investigation  On November 22, 1985 at the end of the afternoon, at the biscuit district in Lille, 7-year-old Nathalie Hoareau was sent by her mother to buy cigarettes and bread. Waxin approached her and offered to show her his shack. She followed him to a wasteland in the rue de Faubourg Arras (RD 549), where he raped her, tried to strangle her with a candy necklace she wore around her neck before stabbing her twice in the heart. Nathalie's mother reported her disappearance to the police at 6:30 PM. Her body, the lower part of which was bare, was found in the evening in a bush by two policemen. Near her, they found the packets of cigarettes she had bought and the shopping list on which the shopkeeper had written a message for her mother. A trace of sperm was found, but the rain had altered it, making it impossible to establish a genetic profile. On October 8, 1990, in the Austerlitz in Wazemmes, Cathy Monchaux, 9 years old, was playing in the garden of her residence.\\"Little Cathy has been murdered\\" Article published on October 10, 1990 in L'Humanité At 8 PM, her father Roger called her to come back home. Waxin then approached her and offered to buy candy, taking her to an old football field turned into a wasteland on Victor-Hugo boulevard. He raped then stabbed her fourteen times because she tried to escape. When Cathy did not return, her father and older sister, Valérie, went out looking for her. Unsuccessful, her father informed the police at 9 PM. A day later, a man walking his dog found Cathy's naked body. On July 23, 1992, at the end of the afternoon on Georges-Mandel street in Moulins, Nadjia Thebib, 4 years old, was playing with other children at the foot of a HLM building where her grandmother Meriem lived on the ground floor. Her parents had just separated. Waxin went in the direction of Ronchin. He carried her in his arms, and since she was calm, her family supposed that he was an uncle of Nadjia. Anissa, Nadjia's aunt, pursued him in the streets, but she stumbled and lost sight of him. Nadjia's mother Nina went out looking for her with the help of the other family members. She reported the abduction to the police at 8 PM. Anissa described the kidnapper's outfit: red T-shirt, sneakers with white stripes and white sweatpants with red stripes. A facial composite was produced and broadcast. Meanwhile, Waxin raped Nadjia, stabbing her in the neck and choking her with a plastic bag. On July 29, 1992 at the beginning of the afternoon, in a vacant lot in Ronchin, three boys found Nadjia's body lying on its right side, under a tarpaulin in a hole between the suburbs. Her clothes were folded beneath her. The medical examiner stated that she had been killed a few hours after her abduction. On one of her clothes traces of sperm was found, and this allowed the authorities to establish a DNA profile. The investigators were certain that the perpetrator lived in Lille or its suburbs, so well as to know the deserted places and move so quickly and discreetly when abducting a child. In November and December 1993 Waxin raped two boys aged 7 and 10 in Moulins and Lambersart.«Denis Waxin suspected of two other rapes» Article published on October 16, 1999 in Libération\\"Perpetuity for the murderous rapist of children\\" Article published on May 31, 2002 in Le Nouvel observateur In 1998, Waxin was arrested for trying to steal cutlery from a store with his wife. On January 6, 1999 on Jean-Jaurès street in Moulins, 6-year-old Wendy, her older sister and brother collected yellow coins for food at the residence where they lived. After a while, her brother and sister decided to separate to collect more efficiently. Wendy remained alone in asking people who came in and out of the residence entrance, while her brother and sister collected in the residence, door to door. Wendy asked Waxin, who was walking down the street. He said he had none on him, but that he had some at home. After checking that no one else was around, he took Wendy by hand and pulled her to the side of the street. They walked for miles. Each time Wendy asked him if it is still far from home, Waxin replied that they have almost arrived. He told her that it is a shortcut and that it took them to an abandoned factory in Fives. She resisted when he began to undress her, but he threatened her with an electric baton, saying that he had already killed other little girls. She no longer protested, letting Waxin undress and rape her. She calmly put her clothes back on when he finished. She left, but Waxin followed her, telling her that he is watching, and he will come back if she speaks to the police. She started walking towards her home and found out that she had lost her way. A motorist saw her crying and carried her to the police station. Wendy's good memory made it possible to create a facial composite. She said that he was wearing a green jacket with a triangle in the back. A few days later, while Wendy was looking out the window, she saw Waxin on the sidewalk in front of the residence, looking at her and smiling. The police, informed a few days later, monitored the building entrance. They noticed a man matching the facial composite. They questioned him, and he claimed that he is a marginal resident in a home near Wendy. The authorities printed on one sheet six anthropometric photos: that of the suspect, and those of five men resembling him. They went to Wendy's house and asked her if she could recognize her attacker among the pictures. She referred to Waxin's photo, who was not considered a suspect. Interlocated, the investigators asked her again and said it's him. For them, Waxin was just a small shoplifter, and without a confession, they could not prosecute him.  Confessions and indictment  On January 20, 1999, Waxin went to the interrogation. He was very nervous. The inspectors were impressed by the resemblance to the facial composite. They barely told him the reason for his summoning when he confessed that it is him, then refused to speak further. When he was lined up behind the beam splitter, Wendy formally recognized him. During the search of Waxin's home, the police found in his room the jacket corresponding to Wendy's description. In a pocket of the jacket, authorities found a police baton. On January 28, 1999, Waxin was indicted for rape and unlawful defilement of children under 15.\\"Lille: Waxin admits to killing two more children\\" Article published on July 21, 1999 in Libération He is currently incarcerated in Loos Prison. Waxin's DNA profile was compared to that of Nadjia Thebib's aggressor, resulting in an identical match. On July 12, 1999, Waxin was indicted for kidnapping followed by death and rape, accompanied or followed by acts of torture and barbarity on Nadjia. He was extracted from his cell and questioned while in custody. He admitted to having raped, strangled and suffocated Nadjia. He refused to sign his confession and speak further. He declared that he wanted to see the investigating judge to tell him about the murders of the 3 girls. On July 13, 1999, in the office of Christophe Ingrain, the investigating judge, Waxin admitted to murdering Nadjia, Cathy Monchaux and Nathalie Hoareau. He claimed to have done this to avenge a rape of which he was victim when he was 12 years old in a cabin in the woods by a homeless man, and that he drank alcohol before committing rape. On July 20, 1999, he was indicted for kidnapping followed by death and rape preceded, accompanied or followed by torture or acts of barbarity on Nathalie and Cathy. On July 20, 1999, Waxin wrote a letter to the investigating judge in which he confirmed the confessions made in the office by describing the crimes more precisely. He claimed to have killed the girls so that they won't give birth to a monster like the one who raped them.

Early life  Marina was born in Piraeus, in the city quarter of Piraiki, Greece. She has been actively participating in LGBTI activism since 1997.  Activism  Prompted by the daily persecution of trans people by the police, in 2002 Marina together with other trans persons took the initiative of establishing the first recognized trans collective in Greece, the Association for Solidarity for Transvestites and Transsexual People (SATTE). Marina was a founding member of SATTE and a Secretary General until July 2004 when she left. As a Secretary General, her action focused on the protection of trans persons from discrimination and racist violence, the protection of trans women from police arbitrariness and the legal recognition of gender identity in line of the then recent jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) (Goodwin v. U.K.) In June 2004, she resigned from her post as a Secretary General of SATTE and on 17 July of the same year she established the first publishing house – named Colourful Planet - and bookshop specialising in LGBTI literature. The purpose of Colourful Planet is the publication of books focused on LGBTI issues and the collection of bibliography, as well as the promotion of LGBTI culture and diversity. Colourful Planet has also run two poetry and prose competitions as wells as many book presentations. Marina was also a member of the Greek Homosexual Community, an organization for the defence of fundamental rights of LGBTI persons. She was Secretary General of the organization between May 2006 and April 2008. Her activities focused on the protection of LGBTI persons from discrimination, with particular emphasis on the rights of LGBTI refugees, exclusion from blood donations and human rights violations in general. In 2009 and following the dissolution of SATTE, Marina took the initiative for the creation of a recognized trans collective in Greece. This was achieved in May 2010, with the establishment of the Greek Transgender Support Association (GTSA). Marina is the GTSA president until now. Her actions focused on claiming fundamental human rights on grounds of expression, identity and gender characteristics - and primarily on racist violence, abolition of hate speech, combatting police arbitrariness, abolishing discrimination, legal recognition of gender identity, supporting sex workers’ rights, prisoners’ rights and refugee rights. Her actions also focused more broadly in the limitation of prejudices and stereotypes on grounds of gender, expression, gender identity and characteristics. Marina was a Council of Europe expert, and she participated in this capacity in the first special seminar for the Greek Police on issues regarding combating hate crime on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity, in an international seminar on issues of LGBTI asylum that took place in Athens Bar Association, in two special seminars for asylum case workers. In this capacity, she was also advisory member of the Special Legislative Preparatory Committee for the drafting of a bill on legal recognition of gender identity between March and June 2017. Marina has written articles for newspapers and websites such as Amagi, Epohi, Avgi, and Editors’ Newspaper (efsyn), and has given interviews to many media. She has also participated in many conferences on human rights issues and Greek, European and international scientific seminars and conferences. She participated in videos directed by Christos Dimas for the play Partali by Theodoros Gregoriades. She is also a writer of books on issues of fundamental rights and owner of t-zine, a web magazine for trans rights.

Biography  Patrick Tissier's parents were in a mutually abusive relationship. Patrick is the youngest of six children. He was 11 when his mother left home. Patrick became an apprentice electrician. His father later dated a woman named Maria Luna.  Crimes  At age 13, Patrick Tissier tried to rape his sister, who reported him to the police. Between March and April 1969, he tried to rape his mother-in-law in his bathroom. He hit her on the head, and tried, unsuccessfully, to strangle her. His mother-in-law reported him to the DDASS, which investigated. He was then observed by a juvenile judge and several psychiatrists. He does not commit further violent aggression.\\"Patrick Tissier, the recidivist\\" in May 2008 and December 2009 in Faites entrer l'accusé presented by Christophe Hondelatte on France 2 Tissier was hired as a pump attendant at a service station. In a bar, he meets Marie- Françoise Pinson, a 16-year-old apprentice hairdresser. On May 1, 1971, Tissier, soon to leave for the French military draft, asked Pinson out to a dance. After the dance, they walked along the river near Bourges, Le Drouet, where Tissier tried to have sex with her. When she rebuffed his advances, he strangled her to death, had sex with her corpse, and threw her in the river. The body was discovered by passers-by the next day. Tissier was quickly arrested in a downtown motel room. The trial of Patrick Tissier took place at \\"the cour d'assises du Cher\\". On April 25, 1972, he was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. He was paroled in 1982 for good behavior, and was released on December 15, 1982. A week later, on December 22, in Toulouse, he threatened a woman with a shotgun and forced her to drive out of the city, where Tissier raped her. He then went on the run. On December 23, 1982, he tried to rape another young woman, but she escaped. Tissier was captured in Nice four months later. Tissier stood trial for rape, attempted rape and theft with violence. He was sentenced again to 20 years of imprisonment. He was released early for good behavior again in January 1992, and moved to Perpignan, where he joined a Mormon community. On August 6, 1993, in Perpignan, Tissier raped and murdered his neighbour, 45-year-old Concetta Lemma. He wrapped her body in a shower curtain, hiding it in the tunnel of the \\"Coves\\" in Canohès. On September 10, 1993, Tissier attacked a friend, Marie-Josée Gauze, in Perpignan. He tried to strangle her with a scarf, but she resisted him. He hit her head against the ground several times, and she eventually fainted. Tissier undresses her. When she woke up, she was sure she had been raped. As he was about to kill her, Gauze reasoned with Tissier, causing him to calm down and walk away. On September 13, 1993, at 6 o'clock, on the parking lot of a primary school, Tissier waited for 8-year-old Karine Volkaert, the daughter of Jocelyne Milluy, a Mormon friend. Karine accepted his proposal to take her home. He parked near a warehouse out of sight and told her that they would play a game. He handcuffed, gagged her, and put a hood on her head. He forced her to hide between the seats as he drove to Fitou, and parked the car near an abandoned house outside the village. He put Karine in the back of the car, and raped her while holding her wrists. Tissier hit her several times, and eventually strangled her. He had sex with her corpse, and then threw it into the well of the abandoned house, concealing it with piles of garbage. On September 21, 1993, Tissier was arrested by gendarmes at Paulhan, Hérault. He surrendered without resistance. Weapons were found in his car. He told investigators where to find Karine Volkaert's body. During the interrogations, he confessed to taping Gauze and raping and murdering Karine.

He demanded that Tissier be delivered to him. Shortly after, he surrendered unconditionally to the police.  Trial  On February 26, 1998, Patrick Tissier trial began in the cour d'assises in Perpignan, Pyrénées-Orientales. Étienne Nicolau is the lawyer for Jocelyne Milluy and Marie-Josée Gauze. André Coll is the lawyer for the Lemma family. The defense for Patrick Tissier is provided by Enric Vilanova and Pierre Parrat, assigned public defendant lawyers. The psychiatric experts conclude that Tissier does not suffer from mental illness, but that he associates violence and sexuality as one and the same. He thus subjects his victims to multiple tortures in order to satisfy his sexual needs. Tissier is questioned about the murders committed in Perpignan and declares, among other things, that he \\"wanted\\" Karine Volkaert and felt impulses toward her the weekend before the girl's death. He recounts that between the assault on Gauze and the kidnapping of Karine, which lasted an entire weekend, he feared the police would find him and hid in Perpignan. At the end of the trial, Tissier apologizes for all the atrocities committed and declared that he does not want the city of Perpignan to have \\"another Patrick Tissier\\".  Conviction  On January 30, 1998, Patrick Tissier was sentenced to life imprisonment with a 30-year lock-in period.\\"Patrick Tissier sentenced to life\\" Article published on January 31, 1998 in Libération\\"Patrick Tissier is sentenced to life imprisonment\\" Article published on February 2, 1998 in La Croix He will not be released eligible for early release before the year 2024.

He was sentenced to criminal imprisonment in 1962 for murdering his godfather two years earlier. Released in 1977, he killed three cashiers in Béziers in December 1979 and three other people, including an 11-year-old, in Carqueiranne in January 1980. He was sentenced in 1983 to life imprisonment without parole for these two triple murders. An inmate since 1980, Tommy Recco is one of the oldest detainees in France.Jean-Marc Raffaelli, \\"Tommy Recco sera fixé le 22 avril sur sa libération conditionnelle\\", Nice-Matin, April 2, 2008  Crimes   Implication assumed in the disappearance of three German tourists  More than half a century ago, the trial on the disappearance at sea of three young German tourists whom he would have walked near on the Ajaccian coast led nowhere.See on corsematin.blogspot.com  First murder  In 1960 in Propriano, Corsica, Tommy and his younger brother Pierre were fishing with dynamite. Suddenly, they were spotted by a marine guard, Casabianca, who happened to be Recco's godfather. For the fear of being caught poaching and fired, Tommy Recco panicked, rushed to the beach and shot his rifle at his godfather; and to make sure he was dead, he beat him several times with the butt of his rifle, taking a big stone and violently hit his head with the latter. Once back at the boat, Tommy refused to explain himself to his younger brother who saw blood on his hands and on the rifle. Propriano police went to the beach after discovering the body. They found green debris near the corpse, suggesting it came from the butt of a rifle. This green debris could come from a rifle belonging to fishermen or poachers, according to the police. Then a rumour spread that Recco had something to do with the murder. The police decided to interrogate him and realized he was the godson of the victim. Recco denied any involvement in the murder. Recco's family, led by his mother (already bereaved by the death of one of his brothers in a car accident and an infant's death), believed strongly in his innocence. But a few months later, Pierre, Tommy's brother, denounced the latter to the police by stating he heard the cries of the godfather on the day of the murder. Recco was questioned again and denied, but after several hours confessed to being the perpetrator of the murder. He said he did not want to pay a fine because of the dynamite fishing practice and he totally snapped. He rushed to the beach to kill the sea guard. Following his confession, Recco retracted it. His trial took place on December 8, 1962. Sentenced to death but pardoned by Charles de Gaulle, his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. He was released in 1977.\\"Remise en liberté refusée pour Tommy Recco, 83 ans, un des doyens des prisons en France\\" AFP via Le Point, July 6, 2017  Triple murder of Mammouth cashiers  During his incarceration, Recco learned that many dramas had affected his family: one of his brothers, Toussaint, was killed in 1973 by his brother-in-law who had a dispute with him. Pierre, his younger brother, was killed in 1976 by two hooded men while anchoring his boat. One of his sisters, Francine, the wife of Toussaint's murderer, fell down the stairs and died a few months later. Released on parole in November 1977, Recco moved to Marseille to start a new life and began working in a shop that sold diving suits. In December 1979, a massacre occurred at the Mammouth shop in Béziers, where three cashiers under the age of 30 were executed in the counting room of the store's recipe. In addition, 700,000 francs was stolen. The investigation proved difficult for police, as nobody had seen or heard anything. The police found that the victims had all been shot in the back of the neck and assumed that the killer(s) responsible were not afraid to act. The Béziers police brigade was unable to identify the perpetrator, and the investigation was halted.  Triple murder in Carqueiranne  Three weeks later, in January 1980 in Carqueiranne in the Var department, an 11-year-old girl heard her father arguing with another man. She decided to call her mother at work (a children's home) but the mother had already left. The little girl then spoke to the director of the home, who immediately warned the girl's closest neighbours. M. Coutrix, a neighbour of the girl, went to see what was going on. Worried about her husband not returning, Mme. Coutrix went to the girl's house where she discovered the body of her husband and the girl on the floor. She warned the gendarmes and once there they discovered, in the basement of the house, the father's corpse. The gendarmes gathered a preponderant clue: the girl reported to her mother's director that her father was arguing with \\"René's cousin\\". The gendarmes conducted research to determine who was \\"René's cousin\\", discovering that a certain Tommy Recco had a cousin called René and that he knew the girl's father.  Investigation  Immediately arrested, Recco denied every accusation and the gendarmes who questioned him were obliged to let him leave. Another gendarme took over and Recco saw his cousin from the gendarmerie brigade. Surprised, he asked the gendarme why his cousin was here and he replied that he was here because of \\"what you did\\". Then Recco wanted to tell why he had killed the three people at the villa. He said he wanted to buy a gun from the girl's father, whom he knew well. The latter refused, and an argument broke out. Recco saw red, and decided to kill the man. Then he came out of the basement, crossed the garden, met M. Coutrix who came to see what was happening, followed him into the house and killed him by shooting him in the neck. He found himself alone in front of the girl and said that he panicked, killing her so as not to leave any witnesses. However, following his statements, Recco retracted them. The public prosecutor in charge of the Béziers massacre case had knowledge of the triple murder in Carqueiranne and noted that the three victims were killed by gunfire, like the three cashiers in Mammouth. He teamed up with the prosecutor in charge of the triple murder in the villa, and as a result of expert reports, discovered that the same weapon or the same type of weapon was used in both cases. Recco was therefore questioned about his possible involvement in the triple murder in Béziers but the latter refused. Nevertheless, in May 1980, a pensioner arrived at the police station in Toulon and declared that the person responsible for the triple murder in Carqueiranne, whose photo was published in the newspaper, was present at the Mammouth shop on the day of the slaughter. The pensioner said that this person, Tommy Recco, was suspicious and looked around the shop as if he was looking for someone or something. The pensioner remembered this person because of his sparkling blue eyes. Again questioned and confused by a witness, Recco denied having been in the Mammouth shop in December 1979. The pensioner later recognized Recco during a recording session. Two reconstructions were organized: one at the Mammouth store and the other in the villa in Carqueiranne, but these re-enactments brought nothing concrete insofar as Recco brought no element that could explain why he committed the two triple murders. However, police learned that Recco had delivered a diving suit, as part of his work, to the Mammouth store, and was thus able to spot the cash room and come back another day to steal money. The cash has never been found. While Recco was awaiting trial, police learned that Antoine Recco, his father, was involved in the disappearance of two 21-year- old girls. In early 1982, rumour has it that Antoine could have been involved in the disappearance of two French tourists in September 1981. The police decided to question him about the missing girls. Antoine Recco denied it, but other police found on his boat the swimsuits belonging to the girls. He recounted how he had met these girls, taking them on the boat for a ride, but when he tried to seduce them, they resisted his advances. He strangled them, weighed them down and threw their bodies into the sea. Antoine Recco was sentenced in August 1986 to life imprisonment for these two murders. He was released for medical reasons in May 2010, and to this day continues to live in Corsica.Paul Ortoli, \\"Antoine Recco libéré pour raison médicale\\", Corse-Matin, May 7, 2010  Trial and imprisonment  Recco's lawsuit opened on June 6, 1983. Mama Recco, as Tommy's mother is nicknamed, and his wife, Chantal Recco, were the only two who believed in his innocence. During the trial he continued to proclaim his innocence. He was interrogated in particular on the motive for the murder of the girl's father in Carqueiranne. Recco still recognized his impulsive side that probably led him to kill his godfather 23 years earlier. Psychiatrists were asked about Recco's mental state and they said that he was completely sane. His boiling and impulsive character led to a flurry of uncontrolled violence that drove him to murder. Paul Lombard was a supporter of Recco. At the end of the trial, he was sentenced to life imprisonment without penalty. Recco is serving his sentence in the prison at Borgo, Haute- Corse, and is one of France's oldest prisoners.. After numerous requests for parole and suspension of sentence for health reasons, all of which were rejected, he filed a new application for release under electronic surveillance in May 2017 but did not obtain it.  TV documentary  Recco was featured in \\"La malédiction des Recco\\" broadcast in December 2010 in Faites entrer l'accusé presented by Christophe Hondelatte on France 2.

Ballyregan Bob broke the world record by winning 32 consecutive races. The George Curtis trained greyhound was voted Greyhound of the Year for the second time. He had begun the year by winning seven more consecutive races, three of which were in track record times but a re- occurrence of his wrist injury had left him on 28 wins. This was just three short of the world record held by American greyhound Joe Dump trained by J C Stanley, which was set in 1979. The long-awaited winning re-appearance was on 13 November at Hove followed by wins 30 and 31 at Harringay, breaking yet another track record in the 31st victory that also equalled the world record. On 9 December Ballyregan Bob lined up for the Racing Post Challenge over 695 metres at his home track Hove. He won easily by 9¼ lengths and duly recorded 32 consecutive wins. Curtis and owners Cliff and Jess Kevern retired the champion to stud. Scurlogue Champ achieved equal stardom by winning a second BBC Television Trophy and continued to amuse crowds with his remarkable running style, that off letting the field gain a significant lead before winning from a seemingly lost position. His career came to an end on 14 August when he finished lame at Nottingham in a 754 metre event and was retired. Ken Peckham's black dog ended with a record of 51 wins from 63 races and 20 track records. The National Greyhound Racing Club (NGRC) released the annual returns, with totalisator turnover at £66,192,736 and attendances recorded at 3,792,738 from 5247 meetings. Track tote remained at 17.5% and government tote tax at 4%. Tracks Northern Sports invested a £1½ million into Oxford Stadium, they had recently profited from a similar venture at sister track Ramsgate. Oxford's investment included a state of the art 250 seated, two- tiered restaurant and a leisure centre. Oxford then brought in two of the leading kennels in the country at the time. Geoff De Mulder returned to the track and Gary Baggs arrived from new sister track Ramsgate. Baggs based at Rosewood kennels was trialling greyhounds ready for Oxford when he received an offer from Walthamstow Racing Manager Tony Smith, an offer he could not refuse. The De Mulder appointment helped Oxford cover the loss of the soon to be English Greyhound Derby winning trainer Arthur Hitch to Slough. Powderhall in Edinburgh was another to invest and marked their 60th anniversary with a new £400,000 grandstand but rival track Shawfield in Glasgow was closed by the Greyhound Racing Association (GRA). After negotiations it was sold to Shawfield Greyhound Racing and Leisure Company Ltd and they, in turn, would re-open the track the following year. The Brandon Stadium in Coventry closed for greyhound racing after only eight years trading although the track layout would remain in place and the Eclipse Stakes moved to Nottingham. The Ladbrokes £2½ million grand re-opening of Crayford Stadium took place on 1 September with the emphasis on providing the betting shops with the Bookmakers Afternoon Greyhound Service (BAGS). News There were thirty fully licensed tracks, eight permit tracks and 58 independent tracks. Whitwood in Castleford raced for the first time under NGRC rules after switching from independent status. Independent track Halcrow in Gretna was opened by James Norman and sons in June but Cleethorpes closed. Competitions Tico completed in the Pall Mall Stakes over 475m at Harringay and mastered his great rival Hot Sauce Yankee when beating him by just under three lengths in 28.45 seconds and later he returned for a Daily Mirror Derby Trial Stakes, which he won by nearly five lengths in 28.44 sec. Tico won the 1986 English Greyhound Derby and then reached the final of the 1986 Irish Greyhound Derby. His significant achievements were slightly overshadowed by the exploits of the two superstars. A white and blue dog called Mollifrend Lucky won the Scurry Gold Cup when defeating Master Hardy in July and the Laurels at Wimbledon Stadium. Savva camp continued their winning ways and produced a brilliant litter, which included Westmead Move, Olivers Wish and Westmead Call. While still a puppy Westmead Move won the Gold Collar at Catford Stadium and then proved to be a bitch of outstanding ability when going on to win the Grand Prix at Walthamstow, where she became the first greyhound to lower a track record set by Ballyregan Bob. Westmead Move went on to win the Midland Oaks at Hall Green as well as the Brighton Belle at Hove.

He last competed part-time in the NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series, driving the No. 42 Chevrolet Silverado for Chad Finley Racing. Racing career Finley began his racing career at the age of 10. He finished third in the East Lansing Kart Track Championship points his first season and won the championship the following. He won the Great Lakes Sprint Series Championship and finished sixth in the World Karting Association (WKA) in 2005. In 2006, Finley made his full-sized stock car debut with the ASA Late Model Series. His first full season in the full-sized stock car came in 2007 when at the age of 15 he won the Outlaw Super Late Model Rookie-of-the-Year award at Spartan Speedway (Mich.). 2008 saw many firsts for Finley. He scored his first career Outlaw Super Late Model feature win at Spartan Speedway (Mich.) and then visited victory lane again just a couple months later, this time driving a Template Pro Late Model in the Super Pro Late Model Series. In 2009 saw Finley make the jump to the ARCA Racing Series driving for NASCAR Sprint Cup Champion Brad Keselowski. He won a pole award at Rockingham Speedway (N.C.), scored one top-five finish, and three top-10s in just four starts that season. Finley made seven starts in the ARCA Racing Series in 2010 where he tied his career best finish of third, twice. Those two top-three finishes came at Rockingham Speedway (N.C.) and Pocono Raceway (Pa.). Chad also raced events at major NASCAR venues such as Texas Motor Speedway (Tex.), and Michigan International Speedway (Mich.). In 2011, Finley competed for JEGS/CRA All-Stars Tour Championship, finishing third in the overall points standings with five top-five finishes and eight top-10 finishes. He scored two season-high second-place finishes at Lucas Oil Raceway (Ind.) and Dixie Motor Speedway (Mich.) respectively. In 2012, Finley scored his first career win in the JEGS/CRA All-Stars Tour at Columbus Motor Speedway (Ohio).

In 2013, Finley ran events in both the ARCA/CRA Super Series and the JEGS/CRA All-Stars Tour, winning two races in the JEGS/CRA All-Stars Tour. He collected five-top five finishes as well as eight top-10 finishes that season as well. At South Alabama Speedway, Finley broke the track record during the 37th Running of the Rattler 250. In 2014, Finley posted many solid finishes in both Pro and Super Late Model races around the country. He also ran select races in the NASCAR K&N; Pro Series. At the end of the season, he moved to Mooresville, N.C., where he expanded Chad Finley Development. In 2015, Finley made his NASCAR Camping World Truck Series debut, driving the No. 30 Ford F-150 for Rette Jones Racing at Michigan and Chicagoland where he finished 21st in both events.

In 2018, he attempted two Truck Series races with his team at Gateway Motorsports Park and at Bristol Motor Speedway respectively. He finished an impressive 6th place with their first attempt at Gateway after avoiding some of the late race chaos in the end. While they qualified well at Bristol, the team fell out of the race early. He later ran the Martinsville fall race with Reaume Brothers Racing, but a wreck towards the end of stage 1 derailed their chances of a good run, finishing 32nd. For the 2019 season, Chad Finley Racing increased their Truck Series schedule to a full-time slate, hiring Robby Lyons to share the No. 42 with Finley starting with the NextEra Energy 250 at Daytona International Speedway.

The National Greyhound Racing Club (NGRC) released the annual returns, with totalisator turnover up nearly 20% at £77,832,636 and attendances up over 5% recorded at 4,020,438 from 5255 meetings. Track tote remained at 17.5% and a further boost to the industry came when the government abolished tote tax on 29 March. Major changes took place within the Greyhound Racing Association (GRA), the company merged with Wembley Stadium owners Arena Holdings to form a new company. The new company retained the GRA name and is valued at £68.5 million. In March the company closed Slough Stadium and six months later in September they closed Harringay Stadium which had been sold to Sainsbury's in 1985. Satellite Information Services began to beam pictures into the betting shops from the 5 May, the company owned by the 'Big Four' Ladbrokes, Corals, William Hill and Mecca Bookmakers would pay the greyhound racing industry a fee for the televised rights. Ladbrokes however abstained from negotiations because they owned some of the tracks involved. Corals also owned some tracks involved but had the foresight to realise that they should pay a fee to help maintain the health of the industry. Ladbrokes actions only further enhanced the belief that bookmakers had too much control of the industry which was already subject to an investigation by the Office of Fair Trading. The negotiations ended with the NGRC charging £300 per each S.I.S meeting in addition to an extra 10% of the track's BAGS fee which prompts Ladbrokes to seek legal advice. Tracks Two more tracks closed along with Harringay and Slough, they were Clacton and Chester but four also opened, those of Barrow, Canterbury, Swaffham and Bideford. Hall Green underwent refurbishment costing £400,000 and Powderhall's new grandstand was completed costing £750,000 but suffered a fire that then caused £25,000 damage. The Scottish Greyhound Derby rights, held by GRA meant that Edinburgh would hold the event for the first time leaving Glasgow with no classic race. Shawfield Greyhound Racing and Leisure Company Ltd re-opened the Shawfield despite not having the Scottish Derby as their blue riband event. Competitions Harringay's closure resulted in the Oaks going to Wimbledon Stadium and the Pall Mall Stakes going to Oxford. The Scurry Gold Cup switched to Catford Stadium following the closure of Slough. Crayford took possession of the Golden Jacket after spells at Hall Green and Monmore. Harringay had also held the event in the afternoon and it was very popular due to the television exposure of the event. Crayford also provided a new matinee meeting for their own Ladbrokes betting shops. Role of Fame made amends for a disappointing TV Trophy performance at Oxford by winning the Cesarewitch at Belle Vue. The Savva camp had a double success towards the latter part of the year. First with Olivers Wish (from the same litter as Westmead Move) who won the £5,000 Gold Collar. Then in the Laurels at Wimbledon, Flashy Sir beat a field that included Derby champion Signal Spark. News Trainers Ray Peacock and Linda Mullins joined Catford and Romford respectively from Harringay, Pam Heasman joined Wembley. Trainer Joe Booth died in hospital and George Curtis retired to be replaced by head man Bill Masters. The kennel of Gary Baggs contained Puppy Derby champion Spiral Darkie, in addition to Fifty Pence, Fiddlers Run, Signal Spark and Karens Champ. Signal Spark emerged as the star when winning the 1987 English Greyhound Derby. Signal Spark was then transferred to Ernie Gaskin following a well-documented dispute between Gary Baggs and owner Towfiq Al-Aali, resulting in the latter removing his dogs from the Walthamstow trainer. Fred Wiseman also had a strong kennel including Scurry champion Rapid Mover, head man John McGee was credited for much of the success from the kennel. Signal Spark was voted Greyhound of the Year.

John McGee head man to Fred Wiseman was granted a trainer's licence and took charge of the kennel. He had a remarkable year as a rookie trainer winning the Greyhound Trainer of the Year and winning the 1988 English Greyhound Derby with Hit the Lid, the white and brindle dog owned by Fred Smith was also voted Greyhound of the Year. McGee also trained Sard who won the Gold Collar at Catford Stadium. Tracks Despite the boom in business five tracks closed, Hull, Maidstone, Gosforth, Derby and Preston all closed. Hull finished due to the fact that landlords Hull Kingston Rovers moved to a new stadium. The closure of Gosforth left the city of Newcastle with just one licensed track at Brough Park. Preston and Derby had both been opened by the same company in 1933 and after 55 years of different owners found themselves closing at the same time. Powderhall would change ownership twice, it was sold by the Greyhound Racing Association (GRA) to local businessman Norrie Rowan for £1.8m, who then sold it on himself to Coral for an instant profit at £2.2m. The GRA lost the rights to the Scottish Greyhound Derby due to the fact that they no longer owned any tracks in Scotland. Ellesmere Port Stadium started racing on 29 February. News The NGRC announced that major competitions would no longer be listed as Classic races but instead they would be classed as Category One and Two races based on prize money levels. This led to many tracks that had previously never had the opportunity to hold a classic race offering increased prize money in order for their events to match the traditional classics in terms of status. The positive was the fact that prize money increased, the negative was the devaluing of some of the sports most famous races in the following years. Grass finally disappeared from greyhound racing when Hove became the last course to remove the turf as the circuit switched to sand. The first computerised form system called Formbank was introduced, created by Peter Shotton it revolutionised Racing Office practices and was the advent to modern day systems. Trainer Barney O'Connor famous for running at Walthamstow died. Competitions The Stewards' Cup at Walthamstow was claimed by Westmead Move, now four years old. Another bitch Exile Energy was the winner of the St Leger at Wembley, the black bitch had made the Grand Prix final and brought Gary Baggs back to the public attention for the first time since his split with Towfiq Al-Aali, his leading owner the previous year. Aali had his own success with Ernie Gaskin when his Derby finalist Comeragh Boy won the year ending Laurels. Gaskin also secured a trainers position at Walthamstow.

John McGee won the Greyhound Trainer of the Year for the second successive year. Waltham Abbey now trained by Ernie Gaskin (formerly Adam Jackson) was voted Greyhound of the Year after winning the Grand Prix at Walthamstow Stadium. The award failed to go the winners of a Derby due to the fact that all three were won by the Irish; they were the 1989 English Greyhound Derby (Lartigue Note), the 1989 Scottish Greyhound Derby (Airmount Grand) and the 1989 Irish Greyhound Derby (Manorville Magic), the latter was voted Irish Greyhound of the Year. Tracks The Greyhound Racing Association (GRA} invested £1 million into Hall Green, mainly extending the restaurant. The Peterborough management also unveiled their new raceview restaurant costing £500,000. Terry Corden sold the Sheffield lease; he was forced to do so after the council closed the stadium due to new safety measures. This was as a direct result of the Hillsborough disaster. Hull (New Craven Park) and Hawick both opened for racing. Competitions The Scottish Derby returned to Glasgow (as a consequence of GRA having no stadia in Scotland), the event received a boost when Ladbrokes stepped in and sponsored the competition. Racing Manager Robert Lithgow was forced to increase the entries from 24 to 36 due to its popularity. The event resulted in what many regarded the best ever when Airmount Grand caught Galtymore Lad on the finish line after both vied for the lead throughout. Trainer Phil Rees Jr. won the Grand National at Hall Green with Lemon Chip, this was the kennels first Grand National success despite previously winning six Springbok titles. Fearless Ace made a remarkable comeback when winning the Pall Mall Stakes for a second successive year; the fawn dog had won the 1988 final for Geoff De Mulder before being retired to stud. He returned a year later to defend his title under the training of Theo Mentzis after coming out of retirement and not only stormed to a surprise victory but broke the Oxford track record in the final. News Brent Walker owners of Hackney took over William Hill and Mecca Bookmakers from Grand Metropolitan for £685 million. Canterbury obtained a Bookmakers Afternoon Greyhound Service (BAGS) contract and Wisbech began the year under NGRC rules. Veteran trainer Hugo Spencer retired and John Coleman moved to Walthamstow. Walthamstow also produced one race meeting tote turnover of £173,000 on the night of the Pepsi Cola Marathon final. Trainer Linda Jones and her husband Doug moved to Lakenheath and formed the Imperial Kennels. They started with four racing greyhounds and a couple of litters of pups set in the Suffolk countryside. The kennel would quickly establish themselves on the local tracks of Swaffham, Mildenhall and Yarmouth. Owner John Dooley visited a stud kennel in Cork to find it abandoned and his Blue Riband champion Lulus Hero missing, the brindle dog is never found. # Champion trainer John McGee and owner Fred Smith had an argument that resulted in Derby champion Hit The Lid leaving the kennels.

They are ancient remnants of the first massive galaxies. The environments of red nuggets are usually consistent with the general elliptical galaxy population. Most red nuggets have merged with other galaxies, but some managed to stay unscathed.  Naming  Red nuggets were not only nicknamed for their size and color, but also for how precious the discovery was to curious astronomers since it challenged our theories on galaxy formation.  Formation of red nuggets  Red nuggets are formed from blue nuggets. Blue nuggets are early, stream fed, star-forming systems that are quenched inside-out within the inner kiloparsec (kpc) and dissipatively compacted into red nuggets at their peak of gas compaction. The compaction of the blue nugget happens at an approximately constant specific star formation rate (or SFR). The quenching of the blue nugget happens at a completely constant stellar surface density. Galaxies with more mass quench earlier than galaxies with low amounts of mass because galaxies with low amounts of mass try to quench several times. The compaction happens due to a fierce period of inflow involving (mostly small) mergers and counter-rotating streams or recycled gas. It is also frequently associated with extreme disc instability. The quenching happens because of the extremely high SFR, stellar and supernova feedback, and possibly also active galactic nuclei feedback due to the high gas density in the center of the red nugget.  Star formation  Data from NASA's Chandra X-Ray Observatory observing the red nuggets Mrk 1216 and PGC 032673 has shown that the central black holes suppress star formation in red nuggets with their heat and feed on the gas surrounding them. This brings up the intriguing question on how they could possibly be packed so densely with stars. Results show that red nuggets may have untapped stellar \\"fuel\\" to produce their unusually large number of stars. Another theory says that red nuggets are young elliptical galaxies, therefore forming the same way they do.  Sloan Digital Sky Survey  A team led by Ivana Damjanov found over 600 red nugget candidates in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (or SDSS) database, of which 9 were confirmed as red nuggets https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2948. These red nuggets have been missed so long because, due to their extremely small size, they look like stars in pictures. But their spectra shows what they really are. Damjanov expressed how truly amazing the discovery was when she said, > “Looking for ‘red nuggets’ in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey was like panning > a riverbed, washing away silt and mud to uncover bits of gold,” Before Damjanov and her team had thought to look through the immense database of the SDSS, no one could find the elusive galaxies after their original discovery in 2005.

The first had been read in 1989.Extracts from the reading were described by Alan Meale (MP for Mansfield) - \\"The purpose of the Bill is straightforward; it is to amend the Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Act 1963 to enable payment of a levy to the greyhound industry from moneys already deducted from punters for that purpose by the bookmakers in off-course betting establishments. There is a great need for this legislation. Greyhound racing is the second most supported spectator sport in Britain. As census figures show, more than 5 million people support the sport by going along to tracks every week. They attend 83 tracks, 48 of which are independent and 35 of which are registered with the National Greyhound Racing Club. The membership of that club and of the independents now amounts to more than 15,000 greyhound owners. More than 20,000 greyhounds are registered and in training. At least 10,000 race meetings are held every year, accommodating over 120,000 greyhound races. Unlike the horse racing industry, the greyhound industry receives no levy money whatever; although moneys are deducted at source in betting shops off- course, throughout Britain. That is a scandal of huge proportions because 10 per cent.—10p in every pound—is deducted from bets, under the legislation to which I have referred, with the purpose of 2% of that 10% coming back into the sport. Most punters are having that money deducted fraudulently because at present the only money that goes back into the greyhound industry returns via the Legislation is in place to ensure that a similar deduction benefits horse racing. Twenty-seven percent of all off-course betting is on greyhound racing, yet not one penny of that money goes back into the industry. Instead, it all goes into the pockets of bookmakers, who do nothing for that magnificent sport\\". It being half-past Two o'clock, the debate stood adjourned. In addition to this, new laws now required all sporting stadia to make safety improvements following the problems related to football. The industry felt that it was being persecuted by the government. In Ireland the racing industry received €3.5 million in the budget but the Bord na gCon was unhappy that they would only receive €500,000. The National Greyhound Racing Club (NGRC) released the annual returns, with totalisator turnover at £104,779,742 and attendances recorded at 4,220,906 from 5803 meetings. Track tote deduction remained at 17.5%. Westmead Harry trained by Natalie Savva was voted Greyhound of the Year after winning the Scottish Greyhound Derby at Shawfield Stadium in a track record time, the Select Stakes, Blue Riband and Eclipse. Adraville Bridge was voted Irish Greyhound of the Year after winning the Laurels, National Produce and Dundalk International. John McGee won the Greyhound Trainer of the Year for the third successive year. Tracks Playbell Ltd (owners of Poole) removed the greyhound track to accommodate a larger football pitch but a new Perry Barr Stadium opened, promoted by Maurice Buckland at the former athletics stadium, this was six years after the closure of the old stadium at Walsall Road. At the end of 1988 businessmen and race horse owner Terry Robson and Harry Williams had got together and decided to take on the Sunderland stadium. Williams a respected former trainer at Brough Park helped design the new track and over £1 million was spent rebuilding the facilities. There was a new restaurant, private boxes and an application to the NGRC. News Champion trainer John McGee joined Hackney in place of Doreen Boyce. Chris Page took over as Walthamstow Racing Manager from departing Tony Smith. Competitions A brindle greyhound called Ravage Again dominated the sprint events, the greyhound trained by Willie Frew in Scotland by Tico out of Drominidy Rose had been bought for £5,500 by Frew, for owners David Fleming and Ian Rutherford. He won heat and final of a Clonmel sprint during the festival week and then after returning to Scotland, he continued to add to his winning sequence on the northern circuit. At 16 successive wins (in June) Ladbrokes offered 300-1 that he would better Ballyregan Bob's world record of 32 successive wins. Controversy over the wager surfaced when it was revealed that Ravage Again's two wins in Ireland would not been counted. Willie Frew sent to the greyhound to be trained in the south by Terry Dartnall, partly because he wanted to prove that he could beat the southern opposition as well. after 22 wins Ravage Again went unbeaten through the Etherington Golden Sprint at Hove, breaking the 285 metre track record in the heats and final. A close call at Hall Green ended with a short head victory before another win at Swindon. He returned north to Frew and won race 28 at Shawfield on 22 December, ending the year on course for a new world record. Dempseys Whisper scored a classic double, the fawn dog won both the Gold Collar at Catford Stadium and Grand Prix at Walthamstow Stadium. He completed a great year getting to the St Leger and Oaks final as well and was unlucky not to win the title of greyhound of the year.

Track tote deduction remained at 17.5%. An industry discussion concluded that a greyhound's career longevity was reduced by two breeding factors. The first factor being the fact that breeding was predominantly conducted between the fastest middles distance stars and therefore increasing the average speed (bringing higher injury rates) and eliminating the stamina of stayers and marathon greyhounds. The second factor was the lack of coursing bloodlines, thereby reducing the durability traits. The physical difference between a 1930s and 1990s greyhound was significant and despite advancement in track preparation the track layouts remained the same. Bobs Regan trained by Brian Timcke was voted Greyhound of the Year after winning the Golden Jacket, the Kent St Leger and the Regency. Ardfert Mick was voted Irish Greyhound of the Year after winning the 1991 Irish Greyhound Derby. John McGee won the Greyhound Trainer of the Year for the fourth successive year, a new record beating the three won by George Curtis and Phil Rees Sr.. McGee notched over 200 winners during the year. Ravage Again won his 29th successive race at Sunderland but then on 26 January at Powderhall at odds of 2-9 he stumbled out of the boxes and found trouble, failing to catch the winner Base Rate. The world record attempt was over and he was immediately retired. Tracks A & S Leisure (owners of five casino restaurants) purchased Sheffield and spent £3 million on refurbishment. Ramsgate secured a BAGS contract with Mick Wheble installed as the new Group Racing Manager. Stuart Netting became Ramsgate Racing Manager in place of Jeff Jefcoate. Mildenhall Stadium started racing for the first time. Brent Walker the owners of William Hill and Hackney Wick Stadium were in a precarious position in regard to gigantic debts, which brought an uncertain future for both. In a statement to a committee of MP's, BAGS representative Tom Kelly reveals that Hackney (and other tracks) are only paid a £900 broadcasting fee for a ten race BAGS meeting that produces a £2 million turnover (£200,000 per race) for BAGS. Tory MP David Sumberg says \\"This £900 bugs me, it is so small\\"; Kelly is unconcerned by the disparity and financial difficulties of tracks and responds by saying that \\"the tracks must be satisfied because they apply for contracts\\". Over the next decade tracks will close at an alarming rate, including Hackney six years later. Competitions The Scottish Greyhound Derby increased prize money from £10,000 to £15,000 and was won by Phantom Flash trained by Nick Savva; the black dog had a great 1990 winning the Sussex Cup and Breeders Forum and was unlucky not to win the Irish Derby. He would later leave Savva to join trainer Patsy Byrne following a disagreement with owner Dave Hawley. The Grand National final at Hall Green produced a memorable race after a dead heat by Ideal Man and Ballycarney Dell, the pair finished just ahead of Run On King and a promising hurdler called Kildare Slippy. Dempseys Whisper continued his good ways when becoming only the second greyhound to successfully defend the Grand Prix title at Walthamstow Stadium. News Tom Smith the owner of Swaffham investigates some of the track trainers kennels and finds unlicensed handlers and greyhounds missing from the establishments that they are supposed to be kennelled at, which leads to the NGRC being called in to hold a series of inquiries. Patsy Byrne joined Wimbledon as a trainer and sponsors the International while Maggie Lucas leaves Hackney for Romford. The Mullins family split camp as Linda Mullins’s son David takes out his first trainers licence at Sunderland. Sunderland had only returned to NGRC rules in 1990 were improving their profile by taking on Mullins and former top flapping man Ted Soppitt, in addition Harry Williams who was responsible for getting the new Sunderland of the ground started training again. There were two major trainer changes towards the latter part of the year both involving Walthamstow, Linda Mullins was recruited from Romford to increase Walthamstow's recent policy of bringing in leading open race trainers. As a consequence Walthamstow's top man Kenny Linzell left to join Romford after being unhappy with the new policy. Former English and Irish Derby winning trainer John Bassett died in March aged 81. Wheres The Limo trained by Linda Mullins won 28 from 45 starts to be leading open race winner. An ITV production called Gone to the Dogs filmed at Walthamstow and starring Jim Broadbent, Martin Clunes, Harry Enfield, Alison Steadman and Sheila Hancock is a success after viewing figures of nine million.

History The original Murrayfield Racers were founded in 1952 as the Murrayfield Royals, becoming the Racers in 1966. The team continued to represent the Scottish Capital until they fell into financial troubles and folded in 1996. They were replaced by the Edinburgh Capitals who were a member of the United Kingdom's premier ice hockey league, the EIHL, until they folded in 2018. The second incarnation of the Murrayfield Racers was founded in 2018 and were awarded the Murrayfield Ice Rink contract in the April of that year. The Racers applied for entry in to the EIHL for the 2018–2019 season but were ultimately denied entry and the Capitals, now with no home venue, ceased operations at the end of the 2017–2018 EIHL season. In June 2018, the Racers were accepted in to the Scottish National League to represent Edinburgh for the 2018–2019 season, while representing the city in the NIHL North Cup, playing their home games at the Murrayfield Ice Rink.

Introduction At the end of the Naser al-Din Shah Qajar period and in the early days of Mozaffar ad-Din Shah's rule, a number of intellectuals and a group of government agents associated with the European countries, who considered Iran's political and social outcomes in the absence of law and respect for individual freedoms, gradually began to rumor and talk about reforms. The reform was based on three amendments of law, civil law, reforming the court system, and preventing foreign intervention. Primary core Perhaps we can recognize Sayyid Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī as one of the forerunners of the popular reformist campaigns. Although his efforts were mostly to keep the rulers awake, his thoughts in founding the associations were not affected. Mirza Malkam Khan Nazem Al- Doleh was known as the founder of the first core of the associations by establishing Faramoosh Khaneh and then forming the Adamiat Association (called the Hizbullah Group).The emergence and evolution of constitutional political parties, page 58/پیدایش و تحول احزاب/ سیاسی مشروطیت صفحه58 So, in the Reji Agreement and the tobacco boycott we are witnessing a popular upsurge and the formation of the first cores of the associations. The Tobacco Protest Contract is one of the reasons to bring and gather the people and also helps to the formation of organizations. Type of activity The associations during the Constitutional Revolution were divided into political, state, religious, literary, and regional according to their statute. But the developments in the country were such that almost all of them were active in pursuit of political and social demands. Some of the associations had secret activities before the constitutional victory, but, their activities, statutes, and members' names were not mentioned publicly. Political associations  At the time of the incident in the Toopkhaneh Square, and before the artillery of the parliament, more than 48 associations were active in Tehran. The number of state and political associations in the country reached to more than 100 associations, and state associations also intervened in political and social activities. Agree to constitutionalism The secret association The secret association was founded in the year 1904 by Mirza Sayyed Mohammad Tabatabai. His goal was to promote the people and familiarize them with political rights. Gradually, some rapid methods were adopted and made some of the members to withdrawal from the association. The members were called and known as \\"Fada'i\\". They joined together to bring justice for the courthouse and the parliament. Sayyed Mohammad Tabatabai, Nazem al-salam Kermani, Mirza Agha Isfahani, and Majd al-Islam Kermani were the members of the association. The association of Baghe Mekideh The Baghe Mekideh Association was secretly established in Muharram 1322 by some libertarians and reformists. Like the Secret Association, it had a revolutionary nature. The main members of the association were Malek al-Motekalemin - Mirza Jahangir Khan (Sūr-e- Esrāfil) - Seyyed Mohammad Reza Masavat Shirazi - Sayyid Jamal al-Din Va'iz Esfahani - Yahya Dolatabadi -Hajj Sayyah - Ali Akbar Saatsaz - Soleiman Khan Mekdeh and many others. It had more than 60 members. The association also had a committee called the Revolutionary Committee. They co-operated with Haydar Khan Amo-oghli’s group. A person named, Abbas Aqa Tabrizi was a member of the committee who later murdered and killed Mirza Ali Asghar Khan Atabak (Amin al- Sultan). =Key members of the Baghe Mekideh Association= Among the members of the association were some prominent people known as Sheikh Mohammad Mehdi Sharif Kashani, Malek Al-MoteKalemin, Seyyed Jamal Vaez, Seyyed Mohammad Reza Masavat, Seyyed Asadollah Kharaghani, Sheikh Mehdi Bahar al-Olum Kermani, Abolhasan Mirza Qajar - Aqa Mirza Mohsen (Sadr al-Ulama's brother) - Soleiman Khan Mekideh - Yahya Dolatabadi - Mohammad Ali Khan Nusrat al-Sultan - Jahangir Khan Soor al-Esrafil, Mirza Abbas Ali Khan Shokat, Hamed al-Molk Shirazi, Mirza Mahmoud Shirazi, Haj Mirza Ali Mohammad Dolatabadi, and …… Some of them were among the relative of the Subh-i-Azal (Morning of Eternity), and some in the past went to Cyprus and met with their leader.Nabavi Razavi, Seyyed Moghadad. \\"The Life of Malek Al-MoteKalemin \\".

The members of the council was elected by the people of Isfahan and Haj Aqa Nourollah Isfahani was chosen as the chairman of the council. This association was formed between the years 1946 to 1948, from the migration of Qom to the artillery of the parliament in ChehelSotoun Isfahan.Musa Najafi, Political Thought and History of Haj Agha Noorollah Esfahani, 2005, Page 132 Tabriz Association In 1945, the association was formed in Tabriz, following the consent of Mohammad Ali Shah, for establishing the constitution and the withdrawal of the infidels from the British Consulate and was known as a very powerful association. The association initially had 20 members and they were also the leaders of the Revolution. A group of the Social Democratic Party of Ghafghaz, such as Haydar Khan Amo-oghli and Ali Moosio, also cooperated with the association. The Tabriz Secret Center was one of the subcommittees of the association and it was founded with the help and cooperation of the Ghafghaz Group. After the law of the state and provincial associations in the National Assembly was adopted, its name was changed to the State Association of Azerbaijan. Following the opposition of Mohammad Ali Mirza with the parliament and the incident that happened at the Toopkhaneh Square, the Association, by sending telegrams to other cities, called for the ruler’s removal from the kingdom, which prompted Mohammad Ali Shah's withdrawal from his position. After the bombing of the parliament, the Tabriz Association virtually assumed the role of the National Assembly and sent verdicts to the cities. At that time, the Neda Mellat Newspaper was published, which later was printed in the name of Nalleyeh Mellat, and reprinted the Association's newspaper.History of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution Other pro-parliamentary associations * Associations such as Azerbaijan, Shah Abad, Mozaffari, Talab, Central, Asnaf, and, the Brothers of the Ghazvin Gate were the most active and powerful associations that armed and confronted the artillery and blockade arenas of the parliament. * The Brothers of the Government Gate * Central headed by Arshad al-Doleh * The Hidden Sani Association was founded in the year 1945 by Seyyed Mohammad Tabataba'i * Mokhadarat Vatan *Jam'iyat-e Nesvan-e Vatankhah * Fatemieh * Student Union * Mohammadieh Baharestan * Ferdosieh * Ansar Associations of the city In addition to the state and provincial associations established in the cities, in Tehran, several associations were also active. * Associations such as the Republic of Azerbaijan, Esfahaniha, South, Shiraz, Hamedan Union, and the Humanity Assembly.

Based around Brisbane, it spent the entire of its history in opposition, merging in 1941 into the Country-National Organisation. When that party separated in 1944, the remnants of the UAP joined the Queensland People's Party which in 1949 became the Liberal Party of Australia (Queensland Division) History Although the federal UAP was formed in 1931 amidst a reorganisation of the right of politics, at the state level the main conservative party remained the Country and Progressive National Party which combined urban and rural forces. In 1936 the CPNP separated out, with the Brisbane section became the Queensland branch of the national UAP whilst the rural section reconstituted as the Country Party. The UAP was led by Hugh Russell, the member for Hamilton, who had been the last deputy leader of the CPNP. However the party had little electoral success, winning only four seats in both the 1938 and 1941 state elections. Russell himself was defeated in the 1941 election and this proved a fatal blow for the party. Immediately after the election the new federal leader of the Country Party Arthur Fadden, MP for the Queensland Division of Darling Downs, sought to merge the Country and United Australia parties into a single force. Only in Queensland did this yield much success with the two parliamentary parties forming the Country-National Organisation.Margaret Bridson Cribb, 'Fadden, Sir Arthur William (1894–1973)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/fadden-sir-arthur-william-10141/text17907, published first in hardcopy 1996, accessed online 19 June 2018.

The CURCC team that played the final In quarter finals, Rosario A.C. had beaten Rosario Central 2–0 (E.C. Jewell, Wells) in Plaza Jewell. The club then thrashed Barracas A.C.

Uruguayan footballers Gaudencio Pigni and brothers Carlos and Bolívar Céspedes (that had escaped from their country due to the Civil War) played for Barracas A.C.

Because of that (and the cold weather) only 1,200 persons attended the match. Rosario scored the first goal in the 10th minute when Le Bas shot to the CURCC's goal after a pass by Parr. In the second half, Camacho ran to the goal, being fouled by Wells when he was about to shot. Pena converted the penalty kick to goal for the 1–1 tie, which would be the final score within the 90 minutes. An extra time of 30' had to be played to crown a champion. In the 5th minute, Wells scored the 2nd goal for Rosario. The rest of the match saw Rosario shooting to CURCC goal but their kicks were stopped by Uruguayan goalkeeper Villalba. With only 5 minutes remaining, Alberto Le Bas scored the 3rd goal for the local squad. Three minutes later, Aniceto Camacho scored the 2nd for CURCC for the definitive 3–2 result. This achievement contributed to consolidate Rosario Athletic as the strongest team of Rosario, being the first team from the city to win an international competition.Cuando el Rosario Athletic salió campeón... de fútbol on CIHF (Archived, 18 Apr 2014) Nevertheless, the club would abandon the practise of football in the 1910s, focusing on rugby union and field hockey.

In military construction hearings during 1964 before the Senate Committee on Armed Services the request for funding of recreational and other support buildings for the Naval Facility the Navy noted it was part of a program supporting continental air and missile defense forces without mention of its role in tracking Soviet missile submarines. On 26 June 1962 NAVFAC Cape Hatteras made the first SOSUS detection of a Soviet diesel submarine. Due to its location on Cape Hatteras, when the facility initially opened, it was only accessibly via ferry from the Oregon Inlet.

Gypped in Egypt is a 1930 animated short film directed by John Foster and Mannie Davis. The film was also produced by The Van Beuren Corporation and released by Pathé, a film distributor with a newsreel titled Pathé News. The plot explores the journeying of two anthropomorphic dogs in the country Egypt. The title's pun means that they were robbed or gypped in Egypt. Copyrighted as Gyped in Egypt and released on November 9, 1930, the film is part of an early cartoon series titled Aesop's Sound Fables. However, the film is not based on an Aesop fable. Plot Waffles and Don run from a Sphinx's head. The film begins with Waffles and Don sleeping on a hammock which is strung by a camel. Waffles and Don sleep on the hammock until the camel kicks them out. Don looks around and finds a source of water. Once arriving at that source, a fight breaks out between the three of them due to the camel trying to drink the water. The fight kills the camel, who is punched several times in the face by Waffles. However, a bird drinks the water instead when they are not looking. A sphinx then arrives from the distance and accuses them of killing the camel. Waffles denies this, and instead blames Don. Waffles then hallucinates and they both end up in a pyramid. After they both inspect the room, Don finds a coin-slot in one of the tombs and inserts a coin. This opens the tomb and reveals a skeleton. The skeleton then gets out of the tomb and starts to dance. This makes the art on the walls start to dance. After the dance, the skeleton then retreats to the tomb. However, the skeleton leaves his leg outside. And when he retrieves to get it, Don hits him over the head with it. When Don tries to see what the tomb is like, Waffles, in a state of panic, pushes him in to the tomb. However, Waffles is dragged into the tomb, and a fight breaks out between the three of them. As a result of the fight, Waffles and Don are both thrown from the tomb and into another part of the pyramid. After inspection, the little dog, despite being told not to by Waffles, pulls some hairs from a mummy, which makes a sound similar to a fire alarm. This makes a skeleton and two cats gather round a wheelbarrow and turns it into a makeshift firetruck. Both Waffles and Don follow the wheelbarrow, until the skeleton flings them off it and they fall into another room. After inspection, Don leans on an unknown item, which produce a piano-like sound. Thus, Don begins to play a song on it. A skeleton then expands it into an upright piano and begins to play a duet with the little dog. After the duet, both dogs leave through an opening in the wall. They then comically take an elevator to a top of an Egyptian style elevator shaft. After reaching the top, they comically walk off the ledge and falls back down to the bottom. They then start running through the landscape. However, they turn back after seeing a giant sphinx face in the sky. The film ends with both Waffles and Don running from the giant face. Characters Unlike other Sound Fables of this time, the main characters are not Milton and Rita Mouse. Instead they are a pair of two dogs, Waffles and Don. Other characters include Egyptian mummies, sphinxes, and a plethora of skeletons, who are inside the tombs and the pyramids.  Reception  Gypped in Egypt received mixed reviews from the cinema magazines at that time.Motion Picture News, November 15, 1930 The Film Daily said that the film was \\"A nightmare of goofy antics cleverly worked out for the laughs\\". The Motion Picture News said that the film was fair.

It is located on one of the highest points of the town. On 3 May 1958 the chapel was officially listed as a cultural heritage site.  History  From 1715 to 1736 the parish of Beroun was administered by Dean Jiří František Procházka de Lauro, originally from Telč. As dean, he was very active in promoting the spiritual life in the town and supported the construction of the Holy Water Chapel, which became a popular destination for pilgrims coming to the town. The pilgrims began visiting the town due to a local legend from 1723, when a local shepherd had a vision revealing the miraculous properties of the spring there. The Stations of the Cross were built there for pilgrims, and between 1733 and 1786 it was protected and maintained by hermits living near the chapel. In 1784 the chapel was closed by order of Emperor Joseph II, who ordered the abolition of all monasteries, spiritual communities, and fraternities that did not meet the conditions for remaining in service. The chapel was later sold. The painting of the Virgin Mary from the chapel was taken to the Dean's church in Beroun. The desecrated chapel, including the neighbouring cottage, was purchased by Jakub Černý, who made it available for the local dwellers for worship. The chapel gradually deteriorated and had to be demolished. In 1893, architect Josef Mocker built a new chapel in the Gothic Revival design, which remains standing on the hill above Beroun.  Architecture  195x195px  Exterior  The chapel is an atrium type. It is a small rectangular building of red bricks with a triangular edge. It is covered with a gabled roof holding a small turret (called Sanctus) with two suspended bells (one of them is fully functional). The turret with the bells is located above the main altar. The vault is held by double buttresses along the entire circumference of the structure. This enabled the installation of larger windows in the characteristic pointed arch shape. Some of the windows are decorated with tracery. The windows are separated by one or two bars. The entrance portal is built of sandstone blocks holding the vault with a rounded profile. The space above the portal bears a quatrefoil with an ornamental rosette in the center. The well is situated opposite the main entrance to the chapel. It is a small structure with a hipped gable roof, again in red brick. The structure is not situated in the usual east-west direction; it was positioned with its front view facing the old town of Beroun.228x228px193x193px  Interior  228x228px229x229pxThe chapel interior consists of three parts. The covered entry hall separates the main atrium from the entrance portal. The interior is lit by a single window with a segmented vault and ribbed vaults in the vestibule area. A holy water font (aspersorium) is located at the entrance to the main atrium. A painted ceiling dominates the interior – it is decorated as a night sky (a European rarity). This is further enhanced by the ribbed vaults that add extra depth to the space. The ribs join in a console with a polygonal head, there is no supporting pillar. The keystone at the crossing of the ribs is decorated with floral ornament. The tall broken arch windows are glazed with colourful stained-glass panes.  The altar  The altar draws the attention with its side pinnacles and a lavish floral ornament on the top. The walls are decorated to create the illusion of a stone masonry. A painting of Virgin Mary with the Holy Infant hangs above the main portal. In 1737 the chapel received the gift of a painting of Virgin Mary that is displayed above one of the side altars in the church of St. James. References *Vávra, Josef.

History The Mortier de 270 mm G mle 1885 was one of a series of heavy artillery pieces designed by Colonel Charles Ragon de Bange. On 11 May 1874 three de Bange heavy cannons (120 mm, 155 mm, 240 mm) and two mortars (220 mm, 270 mm) were ordered by the French Army. The mle 1885 was advanced for its time due to being built completely of steel instead of a steel liner and cast iron reinforcing hoops of the previous Canon de 240 mm C mle 1870-87. The later Mortier de 270 mm modèle 1889 was based on the mle 1885 and adapted to the coastal artillery role by fitting the same barrel to a different carriage. Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. Fortresses, armories, coastal fortification and museums were scoured for heavy artillery and sent to the front. Suitable field and rail carriages were built for these guns in an effort to give their forces the heavy field artillery needed to overcome trenches and hardened concrete fortifications.  Design  The mle 1885 was breech loaded with a de Bange obturator, and used separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. The recoil system for the mle 1885 consisted of a U shaped gun cradle which held the trunnioned barrel and a slightly inclined firing platform with hydraulic buffers. When the gun fired the hydraulic buffer slowed the recoil of the cradle which slid up a set of inclined rails on the firing platform and then returned to position by the combined action of the buffers and gravity. The carriage allowed for high angles of elevation and pivoted at the front for 30° of traverse. At the outbreak of the First World War, it is estimated there 32 mle 1885's available. For transport the mle 1885 could be broken down into four wagon loads for horse or motor traction. The mortars could also be transferred to narrow gauge rail wagons for the final leg to their firing positions. These narrow gauge tracks were also used to re-position the mortars and bring up their ammunition and supplies. Site preparation needed up to 15 men directed by 2 officers and took 7-8 hours. Site preparation included creating a base of wooden beams then assembling the mortar with cranes and block & tackle.

He was also a Supernumerary Fellow at Merton College, Oxford. He was known for his discoveries in processing and presentation of cancer and viral peptides to T cells and lipids to invariant NKT cells. Cerundolo died of lung cancer on 7 January 2020.Immunology Leader Vincenzo Cerundolo Dies  Early life and education  Vincenzo Cerundolo was born in Lecce (Italy) on 20 December 1959 to Vittorio Cerundolo and Colomba Vissicchio. He went to school at Liceo Scientifico De Giorgi (Lecce) and then to the University of Padua to study Medicine (1979-1984). He went on to complete a higher degree at the University of Padua at the Institute of Oncology supervised by Dino Collavo and Paola Zanovello.  Career and research  After his studies at the University of Padua, Cerundolo completed his postdoctoral research with Professor Alain Townsend at the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, at the University of Oxford. He was first to demonstrate that TAP genes located within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) transport peptides presented by MHC class I molecules and describe a novel clinical syndrome in patients with defective TAP genes. He characterised the relationship between the length of peptides and their binding affinity to MHC class I molecules, explaining the homogeneous length of peptides isolated from MHC class I molecules. He characterised the structural and kinetic mechanisms by which lipids bind to CD1 molecules and are recognized by T cells and demonstrated that harnessing CD1 restricted Natural killer T cell (NKT) cells enhances antigen specific antibody and T cell responses. Cerundolo became Director of the MRC Human Immunology Unit in 2010.  Publications  His publications include: * Cerundolo, V., J. Alexander, K. Anderson, C. Lamb, P. Cresswell, A. McMichael, F.

The property is owned by the Broken Hill City Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Day Dream Smelter, situated about 20 kilometres north-west of Broken Hill and north-east of Silverton, was established as a settlement following the discovery of rich silver-bearing ore in December 1882 and by 1884 there were some 400 to 500 people on the field. The Day Dream mine by 1884 had become important. It raised 96,000 tons of ore before it floated into a company. The Day Dream Smelter was built by the Barrier Ranges Association which was formed in the early days of the field to take over mines, work them, establish smelters and otherwise develop the field. The Day Dream Smelter was opened in 1885. It had a 25-ton and a 40-ton water-jacket furnace. The Day Dream mine proved short lived and in April 1886, after only 10 months of operation, the smelter was closed down as there was not sufficient ore to keep it going. Sometime soon afterward during 1886-87 the smelters were re-opened to treat the first production from the Broken Hill Mine, some 1,500 tons of ore, as the broken Hill mine had not then started its own furnaces. By the end of 1888 the Day Dream Settlement was almost abandoned and the smelters closed forever. Nothing remains of the settlement. All the machinery of the smelter was removed and all the salvageable material of the smelter buildings - timber and galvanised iron has long since gone. What remains of the smelter is interesting and very strongly evocative. Standing in dramatic isolation on a round hill in the arid Barrier Range, it remains a prominent reminder of the intense activity and high expectations which were later eclipsed by the wealth of the lode at Broken Hill. In 1980 the Heritage Council visited the site during its visit to Broken Hill. Subsequently, the Barrier Environment Group nominated Day Dream Smelter for a Permanent Conservation Order. On 11 February 1983 a Permanent Conservation order was placed over the smelter. It was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.Branch Managers Report to the Heritage Council 27 July 1981  Description  Remaining structures on the site include the chimney stack, adjoining surface trench, stone walls and platform upon which the smelter structures were erected, shaft access holes and mullock retaining walls. The coursed rubble stone based walls of the smelter stand on the hillside and are connected up the slope to the hilltop by the stone side walls of a rising flue tunnel which connects to the chimney stack on the hill top. The circular chimney stack is built of stone for its lower half and brick for its upper half. It was reported as at 3 October 2000 that the brickwork of the upper chimney stack was built in very weak mortar which was being eroded by rainwater from the top downwards.  Heritage listing  The remains of the Day Dream Smelter are a significant item of the environmental heritage of New South Wales as an important item in the mining and industrial history of the Broken Hill-Silverton area which pre-dates the development of Broken Hill itself. The masonry wall and chimney remains are interesting. What remains of the smelter is interesting and very strongly evocative.

Surviving remnants of the larger Albert Goldfield, they were built from 1880. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Gold was first discovered in the area during October 1880, when John Thompson and a friend found payable gold at Mt Poole. About five months later James Evans found about 14 ounces of alluvial gold at Mount Brown. News of the find caused a rush to this remote location. As the country was opened up, rushes also occurred at Easter Monday, Good Friday, Nuggety Hill, The Granites and many other areas as gold was found. Reefs such as the Pioneer and Warratta Creek were found. In a very short space of time an auriferous belt some 50 miles by 10 had been opened up. This became known as the Albert goldfield with Milparinka as the main settlement. Milparinka is an Aboriginal word meaning water can be found here. As there was no water at Mt Browne, the miner's chose to camp at Evelyn Creek, which later became known as Milparinka. The discovery of gold at Mt Browne, some twenty miles south of Mt Poole was announced in February 1881 amid much scepticism from the print media. Newspapers warned prospective miners of the many deaths from thirst and heat which had occurred when a similar rush had occurred 150 miles south of Mt Poole. Despite these dire warnings, over one thousand men soon flocked to the site of the new discovery. The Albert or Mt Browne goldrush had begun. The Albert Goldfield was declared in early 1881. By the end of 1881, several of the 25 quartz claims near Warratta Creek had been formed into public companies, based in Melbourne and Adelaide. It was reported that gold showed freely in the quartz veins, but the Mining Warden warned that shortages of timber, firewood and the high cost of transporting materials and equipment would make the cost of extraction high. Conditions were harsh and miners tended to converge on sites where water, no matter how small the amount, existed. Such supplies were quickly exhausted. Water shortages prompted the carting of excavated soil from Mt Browne to Milparinka for washing. Other miners resorted to dry-blowing to extract the gold. At times, neither teams of bullocks or horses could transport supplies into the field and miners were reported to go for days without flour, subsisting on mutton and \\"wild spinach\\" which grew near the creeks. Camel trains, travelling overland from Beltana in South Australia were introduced to help alleviate transportation problems. Illness also took its toll on the miners. In 1882 temporary hospitals had to be established at Milparinka and Tibooburra as scurvy and ophthalmia (Barcoo Rot) were rife and there were many deaths from dysentery and a fever similar to typhoid fever. Albert Town was established in 1882 and sits between two arms of Warratta Creek. Warratta Reef (later known as The Reefs), discovered in 1881 as part of the initial exploration of the Albert Goldfield, and worked continuously from that time onwards is immediately to the west, while the Pioneer, Elizabeth, Phoenix and Rosemount reefs are to the east of the creek. Warratta Reef was mined by trenching following particular visible quartz seams and other exploratory trenches running across the line of reefs to intercept buried reefs. A number of shafts and shallow holes were dug. Because of the aridity of the area the technique of dry-blowing was a major source of gold yield. Initially this was through dish winnowing, and later machines were developed. The goldfield had a great impact on the remote region, bringing a range of resources, including goods, labour, capital investment and public awareness to the Corner Country. The influx of resources can be seen in how the area competed, although only for a year or two, with Silverton as a successful centre in the far west of New South Wales. By the end of 1882 the goldfield had settled into an established demographic pattern which saw Milparinka and Tibooburra as the major centres, Mt Browne as a struggling community with sporadic bursts of alluvial mining and Albert as a struggling community which was abandoned before the turn of the century. While initially producing 11,900 ounces in 1881 gold production declined markedly with only 387 ounces produced in 1906. Both the drought and Depression of the 1890s severally impacted on the Albert Goldfield and can be related to the decline in production.  Description  Albert Goldfield and Albert Town are situated approximately 25 kilometres south of Tibooburra along the Silver City Highway. Nine structures built of local stone are standing above the surface of the ground and another three masonry structures are fairly close to the ground. The remains are spread over an area of c. 50 metres north - south and 150 metres east - west. The masonry structures generally consist of fireplaces and wall alignments mostly constructed of mass angular sedimentary chunks of slate. Evidence of superstructures is limited. The overall integrity and intactness of the structures were reported as high as at 31 March 2006 allowing their form, function and interrelationship to be easily established. The archaeological remains are particularly illustrative and informative of geological and mining techniques of the period and have the potential to provide further research information relating to the miners responses to their surroundings, especially distance from service and population centres, aridity, the area's geology and the skewed sex ratios of the area. Integrity and intactness are high. Almost all of the structures retain enough original fabric to allow their form, function and interrelationship to be easily established.  Heritage listing  The Albert Goldfield is of state significance. It irrevocably altered the nature of the northwest of the state, giving it considerable regional importance. It was the first mining locality to tap into the arid country mineral fields of Australia and as such paved the way for the mineral exploration of the Australian interior using a range of technologies for arid country goldmining that originated on the Albert Goldfield. The overall integrity and intactness of the structures is high allowing their form, function and interrelationship to be easily established. The archaeological remains are particularly illustrative and informative of geological and mining techniques of the period and have the potential to provide further research information relating to the miners responses to their surroundings, especially distance from service and population centres, aridity, the area's geology and the skewed sex ratios of the area. Albert Goldfield was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Has a national significant because the Albert Goldfield was the first mining locality to tap into the arid country mineral fields of Australia, and as such paved the way for mineral exploration of the Australian interior. The Albert Goldfield saw the start of a range of technologies being developed for arid country gold mining which were used to great effect elsewhere in the Northern Territory, Queensland and especially Western Australia. It was effectively, the springboard for the desert goldfields of Australia. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The setting of the Albert Goldfield and Albert Town are aesthetically pleasing as an arid landscape. The appearance of the building remains, ash heaps, mining trenches and other cultural remains within the complex is evocative of the romance of the historical period of gold mining. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Albert Goldfield is socially significant as Albert Town and the Albert Goldfield reveal the responses of the miners to their surroundings, especially distance from service and population centres, aridity, the area's geology and the skewed sex ratios of the area. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. That distinctive Australian arid country adaptation for gold prospecting, dry- blowing originated on the Albert Goldfield. Some of the archaeological remains are particularly illustrative and informative of geological and mining techniques of the period, while other remains can contribute useful information on the lifestyles of miners and others, all of which has the capacity to contribute to a range of pertinent research issues in historical archaeology and social history. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Albert Goldfield is the oldest Australian example of the response to gold prospecting in arid conditions in the form of dry-blowing. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Albert Goldfield is representative of a unique response to mining in an arid environment.

The last boats of this design were built in 1982 and delivered as kits. Production The design was commissioned by Douglas Badgley, designed by Brewer as the Douglas 31 and initially built by Badgley's company, Douglas Marine Craft in Port Stanley, Ontario, Canada, with production commencing in 1967. Douglas Marine Craft went out of business in 1970-71 and creditors seized the company assets, including the design's molds. Jeffrey White of North American Fiberglas Moldings of London, Ontario, acquired a set of Douglas 31 hull and deck molds and had Brewer modify the design to incorporate an extended reverse transom. The new version was known as the Douglas 32. In 1974, North American Fiberglas entered receivership, emerging as Command Yachts, under the same management and produced the Douglas 32 Mark II model. In about 1976 Command Yachts was purchased by De Leuw Cather Canada and the boat building division was shut down. Bruce Peninsula Yachts of Port Elgin, Ontario then bought the molds and built the Douglas 32 Mark II, with a new cabin configuration. Hullmaster Boats of Picton, Ontario, had also purchased at least one of the original Douglas 31 molds at about the same time that North American Fibreglas Mouldings had acquired their molds, and built the design as the Hullmaster 31, completing production in 1979. Following Hullmaster's bankruptcy, Doug Smith acquired the Douglas 31 molds and built the design in the form of a kit for owners to finish. Smith then sold his business to Jed and Carol Benoit of J&C; Fibercraft, based in Barrie, Ontario, who then used the molds to produce the Douglas 31. Hinterhoeller Yachts built the last six Douglas 31 hulls in about 1982. These were then delivered to customers as kits for owner completion.

The grapes were developed by horticulturist David Cain and his team at Bakersfield, California-based fruit breeder International Fruit Genetics (IFG). The grapes are produced in California by grower Grapery, which began selling them in 2011. Development Cotton Candy grapes in their packaging David Cain was a fruit geneticist and former USDA researcher who co- founded IFG in Bakersfield in 2001. A few months after forming the company, he attended a trade show where researchers from the University of Arkansas were showing grapes. One was a purple Concord grape that tasted sweet like cotton candy, but was fragile with tiny seeds. He licensed that grape and began working to improve the size and texture by crossbreeding the grapes with sturdier California grapes. He hand pollinated to cross pollinate millions of grapes to combine the sweet Concord grapes with common grapes in order to make them firmer. Pollen from male grape flowers was extracted and brushed onto the female clusters of the target plant. Over twelve years, a hundred thousand plants were created and grown in test tubes before developing the Cotton Candy variety of grape. In 2010, IFG patented the grape and began licensing it to growers, including California grower Grapery. Grapery was founded in 1996 by Jack Pandol, a UC Davis plant scientist graduate and third generation grape grower, and was co-owned by fellow grower Jim Beagle. Description No artificial flavoring is added to give the grapes a flavor similar to cotton candy. Weighing in at about 18 grams of sugar per 100 grams of grapes, the Cotton Candy grapes have about 12 percent more sugar than regular table grapes. Production and distribution In addition to California, growers also grow the grapes in Peru, Spain, Italy, Chile, Brazil, Australia and Mexico. The fruit is available in every state of the US but only on a seasonal basis. Retailers include Trader Joe's and Whole Foods. As of September 2017, the company's grapes were being sold in 14 countries.

A bend in the shoreline on the northwest side of the island created a bight, a wide bay and naturally protected harbor. Today, the Historic Seaport is the location of restaurants, bars, boutiques, art galleries, museums, hotels, boats, and watersports excursions.  Historical industry  Green turtles being harvested at the Key West Bight.  Turtles  Sponge auction at the Key West Bight. In the mid to late 1800s, sea turtles were a prized commodity and sea turtle consumption was a substantial industry, with tens of thousands of green turtles harvested from Key West waters every year. Sea turtle meat was used in steaks and soups, their skin was turned to leather, and their shells were used in jewelry. At the bight, turtles were kept live in “kraals,” dockside pens, before being butchered, processed, and canned. Norberg Thompson, founder of Thompson Enterprises and The Thompson Fish Company, began his operations in the turtle industry. He was an influential Key West businessman who significantly developed the bight. During the Great Depression, Thompson employed 40% of Key West, and he went on to become the town's mayor. In 1973, the Endangered Species Act put an end to harvesting all green sea turtles. Today, the bight is home to Turtle Kraals restaurant and the Key West Turtle Cannery Museum.  Sponges  In 1849, the first sponge shipment arrived in New York from Key West. There was great demand for Key West sponges and the industry created 1,200 jobs on 350 sponge fishing vessels, known as \\"hook boats\\", based in the Key West Bight. Business dropped off significantly when local waters became depleted and disappeared altogether with the arrival and popularity of artificial sponges. The Key West sponging industry was the setting of the 1953 film Beneath the 12 Mile Reef.  Shrimp  In 1947, Tortugas pink shrimp were discovered in Gulf waters off Key West. Shrimp trawlers were housed at the bight. The lucrative shrimp industry was known as the “Pink Gold Rush” and the shrimps themselves were called “Key West Pinks.” During this time, Booty Singleton's seafood company, Singleton Packing Corporation, took advantage of the availability of shrimps and became a national name. Because of his success in the industry, Singleton became known as the \\"Shrimp King\\". Shrimping continued until the late 1980s when the shrimp population was decimated and shrimpers left Key West.  Historic Seaport today  The Western Union berthed at the Key West Bight.In January 1999, the bight was officially renamed Key West Historic Seaport and Harborwalk. One vessel found at the Historic Seaport today is the Western Union, a schooner built in 1939 and the last surviving authentic working tall ship from Florida. It is the flagship of the state of Florida and the city of Key West. The historic seaport is home to a number of large artworks, including by artists Robert Wyland and Ryan Stimers. Businesses at the seaport include The Waterfront Brewery and Cuban Coffee Queen and the bight is the site of sunset cruises. In 2018, the Key West Historic Seaport was recognized by the Florida Trust for Historic Preservation with the Meritorious Achievement Award for Organizational Achievement.

He is the first person in the history of medicine to be the one chiefly responsible for all 3 of the following steps: (1) discovery of the virus causing a human disease, (2) development of a method of diagnosis for the disease, and (3) development of a vaccine against the disease. Lee studied medicine at Seoul National University with a M.D. degree in 1954 and was awarded a doctorate at the University of Minnesota in 1959. From 1954 to 1972 he was a professor of microbiology at the Medical College of Seoul National University, as well as dean of the Medical College. From 1972 to 1994 he was the director of the Department of Virology of Korea University. Since 1994 he has been the director of the ASAN Institute for Life Sciences in South Korea. In 1976 Lee and his collaborators succeeded in isolating the virus causing Korean hemorrhagic fever; they gave it the name Hantaan virus (now called hantavirus or orthohantavirus). The discovery caused a sensation in the international community of medical researchers, because the quest for isolating the virus had been the subject of intense effort since the early 1950s. The research involved in isolating the virus was dangerous, and several of Lee's collaborators became ill due to aerosols produced by chronically infected rodents. In 1989 Lee and collaborators developed a formalin-inactivated suckling mouse Hantaan virus vaccine, which under the name Hantavax™ has been approved for commercial use in South Korea since 1990. In 1990 Tomiyama and Lee published their findings for their method of rapid serodiagnosis of hantavirus infections. Ho Wang Lee became one of the first South Korean scientists to gain international fame while continuing to do research primarily in South Korea.

It occurs on June 24 every year. Background The feast of São João is a celebration of the birthday of St. John the Baptist. St. John was the son of St. Elizabeth, a relative of Mary, the mother of Jesus. This feast is celebrated on 24 June. The significance of this date is that it falls three months after the feast of the Annunciation (25 March). At the Annunciation, the angel Gabriel told Mary that she would bear a son (Jesus), and that Elizabeth was already six months pregnant with a son (). Mary visited Elizabeth, and when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby St. John 'leapt' in her womb ().Butler, Alban. Lives of the Saints The Annunciation itself occurs nine months before Christmas, the feast of Jesus' birth. When John grew up, he is described as living in the wilderness, wearing clothes of camel's hair, eating locusts and wild honey. John foretold the coming of the Messiah, Jesus. When Jesus was thirty years old, he was baptised by St. John in the river Jordan. The Nativity of John the Baptist is one of the oldest festivals of the Christian church, and there is record that it was already a big feast in the year 506 AD. The feast of Sao Joao in Goa coincides with the time of the year when the monsoon usually has commenced, there are fresh greenery and flowers in the surroundings, and wells and other water bodies are full. Consequently, the celebration of the birth of St. John in Goa apparently evolved to incorporate elements of celebration of the rainy season. Jumping in wells and ponds is symbolic of the baby leaping in the womb, and of the baptism in the river Jordan.http://www.goatourism.gov.in/festivals/christian-festivals/201-sao-joao Wearing kopels made of flowers, and other adornments and vestments made from plants is probably also a nod to the fact that St. John wore natural coverings instead of clothing made of fabric.  Form of celebration  While the feast of Sao Joao is celebrated across the Catholic world on the same day, Goa is the only place in the world where it is marked by leaping into wells. On this day, groups of people go around singing traditional songs accompanied with instruments like ghumot, mhadalem and kansallem. \\"Tourists think it is only about jumping into wells. But the prayers we say before that are for a good monsoon,\\" Cecil Pinto, described as the local authority on the feast of São João, has been quoted saying. The festival has been described as being \\"quite popular among tourists from both India and abroad\\". Villagers at Saligao, Goa, serve food to all present during the Sao Joao (Vangodd de Saligao) festival in GoaChari writes that while the Sao Joao celebrations are \\"centuries old\\", a more recent tradition is followed in the village of Siolim, in Bardez taluka, featuring colourful floats on boats. These festivities date back 175 years, when San Joao revellers from Chapora and Zhor villages of Anjuna, Badem in Assagao and Siolim would come in boats to the chapel of San Joao in Pereira Vaddo, Siolim, every year, to pay homage to the saint. In the village of Saligao, also in the Bardez taluka, the event is celebrated as the Vangodd de Saligao, a village festival of music, dance and with the villagers often cooking enough food to feed all the visitors free of cost. Sao Joao is also a celebration of thanksgiving for newly-weds, and for families with babies born during the preceding year.

She was also known the \\"Courtesan of Colorado City\\" and \\"Queen of the Colorado City Tenderloin\\". She had entered the profession after being left with an infant daughter. McDaniel maintained a close relationship with her mother and family over her career and she sent her daughter to boarding school. Her clients were among the wealthy citizens of the Colorado Springs area and she was said to have the \\"most spectacular [house] in town\\", managed by a number of servants. Although she was encouraged to leave town by citizens and law enforcement, she continued to operate her business until her death. Early years Laura Bell Horton was born on November 27, 1861 near Buffalo Lick, Missouri to farmers, James and Anna Horton. Her father died in 1870 and her mother continued to farm the land and raise Laura and her brother James. Anna then married John Warmoth (died by 1884), and in 1878 they had a daughter named Birdie. When she was 19 years old, about 1880, she married Samuel Dale from Brunswick, Missouri. Soon after they were married, they moved to Salida, Colorado, a new railroad town. In 1884, their daughter Eva Pearl Dale was born. Samuel left within a few months of his daughter's birth. When she began having marital problems, her mother moved to Colorado and opened a boarding house and worked as a laundress. She operated the boarding house with McDaniel's two younger sisters. In 1885, McDaniel purchased a house next her mother's house and worked as a clerk as she raised her daughter and nine-year old nephew, Wiley Short. She began dating John Thomas McDaniel, called Tom. Her house was destroyed by a fire when she was on a trip to Leadville with Tom McDaniel. She had an insurance policy to cover the cost of the damage, but one of her mother's boarders, Morgan Dunn, was thought to have set the fire. She moved to a house in the town's red-light district. There was an investigation of arson regarding her house, but nothing could be proved, and McDaniel received the insurance money. She married Tom on April 7, 1887 and the couple was scheduled to go on their honeymoon on April 14th. She told her husband that Dunn and tried to kiss her and Tom confronted Dunn and the two men got into a fight, but were convinced to stop fighting, but Tom later shot and killed Dunn and claimed he did so in self-defense. Town residents believed that Dunn had set fire to McDaniel's house as agreed upon so that she could get the insurance money, and Tom killed him to keep him from talking about it. The local paper stated that Dunn was unarmed when he was shot and he was recovering from a broken collarbone and arm from a bar fight. The McDaniel's gave an interview to the paper providing information that were inconsistent with the events and statements by Anna Horton. There was a trial that found Tom not guilty. Career Colorado City Colorado Avenue, Old Colorado City, circa 1910. The respectable businesses were on the north (right) side of the street and the saloons and bordellos on the south side (left) and Cucharas Street. To avoid being seen entering the businesses, customers could enter the saloons and bordellos via tunnels that went underneath Colorado Avenue. Both of the McDaniels left Salida and went their separate ways. Laura McDaniel settled in Colorado City by 1888. She now referred to herself as Mrs. Bell McDaniel. She bought a house for a brothel on Washington Street (now Cucharas Street), which was visited by wealthy and well-known people. It was one of the \\"most spectacular in town\\" with expensive furniture, chandeliers, and a ballroom. She employed a cook, bartender, and other servants. In 1889, her Faro dealer was Bob Ford, who killed Jesse James. There were tunnels that went under Colorado Avenue and directly to her house, so that customers would not be seen entering the bordello. She charged $250 for one of her girls, at a time when women made $2 working a day as a laundress. People that had a significant role in her life included Charles L. Tutt Sr., a real estate and mining magnate; Minnie Smith, a female gambler; and John O'Bryne, nicknamed \\"Prairie Dog\\", who was a hack driver and brakeman for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. Aside from dealing with the challenges of running a bordello—suicidal employees, unruly customers, and managing competition with other houses—McDaniel's also had to manage law enforcement issues, which became more stringent in the early 1900s. Citizens became involved, warning and beating prostitutes and burning down brothels. In 1903, she was arrested for prostitution and she was indicted for running a house of ill repute and paid a bond of $500. She also paid monthly fines for running her business. Her houses were burned down, but she always rebuilt. Her nicest house, called the Mansion, was a big brick building that cost more than $10,000 () to construct. In late 1917, she was arrested for stealing 34 bottles of liquor from Charles Baldwin, a wealthy resident of Colorado Springs. A trial was held in January 1918, during which a friend, Dusty McCarthy, testified that the liquor was planted in her house. The case was dismissed. McCarthy was a lifelong friend and cousin of Billy the Kid. Cripple Creek Between 1903 and 1905, she ran a brothel in Cripple Creek. She returned in 1905, and then began running houses in both towns. Between 1901 and 1907, she had established two brothels. Personal life McDaniel sent her daughter, Eva Pearl, to boarding school to improve the likelihood that she would have better opportunities. In 1890, her mother, Anna Horton, moved to Colorado City and lived around the corner from McDaniel. That year, Horton married John Kistler (died 1898). Over the years, McDaniel contributed to her family's finances. In 1893, she divorced Tom McDaniel. Within ten years, her sister Birdie, Birdie's husband, and their infant son lived with Horton by 1900. In 1901, Eva Pearl lived with her grandmother, who died in 1905. By 1907, McDaniel bought a house on Grand Street (now Vermijo Street). McDaniel married Herbert N. Berg, the financial editor of the Colorado Springs Gazette Telegraph in February 1911 and she continued to operate her businesses. Berg filed for divorce in 1912 and it was granted in October. Berg died in 1916. She shopped within the red-light district and conducted herself with dignity while in public. She helped the homeless by helping them find a place to live and giving them money. She also donated to charities. On January 25, 1918, the day after the legal case against McDaniel was closed, she was in a car accident on a drive to Denver. She died a few days later at Memorial Hospital in Colorado Springs. Her niece, Laura Pearson, was killed and Dusty McCarthy was injured in the crash that occurred near Castle Rock. McDaniel and Pearson were buried next to each other at the Fairview Cemetery in Colorado Springs. Her daughter inherited McDaniel's estate of about $15,000 (). It was later determined that there was a car with the deputy district attorney and two other men following close behind McDaniel's car on the day of the crash, but since McCarthy was blind there was not enough evidence for prosecution.

The History of the World's Fair states, \\"It will be a long time before such an aggregation of woman's work, as may now be seen in the Woman's Building, can be gathered from all parts of the world again.\\" Origins Beginning in 1889, activist women in Chicago lobbied to make their city the site of the world's fair of 1892. They also petitioned for an official place for women in the planning and exhibitions at the fair. Led by Emma Gilson Wallace, they suggested forming a \\"Women's Department for the Fair\\". These activists came from various women's organizations involved in philanthropy, education, and suffrage. The Quatro-Centennial Committee of the Senate (i.e. commemorating the 400th anniversary of Columbus's first voyage to the New World) approved the Fair Bill naming Chicago as the site. When the bill was sent to the House of Representatives, William McKendree Springer attached an amendment to create a Board of Lady Managers. The House accepted the bill and in 1890 President Benjamin Harrison signed the bill into law. The Board appointments, made by the National Commission, numbered 117, including two Lady Managers from each state, territory and the District of Columbia, as well as members-at-large.

Four panels in the Hall of Honor were painted by Lucia Fairchild Fuller, Amanda Brewster Sewell, Rosina Emmet Sherwood and Lydia Field Emmet. The British sculptor Ellen Mary Rope contributed a bas relief, depicting ‘Hope, Charity, Faith and Heavenly Wisdom’, which found a later home in the dining room of the first Ladies' Residential Chambers in London, a project of cousins Rhoda and Agnes Garrett. The library ceiling mural was painted by Dora Wheeler Keith. Exhibits Madeleine Lemaire's poster for The Art & Handicraft in the Woman's Building The Woman's Building contained exhibits of works by women across a variety of fields from fine art, applied art, literature and music, to science, and home economics. There were also exhibits about women in American History and other cultures and places in the world. Annexed to the Woman's Building was the Children's Building which exhibited American 19th century best practices for child-rearing and education. Legacy Yandell co- wrote a semi-autobiographical account of her involvement in planning the fair, Three Girls in a Flat (1892). The exhibits at the Woman's building inspired Danish noblewoman, Sophie Oxholm, to organize a women's exhibition in Copenhagen, eventually resulting in the 1895 Copenhagen Women's Exhibition. Buildings at world's fairs are often demolished when the event ends, and finding another home for them is rarely practical. (The exception was The Crystal Palace after the Great Exhibition of 1851.) The Woman's Building was destroyed as part of the general demolition after the Fair. Sadly, after the exposition, Cassatt's mural and many other artworks by many women were placed in storage and subsequently lost. Eighty years later, the Woman's Building had been almost lost to history. With the flourishing of second-wave feminism, women went searching for what had gone before. Feminist artist Judy Chicago and her team of students, in the midst of creating The Dinner Party, discovered a copy of the Woman's Building catalog in a second-hand bookstore. When the Los Angeles Woman's Building was opened in 1973, the founders decided to name the organization after the 1893 Woman's Building.

The mine would be among the world's largest tungsten mines, with reserves equating to 227 kilotonnes of elemental tungsten (W). The claim owner, Sisson Mines Ltd., proposes to mine 30,000 tonnes per day of ore which contains on average 0.06 per cent tungsten trioxide (WO3) and smaller amounts of molybdenum. The tungsten component of the ore would be refined into an intermediate product ammonium paratungstate (APT) for shipment. Five hundred fifty seven thousand metric tonne units (mtu) of APT would be produced per year, which equates to 4,457 tonnes of tungsten metal per year. The mine would generate large quantities of potentially acid-generating tailings. To minimise acid production and leaching of toxins, including arsenic, from the tailings and waste rock the operator proposes to submerge the tailings and waste rock in a large tailings storage facility (TSF - or \\"tailings pond\\"). The pond would be about 3½ by 2½ km in horizontal extent, with a maximum dam height of 90 metres;Amec Foster Wheeler Environment & Infrastructure. July, 2016. \\"REVIEW OF SITE CHARACTERIZATION AND TAILINGS STORAGE FACILITY DESIGN SISSON BROOK MINE, NEW BRUNSWICK, FINAL REPORT\\". (Submitted to: New Brunswick Department of Energy and Mines, Fredericton, New Brunswick.) Page 3. The 90 m figure is more recent than a figure of 75 m given in the 2015 Environmental Impact Assessment. the stored volume would comprise 23 million cubic metres of contaminated water, 282 million tonnes of tailings, and 193 million tonnes of waste rock. There is local concern about the environmental impact of the mine and tailings storage facility. According to a 2002 paper by T E Martin and others in Minerals, Mining, and Sustainable Development, “Tailings storage facilities typically represent the most significant environmental liability associated with mining operations.” The mine would be closed after a two year construction period and 27 year producing life. The operator says that after closure, the open pit, which will be 2 km2 in area and 300–330 metres deep, will be allowed to fill with rain water. Because the sides of the flooded pit will be steep and rocky, and thus hazardous, the operator proposes that: \\"The open pit and quarry will however be fenced, supplemented with earth/rock berms if deemed necessary, to prevent human and wildlife access.\\" The tailings storage facility will not be drained or filled after closure but will remain as open water. The tailings storage facility must be essentially permanent, as the submerged tailings will remain chemically hazardous for about 10,000 years.David M Chambers ca. 2011, p 3. Tailings dams have a history of failure in Canada as well as around the world. The rate of tailings dam failure worldwide is between 1/700 and 1/1500 per dam per year. After the 2014 catastrophic failure of the Mount Polley tailings dam in the province of British Columbia, Canada, the government-appointed Expert Panel which reviewed the incident found that since 1969, of the province's approximately 100 tailings dams, 7 had experienced major failure. The rate of major failure was 1.7 x 10−3 per dam per year. In its Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) statement to the New Brunswick and Canadian governments, Sisson Mines Ltd. dismissed the possibility of a tailings dam failure and made no risk assessment of it. > \\"the possibility of a structural failure of a TSF embankment is so unlikely > that it cannot reasonably be considered a credible accident or malfunction, > and is thus not considered further in this EIA Report.\\" (Sisson EIA, p. > 8-698, cited in CCNB 2013, p 84/230) Several experts asked to comment on Sisson's regulatory application found this omission unacceptable. Writing for the Centre for Science in Public Participation, Dr. David Chambers and Mr. Stu Levit, M.S., J.D. commented on the above statement as follows: > \\"This is the first time I have seen this glaringly overconfident statement > made in an EIS/EIA. > > \\"In the 10 years since the ICOLD 2001 report the failure rate of tailings > dams has remained at roughly one failure every 8 months (i.e. three failures > every two years).

Previous research pointed out that most > tailings dam failures occur at operating mines, and that 39% of the tailings > dam failures worldwide occur in the United States, significantly more than > in any other country. > > \\"Tailings dam failure is a low probability event, but also an event with > high consequences.

To in essence assert that 'my engineering' could > not possibly fail, in light of existing statistics, is arrogantly assuming > that it is always the other guy (or gal) that will make a mistake -- but not > me. This is exactly the attitude that leads to accidents.\\" (CCNB 2013, p > 84/320.) R Allen Curry, a professor of biology at the University of New Brunswick, commented as follows: > \\"I respect that the engineers can design a well-built dam that has a low > probability of failure under normal operating conditions. However, the > statistics on TSFs are indisputable – the proponent will fail to contain > their water.... [A]ssuming a mine life of 27 years and the current empirical > rate of 1 [failure sic.] in 2000 per dam year, the TSF dam at Sisson would > have a 98.65% chance of surviving 27 years without a failure, or a 1 in 74 > risk of at least one failure over 27 years.... > > \\"Given that the Mt.

(Mt. Pleasant was a tin and tungsten mine located 100 km south of Sisson; its tailings dam failed in 1998.Lisa Hrabluk, 17 March 1998, \\"Tin mine tailing pond breached by flood.\\" The Telegraph Journal (Saint John, New Brunswick)) At 0.06% WO3, the grade of the ore at Sisson mine is low by industry standards, so the mine can only be operated profitably if costs are minimised and the tungsten price is high.

History The Mortier de 220 mm L mle 1880 was one of a series of heavy artillery pieces designed by Colonel Charles Ragon de Bange. On 11 May 1874 three de Bange heavy cannons (120 mm, 155 mm, 240 mm) and two mortars (220 mm, 270 mm) were ordered by the French Army. The mle 1880 was advanced for its time due to being built completely of steel instead of a steel liner and cast iron reinforcing hoops of the previous Canon de 240 mm C mle 1870-87. Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. Fortresses, armories, coastal fortifications, and museums were scoured for heavy artillery and sent to the front. Suitable field and rail carriages were built for these guns in an effort to give their forces the heavy field artillery needed to overcome trenches and hardened concrete fortifications. Variants mle 1880 The mle 1880 was a breech loaded mortar with a de Bange obturator and used separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. The mle 1880 was originally built without a recoil mechanism and in order to traverse the carriage needed to be levered into position before and after each shot. For transport, the mle 1880 could be broken down for transport into two wagon loads (barrel and carriage) for towing by two horse teams. The mortars could also be transferred to narrow gauge rail wagons for the final leg to their firing positions. These narrow gauge tracks were also used to re-position the mortars and bring up their ammunition and supplies. Site preparation included creating a firing platform made of wooden beams on soft ground. At the outbreak of the First World War, it is estimated there were 300 mle 1880s available. mle 1880/91 A modification program in 1891 gave the mle 1880 a carriage with a hydraulic recoil mechanism and limited traverse. The new carriage was similar to the one used on the Mortier de 270 mm modèle 1885. The 130 mortars modified were designated as the mle 1880/1891 and consisted of a U shaped gun cradle which held the trunnioned barrel and a slightly inclined firing platform with hydraulic buffers. When the gun fired the hydro-buffer slowed the recoil of the cradle which slid up a set of inclined rails on the firing platform and then returned to position by the combined action of the buffers and gravity. For transport, it could be broken down into three loads for towing by horse teams or by artillery tractor. Site preparation consisted of creating a firing platform from wooden beams. However, a downside to the carriage modernization was the combined weight had doubled, which made transport and setup more difficult. mle 1880 A.C.S. In an effort to improve the mobility of the mle 1880, 100 mortars were given six-wheeled carriages called Affût de Circonstance Schneider. The carriages were built from steel with a two-wheeled axle at the front and a four-wheeled axle at the rear. The bed of the ACS formed the base of the mortar and it had the same recoil system as the earlier mle 1880/91. Once in position, the wheels could be retracted and the mortar sat on its base. The advantage of this system was its mobility and reduced setup time. The downside was excessive weight, it could only be towed by artillery tractors and it was unsuitable for use on soft ground.

The Bookfellow was a monthly English language journal published in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The publication's focus was Australian literature and editions were often accompanied by illustrations.  History  The Bookfellow was published in Sydney, by William Macleod from January 1899 to May 1899. Journalist A.G. Stephens, one of Australia’s most influential critics, had made several attempts at producing a literary magazine for Australians. In 1894, he was recruited by J.F. Archibald for the weekly Bulletin. He claimed the inside cover of the magazine for reviewing books and relaying literary gossip to interested readers. This section of the Bulletin came to be known as the ‘Red Page.’ Stephens assisted many emerging Australian writers by featuring their work on the ‘Red Page.’ In 1898, he convinced the owners of The Bulletin to sponsor a small magazine to increase the scope of the ‘Red Page.’ In January 1899, the first issue of The Bookfellow was published. The magazine actively promoted Australian writing and set out to educate Australian readers about developments in literature occurring overseas. The first issue, was subtitled ‘A monthly Magazine for Book Buyers and Book-Readers.’ Those who wrote for the publication included Barcroft Boake, Chris Brennan, Mary Hannay Foott, A.G. Stephens and A.J. Fischer.Stuart, Lurlene (1979), Nineteenth century Australian periodicles: an annotated bibliography, Sydney, Hale & Iremonger, p.49. The magazine ceased after 5 issues, in May 1899. Stephens returned to the ‘Red Page,’ but following a souring of his relationship with new Bulletin editor, James Edmonds, Stephens left The Bulletin in November 1906 to open a small bookshop that he called \\"The Bookfellow.\\" He resurrected The Bookfellow as a weekly magazine in January 1907; however, neither the bookshop, nor the magazine would see the year out.

Afterpay and Touchcorp merged in June 2017 to form Afterpay Touch Group. Business Afterpay was founded in 2015 by Nick Molnar and Anthony Eisen to provide a platform for allowing retailers to offer online layby. With the introduction of the Afterpay mobile app in 2017, Afterpay expanded its offerings to also be available for use at in-store retail locations. In 2017 Afterpay merged with one of its technology suppliers, Touchcorp. Subsequent to the merger, Afterpay's business operations consist of \\"buy now\\" and \\"pay later\\" business segments. Its pay later business enables retailers to offer their customers the facility to buy now and pay later without requiring traditional credit, upfront fees or interest allowing customers to have the ability to make purchases now and pay for them in four equal payments made every fortnight without any interest. There is no interest charged to customers for using this service. However, failure to make their payments will result in a late fee. Customers are required to be over eighteen years of age to use the service. The pay now business consists of the Touch System Platform, which includes services related to fraud protection, regulatory compliance, and data collection and analysis for digital payments. Expansion  In January 2018, US venture capital fund Matrix Partners announced its intention to invest AU$19.4 million in Afterpay to support its entry into the US retail market, which was worth US$3.8 trillion in total annual turnover, including US$450 billion in online purchases. Afterpay launched in the US in mid-May 2018 with retailers such as Urban Outfitters, with over US$11m of underlying sales was processed in the first full month in June 2018. By August 2019, the company revealed that it had approximately over 2 million active users and 6,500 merchants in the US and announced a strategic partnership with Visa Inc. in the US to help it acquire new merchants by smoothing integration processes. On May 21st, 2020, the company announced that its US operations had grown to five million active customers in the US. Furthermore, it revealed that in total there were nearly nine million U.S. consumers who had joined the platform since its launch two years prior. In August 2018, Afterpay entered into a share purchase agreement to purchase Clearpay, a UK based buy now pay later subsidiary of Thinksmart. Under the agreement, Afterpay acquired 90% of the equity in Clearpay for total consideration of 1 million Afterpay shares. Afterpay has the option to purchase the remaining 10% in any time 5 years subsequent to the purchase. In June 2019, Afterpay announced that it had launched in the UK under the Clearpay brand. In its 2019 financial year update, the company announced that its growth in the UK was faster than that of the US, with more than 200,000 customers in the UK over its first 15 weeks. Criticism and regulation Some news outlets have called Afterpay a scheme, one stating that it is putting vulnerable young people into vicious cycles of debt that follow them long after they stop spending. Additionally, market commentators suggest whilst buy now pay later payment options (such as Afterpay and its competitors) are showing significant upside, they may be unable to sustain such growth unless they continue to show they are able to generate larger basket sizes (i.e., extra sales that consumers would not otherwise have made). In 2018, Afterpay announced it earned 24.4% of its income from late fees — and 75.6% from merchant fees. Critics have argued that the service may cause financial stress and the accumulation of debt. Despite this, 95% of payments have not received a late fee. Following this, in April 2019, legislation was passed to provide ASIC with \\"Product Intervention Powers\\" (PIP). These powers provide ASIC with the authority to intervene where it identifies a risk of significant detriment to retail consumers (including those using buy now pay later services like Afterpay). The company supported the introduction of these powers as a way to provide regulatory oversight and protect consumers. In June 2019, Afterpay disclosed that it was under probe by AUSTRAC for potential breaches of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (AML/CTF regulations). The company is \\"in dialogue\\" with the regulators and the outcome of the probe has yet to be determined. AUSTRAC upon identifying several concerns with its compliance, then subsequently ordered the appointment of an external auditor at Afterpay's expense to examine its compliance with the AML/CTF regulations. Competition Afterpay has a number of competitors including Affirm, Laybuy, Zip, Klarna, Splitit, Openpay and Sezzle.

Its staff and contributors use courses, mass media, special events and books to debunk pseudo-scientific myths and improve scientific literacy.  History  The organization was founded in 1999 as the Office for Chemistry and Society by chemistry professors Joseph Schwarcz, David Harpp and Ariel Fenster, with Schwarcz heading the office. The name was changed to indicate its wider focus. Both its public education role and the wide range of covered topics were explicit from the beginning: A timeline representing the development of the Office. The office pioneered the COursesOnline (COOL McGill) system, an initiative that started in 2000 with three professors and two programmers and now provides online versions of 350 courses. The office is funded by McGill University. In 2011, the Office received a $5.5-million grant from the Lorne Trottier Family Foundation.  Current status  The OSS conducts public education activities:via Educational presentations on scientific topics, Radio and television appearances, Youtube videos, Newspaper columns, and its Annual Trottier Public Science Symposium. The OSS was the recipient of the 2015 Science Promotion Prize by the Canadian Council of University Biology Chairs. With the proliferation of misleading or fraudulent health information online, the organization added the production of internet videos to its public communication activities. One video gained international attention in July 2018, when it got promoted by skeptics with a large online presence such as David Gorski, Susan Gerbic and Kavin Senapathy, as well as comedian Scott Rogowsky, and quickly reached 10 million hits. Imitating the format of others that promote false cures for cancer, the OSS video tells of a medical discovery by one Johan R. Tarjany (an anagram of OSS' Jonathan Jarry) before inviting the watcher to be skeptical and to ask questions. Public interventions by the OSS have attracted criticism from practitioners of alternative medicine, especially homeopaths accusing the OSS of ignoring evidence showing these kinds of treatments produce results exceeding the placebo effect.

Early life  Étienne Sved was born Süsz István in Székesfehérvar, Hungary, in 1914, changing his name on June 9, 1947.Ferenc Markovics, editor of Fények és tények (szerk.: Ferenc Markovics) MFSZ, 2006. 230. HUN, a book on the Association of Hungarian Photo-Artists, discloses that two photo-artists called István Svéd lived at the same time: Étienne Sved, and Stefan Sved Magyarized who changed his name from Seidner to Sved (1924–2000) who had first emigrated to Sweden, then eventually passed away in Israel. Rejected by the art schools of Budapest because he was Jewish, in 1930 Sved studied drawing at Atelier Budapest, a school of graphic arts founded in Budapest by Bauhaus teachers fleeing Nazi Germany.  Exile and work in Egypt during WWII  In face of the rising threat of Nazism, Sved fled to Egypt in 1938, traveling the country on a donkey, touring ancient funerary sites on the banks of the Nile, and eventually befriending Abbot Drioton, director of the Cairo Museum. Sved remained in the country until 1946 and through his friendship with the writer and intellectual Georges Henein, founder of the surrealist Jama’at al-Fann Wa al-Hurriyyah (Art and Liberty Group)Bardaouil, Sam & ProQuest (Firm) (2017). Surrealism in Egypt : modernism and the Art and Liberty group. I.B. Tauris & Co. Ltd, London ; New York, NY active 1939 - 1945, Sved worked as a photographer at the French paper Le Progrés Egyptien. In 1945, when Sved executed a series of posters for a local brand of cigarettes called Setos, Henein was the director of the company in Gianaclis that owned it. Sved published many satirical drawings before discovering photography, and while in Cairo, he created a series of anti-Nazi caricatures that were republished many years later in a bound volume titled Adolf ou à quand le crèpuscule des odieux?Adolf ou à quand le crépuscule des odieux? [Texte imprimé]: Opéra bouffe / Illustrations Etienne Sved; préface de Rita Thalmann / [Paris]: Ed. de Nesle, [1980?] His photographic work illustrated Jean Cocteau's Maalesh, a journal inspired by Cocteau's 1949 stay in Egypt. Sved’s eagerness to document the local Arab and Bedouin populations, rather than the French colonialists, led him to create an impressive collection of images of artefacts and street photographs of great historical value, which appear notably in a work published in 1954, Egypt face to face, with a text by Tristan Tzara for whom it became his most popular book during his lifetime, selling over 20,000 copies.\\"...it seems to be simply an album of photographs, the extraordinary photographs of Etienne Sved that make you look at the pictures of the ancient arl of Egypt and the reflections of the present: Egypt face to face. Tristan Tzara's commentary is a vast and continuous poem on the equation of songs of the millennia and the poet's current word. Face to face presents a strange resemblance between the language of the scribes, ritualistic chants, proverbs, and the prose-poetry of Tristan Tzara is revealed. The challenge here was to enter into dialogue - what a reward - with the ancient song, over the temporal layers. Jacques Gaucheron 'Esquisse pour un portrait' Europe; Jul 1, 1975; 33  In France  Étienne Sved departed Egypt for France in 1946, and the following year married. He became a naturalised French citizen in 1949. He continued his photographic career while successfully pursuing a career as a graphic designer in advertising. In 1952, he travelled to Algiers to produce, over a six-week stay, 600 illustrations for the album Algiers, 1951, a country in waiting with texts by Benjamin Stora, and two Algerian writers, Malek Alloula and Maïssa Bey. In 1955 a photograph of an Egyptian woman bearing a water jar was selected for the world-touring exhibition The Family of Man by Edward Steichen, curator of photography at MoMA. In 1962, he set up a publishing house and moved to Haute Provence producing Provence des campaniles (1972), which won the Nadar prize in 1990. He continued his work as a publisher and photographer until his death in 1996.  Legacy  In 2003, the Nicéphore-Niépce museum acquired the Middle Eastern photographic collection of Étienne Sved, comprising more than 3,000 negatives and vintage prints, and mounted a major retrospective in the same year in Manosque. The following year, Denon museum in Chalon-sur-Saône showed Moolesh, seventy-five photographs taken during his early years in Egypt along with memorabilia including a self-portrait of Sved from around 1940; his 1944 press card for Le Progrés Egyplien; and the Hungarian civil status certificate recording his name change from Istvan Süsz on June 9, 1947.

A famous story about fenshen concerns general Cao Cao ordering the execution of the alchemist Zuo Ci, who when taken into prison playfully divided himself into multiple Master Zuos, thus bamboozling the guards and escaping death. Terminology The Chinese word fēnshēn is a compound of fēn 分 \\"divide, separate, split, divert; differentiate, distinguish, discriminate, demarcate\\" and shēn 身 \\"torso of a man or animal, trunk of the body, the body below the neck; by synecdoche, general term for body\\" (Kroll 2017: 112, 406). The Chinese Hanyu Da Cidian, which is lexicographically comparable to the Oxford English Dictionary, defines fenshen 分身 with four meanings and cites earliest usages (1993 1: 571-572). # Transforming one's body into multiple bodies (), Hui Jiao 慧皎's c. 530 Memoirs of Eminent Monks biography of Shao Shuo 邵硕, on the same day that Shao was participating in a Chengdu procession while walking on all fours like a lion, \\"On that day, it was said that Shao was in Pidu District having assumed the form of a lion, and was conscious of his multiple bodies\\" () # A term for dealing with other matters (), Luo Guanzhong's 14th-century Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Zhuge Liang tells Wang Ping, \\"even if you can be both wise and brave, you are only one person, can you divide yourself into two places?

The near synonym fēnshén 分神 \\"transformation of the spirit\\", with shén 神 \\"god; deity; spirit; soul; mind\\" for shen \\"body\\", translates as \\"give some attention to; divert attention to; distraction\\", as used in fēnshénbùxiá 分神不暇 \\"unable to be in two places at the same time\\" (Bishop 2016). Compare the terms biànshén 變身 \\"transform the body\\" and biànshén 變神 \\"transform the spirit\\" referring to a meditator identifying with a specific deity or the entire cosmos. The term fēnxíng 分形, with 形 \\"outward form, appearance, shape; physical form of human being, often contrasted with spiritual essence\\" (Kroll 2017: 509), was synonymous with fenshen in early Daoist texts.

Knechgtes 1982: 231). # To separate (), Bao Zhao's early 5th-century poem \\"Presented to my old friend Ma Ziqiao\\" (), \\"Paired swords about to be parted, First cry out from inside their case. Mist and rain mixing as evening approaches, From this point on they separate their forms.\\" (tr. Varsano 2003: 161) (). Chinese Buddhist terminology uses fenshen 分身 \\"dividing the body\\" referring to the temporal huàshēn 化身 \\"transformation bodies; nirmāṇakāya\\" of the Buddha, \\"with which he teaches and saves living beings, a Buddha's power to reproduce himself ad infinitum and anywhere\\"; and fenxing 分形 \\"varied manifestation\\" means \\"to manifest in different forms for different beings simultaneously\\" (Digital Dictionary of Buddhism). In general usage, huashen 化身 means \\"incarnation; embodiment; personification\\" (Bishop 2016). In Sino-Japanese vocabulary, bunshin 分身 (borrowed from fenshen) translates as \\"a branch; an offshoot; [in self-reference] the other self; one's alter ego; [Buddhism] incarnations of the Buddha\\", and is used in bunshin no jutsu 分身の術 (from fēnshēnshù) \\"magic to create body-doubles\\" (Watanabe et al. 2003: 2341). Standard Chinese usage has semantically modernized both these ancient Daoist \\"body division\\" words: fenshen is Internet slang for sockpuppet and fenxing is mathematical jargon for fractal. Translations Translating Chinese fenshen and fenxing into English is problematic owing to numerous different stories about how Daoist and Buddhist masters could multiply themselves. The narratives describe body division as more of an ephemeral incarnation than a perpetual reincarnation, and involve elements of shapeshifting, body double, alter ego, doppelganger, avatar, personification, embodiment, and astral projection. English translations of ancient fenshen and fenxing include: *\\"multiplying the body\\" (Ware 1966) *\\"divide the body\\", \\"ubiquity\\" (Robinet 1979: 48) *\\"create dual images of oneself\\", \\"body splitting\\" (Penny 1993) *\\"body division\\", \\"dividing oneself\\", \\"divide one's form\\" (Campany 2002) *\\"create body-doubles\\" (Watanabe et al. 2003) *\\"multiplication of the body\\" (Baldrian-Hussein 2008) *\\"dividing oneself\\", \\"replicating oneself\\" (Bishop 2016) In present-day usage, English translation equivalents for fenshen expressions include (Wu 2003 1: 1359, and Bishop 2016): *fēnshēn 分身 spare time from one's main work to attend to [something] else *fēnshēnbùxiá 分身不暇 unable to be in two places at the same time; unable to disengage oneself *fēnshēnfǎ 分身法 means to divide oneself (for various tasks) *fēnshēnshù 分身术 magic of replicating oneself *fēnshēnfáshù 分身乏术 lack the art of dividing oneself; to find it hard to be in two places at once; unable to show up at all the places where one is needed; unable to do all the things one has to do Textual examples Woodcut illustration of neidan meditation Duangong mingxin 端拱冥心 \\"Sitting with Hands Clasped and Mind Undifferentiated\\", from the 1615 Xingming guizhi 性命圭旨 Pointers on Spiritual Nature and Bodily Life Chinese texts began to record fenshen and fenxing in the 3rd and 4th centuries CE.

(tr. Greatrex 1987: 121). > The above sixteen, according to statements made by [Cao Cao's sons] emperor > Wen of the Wei (i.e. Cao Pi), the king of Dong'e (i.e. Cao Zhi), and Zong > Changtong [仲長統], could all refrain from eating grains, make themselves > invisible, and go in and out without passing over the threshold of the door. > Zuo Ci could change his form [能变形], deceive people's vision and hearing, > dispel evil spirits and the like.

(tr. Greatrex 1987: 121-122). Baopuzi The earliest reliable descriptions of fenshen and fenxing are found in two c. 320 texts compiled by the Jin Dynasty Daoist scholar Ge Hong (282-343), the Baopuzi or Master who Embraces Simplicity and the Shenxian Zhuan or Biographies of Divine Transcendents. Two Baopuzi Inner Chapters mention multiplying or dividing the body. \\"Truth on Earth\\" (18, 地真) uses fenxing 分形 \\"divide the body\\" twice, xingfen 形分 \\"body division\\" once, and shenfen 身分\\"body division\\" once. The context describes three meditation techniques, Shou xuanyi 守玄一 Guarding the Mysterious One, Shouyi 守一 Guarding the One, and Mingjing 明鏡 Bright Mirror. > Mystery-Unity is seen only in the sun. The search for It begins in the sun, > and is described as \\"knowing white and preserving black\\" [所謂知白守黑] or > \\"unsuccessful in the desire for death\\" [欲死不得者也]. To begin with, you must > purify yourself and fast for a hundred days. Only then may you go to a > teacher and seek It, but then It can be obtained in not more than three or > four days; once you possess It you will never lose It provided you take > steps to preserve It. The preservation of Mystery-Unity consists in > imagining yourself as being divided into three persons [守玄一並思其身分為三人]. Once > these three have become visible, you can continue to increase the number to > several dozen, all like yourself [三人已見又轉益之可至數十人皆如己身], who may be concealed > or revealed, and all of whom are automatically in possession of secret oral > directions. This may be termed a process for multiplying the body [此所謂分形之道]. > Through this method [Zuo Ci], [Ji Liao], and my uncle [Ge Xuan] could be in > several dozen places at one time. When guests were present they could be one > host speaking the guests in the house, another host greeting guests beside > the stream, and still another host making casts with his fishing line, but > the guests were unable to distinguish which was he true one. (tr. Ware 1966: > 305-306) Robinet notes that Ge Xuan's mundane activities do not distract him from the \\"major occupation of all Taoists—dreaming alongside running water\\" (1979: 49). The context continues with Ge Hong quoting \\"my teacher\\", Zheng Yin 鄭隱 who was a disciple of Ge Xuan, about methods for body multiplication. > My teacher used to say that to preserve Unity was to practice jointly Bright > Mirror [守一兼修明鏡], and that on becoming successful in the mirror procedure a > man would be able to multiply his body to several dozen all with the same > dress and facial expression [能分形為數十人衣服面貌皆如一也]. My teacher also used to say > that you should take the great medicines diligently if you wished to enjoy > Fullness of Life [欲長生當勤服大藥], and that you should use metal solutions and a > multiplication of your person if you wished to communicate with the gods > [欲得通神當金水分形]. By multiplying the body, the three Hun and the seven Po are > automatically seen within the body [形分則自見其身中之三魂七魄], and in addition it > becomes possible to meet and visit with the powers of heaven and the deities > of earth and to have all the gods of the mountains and rivers in one's > service. (tr. Ware 1966: 306) This \\"metal solutions\\" translates jīnshuǐ 金水 Gold Water, referring to Gold Liquor, an alchemical elixir prepared from gold, mercury, saltpeter, and realgar. \\"Looking Farther Afield\\" (19, 遐覽) uses huaxing 化形 \\"transform the body\\" and fenxing \\"divide the body\\" referring to a lost text, the Yunu yinwei 玉女隱微 Latency of the Jade Woman. > By its method people can change into flying birds or stalking animals > [化形為飛禽走獸]. Clouds are raised and rain brought for an area a hundred miles > square by means of metal, wood, jade, or rock. Snow can be produced in the > same fashion.

They emit light shining for thousands of feet; > in a dark room, they are their own light. The book does indeed teach a great > art. (tr. Ware 1966: 316-317) The three xian transcendents Zuo Ci 左慈, Ge Xuan 葛玄, and Ji Liao 薊遼 or Li Zixun 薊子訓 mentioned as masters of fenxing are more fully described in Guo's other compilation below. Shenxian zhuan Five Shenxian zhuan hagiographies of Daoist xian describe fenxing 分形 or fenshen 分身 body division, usually resulting from the adept taking waidan alchemical elixirs. First, Zhang Daoling (34-156 CE), first patriarch of the Way of the Celestial Masters, founded the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice movement in 142, and eventually controlled a prosperous theocratic state in present-day Sichuan. > On account of all this, Zhang Ling obtained much wealth, which he used to > buy the necessary medicinal ingredients for synthesizing elixirs. When the > elixirs were completed, he ingested only half the dosage, not wishing to > ascend to Heaven immediately. As a result, he gained the ability to divide > himself into several dozen persons [能分形化作數十人]. Now, there was a pond outside > the gate of Zhang's residence, on which he frequently went boating to amuse > himself. Meanwhile, however, many Daoist guests would be going and coming in > his courtyard. There would always be one Zhang Ling in the courtyard, > conversing, eating, and drinking with these guests, while the real Zhang was > out on the pond. (tr. Campany 2002: 351) Second, Zuo Ci was a Daoist master who allegedly obtained the alchemical classics Scripture of Nine Elixirs and the Scripture of Gold Liquor from inside a cave on Mount Tianzhu, and mastering their techniques made him become \\"capable of transforming into a myriad different forms\\". Zuo uses his shapeshifting ability both to amuse and to taunt rulers. \\"Behind the amusing and the taunting lies a single lesson: transcendence-seeking adepts are of a superior order of being; rulers' appropriate response to them is respect and veneration, and any attempts to dominate or manipulate are futile.\\" (Campany 2002: 283). During the end of the Han dynasty (189-220 CE), the prominent general Cao Cao became Grand chancellor and founded what later became the state of Cao Wei. When Cao Cao heard of Zuo Ci's supernatural powers, including the ability to live without eating, he summoned him to court and incarcerated Zuo under supervision without any food for one year. Upon seeing that Zuo had remained in perfect health, Cao concluded that he was a sorcerer, and decided to execute him. Zuo Ci immediately realized Cao's intent, managed to magically disappear, and returned home. > Duke Cao was now even more determined to have him killed, and he also wanted > to test whether Zuo could avoid death, so he gave orders to have him > apprehended. As Cao's men approached, Zuo fled into a flock of sheep, and > his pursuers, losing sight of him, suspected that he might have transformed > himself into one of the sheep. They had the sheep counted. Originally there > had been an even thousand of them, but now there was one extra, so they knew > that Zuo had indeed transformed himself. They announced: \\"Master Zuo, if > you're in there, just come out; we won't hurt you.\\" Then one of the sheep > knelt down and spoke words, saying, \\"Who would have thought I'd be > pardoned?\\" When the pursuers tried to seize that one sheep, all of the other > sheep knelt down and said, \\"Who would have thought I'd be pardoned?\\" So the > pursuers [gave up and] left. (tr. Campany 2002: 280-281) Later on, someone learned Zuo Ci's whereabouts and informed Cao Cao, he once again sent soldiers who captured him. Although Zuo could have escaped, he deliberately allowed himself to be arrested in order to demonstrate his divine transformations. > He was taken into prison. When the guards there were ready to torture and > interrogate him, there was one Zuo inside the cell door and another Zuo > outside it, and they did not know which one to torture. When Cao was > informed, he despised Zuo even more, and ordered that he be taken out of the > city and killed. As they were taking him out of the city, Zuo suddenly > vanished. So they locked the city gates and searched for him. It was > announced that [they were searching for a man who] was blind in one eye and > wearing a linen cloth wrapped on his head and a one-layer gown. The moment > this announcement was made, the entire city full of people, numbering > several tens of thousands, all turned into men blind in one eye wearing a > linen cloth on their head and a one-layer gown. So in the end they did not > know which one to seize. Cao then put out an all-points order that Zuo Ci > was to be killed on sight. Someone saw and recognized Zuo, so they beheaded > him and presented [the head] to Cao. Cao was overjoyed. When he inspected > the head, however, it turned out to be only a bundle of straw. When someone > went back to search for Zuo's corpse, it had vanished. (tr. Campany 2002: > 281) Specifically, the one-eyed men all wore qing gejin danyi 青葛巾單衣 \\"a green kudzu- cloth headwrap and an unlined garment\\". Zuo Ci used what was later called bingjie 兵解 \\"escape by execution\\", an uncommon form of shijie \\"escape by means of a simulated corpse\\", and the Baopuzi says, \\"Zuo Ci performed 'martial escape' [bingjie 兵解] but did not die\\" (tr. Campany 2002: 286, cf. Ware 1966: 208). Third, the Shenxian zhuan has a detailed biography of Ge Xuan (164–244), who was the great-uncle of the compiler Ge Hong, that mentions fenxing. The first line states that Ge Xuan was a student of Zuo Ci who gave him the alchemical Scripture on the Elixirs of the Nine [Tripods] and the Scripture on the Elixir of Gold Liquor. Ge Xuan breathing fire to warm his guests A narrative about Ge Xuan entertaining visitors, compare Zhang Daoling above, mentions body division. > Ge Xuan often entertained guests. He would go out to welcome the latecomers, > while, meantime, seated and talking with the other guests was another Ge > Xuan. When sending guests off, he did the same thing. [Once] when the > weather was cold Ge told his guests, \\"It is impossible in my humble abode > for each of you to have his own fire, but I invite you to warm yourselves in > common.\\" He then opened his mouth and exhaled flames, which quickly filled > the room. All of the guests felt as if they were under a bright sun, but > neither were they too warm. (tr. Campany 2002: 154) Fourth, the hagiography of Ji Liao 薊遼 or Ji Zixun 薊子訓 records that he was famous for his paranormal abilities, including bringing back to life a dead child who Ji had accidentally killed. Many aristocrats in the capital of Chang'an wanted to meet Ji Zixun, and when they learned that Ji's young next- door neighbor was a student at the Imperial Academy, they promised that if he could get Ji to come to the capital, they would ensure that the student passed his exams and would become a wealthy official. Ji Zixun agreed in order to help his neighbor and gave a day when he would come to Chang'an. On that day, Ji left in the morning and arrived at the capital before noon, having traveled over a thousand li (\\"Chinese miles\\") in a few hours, he then asked the student, > \\"So, who wants to see me?\\" \\"A great many people want to see you, Master,\\" > said the student. \\"We don't want to keep them waiting. Just let me know > where you'll be staying, and I'll see that they all come to you.\\" Ji > replied, \\"They don't need to come here. I've just traveled a thousand li; > don't you think we can manage this? Tell each of them today to start > preparing for a guest. I will set out at noon and will decide at the last > minute whom I shall visit first.\\" The student, as instructed, relayed this > message to the notables, each of whom sprinkled and swept his chambers. > Precisely at noon, Ji Zixun went to each one of the twenty-three places in > question. There were twenty-three Ji's, one at each residence. Each of the > notables was delighted, thinking that he was the first to have been visited > by Ji. When they met the next day, as arranged, to compare experiences, they > realized that they had each simultaneously had a Ji Zixun in their home. The > clothing and countenance of each one was the same; only their discourse was > different, depending on what questions each host had asked the guest to > answer. Furthermore, each host had laid out food and drink for Ji, and he > had partaken of them with complete appropriateness at each place. People > near and far were astonished by this. (tr. Campany 2002: 170) Although the aristocrats clamored to see more of Ji he was not interested and said he was going to leave. > Just after he had cleared the gate, the lane outside was clogged with a > crowd of notables arriving there. The student said to them, \\"He has just > left. He will be the one heading east, riding a gray mule.\\" At this, each of > them spurred his horse to chase after Ji. From a distance it appeared that > the mule was sauntering along at a leisurely pace, but none of the horses > could catch up to him. This went on for half a day, with the distance > between them always holding steady at about one li. In the end none of them > could catch up, so they quit and returned home. (tr. Campany 2002: 170) Calling this account of Ji Zixun escaping astride his slow mule \\"a fine narrative expression of the near-yet-far, accessible-yet-not quality of the transcendent and his arts\\", Campany says \\"his feat of body division\\" (fenxing or fenshen) multilocality is one of the most vivid depictions of this art\\" in the Shenxian zhuan (2002: 171). Fifth, the later-attested hagiography for Yuzi 玉子 Jade Master includes fenxing in a list of supernatural abilities. > He was thoroughly versed in the meanings of the Five Phases, using them to > nourish his nature; cure illnesses; dispel misfortune; instantly call forth > wind, clouds, thunder, and rain; and change plants, rocks, and pottery into > domestic animals, dragons, and tigers. He could divide his form so as to > become several hundred thousand at once [分形為數百千人], and he could walk on > rivers and seas. By spitting out water, he could form pearls and jades, and > they would not revert [to water]. He could make horses from balls of mud, > and they would go a thousand li in a day. (tr. Campany 2002: 370) Methods In Daoist hagiographies, adepts who have mastered bianhua \\"transformation; metamorphosis\\" are portrayed as autonomously free from normal spatiotemporal limitations. Isabelle Robinet describes this transcendent state as possessing \\"the gift of ubiquity, [fenxing], which literally means to divide the body into many parts\\" (1979: 48-49). > [T]hrough \\"body division\\" (fenshen 分身), they are able to be at several > places at once, they disappear at will, they transform their appearance into > that of other persons or species, pass through walls and rocks, slip into > tiny spaces as well as across dimensions of time, enter water without > getting wet and pass through fire without burning, walk on water, secure > fruit out of season, and magically produce foods, water sources, and fire. > (Campany 1996: 303) The above textual examples have mentioned several techniques for obtaining the faculty of body division, and later texts give many others. The Baopuzi describes two methods for dividing oneself (Robinet 1979: 49). Zuo Ci, Ji Liao, and Ge Xuan used the Guarding the [Mysterious] One method that requires ritual fasting and purification before learning how to envision oneself into three selves, and then up to several dozen. By simultaneously practicing the Guarding the Mysterious One and Bright Mirror methods, an adept can multiply their body into dozens of selves, and if one wants to communicate with the gods, one needs to consume Gold Liquor and multiply the body by making one's three hun and seven po souls appear. Four of the five Shenxian zhuan hagiographies concerning body division also mention using waidan alchemical elixirs: Zhang Daoling, Zuo Ci, Ge Xuan, and Yuzi. According to Daoist legends, these masters of body division most commonly split into around two dozen duplicate selves; Zhang and Ge both used fenshen or fenxing for entertaining all their guests, and Ji Liao simultaneously appeared at twenty- three places. The highest number of duplications is ascribed to Yuzi who was supposedly able to divide himself into several hundred thousand Yuzis. Zuo Ci was the most famous master of body division, he shapeshifted into a sheep, divided into at least two identical selves, and simultaneously transformed himself and tens of thousands of city residents into identical one-eyed men wearing a green kudzu-cloth head wrap and an unlined garment. In contrast to early fenshen and fenxing techniques based upon laboratory waidan external alchemy, many later methods involved meditational neidan internal alchemy. The c. 1029 Yunji Qiqian Daoist encyclopedia gives methods for creating a yingren 影人 \\"shadow person\\" human simulacrum by means of mental concentration. Such figures, only several inches tall, are substitutes for the adept, and act as representatives who roam the heavens in order to secure beneficial influences for the adept. The 12th-century Daoshu 道樞 Pivot of the Dao compendium refers to a method of the \\"ancient sages\\" that enables one to fenxing divide the body by gazing at one's shadow [分形散影], as well as by gazing at one's reflection in a metal or water mirror. Other methods consist of envisioning oneself, or one's distinctive hun soul, entering the Palace of the Taiji Supreme Ultimate or ascending into the heavens accompanied by the three divinities of the Dantian, or else fusing with the Taiyi Supreme One. In their exercises, the Daoists \\"divide their bodies into a thousand persons, pace the void and go where they will\\" (Taidan yinshu 太丹隱書), \\"divide their breaths and expand their bodies\\" (Yuanshi bianhua baozhen shangjing 上清原始變化寶真上經), and \\"divide their light into a thousand bodies\\" (Shenzhou qizhuan qibian wutian jing 神州七轉七變舞天經) (tr. Robinet 1979: 49-50).

History  In 1931, an airfield was built in Šiauliai specifically for Lithuanian air forces. In 1940, after Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940) the airfield was placed at the disposal of the Red Army. June 22, 1941 aviation Wehrmacht and made a raid on the airfield, destroying a significant part of the Soviet aircraft there (including Polikarpov I-15 and Polikarpov I-16). During the war, the Germans used the forced labor of Lithuanian Jews to maintain the airfield. After the war, the airfield was expanded and specially transformed for the needs of Soviet aviation: by 1957, two large runways were built. In 1955, Šiauliai Airfield was one of six Soviet airfields that could receive intercontinental strategic bombers M-4 with nuclear weapons on board. At the aerodrome were based 53rd Fighter-Bomber Aviation Regiment (fighters MiG-23 and MiG-27), 18th Guards Military Transport Aviation Division, 196th Military Transport Aviation Division (transport aircraft IL-76) and 117th Separate Aviation Berlin Order of Kutuzov ALC EW (planes An-12). From 1966 to 1992, the 67th Separate Aviation Squadron DRLO military unit 32457 was based on airplanes Tu-126, then on A-50. In 1993, Russian troops were withdrawn from the territory of Lithuania. The airfield was partially re-equipped to receive civilian flights (irregular), but remained the basis of the Lithuanian Air Force. In 2004, Lithuania joined NATO, and the air forces of NATO were deployed at the airfield. The airfield is also used to refuel cargo and transit aircraft. NATO presence Members of NATO have taken turns rotating forces to the air base as part of the Baltic Air Policing mission, which has approximately 100 NATO support personnel assigned to the base.

Biography Born in New Delhi, Menon studied at St Xavier's High School and St Stephen's College, where he read History Honours (1968–69) and then Philosophy Honours (1969–70), but left college without taking a degree. Reading the Bhagavad-Gita at this time was a life-changing experience for him. It was the seed from which all his later work emerged. He developed an informal guru-sishya relationship with the great Malayalam novelist OV Vijayan, and translated two of his master's novels into English: The Infinity of Grace (Penguin) and Madhuram Gayathi (yet to be published by Vijayan's estate after his demise in 2005). Menon has lived and worked in Delhi, Hong Kong, Bengaluru, Jakarta, Tiruvananthapuram, Kodaikanal and Chennai. Ramesh Menon Critical Response In a starred review, Kirkus Reviews described his Ramayana as 'A masterpiece made new for a generation of readers who ought to be very grateful indeed to Menon'. British theatre director Peter Brook called the book 'A beautiful new rendering of an inexhaustible theme'. His 2 volume rendering of the Mahabharata is his most read and reviewed book.

His selections have been used in shelterbelts and landscaping applications across Canada and in northern countries around the world. Some of his selections include: * Coronation Triumph Potentilla * Density and Korman Spirea * Jubilee Willow * Radiance Amur Maple * Prairie Princess Phlox * Garry Pink Viburnum * Hill Poplar * Walker Poplar * Walker Caragana He was a founding member of the Indian Head Horticultural Society and past president of the Saskatchewan Institute of Agrologists, the Saskatchewan Horticultural Societies Association, the Western Canadian Society for Horticulture, and was a member of many other national and international horticultural organizations. He was a prolific contributor to The Prairie Garden magazine and also served as editor.  Early life and education  John Walker was born near New Deer, Aberdeenshire, Scotland at Hardbedlam Farm on 16 May 1893. His parents were James Walker (1856-1941), a farmer, and Margaret Ironside (1863-1956), who had eight children together. James also had two children with a previous wife, Margaret Delgarno (1857-1888). Walker obtained his early education at New Deer public school and Gordon's College in Aberdeen. He received his Intermediate Leaving Certificate in 1909 at the age of 16. Following his mother's keen interest in flowers and plants, Walker began an apprenticeship in gardening at Idvies House, near Lethan, Forfar, Scotland in July 1909. There he received training in the cleaning and care of the hot water boilers that heated the greenhouses. He later received training on the care of a wide range of annual and perennial vegetables and flowers. In 1912, as a qualified journeyman, Walker accepted an appointment at Murthly Castle in Perthshire, Scotland to carry out similar work to that at Idvies house. Around that time, opportunities in overseas countries were widely advertised, and in 1913, Walker arranged to leave Scotland for Canada, having been assured work at the Dominion Experimental Station in Lethbridge, Alberta. He departed Glasgow, Scotland on 22 March 1913 aboard the ship S.S. Scotian and arrived in Halifax, Nova Scotia on 31 March 1913, from where he proceeded by train to Lethbridge. There he worked in the garden and grounds during the summers of 1913 and 1914, enrolling in classes at the School of Agriculture in Claresholm, Alberta during the winters. He obtained a Diploma in Agriculture in April 1915, and was appointed gardener-in-charge at the Experimental Station in Lacombe, Alberta in April of that year.  Military service  John Walker in 1918 With World War I entering its second year, Walker enlisted for overseas service as a private in the 50th Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force, Calgary, Alberta, and was taken on strength on 31 August 1915. The camp where he completed his training was located at Sarcee, near Calgary. His unit, along with three other units comprising the 4th Infantry Division, Canadian Expeditionary Force, left Canada for England in October 1915. Their camp was in the south of England, near Bramshott, Hampshire, and they trained there until August 1916. Walker was a member of what was called the “Bomber Section” with special training in the use of grenades, etc. Their destination in France was the Somme near Amiens, where they manned the wet and muddy trenches until the spring of 1917. Their next move was to an area near Arras, opposite Lens, where the unit took part in an offensive drive in April. By this time, Walker had been promoted to the rank of Sergeant. In a later offensive action in June 1917, Walker was wounded in the right leg and left arm by shell fragments and was evacuated to England for hospitalization. After recovering from his wounds, Walker was designated to take an officer's training course. After successful completion of the course, he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant, and was assigned for duty in the Valanciennes area in 1918. After the armistice was signed in November 1918, Walker's unit remained in southwest Belgium as part of the Occupation Force until they returned to Canada in June 1919. Demobilization took place in Calgary, Alberta. Walker continued to be associated with the military after his return to civilian life, being involved with C.O.T.C while attending university in Edmonton, Alberta, between 1924 and 1925, and at the University of Manitoba between 1939 and 1942, including one summer period at Camp Shilo in Manitoba. He was also officer-in-charge, with the rank of Acting Major, of the Reserve Artillery Unit, 76th Field Battery, at Indian Head, Saskatchewan, from 1943 to 1945.  Undergraduate and graduate studies  Walker enrolled in the Agriculture Degree program at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, in the fall of 1921. He obtained his Bachelor of Science degree in 1924. He then pursued post graduate studies at the University of Minnesota, where he conducted vegetable production research on peat land and had teaching assignments.

The third volume was announced by Chinese state media on 30 June 2020. Reception Reviews of Governance of China have been mixed. It was positively received by Chinese media and officials and received measured praise from non-Chinese leaders. Prayuth Chan-ocha, the leader of Thailand's military junta, for instance, asked his cabinet to study the first volume shortly after it was released. In Western media it largely received negative reviews, with some regarding it as propaganda but offering that it is a useful guide to better understanding China under Xi Jinping's rule. Bethany Allen- Ebrahimian, writing in Foreign Policy, for instance, called it a \\"mix of stilted Communist Party argot, pleasant-sounding generalizations, and 'Father Knows Best'-style advice to the world\\". It received limited praise in other areas of Western society, however, with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly having read the book and ordering copies for his company's employees (though Zuckerberg's interest in the book has been interpreted as a vested interest—Facebook is blocked in China, and if the block were lifted the potential result would be a dramatic increase in Facebook's userbase). Although Chinese media have reported global circulation numbers for the book's volumes on the order of several million copies, Western media have reported very low sales numbers for the work in Western countries. According to The Economist: \\"There may not be very many readers outside China. The publisher claims the second volume has a global circulation of 13 million. But, according to Scott Morton of Nielsen Bookscan, a data provider, fewer than 100 copies of the English-language version of the second volume have actually been sold in Britain since it was published in November. Sales are slightly higher in Australia, at 124. The first volume has not performed much better: 588 copies in Britain and 430 in Australia.\\" It is likely that freebies of both volumes hugely exceed the number of copies sold to individuals.

The film also features Vidharth and Lakshmi Manchu in supporting roles. It is a remake of the Hindi-language film Tumhari Sulu (2017). The film narrates the story of an ambitious housewife who becomes a radio jockey for a late-night relationship advice show. The film was released worldwide in November 2018. The film's title was taken from a song from Mozhi, which was also directed by Mohan. Plot Vijayalakshmi Balakrishnan, nicknamed Vijji (Jyothika), is a middle- class housewife living in Chromepet with her family. Vijji enjoys her life to the fullest with her husband Balakrishnan (Vidharth) and an 11-year-old son. She dreams of being a working woman, but since she couldn't complete her high school she cannot think of any white collar jobs. Her elder twin sisters are always critical of her educational credentials and frequently mock her failed business ideas. Vijji is fond of participating in and winning any and every contest around her, be it a singing competition, an athletic event or a simple lemon and spoon race. Her husband, Balu works as a manager in a tailoring firm, which is quite a frustrating job since everyone apart from him is over the age of sixty, including the owners. Most of them are either unresponsive or unreasonable. On top of it, the firm now is taken over by the grandson of the owner, who is very rude and treats him with disdain. Balu bears all this for his family. Her son is constantly teased by a set of students, who have expensive items like a PlayStation gaming console, etc., in school. One fine day, Vijji wins a contest hosted by her favourite radio station. She receives a call from Anjali, the top RJ of the radio station. On the call, Anjali makes her sing. Vijji sings a retro song, which everyone at the radio station finds funny. Next day she goes to the Radio station to collect her prize. There she sees a poster of auditions for the position of a RJ. She is very excited and feels that this is the job she is waiting for. She insists on filling the form, which the receptionist refuses on some pretext or the other. Coincidentally, RJ Anjali walks in and feels that she must give her a shot. She takes Vijji to meet her boss, Maria (Lakshmi Manchu). Vijji is extrovert and engaging, which is a bit annoying for others but Maria finds her interesting. She gives her an opportunity to audition. At the audition, Vijji is very casual and not able to control her laughter after Kumki (Elango Kumaravel), one of the poets at the radio station, recites the lines in a sensual manner. Just at the end, she manages to say 'Hello' in a sensual manner, which impresses Maria. Maria gives her card and asks if she would be able to do a call-in night show - where people would call her to talk about their troubles. Maria gives Vijji time to think. Vijji thinks about the job and the sensual accent in which she would have to answer the calls. Just to try out, she calls a nearby grocery store, talks in a sensual accent and requests the owner to get a broom and deliver it to the Fifth floor. The owner excitingly comes to the address, only to find out that the floor does not exist. Next, she calls her husband and drives him mad. Next day, she calls Maria multiple times to tell that she is ready to take up the job. As it happens, Maria is in a very difficult situation and is not able to receive any of her calls. Vijji is disappointed and sends a few messages indicating that she is ready to work. Next day, Maria realizes the passion behind Vijji's persistent annoyance and fires her. To start with, Balu is annoyed with her that she took up the job without discussing with him but later relents out of his love for her. The company provides Vijji pickup and drop facility. On her first day, Vijji faces an annoying caller who tries to change their chat into an obscene one. With her sharp mind, Vijji is able to tactfully handle it. Next, she gets a request from a caller to sing an out of the world kind of a song for him. Vijji, out of excitement, sings a song which she sings only for her husband. Balu is annoyed by all this, as well as frustrated with his new boss who treats him rudely. Because of these two situations, he becomes angry and, at times, insecure. Vijji's parents and her sisters are very angry with her program and force her to quit the job. But Balu stands by her and she is able to continue. Maria is very happy with her and the show becomes very successful. Vijji also enjoys her work. But at times, Balu expresses his frustration either at his job or hers. It seems that life is like a roller coaster ride for Vijji, high at work and low at home. One day, she gets a call from her son's school and they visit his principal's office. The principal reveals that he and his friend were about to sell some stolen phones, one of which was Balu's to buy a PlayStation gaming console, and also forged Balu's signatures over the remarks written in his school diary. On this basis, he suspends her son from the school. This becomes a very big issue in their family and Vijji's sisters blame her that because of her job she has neglected her son. They decide that she now has to leave the job and her son would not stay with them because her low level of education is causing similar influence on him. Vijji takes a tough stand, rejects both the conditions and leaves for her job. While about to start the show, she gets a call that her son is missing. They later find a note by him, revealing he is very ashamed of what he has done. He is very sad to see that his mother had to leave her job because of his actions. He requests his father to support his mother and her job. Next day police find her son and bring him home. Vijji goes to her office and resigns. She feels that she is not able to handle the emotional turmoil at home. Just as she is leaving, she finds the receptionist having a fight with the tiffin service guy. Vijji has an idea and she requests Maria to give her the contract for the tiffin service. Next, we see Balu managing the tiffin business and Vijji going back to her job; managing both the household and her professional life in her own unique style.

In London near the end of World War II, 14-year-old Nathaniel and his sister Rachel are left in the care of an enigmatic figure named The Moth, their parents having moved to Singapore. The Moth affiliates with a motley group of eccentric, mysterious, and in some ways nefarious characters who dominate the children's experience early in the postwar period. Synopsis In 1945 at the end of the war, Nathaniel's father and mother decide to leave London for a year to go to Singapore, where Nathaniel's father is being stationed. The parents decide to leave their children, 14-year-old Nathaniel and his older sister Rachel, in the care of their lodger, Walter, known as The Moth. The children both have the impression that The Moth is a thief. Nathaniel's mother claims to know The Moth because they were both in charge of fire watching at the Grosvenor House Hotel during the war but their stories about the war imply that they had other, secretive war jobs. Nathaniel and Rachel are supposed to be boarders at their school when their parents leave, but after complaining to The Moth they are allowed to live at their home which is now populated by an odd mix of characters. One of these is The Moth's friend, The Darter, who imports greyhounds into England for the purpose of illegal gambling and ferries explosives by barge from Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills into central London. The Darter helps Nathaniel gain employment, first at a restaurant where he meets a working-class girl, Agnes Street, who he develops a relationship with, and later employing him to aid in smuggling. When Agnes thinks that Nathaniel does not want to introduce her to his parents because he is ashamed of her, Nathaniel has The Darter pretend to be his father. The Darter similarly helps Rachel, who develops epilepsy during this time period, by teaching Nathaniel how to deal with the symptoms, and helping Rachel find employment in a theatre. After the year has elapsed and his parents have still not returned, Nathaniel begins to suspect he is being followed, and also that his mother is still somewhere in England, possibly also in London. One night while out with Rachel and The Moth, all three are attacked by men who have been following Nathaniel for some time. When Nathaniel awakens, he and Rachel have already been rescued. He is also able to see his mother, briefly, who implies that giving up the children was part of a deal she made to ensure their safety. Shortly thereafter, Nathaniel and Rachel are separated and re- homed, with Rachel going to boarding school in the country, and Nathaniel briefly attending a boarding school in America. In 1959 Nathaniel, now an adult, is recruited by the Foreign Office to help in a mass censorship of post-WWII espionage activities, the censorship being known as The Silent Correction. Nathaniel buys a home in The Saints where his mother grew up and where he briefly lived with her after his return from America. Nathaniel also tries to connect with members of his past but The Moth is dead after their attack and almost everyone else has scattered. He and Rachel have a tense relationship though he eventually learns he has a nephew, named Walter after The Moth. Nathaniel's personal reason for accepting his Foreign Office work is to look for traces of his mother. Though he is never handed any documents that refer to her, Nathaniel begins breaking into the office and temporarily stealing files to try to learn more about her and her activities. He realises that one of the much higher up employees also attended his mother's funeral and that he is also a man named Marsh Felon, who his mother knew when they were both children and Felon's family worked for hers. Through a few sparse details from the files and in recollecting information given to him by his mother in the brief time they lived together in The Saints, Nathaniel tries to trace his mother's war work and her relationship with Felon and imagines that they were both friends and lovers. They had worked with partisans in Yugoslavia and it is the daughter of one of them who tracks down and kills his mother. Nathaniel also discovers that some of The Darter's so-called illicit activities were done in service to the war and post-war efforts. While digging in the archives he finds The Darter's real name, Norman Marshall, and a current address and goes to visit him. He is surprised to find The Darter married with a daughter though he does not meet either of them. Upon leaving he sees a piece of embroidery with a quote that Agnes loved and he realises that The Darter is married to Agnes and their child was likely fathered by Nathaniel. Despite entertaining a fantasy that he will one day run into his daughter, Nathaniel continues to live his mostly solitary life leaving Agnes and her family undisturbed.

An ethnographer who is later revealed to have been sent by their mother to look in on them. Interpretation Penelope Lively wrote in The New York Times that the \\"signature theme\\" of the novel is that “the past never remains in the past”, its \\"paramount subject matter\\" being that \\"the present reconstructs the past\\". As the title's term 'warlight' is thought to refer, literally, to the blackouts of World War II, Lively wrote that the novel's narrative is likewise \\"devious and opaque\\" and proceeds \\"by way of hints and revelations\\", that its characters are elusive and evasive, and that the novel has an \\"intricate and clever construction\\" requiring a close reading. As background, Alex Preston wrote in The Guardian that much of Ondaatje’s literary career has been driven by the perception that \\"memory is the construct of the older self looking back\\". Calling Ondaatje \\"a memory artist\\", Preston wrote that the author \\"summons images with an acuity that makes the reader experience them with the force of something familiar, intimate and truthful\\". A.S.H. Smyth wrote in The Spectator that Ondaatje is \\"at his best when writing about awkward, quiet types, and ‘those at a precarious tilt’, and characters, especially narrators, with dodgy memories\\", Smyth noting that the novel's narrator Nathaniel said that he \\"knows how to fill in a story from a grain of sand\\". Writing in The New Republic, Andrew Lanham noted the significance of Nathaniel's postwar job working for British Intelligence as a historian reviewing after-action reports, Lanham implying that the novel articulated the \\"need to probe the archives for what really happened: In our cultural memory of the wars of the past, only the rereading counts\\". In this context, Lanham wrote that Ondaatje’s literary career has echoed Nathaniel’s task, with several of Ondaatje's novels \\"circling around war and the challenge of remembering and recovering from war\\". On August 19, 2018, former U.S. President Barack Obama included Warlight in his summer reading list, describing the novel as \\"a meditation on the lingering effects of war on family\\". Critical response and reviews Warlight reached The New York Times Best Seller list within the month of its publication. In July 2018 Warlight was longlisted among thirteen novels for the Man Booker Prize. Penelope Lively wrote in The New York Times that Warlight is rich with detail, having meticulous background research that brings alive a time and a place, Lively summarizing the novel as \\"intricate and absorbing\\". Similarly, Robert Douglas- Fairhurst wrote in The Times that most of the novel's movements are \\"measured and catlike\\" with \\"writing that is prepared to take its time\\", concluding that Warlight is a novel of \\"shadowy brilliance\\". Anthony Domestico wrote in The Boston Globe that \\"Ondaatje’s is an aesthetic of the fragment\\", his novels \\"constructed, with intricate beauty, from images and scenes that don’t so much flow together as cling together in vibrating, tensile fashion. ... built more from juxtaposition and apposition than from clean narrative progression\\". Likewise crediting Warlight as \\"a series of sharply perceived images\\", Alex Preston wrote in The Guardian that the novel \\"sucked me in deeper than any novel I can remember; when I looked up from it, I was surprised to find the 21st century still going on about me.\\" Indicating that Warlight would not disappoint \\"lovers of intrigue, betrayal, war-torn cities and score-settling\\", A.S.H. Smyth described in The Spectator how the novel did not glorify war and concluded that \\"it’s hard not to think of Warlight as an adroit and unromantic B-side to (Ondaatje's 1992 novel) The English Patient.

The city government determined that it could not find a purpose for the 1913 section; therefore its razing occurred in 2012.

Early Career Braufman graduated from Boston’s Berklee College of Music where he met Cooper-Moore (then Gene Ashton) and other musicians who moved to New York City in 1973 and occupied a vacant building at 501 Canal Street in lower Manhattan.http://www.nycjazzrecord.com/issues/tnycjr201602.pdf The building, where the total rent came to $140 for four floors, became a hub for musicians to practice and perform and its occupants played a seminal role in New York City's early-seventies loft jazz scene. In 1974, Village Voice jazz critic Gary Giddins wrote a review of Braufman’s performance called \\"Taking Chances At 501 Canal,\\" stating “The fact is, these are the musicians who are taking the chances today and their gifts and commitment ought to be attended.” In 1975, Braufman's debut album Valley of Search was released on the India Navigation record label. The album was recorded live in the performance space at 501 Canal Street by Bob Cummins, the owner of India Navigation and was the label’s second release.

The Mueda Plateau lies between the Ruvuma River on the north, which forms the border with Tanzania, and the Messalo River on the south. It is named for the town of Mueda, the principal town on the plateau. The western edge of the plateau forms a steep escarpment, dropping to rolling plains. The plateau covers an area of 1715 square kilometers. It is gently undulating and densely wooded, with the trees Pteleopsis myrtifolia and Albizia gummifera predominant.Kingdon, Zachary (2013) A Host of Devils: The History and Context of the Making of Makonde Spirit Sculpture. Studies in Visual Culture, Routledge, 2013. , 9781136476662 The Makonde people inhabit the plateau and the adjacent lowlands. The Makonde Plateau, which lies immediately north of the Ruvuma River in Tanzania, is also inhabited by the Makonde. The name 'Makonde' is derived from the typical woodland thickets of the plateau. The soil is light and sandy but fertile, and the Makonde people on the plateau traditionally practiced a form of swidden agriculture with a three-crop rotation. Trees were cut down to stumps, which provide support for vine crops (beans, pumpkins, and cucumbers) followed by a maize crop, and then millet. At the end of the growing season, the tree stumps were allowed to re-grow for a six- to nine-year fallow period.

The film stars Ethan Hawke, Dane DeHaan, Jake Schur, Leila George, Chris Pratt, Adam Baldwin, and D'Onofrio, and centers around Rio Cutler who forms an unlikely alliance with local sheriff Pat Garrett and infamous outlaw Billy the Kid in a mission to rescue his sister Sara from Grant Cutler, the boy’s thuggish uncle and gang leader. The Kid was released in the United States on March 8, 2019, by Lionsgate Films.  Plot  Young Rio Cutler (Jake Schur) kills his drunk father one night in an unsuccessful attempt to save his mother from being beaten to death. His uncle Grant Cutler (Chris Pratt) hears the gunshot, enters the house, and furious over his brother's murder, he attacks the boy. Rio stabs him in the face with a shard of glass and he and his sister Sara (Leila George) escape. She steals a horse and they take shelter in an abandoned shack; they intend to meet their mother's friend in Santa Fe. When they wake, they are greeted by Billy the Kid (Dane DeHaan) and his gang. Rio shows a picture of his mother to Billy, who reveals that he too killed his father in defense of his mother. When one of the gang goes outside to check on the horses, he his shot by Sheriff Pat Garrett (Ethan Hawke) and the posse who have the gang trapped in the shack. A gunfight ensues, and Garrett's posse takes the gang prisoner. Sara warns Rio not to go outside, fearing he will be hanged if he reveals he killed their father. Seeing this as a chance to get safely to Santa Fe, Rio runs outside anyway. Garrett begins to question Rio and Sara; they tell him that their mother died and while traveling to Sante Fe, they were separated from their father. Garrett seems suspicious, but takes them along. The posse stops at a Mexican ranch where Billy sees his lover and promises to return. While Billy antagonizes Garrett during dinner, Rio slips him some butter to escape from his wrist shackles and Billy threatens to kill a deputy, if not set free. Garrett produces a gun and threatens to shoot gang member Dave Rudabaugh, who Billy is still shackled to at the ankle. With no escape possible, the situation is defused. Later, Garrett tells Rio about the first man he killed and asks him if he has anything he wants to tell him, but Rio says no. When they reach Santa Fe, Sheriff Romero (Vincent D'Onofrio) insists on taking Billy into custody along with Dave. Sensing hostility, Garrett commandeers a stagecoach, and amidst an armed standoff, he leaves with Billy for Lincoln County, where Billy can stand trial. Rio and Sara slip away during the trouble and find their mother's friend in a dance hall, but Grant and his gang ambush them. He tells them their mother was a whore, and for killing his brother he's taking Sara as his whore. He turns Rio out on the street and takes Sara. Rio sees Dave about to be hanged and Dave informs Rio that Billy is also about to be hanged in Lincoln and gives him a letter from Billy, which claims he knows where Sara was taken. Rio steals a horse, gets a gun, rides to Lincoln and goes to the jail to visit Billy, but a deputy turns him away. To get into the jail, Rio half-heartedly robs a bank and is shot by another deputy. In jail, Billy plots to escape and offers to bring Rio. Garrett once again asks Rio if he has anything to tell him, again he says no, and Garrett leaves town. Billy puts his plan in motion. He escapes by attacking his guard during a trip to the outhouse; when the guard runs, BIlly shoots him. He gets the keys to his shackles and frees Rio. They steal a horse and head to the Mexican ranch; Billy promises to help find Sara, but once at the ranch, Billy finds his lover is pregnant and ignores Rio's plea for help. Garrett catches up with Billy at the ranch and kills him. Realizing Billy could not have helped him, Rio tells Garrett the truth about his father and his sister. They go to the whorehouse in Puerto de Luna and Rio looks for Sara while Garrett encounters Grant. Grant tells Garrett about a time he saw his brother engaging in incest; when he told his father, he was beaten harshly and told to keep his mouth shut. Rio emerges with Sara and Grant takes Rio hostage during a skirmish that includes gunfire and Sara shooting one of the men that raped her from her uncle's gang. Garrett chases Grant outside, where Grant threatens to kill Rio if he isn't let go. Garrett tells Grant that witnesses will attest to how he ran off from Pat Garrett like a coward. Grant says that's not true, but Garrett says it doesn't matter what's true, it matters the story they tell when you're gone. Garrett challenges Grant to a fair gunfight, which he accepts, and tosses Rio aside. Sara emerges from the saloon suddenly, distracting Garrett. Grant makes his move, but Rio shoots him in the head. Before Garrett leaves town, he tells the siblings they have good in them and plenty of life to put to good use. As Sara and Rio ride off, Rio encourages Sara to remember what she once said to him, that it ain't wrong being afraid, you have to keep trying and keep moving until you find some goodness in life.

The lineup originally consisted of Dayeon, Terry, Baekah, May, and Iaan, and they released their debut mini-album Moonlight on June 27, 2018. Terry left the group the following January and was replaced by Dohee. NeonPunch released their second and final mini-album Watch Out January 30, 2019, and disbanded on August 11, 2020. History 2017–2018: Formation and debut On February 7, 2017, A100 Entertainment announced that they would be doing their first girl group project via their YouTube channel and started uploading covers of the group. There was a various number of members throughout the project that were always masked and kept their identities a secret while they did the covers. The number of members changed until only five members remained and they formed the final line-up. On October 2, A100 announced that their girl group will be named NeonPunch and introduced the members through a teaser for their pre-debut reality show. The members were Dayeon, Hajeong, Baekah, Arang, and Iaan. NeonPunch auditioned for JTBC's reality show, Mix Nine, but only Baekah passed the audition stage and made it onto the show. On April 13, 2018, A100 announced that NeonPunch would be the new model for Beauty brand DPC. The members of the group were Baekah, Dayeon, and Iaan with new members May and Terry. The group was stated to debut at the end of May. On May 8, A100 announced that the debut was postponed to June, and the five members Baekah, Dayeon, Iaan, May and Terry were confirmed as the final members of NeonPunch. NeonPunch performing \\"Moonlight\\" in June 2018; from left: Terry, Iaan, Dayeon, May, Baekah On June 27, 2018, NeonPunch released their first single album, Moonlight, along with the eponymous lead single. On June 30, they made their official debut stage on the music program MBC's Show! Music Core. On October 4, A100 announced that Terry had taken a break for personal reasons and had not explained anything further. 2019–2020: Watch Out and disbandment On January 16, 2019, A100 had revealed that Terry would permanently leave the group for health reasons. In her stead, new member Dohee joined the group prior to the group's January comeback. On January 30, NeonPunch released their second mini album Watch Out and its lead single \\"Tic Toc\\". On August 11, 2020, A100 Entertainment announced that NeonPunch had disbanded, due in part to the label's financial hardships exasperated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Shortly after, it was announced by the label that Dayeon, Baekah, and Iaan would be debuting as a trio named XUM on August 25. The debut was delayed to September 24, after one of their staff members had come into contact with someone who had COVID-19.

It has a single tubular, shiny dark green leaf and up to twenty five scented, greenish to brownish and white flowers. It is only known from two populations on the Northern Tablelands. Description Prasophyllum graniticola is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single shiny, dark green, tube-shaped leaf, long and wide with a purplish base. Between ten and twenty five flowers are crowded along a flowering spike long, reaching to a height of up to . The flowers are sweetly scented and greenish to brownish. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is egg- shaped to lance-shaped, long, about wide and has three to five darker veins and a pointed tip. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, long, about wide and spread widely apart from each other. The petals are white with a red central line, linear to narrow spatula-shaped long and about wide. The labellum is white, oblong to lance-shaped, long, about wide and turns sharply upwards through more than 90°. There is an egg-shaped to wedge-shaped yellow callus with a dark green base in the centre of the labellum and extending well past the bend. Flowering occurs between late November and late December. Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum graniticola was first formally described in 2018 by David Jones and Lachlan Copeland from a specimen collected near Ebor and the description was published in Australian Orchid Review. The specific epithet (graniticola) is derived from the Latin word granum meaning \\"granite\\" (amongst other meanings) and the suffix -cola meaning \\"dweller\\", referring to the habitat preference of this species, compared to the basaltic soils preferred by the similar P. basalticum.

It is also known as Bond and Free Store. It now operates as the Albert Kersten Mining and Minerals Museum. The property is owned by the Broken Hill City Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  In 1893 the Bond and Free Store was constructed for the South Australian Brewery Company. The store probably supplied miners and service industries with tools, commodities and ale. The building remained in the possession of the South Australian Brewery Company until 1923 when Seppelts & Son took over the building for a wine vinegar manufacture, storage and bottling store.Tropman, Conservation Plan Report, 27 June 1984 In 1850 Joseph Ernest Seppelt, his wife and three children, a group of skilled and semi-skilled employees and thirteen families arrived from Wustewaltersdorf in Silesia where Seppelt had had a family business distilling and compounding various liqueurs and cordials and making snuff. The near famine conditions of the \\"Hungry Forties\\" in many parts of Europe had led to a great deal of unrest and migration and with the decline of his business Seppelt and his sizeable staff migrated to South Australia. Seppelt ultimately moved to the township of Tanunda along with the women and children of the Silesian migrants. The men themselves went to Seppeltsfield four miles away in the country and returned to Tanunda for weekends. After experimenting with tobacco Seppelt planted corn and a small vineyard and constructed a storage cellar for wine. In 1924 Seppelt purchased the Bond and Free Store from the South Australian Brewery Company. Seppelt died in 1868 and his son Benno took up the work left unfinished by his father. By the 1960s the Seppelt Company owned 5,500 acres of land in South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. The Bond and Free Store was sold by the Seppelts in 1979. In 1979 representations were made to the Heritage Council by the Broken Hill Historical Society expressing concern that the building was in danger of demolition and requesting protection under the Heritage Act. After discussions with the owner an Interim Conservation Order was placed over the building on 16 November 1979. In 1981 Broken Hill Council wrote to the Heritage Council expressing concern for the future of the building as it was receiving no maintenance. On account of its heritage significance and the opportunity for sympathetic re-use, the Heritage Council recommended to the Minister that a Permanent Conservation Order be made. As the Interim Conservation Order had expired another Interim Conservation Order was placed on 8 April 1982. An objection to the Order was made by the owner of the property. Subsequently, under section 41 of the Heritage Act a Commission of Inquiry was held. The Commissioner in 1982 recommended that the Permanent Conservation Order be made and to consider the provision of funding to the owner to enable essential repairs. A Permanent Conservation Order was placed over the property on 30 July 1982. In 1984 Broken Hill Council purchased the property. In 1984 through the Heritage Assistance Program a grant was made available for the use of conservation architects. A further grant was made available for the restoration of the building. Heritage Council approval was securing the roof, cleaning and regrouting walls, repair of windows and fire- rating underside of timber floor. It was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. In 2018, it houses the Albert Kersten Mining and Minerals Museum.  Description  Side view of warehouses Seppelts Warehouse is a tall single storey building plus basement. It is constructed of brick and rubble stone masonry walls with a galvanised corrugated iron roof and a timber ground floor. The basement floor is of earth. The masonry walls and especially the parapets and gables are an excellent example of decorative brickwork for that period. It appears that the bricks were made locally and the stone - gneiss - was gathered from the local area.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Broken Hill was first established in 1883 and this building was one of the first warehouses to be erected within the area.

It is a shrub or small tree to about 6–8 m tall, native around the Mediterranean Sea from Portugal to Lebanon and Syria in the north and from the Canary Islands to Tunisia in the south. Salix canariensis may be treated as a subspecies of S. pedicellata. Description Salix pedicellata is very variable in appearance. It forms a shrub or small tree up to 6–8 m tall. Its trunk may be up to 1.4 m, but is usually shorter. Its twigs are dark brown, initially with short hairs (tomentose), later smooth (glabrous). If the bark is removed from a twig, prominent longitudinal ridges or lines are visible. The leaves are more-or-less oblong, 4–16 cm long and 1–5 cm wide. The upper surface of the leaf is green, the lower greyish with prominent veins. S. pedicellata flowers in early Spring – February to April in its native habitat. The male catkins are usually densely packed with flowers and are 2–4 cm long. The female catkins are less dense, usually revealing the stem, and slightly longer at 5–8 cm. Both male and female flowers have a single nectary. The seeds are black to olive in colour, cylindrical, about 1.25 mm long and 0.5 mm wide. Taxonomy Salix pedicellata was first described by René Desfontaines in 1799. Salix canariensis is treated by some taxonomists as a subspecies of S. pedicellata, under the name S. pedicellata subsp. canariensis, so that the species S. pedicellata becomes S. pedicellata subsp. pedicellata. It hybridizes with Salix atrocinerea. Distribution Salix pedicellata subsp. pedicellata is native to some of the countries around the Mediterranean, in Europe (Portugal, Spain, Sicily, mainland Greece, Crete, doubtfully mainland Italy), western North Africa (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia) and Western Asia (the East Aegean Islands, Turkey and Lebanon-Syria). It has been introduced to Ethiopia. Salix pedicellata subsp. canariensis is native to Madeira and the Canary Islands.

It has also been known as the Broken Hill Coffee Palace, Mario's Hotel and Marios. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The hotel was originally built as a Temperance movement coffee palace, the Broken Hill Coffee Palace. It was designed by Melbourne architect Alfred Dunn and built in 1889 at a cost of £12,190, opening on 18 December that year. The coffee palace was not a financial success, running at a loss for its first three years, and by July 1892 media reports indicated the company and lessees were \\"stone broke\\". In that month, the lessee applied for and was granted a liquor license, at which time it was renamed the Palace Hotel. Owner Mario Celotto painted a mural of Botticelli's Venus on a ceiling. This led to many more murals being painted both by Celotto and other artists, making the hotel a tourist attraction. The 1994 Australian comedy-drama film, The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, filmed many of its Broken Hill scenes in the Palace Hotel, which producer Al Clark described as \\"drag queen heaven\\". The movie describes the hotel's murals as \\"tack-o-rama\\". Description  Heritage listing  Palace Hotel was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Her reputation for purity ended when she set up home with James Cuffe who was the member of parliament for Mayo and had an estranged wife, Mary. They had two sons including James who became an MP. Her partner's wife died in 1808 and Wewitzer adopted her title of \\"Lady Tyrawley\\" as Cuffe had been promoted to Baron Tyrawley in 1797. Wewitzer died on 4 October 1820 at Ballinrobe.

As of 2018 it is an ongoing research project lead by researchers at ETH Zurich and, among other Future Internet proposals, is being explored in the Internet Engineering Task Force research group for path-aware networking.  Goals  * Availability in the presence of distributed adversaries: As long as an attacker-free path between endpoints exists, it should be discovered and utilized with guaranteed bandwidth. * Transparency and Control: Separation of control and data planes by encoding paths as packet-carried forwarding state (PCFS) in the packet header, as well as enabling of multipath communication for enhanced availability David G. Andersen, Hari Balakrishnan, M. Frans Kaashoek, and Robert Morris. Resilient overlay networks. In Proceedings of ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP), October 2001. Pages 9, 24, and 192. and defense against network attacks. * Efficiency, Scalability, and Extensibility: Packet forwarding is at least efficient in latency and throughput as current IP in common cases and more scalable with respect to BGP and the size of routing tables. Achieved by storing state in packet headers and protecting them cryptographically, using modern block ciphers such as AES that can be computed very efficiently (within 10ns on a modern CPU Kahraman Akdemir, Martin Dixon, Wajdi Feghali, Patrick Fay, Vinodh Gopal, Jim Guilford, Erdinc Ozturk, Gil Wolrich, and Ronen Zohar. Breakthrough AES performance with Intel AES New Instructions. White paper, June, 2010.

Global authentication in an untrustworthy world. In Proceedings of Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems (HotOS), May 2013. Page 10. and utilizing trust agility Moxie Marlinspike. SSL and the future of authenticity. https://moxie.org/blog/ssl-and-the-future-of-authenticity/, Apr 2011. Page 10. so each end host or user can know the complete set of trust roots for the validation of a certificate. *Deployability: Deployment should only require installation or upgrade of a few border routers, thus requiring minimal added complexity to the existing infrastructure. In addition, it should not disrupt current Internet topology and business models/relationships (e.g., should still support peering).  Isolation domains and autonomous systems  SCION introduces the concept of an isolation domain (ISD) which is a logical grouping of autonomous systems (ASes), administered by a smaller subset of the ASes that constitute the ISD core. The ISD is governed by a policy, called the trust root configuration (TRC), which is negotiated by the ISD core and defines the roots of trust that are used to validate bindings between names and public keys or addresses. ASes within an ISD can be connected by core links, customer-provider links, or peering links, representative of the relationship between the ASes. Within an AS there are several services such as: * Beacon Servers - responsible for beaconing which is a process to generate, receive, and propagate messages called path-segment construction beacons (PCBs) to construct path segments and explore routing paths. * Path Servers - storage for mappings of AS to path that were discovered during beaconing. * Name Servers - perform name translation similar to DNS by using RAINS to retrieve (ISD, AS) tuple that can be used to find and construct end- to-end paths. * Certificate Servers - cache for copies of TRCs retrieved from the ISD core, AS certificates, and key management for securing inter-AS communication. * Border Routers - used for SCION packet forwarding to the next SCION border router or to the destination host within the destination AS.  Control plane  The control plane is responsible for discovering networking paths and making those paths available to end hosts. Inter-domain beaconing connects ISDs by enabling core ASes to learn paths to other core ASes while intra-domain beaconing allows non-core ASes to learn path segments to core ASes. The SCION control plane operates at the AS level, while communication within an AS is governed by existing intra-domain communication technologies and protocols (e.g. OSPF, SDN, MPLS). To reach a remote destination, a host performs a path lookup at its local path server to obtain up-segments (from source AS to the core), down segments (from core AS to destination AS), and core segments (between core ASes) in the case these up and down segments end at different core ASes. Paths can be combined as desired, possibly using peering links where available.  Data plane  A SCION packet minimally contains a path and the data plane ensures packet forwarding using the provided paths. Forwarding utilizes a split of locator (AS-level path) and identifier (the destination address), like in the Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP) Dino Farinacci, Vince Fuller, David Meyer, and Darrel Lewis. The locator/ID separation protocol (LISP). RFC 6830, January 2013. Page 25.. As a result, SCION border routers forward packets based on the AS-level path in the packet header without inspecting the destination address and also without consulting an inter-domain routing table. The destination address can have any format that the destination AS can interpret because only the border router at the destination AS needs to inspect the destination address to forward it to the appropriate local host. The destination can respond to the source by inverting the end-to-end path from the packet header, or it can perform its own path lookup and path-segment construction.  Security  Similar to BGPsec, each AS signs the PCBs it forwards. This signature enables PCB validation by all entities. To ensure path correctness, the forwarding information within each packet is also cryptographically protected. Each AS uses a secret symmetric key that is shared among beacon servers and border routers and is used to efficiently compute a message authentication code (MAC) over the forwarding information. The per-AS information includes the ingress and egress interfaces, an expiration time, and the MAC computed over these fields, which is (by default) all encoded within an 8-byte field referred to as a hop field (HF).  Deployment and commercial operations  SCION is running on a number of nodes around the world. \\"In 2017, several internet service providers and financial institutions in Switzerland wanted to use SCION for their commercial operations. And so Adrian Perrig founded the spin-off Anapaya Systems together with David Basin and Peter Müller, fellow professors at the Department of Computer Science at ETH Zurich.\\" The first ISPs to use SCION are Swisscom and SWITCH. Several corporations have obtained SCION network connections through these ISPs to the corporate SCION network. Among the first customer deployments are SNB, ZKB and SIX from the Swiss financial sector.

The film was directed by Dave Tynan. Plot Jason is a wannabe DJ in Dublin who is addicted to drugs. He later meets his brother Daniel, an educated homeless heroin addict. The two brothers reconnect during a weekend. Jason continually runs into his double, who has his phone. He attempts to connect with this seemingly secondary self, but is consistently thwarted in his efforts. At the end of the play, time doubles back on itself, and Jason seems to be reliving the day again. Play The play premiered in 2014. Both Kirwan and Anderson prefer acting on stage than acting in a film. It won the Best Fringe Performers Award at the Tiger Dublin Fringe Festival. The play was shown at the Project Arts Centre twice. The stage version was characterized by a highly physical stage presence, an almost complete lack of set, and the use of lighting to denote changes in space and time. Paul Taylor, writing for The Independent gave a positive review of its 2017 run at the National Theatre in London saying, \\"Emmet Kirwan's two-hander, starring himself as Jason, a wannabe DJ and Ian Lloyd Anderson, as his long-lost drug addict brother, is highly charged theatre.\\" Michael Billington of The Guardian gave a negative review of the same run at the National Theatre saying, \\"If Kirwan can harness his verbal power, he may yet write a play that offers more than a sensory impression.\\" Film The film was released on 29 June 2018 in Ireland theatres.https://www.screenireland.ie/news/dublin-oldschool-released- in-irish-cinemas-on-29-june The play's writer, Emmet Kirwan, plays the role of Jason and Ian Lloyd Anderson plays the role of Daniel. It is directed by Dave Tynan. The film expands on the two character play with added characters including Sarah Greene as Jason's friend Lisa and Seana Kerslake as Jason's former girlfriend. Kirwan stated he hopes that the film will foster awareness of the homeless and drug addicts. Screen Ireland and Windmill Lane Pictures helped with the production. The film was released on DVD and on demand on 9 November 2018 in Ireland and on 11 November 2018 in the United Kingdom. Paul Whitington of the Irish Independent gave the film a negative review that states, \\"Tynan's film is laden down with aimless chatter, and its plot meanders drearily towards a country rave that seems curiously old-fashioned, and feels like a piece of Dublin's past, not its present.\\" References Category:2015 plays Category:2010s comedy-drama films Category:Films about drugs Category:Films about heroin addiction Category:Films set in Dublin (city) Category:Irish comedy-drama films Category:Irish plays Category:Theatre about drugs ","title":"Dublin Oldschool"},{"id":"57760544","text":"Alfred Oppenheim may refer to: * Alfred Oppenheim (chemist) (1878–1943), German chemist and gas mantle manufacturer * Alfred Oppenheim (artist) (1873–1953), German artist * Alfred Freiherr von Oppenheim (1934–2005), known in America as Alfred Oppenheim, German billionaire and banker ","title":"Alfred Oppenheim"},{"id":"57760568","text":"The 1977 Special Honours in New Zealand was a Special Honours List, published on 1 November 1977, that recognised the service of the outgoing vice-regal couple, Sir Denis and Lady Blundell.

Olds House, also known as the Albert Read House, is a single family home located at 10084 Rushton Road in Rushton, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. History Alonzo W. Olds emigrated from New York state to Michigan in 1833, where he purchased 40 acres of farmland. In 1835, he purchased an additional 80 acres, including the site of this house. He built this Greek Revival home in 1848-49. William Read died in 1888, passing the house and farm on to his wife Mary. When she died in 1900, their son Albert purchased the farm. He farmed the land until his death, when it was passed on to his son, Albert Jr. He farmed the land until his death in 1975, after which his wife Harriet lived in the house. In the early 1980s, much of the farmland was used to develop the Centennial Farms Adult Community. Harriet Read continued to live in the house until her own death in 1992. Description The Alonzo W. Olds House is a handsome, classical Greek Revival house, formally composed with a narrow two-story central section fronted with a tetra-style Ionic portico, and symmetric one-story wings with hipped roofs to each side. It is a frame house, with flush siding under the portico and clapboard covering the rest of the building. The portico is supported with fluted columns, and the main cornice and the cornice over the entrance have a dentil course; the architrave of the portico and the wings have similar dentilation. The corner boards on the wings are wide to match the portico. The wings were once topped with symmetrical parapets, but these were removed in the early 1920s. The original wood shingles on the roof were replaced with asphalt roofing after a fire on the roof in 1939 or 1940. A kitchen and family room wing has been added to the rear of the house, as well as a garage.

The development opened in stages between 2018 and 2019 at a cost of US$2.6 billion. First founded in 1910, the site was originally known as Holt's Wharf. The development includes K11 Musea, a major shopping centre; serviced apartments, office space, and a hotel. The development is home to a 284-metre skyscraper designed by architectural firm Kohn Pederson Fox; it is currently the 8th-tallest building in Hong Kong. Background and history The site was originally set up in 1910 as Holt's Wharf. Located in Tsim Sha Tsui (Kowloon, Hong Kong), it first acted as a railway hub and was once considered one of the major world ports. In 1971, the site was sold to New World Development, who developed the area during the 1970s commencing the construction of the New World Centre and the Regent Hong Kong (later named InterContinental Hong Kong). The project was completed in 1982, also including a shopping complex, residential, offices and apartments. The New World Centre was considered one of the largest commercial complexes in the world during this time. The site became popular amongst locals and tourists, and hosted numerous major events including the LEGO International Exhibition and Hong Kong-Beijing Rally. In 2010, New World Development closed the New World Centre for demolition. In 2012, it started the development of the Victoria Dockside, which was named after the Victoria Harbour as well as the site’s former name, ‘’Holt’s Wharf’’. The project is led by Adrian Cheng, and includes participation of over a hundred international and local architects and designers. The district was completed in 2019 and includes Rosewood Hotel and residences. Design and architecture The building's site plan was carried out by architectural firm Kohn Pederson Fox (KPF), as well as architect James Corner Field Operations, Ronald Lu & Partners, LAAB Architects, and PLandscape.  Components   K11 Musea (shopping centre) K11 MUSEA Opera Theatre K11 Musea (self styled as K11 MUSEA) is a retail and arts complex located in the Tsim Sha Tsui promenade front within the Victoria Dockside development, Hong Kong.

K11 Musea’s name is said to derive from “A Muse by the Sea”. The complex will include a public art collection and is set to be completed by 2019. The project aims to foment art, culture, and design in Hong Kong. The K11 Musea building consists of ten floors and an outdoor plaza. The project's design architects include James Corner (James Corner Field Operations), Forth Bagley (Kohn Pederson Fox), and LAAB Architects. The outdoor plaza is a 2,000 square-feet sunken plaza modelled as an amphitheater. The architecture also includes 50,000 square feet of green walls. The developer claims certifications of the U.S. LEED (gold standard) and the Hong Kong BEAM Plus (gold standard). There is further claim that the development will include rainwater harvesting and that interior parts of the building will be made in part of natural limestone and wood. Also featured is the multi-storey Donut Playhouse filled with family-friendly edutainment and shops.

In Italy, direct elections were held in 720 comuni: in each comune were chosen mayor and members of the City Council. Of the 783 comuni, 21 were capoluoghi and only 112 had a population higher than 15,000 inhabitants (10,000 for Sicily).Elezioni comunali – I comuni al voto In Friuli-Venezia Giulia the elections were held on 29 April with a second ballot on 13 May; while in Aosta Valley they were held on 20 May, and in Trentino Alto-Adige on 27 May. Voting System All mayoral elections in Italy in cities with a population higher than 15,000 use the same voting system. Under this system voters express a direct choice for the mayor or an indirect choice voting for the party of the candidate's coalition. If no candidate receives at least 50% of votes, the top two candidates go to a second round after two weeks. This gives a result whereby the winning candidate may be able to claim majority support, although it is not guaranteed. The election of the City Council is based on a direct choice for the candidate with a preference vote: the candidate with the majority of the preferences is elected. The number of the seats for each party is determined proportionally.

The film was released on 6 July 2018 on Netflix.  Plot  The film opens with an unspecified year but is probably around WWII, as the rifle he carries appears to be a German KAR98, which was introduced in 1935 as the standard German infantry rifle. It is possible he could have obtained it during the Spanish Civil War, ca. 1936 to 1939, but it would have been a German frontline weapon at that time. The local townspeople do not appear to have all the modern comforts of the era with exception of electricity. The main character Martinon is a huntsman who lives a life of solitude completely without modern day comforts high on a mountain top in an abandoned town, which appears to have been ravaged by war. Martinon's life is that of \\"hard-living\\". The terrain near Martinon's home is rocky with steep hills, which are surrounded by a dense forest filled with wildlife. Martinon's daily routine consists of maintaining the land in front of his house, tending to his goats and hunting for wolves so that he can trade their skins. All this is done through the harsh bitter cold mountain weather. Martinon's physical appearance, tall and muscular with shaggy hair and a bushy beard, intimidates those he encounters. Occasionally, Martinon makes the two day journey down the mountain to the local town to sell the wolf skins he harvested. During a visit to the local town, inside a bar Martinon is attempting to sell some newly caught wolf skins to the mayor, who haggles with him over the price and authenticity of the skins. Afterwards, Martinon discusses the exchange with the bar owner Severino. Severino suggests to Martinon that he should consider marriage and starting a family to pass on his property as his legacy. Martinon considers the suggestion but points out that the conditions of his life in the mountains are no place for children or a wife. On his way out of town Martinon has sex with a local woman, Pascuala, and considers her to be a suitable wife. Martinon makes a deal with Pascuala's father, Ubaldo. Martinon leaves town with Pascuala as his wife. Pascuala adapts to her new home life with ease, but begins showing signs of an unknown illness through consistent coughing. Pascuala also tells Martinon that she is pregnant. Martinon shows no verbal or facial expressions on how he feels about the pregnancy, but begins to create a baby crib. Pascuala's illness worsens, resulting with a difficult pregnancy. Bedridden Pasculua dies while giving birth to a stillborn baby boy, while Martinon is tending to the goats. Visibly saddened and frustrated because of the deaths of his wife and son, Martinon breaks the baby crib he created. While attempting to bury their bodies, Martinon burst into a fit of anger and begins knocking down the headstones on the older surrounding graves of the graveyard. Martinon brings the bodies of his wife and the baby boy to Ubaldo, and accuses him of knowing that Pasculua was sick and pregnant with someone else's child upon joining him. Ubaldo concedes to the accusations, stating that he was afraid that Pascuala's reputation would be ruined. He'd hoped that once Pascuala had her baby, people would believe that Martinon was the father, since they were living together. Martinon berates Ubaldo for not being a good father and demands his money back. Ulbaldo begs Martinon for time to collect the money. Martinon gives him until the next spring to pay. When Martinon goes back to Ubaldo to collect his money, rifle in hand, Ubaldo instead of money offers his youngest daughter, Adela, to Martinon. He says Adela will join him, provided that he marry her. Martinon accepts Adela and the next day they are married. After the wedding, Ubaldo apologizes to Adela for the impromptu marriage. He pleads with Adela not to run away, but instead to attempt to adapt to the situation, because should she run away, Martinon would look for her and also come after Ubaldo. Here father then gives Adela a red cloth, later revealed to contain herbs, telling her to use it should her situation become unbearable. Adela leaves with Martinon on the journey back to the top of the mountain. The walk is strenuous for Adela, causing Martinon to stop repeatedly to give her water. Adela does not adapt to her new life, which features brutal sex forced upon her and a complete lack of human connection with Martinon, who regards her as a piece of property. One day Martinon informs Adela that he will be gone for trading for four days. Martinon warns Adela to be careful of the wild life in the forest, should she venture outside the abandoned town. While alone for four days, Adela inspects the ruined buildings of the abandoned town and the nearby cemetery, where she notices two open graves. Upon Martinon's return, Adela asks for whom they were intended. Martinon replies that \\"they're not graves, just holes\\". This response upsets Adela and she begins to walk away when Martinon tells her that Pascuala's death was her father's fault because Ubaldo traded Pascuala knowing she was sick and pregnant. Martinon also tells Adela that Ubaldo did the same trade with her. Adela calls Martinon a liar and walks away. Later Martinon observes Adela staring tearfully out into the distance. While looking at herself in the mirror Adela realizes she is pregnant. Though Martinon shows no verbal or facial reaction, he prepares a baby crib and makes breakfast for Adela in the mornings. Martinon also begins to reduce any strenuous activities for Adela. One day while cleaning a wolf skin, Adela becomes frustrated, and resolves to poison Martinon's food with the herbs her father gave her. Martinon unknowingly eats the poisoned foods and soon becomes sick, vomiting daily. Adela appears pleased with herself and decides to run away while Martinon is out hunting. While running down the mountain Adela steps on one of the traps set by Martinon, preventing her from properly running and walking. When Martinon returns home to find Adela gone he immediately searches the ruined buildings of the town. The next morning he follows Adela's tracks and discovers her passed out under some fallen trees. Martinon takes Adela home to nurse her back to health. While wrapping the unconscious Adela's frost bitten feet Martinon observes Adela having a miscarriage. Adela becomes strong enough to walk around the house. Adela sorrowfully tells Martinon that she lost the baby. Martinon is quiet, as he is already aware. Martinon tells Adela that once she fully recovers, she can return to her family. When Adela asks why, Martinon only replies that the days are shorter so she'll have to leave early. Adela shows a mix of happiness and remorsefulness while standing outside alone, and she eventually leaves. Martinon is left alone in his home. He soon discovers Adela's hidden canister of poisonous herbs. Martinon stands outside silently crying to himself while staring out into the distance. The film ends with Martinon in bed looking up at the ceiling alone in his house while the darkness settles around him, with his rifle by his side. As the scene pulls away, the door to Martinon's house has been left wide open to a cold snowy evening  Cast  * Mario Casas as Martinón * Irene Escolar as Adela * Ruth Díaz as Pascuala * Kandido Uranga as Severino * Josean Bengoetxea as Marcial * Armando Aguirre as Ubaldo (voice) * Ainhoa Sánchez as Nora * Patricia Cid as Marina * Francisco Domínguez as Don Bernardo * Alfonso Giménez as Ayudante Alcalde * Laura Cuellar as Fátima * Gustavo Sánchez as Herrero  Production  The film is writer/director Samu Fuentes' debut feature.

She is particularly well known in her role with Mary Anderson, of forcing a change in Irish law to enable women to serve on juries. Activism A leading Sinn Féin and Official Sinn Féin member (General Secretary for 11 years), de Burca was a founding member of the Irish Women's Liberation Movement in 1970. She was also a member of the Dublin Housing Action Committee, formed in May 1967, the Irish Voice on Vietnam, the Irish Anti-Apartheid movement, the Prisoner's Rights Organisation and Right to Die Ireland. As an activist she has been jailed for 3 months (for her anti-Vietnam War activities where she took down the flag and burnt it) and fined (for her attacks on Richard Nixon's car during a visit to Ireland) during 1970. In 1971 the Contraceptive Train was organised by the Irish Women's Liberation Movement. This was a train to Northern Ireland so that women could buy contraceptives and openly bring them back to the Republic. This subject was delicate and de Burca made the active decision not to go as she feared the reaction because she was not married at the time. She has been involved in a legal case which changed Irish law and Ireland. The two litigants were represented in court by Mary Robinson and Donal Barrington. That case allowed for the Juries Act 1976 which now allows any Irish citizen aged 18 or over who is registered to vote in general elections to be involved in a jury. Despite her activism, de Burca is considered a militant pacifist. In 2017 de Burca was awarded the Honorary degree of Doctor of Law by University College Dublin.

With \\"Die Seele\\" Geyser aims to clarify the specific processes of the soul and its relation to our consciousness and body thereby discussing the Mind–body problem and different positions such as Materialism or parallelism. Finally, Geyser concludes with an interactionist position (\\"Wechselwirkung\\") between mind and body.  Historical context  (1869–1948) received his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Bonn in 1898. Later he was teaching in Münster (1904), Freiburg (1917) and Munich (1924). As a supporter of the philosophia perennis he aims at answering questions in an objective, critical and realistic manner while being independent of the temporary situation: At the time, the pressing question as formulated in Psychological Bulletin at the beginning of 1914 was: \\"Is psychology purely a study of behaviour, or is it solely a study of mental states and processes, or does its problem lead to research in both fields?\\" In Die Seele (1914) Geyser himself claims to fit the Zeitgeist of philosophy and psychology at the beginning of the 20th century to focus not on basic but higher conscious processes. His work is written and published at a time where psychology was in its early shoes. On the one hand, the first experimental psychology lab in Leipzig, Germany has been opened in 1879 by Wilhelm Wundt. During the period of 1970–1914 in Germany and America, psychology has been transformed into an experimental psychology. In this period many mental phenomena started to be investigated in an empirical fashion. Especially visual and spatial perception has been a centre of attention with phenomena such as binocular stereopsis (3D and depth perception) and colour blindness. These developments slowly replaced more traditional associationist psychology which regarded psychology as a science of purely mental phenomena. On the other hand, in parallel to the experimental movement, Sigmund Freud and his publications in psychoanalysis entered the field of psychology. Wundt is seen as a representative of a dual psychology, i.e. dealing with an \\"experimental psychology of elementary psychic phenomena\\", as seen in Wundt's physiological psychology and a \\"non-experimental psychology of higher psychic phenomena\\" as seen in Wundt's nonexperimental \\"ethnopsychology\\" (\\"Völkerpsychologie\\"). In Germany as well as in the United States, the \\"new psychology\\" in contrast to the old, metaphysical psychology, emerged, usually dated as by 1914. This development is also reflected by James Watson's publication of Psychology as the Behaviorist Views it, marking the beginning of Behaviourism. One year prior to Die Seele by Geyser, 1913, this work formulates the behaviourist viewpoint from which the discipline of psychology is seen as a purely objective experimental branch of natural science, disregarding introspection and the study of consciousness. Geyser, combining empirical psychology and philosophical psychology, appreciated experimental results and the Würzburg School. Oswald Külpe, former student of Wundt, associated with the Würzburg School, extended under criticism of Wundt experimental psychology to higher cognitive and mental processes. Geyser's work is influenced by the dual psychology of Wilhelm Wundt which in contrast to the emerging behaviourism does not completely disregard the metaphysical aspects of consciousness, Oswald Külpe and the Würzburg School. While Wundt supports the psychophysical parallelism, stating that mental and physical phenomena form two distinct, parallel existing realms, Geyser closes Die Seele with a more interactionist position of the mind-body problem.  Influence on \\"Die Seele\\"  With Die Seele (1914) Geyser himself says to fit the Zeitgeist of philosophy and psychology at the beginning of the 20th century to focus not on basic but higher conscious processes and examines the role of our soul and consciousness as he describes it in his preamble. As Geyser further points out, Metaphysics is inevitable in the question of consciousness, but influenced by Wilhelm Wundt and Experimental psychology the has the opinion to limit metaphysics to an amount only necessary for the human logical need to understand. Further Geyser's work complies with Oswald Külpe's (doctoral student and assistant of Wundt) urge to not completely separate psychology and philosophy since they mutually depend on each other. Die Seele is one of Geyser's earlier and more unknown works and is described as an outsourced summary of the specific parts about the soul of the earlier work \\"Lehrbuch der allgemeinen Psychologie\\" (1912). This work integrates into the research interest of the time to clarify general philosophical and psychological concepts as can be seen in contemporary works such as Natorps \\"Allgemeine Psychologie nach kritischer Methode\\" (1912).  Influence of logic in Geyser's work  Later works of Geyser include \\"Grundlegung der Logik und Erkenntnistheorie\\" (English: Basics of Logic and Epistemology; 1919) and \\"Auf dem Kampffelde der Logik\\" (English: On the battlefield of logic; 1926) and his strong background in Logic is already noticeable throughout Geyser's earlier work Die Seele. Arguments of other philosophers are decomposed and analysed such as Paul Natorp's argument which contains the Fallacy Petitio principi.  Reception  Today Joseph Geyser is rather unknown, but that Joseph Geyser's work was relevant and valued at the time can be seen in the commemorative publication \\"Philosophia Perennis. Abhandlungen zu ihrer Vergangenheit und Gegenwart\\" by Fritz-Joachim von Rintelen in honour of the sixtieth birthday anniversary of Geyser. In more than 1000 pages this commemorative publication combines articles of various contemporary scholars at the time such as Étienne Gilson, Jacques Maritain, Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange, Martin Grabmann, Joseph Maréchal, Peter Wust, Antonin Sertillanges, Richard Hönigswald and Dietrich von Hildebrand. Max Ettlinger's (1877-1929) article deals with Joseph Geyser as a Psychologist. Ettlinger points out that Geyser's philosophy and psychology developed through intense exchange within the circle of students at the University of Munich under the \\"inspiring teacher\\" Theodor Lipps. Theodor Lipps is described as developing from earlier positions such as Psychologism to metaphysics of mind whereby the latter was congenial to Geyser view. Valued by the German philosopher Nicolai Hartmann, who was also a supporter of the philosophia perennis and critical realism, Geyser is described as having a \\"consistently thought-out and complete worldview\\" which was developed within his Christian belief. Geyser further called attention through his discussion of the causality principle. In his Das Prinzip vom zureichenden Grunde (English: The principle of sufficient reason; Ratisbon, 1929) and in Das Gesetz der Ursache (English: The law of cause; Freiburg, 1933) he develops the idea that we can only discover the meaning of causality through experience. He questions whether his principle of causation is a priori. This question is highly \\"significant for any further epistemological and metaphysical construction that is in accord with experience\\".  Content  The book comprises an introduction and six main chapters with several sub-chapters in order to clarify the concept of the soul and its relation to our consciousness and body.  Preamble and Introduction  While the naive person regards the soul as a homogeneous entity being the \\"Wurzel, Zuschauer und Täter der mannigfaltigen Vorgänge im geistig Inneren\\" (English: root, the observer and an actor of various processes in our inner world), Geyser points out that many psychologists doubt this simple view. A consistent name for the sum of all inner, mental processes suggests that there is a soul that feels and thinks, but usually, psychologists regard this view scientifically wrong. Geyser states that his book aims to fill the academic gap between theory and practice by clarifying the concept of \\"the soul\\". Either the concept of a soul that is used by the layperson should be scientifically justified or should be abandoned completely.  I. First chapter: The mental facts of experience and the concept of consciousness  The first chapter introduces the problem of separating mental and bodily states as well as separating psychology and natural sciences. Classically, natural sciences like chemistry and physics were seen as dealing with experiences through sensory organs while psychology deals with everything else, like emotional states. However, Geyser states that the same object e.g. colours can be subject to both research streams: Therefore, everything we perceive is a result of mental as well as non-mental causes and processes, thereby Geyser opposes pure Idealism. The mental (\\"Seelisches\\") is defined as the act of perception and the content of perception. Geyser refers to Max Plancks' notion that perceptions can only give us a hint of the reality but may not depict the reality itself. The chapter concludes with the notions that the act of perceiving accompanies every sensory experience turning it in a psychological experience.  II. Second chapter: The knowledge about the soul out of its existence and characteristics of consciousness  The second chapter examines how we can know that the soul exists by knowing that we are conscious. One sub-chapter deals with Immanuel Kant's ideas and Transcendental idealism. In another subchapter, Geyser argues against Paul Natorp by stating that our knowledge of our consciousness (\\"Bewusstsein\\") implies that we are conscious of it. This paves the way for Geysers' metaphysics of mind. The chapter concludes that we know that the various processes in our consciousness (\\"Bewusstseinsfeld\\") exist in the subject that experiences them (\\"Bewusstsein\\").  III. Third chapter: general organisation of consciousness  After defining the terminology of the soul and consciousness several sub-chapter examine the organisation of our consciousness in greater detail. # The duration of the soul: Is the momentary subject of perception the same as yesterday? Geyser argues it is because we remember and have the ability to \\"re-cognize\\". # The passivity of the soul: Geyser argues that assuming that our senses are simply stimulated by physical processes and the conscious perception is simply passive as described in Associationism is not enough to understand the nature of the soul. In his opinion, the active part of the soul is what leads to a qualitative character of every perception. # The reactivity of the soul # The activity of the soul while thinking # The activity of the soul and free will: Deterministic and Indeterministic viewpoints are discussed. However, Geyser concludes that we have a will and that despite influencing motives and tendencies we have the willpower to consciously choose the opposite, given enough consideration time. He gives the example of picking a card.  IV. Fourth chapter: The problem of the unconscious. Being aware, noticing, observing. Real-definitions of the human soul  The unconscious nature of certain processes is discussed whereby several sub-chapters examine different processes such as being aware, noticing and observing and its unconscious parts. Geyser distances his work from Freud's psychoanalytical view of the unconscious.  V. Fifth chapter: Rejection of the denial of the soul by materialism  The materialism denies that there is a mental part, a soul. Geyser discusses the different form of materialism in the light of Naïve realism (psychology) and Critical realism (philosophy of perception).  VI. Sixth chapter: The nature of the dependence of mental and bodily processes  The Mind–body problem is introduced with the question whether there are two separate substances, namely the mental (soul) and the physical (body) and if so, whether and how those two substances interact. Geyser opposes René Descartes who stated the problems of Interactionism (philosophy of mind). The chapter discusses arguments against the notion that substances who interact have to be the same substance. Usually the strong argument against some sort of dualism is the law of conservation of energy argument, however, Geyser rather quickly refutes it. He supports his opinion by referring to Erich Becher and his work on \\"Leben und Seele\\" (1912) who argues that interaction (\\"Wechselwirkung\\") is not incompatible with results of Rubner, Laulanie and Atwater regarding conservation of energy. Subsequently, the position of Parallelism (philosophy) is discussed and denied. Finally, Geysers concludes that there must be an interaction (\\"Wechselwirkung\\") between mental and physical, as can be seen by the fact that we do not just think but also speak and write about our thoughts with the aim to influence other peoples thoughts and decisions:  References  Bibliography * * M.

Through a fortunate second marriage with Thomas Aylesbury, she became the grandmother of Lady Anne Hyde, Duchess of York and great-grandmother of Queen Mary II and Queen Anne.  Early life  Anne was born in Olde Hall, West Retford in around 1587. She was the younger daughter of Francis Denman of Retford and Anne (Blount) Denman. Francis (born c 1531, died 1599) was the rector of West Retford, Notts from 1578. He was the second son of Anne Hercy by her first husband, Nicholas Denman esq of East Retford, Notts. Francis had several sons who pre-deceased him and left two daughters as his heirs: Barbara (born c 1583) who married Edward Darell (born c 1582); and Anne. Anne's nephew, Dr John Darrell, was the youngest child of Barbara Denman and Edward Darell, and inherited substantial properties from both the Denman and Darell families. In 1665 just before his death he made a will dividing his estate between three charities. He donated the childhood home of Anne and Barbara, Olde Hall, to create a hospital for elderly men (an alm's house), which became the site for Trinity Hospital, Retford (a Grade II listed building).  Marriages  Anne was married at 20 and left a widow at 23 after the death of her first husband William, the younger son of Sir Thomas Darell. William was the half-brother of her sister Barbara's husband Edward. Anne left Retford due to some unknown trouble, or loss of fortune, in 1610 and proceeded to London by waggon-coach. Wilmshurst (1908) records that there had been a lawsuit between the two sisters in 1605. After reaching London, Anne is said to have halted at a hostel called the 'Goat and Compasses', where she rested before looking out for an occupation suitable for a country lady of good birth and family. The owner (not the landlord) of the hostel was Mr Thomas Aylesbury, a rich brewer of the Parish of St Andrew's, Holborn who happened to be making an inspection of his 'Houses' and required a housekeeper for his household, engaging Anne to this position. Thomas was a widower of 34, and a year later made Anne an offer of marriage. Thomas Aylesbury, Anne Denman's husband, c 1642 The marriage of Anne and Thomas was recorded in the Bishop of London's Registry, dated 3 October 1611, giving the couple's address as St Andrew's, Holborn. The registry notes that the marriage has 'the consent of his father, William Aylesbury, Esquire'. She is described in the register as 'Anne Darell, of the City of London, widow, whose husband died a year before'. Edwin Wilmshurst (1908) notes that Anne's first husband, William Darrel is described as 'of London', and apparently died there. He says this suggests Anne 'may have become acquainted with Mr Thomas Aylesbury before she became so young a widow and he a widower'. He also comments that on 17 April 1611, there was a partition of Estate between Edward Darrel and Barbara his wife, and her sister Anne, by an Indenture. This took place while she was working for Thomas Aylesbury but before she married him. Marrying Thomas was fortunate for Anne, as in 1627, he was created a Baronet, Master of the Mint, and Master of the Requests, by Charles I. After the King's death, the family moved to Antwerp with other Royalists. During this time in exile, Barbara, Anne's daughter died. Lady Anne Hyde, Duchess of York, and granddaughter of Anne Denman, later noted in her pocket book that her aunt Barbara died in Antwerp in 1652 and unmarried. 'My dear Aunt Bab was, when she died, 24 years of age.' Barbara, when in exile in Holland, was attached to the then Princess of Orange, as a lady in waiting at the Hague.  Children  The issue of Anne Denman's marriage with Thomas Aylesbury were: Portrait of Anne Denman's granddaughter Anne Hyde and her husband James II * William baptised in 1612 at St Margaret's Lothbury in London, died in Jamaica in 1656 * Thomas (probably died young) * Frances born 1617 died 1667, married Edward Hyde in 1634, had issue **Lady Anne (1637–1671), married King James II/VII **Hon. Henry, later 2nd Earl of Clarendon (1638–1709) **Hon. Laurence, later 1st Earl of Rochester (1641–1711) **Hon. Edward, (born c 1645, died 1665) buried 13 January 1665 having died at age 19 while a student at Oxford **Hon. James drowned in the Gloucester Frigate in 1682 in the suite of the Duke of York **Lady Frances, married Thomas Keightley, Irish revenue commissioner and privy councillor in 1675. * Anne, baptised at St Margaret's and married there in 1637 to John Brigham * Jane (probably died young) * Barbara baptised at St Margaret's, Westminster, 9 May 1627 died 1652 in Antwerp, no issue. Through her daughter Frances, Anne Denman is the maternal grandmother of Anne Hyde, the first wife of James II, and is the maternal great-grandmother of Mary II of England and Queen Anne.  Sir Thomas' death and will  In 1657, Sir Thomas died in exile in Breda, aged 81. Anne returned to London. Sir Thomas's will was in favour of Anne and her daughter Frances, but was disputed. Fortunately, Anne had the help of the eminent lawyer Edward Hyde (b. 18 February 1608/9 d. 1674) who was married to her daughter Frances. The deaths of Frances' brothers and sisters meant that by the time of her father's death she was the heiress for her father's estate.  Edward Hyde  Edward Hyde was Anne's son-in-law. The Registers of Westminster Abbey show that he married Frances, daughter of Sir Thomas Aylesbury and his wife Anne, at the Church of St Mar­garet's, Westminster (in which Parish Sir Thomas and Anne were resident), on 10 July 1634, under a Licence from the Dean and Chapter of Westminster, issued the same day. He was said to be 26 years of age having been born in the ninth year of King Charles' reign (1609), and was already a widower. He married his first wife Anne in 1629, and she died about six months later after catching smallpox. His second wife, Frances was about 21 upon her marriage. Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon Edward Hyde had risen rapidly in his profession. When King Charles was at Oxford, he was knighted on 22 February 1642-3, and was then made Lord Chancellor and Privy Councillor at the age of 34. Upon King Charles' death, he had to flee from Puritan vengeance. He was with King Charles II in exile in Flanders, and in Bruges on 29 January 1657-58, he was again appointed Lord Chancellor in prospectu. With the restitution of the monarchy, Edward and Frances Hyde were now in high favour. For his long service to the King, and his fidelity to the Crown, Edward was created Baron Hyde of Hindon, Wiltshire in 1660. In 1661, he was raised to be Viscount Cornberry (in which year Frances died). He was later created Earl of Clarendon (1662), taking his title from the Estate and Park of Clarendon, near Salisbury. Edward and Frances had six children. Their daughter Lady Anne (1637–1671), married King James II/VII.  Death and burial  Anne Denman is interred in the Hyde family vault in Westminster Abbey. She seems to have secured the regard of her grandson-in- law, James, Duke of York, as Samuel Pepys notes in his Diary that, in 1661, The Duke of York was in mourning for his wife's grandmother, who (he adds) was thought of with a great deal of fondness — and which grandmother was Anne Denman, of the Old Manor House, West Retford, Notts, now the Trinity Hospital.  Queen Anne portrait  Anne Denman's childhood home, the Old Hall in Retford, was given by her nephew John Darrell in his will to become a hospital for old men of good repute. As the last member of the Denman-Darrell family, he carried out the wishes of his father, Edward, in this respect. The Old Hall became Trinity Hospital, on Hospital Road, Retford. It is administered by a Trust which owns considerable property around Retford. A portrait of Queen Anne in Trinity Hospital was recently attributed (1999) by the auctioneers Phillips to Sir Godfrey Kneller. John was the nephew of Anne Denman, the first cousin of Frances Hyde, and therefore a cousin twice removed of Queen Anne.

Boyle became a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Culinary Arts in 2017. Life and career Boyle was born in Glasgow, Scotland and attended Bournemouth and Poole College to start his culinary training. He was awarded the Specialised Chefs Scholarship, arranged by the Royal Academy of Culinary Arts. Sponsored by The Savoy Hotel London, Boyle completed his apprenticeship at the 5* hotel. Boyle went on to become part of the Michelin-star winning team at Chewton Glen and then worked as a chef on cruise ships and luxury vessels, including on P&O; Cruises and with Swan Hellenic. He was appointed the first Culinary Ambassador for Unilever in 2002. After volunteering in Sri Lanka following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, Boyle returned to the UK to set up a food events company that also helped homeless people. Boyle appeared on BBC’s Dragons' Den in 2008 to pitch for funding, which was unsuccessful. In 2010, Boyle formed a partnership between his social enterprise – the Beyond Food Foundation, with PricewaterhouseCoopers, De Vere (hotel operator) and the Homes and Communities Agency, who invested £800,000 in a new restaurant and training concept. The Brigade restaurant and training school in London Bridge has been running since 2010. The concept helps get homeless people off the streets through food training programmes and apprenticeships. All profits of the restaurant are shared with charities and social enterprises. Recognition Former Prime Minister David Cameron and former Mayor of London Boris Johnson have visited Boyle at Brigade. Cameron called Brigade a \\"most impressive social enterprise\\". Johnson said: \\"This is ethical capitalism\\" and \\"social enterprise at its best.\\" Boyle's series of supper clubs at Brigade have involved guest chefs including Michel Roux Jr (Le Gavroche), Shay Cooper (The Goring) and Chris King (The Langdown). In March 2018, Boyle was invited to the House of Commons All Party Parliamentary Group for London to advise the government on how they could better support social enterprises. Boyle said the government’s competitive contracting of funding was \\"soul destroying\\" and urged the government to do more to recognise the work social enterprises are doing. Boyle won the People’s Choice Award by the Craft Guild of Chefs in 2013. He was awarded an Honorary Diploma and named an Honorary Head of State Chef by Le Club des Chefs des Chefs in 2015. The same year, he also won the Lord Mayor’s Dragon Award.

History The V9 Academy was founded, in 2016, by professional player Jamie Vardy and his agent John Morris after they felt that \\"too few professional clubs look hard enough in non-league football\\". Vardy invested £100,000 into the venture. Vardy had played in non-league football for a number of years before turning professional, eventually winning the Premier League with Leicester City and representing England at international level. For the first intake in 2017 there were thousands of applicants. In the summer of 2017 the Academy invited 42 applicants to attend a week-long trial in Manchester, from which four players (Danny Newton, Alex Penny, Lamar Reynolds and Blair Turgott) received professional contracts. There were scouts present from 65 professional clubs. It was the subject of a Sky Sports documentary series in September 2017. There was a second intake of 42 players in June 2018, which was also the subject of a Sky Sports documentary. Graduates Danny Newton was the first graduate who was awarded a professional contract after signing for Stevenage in June 2017. Three further players – Alex Penny, Lamar Reynolds and Blair Turgott – also received professional contracts that summer. Other players from that initial intake also later received professional contracts, including Elliott Durrell, Mikel Miller, and Elton Ngwatala. There was a second intake of players in 2018, the first of which was Luther Wildin. In June 2018 two more graduates – Josh Heaton and Cody Cooke – were awarded professional contracts by Scottish club St Mirren. Later that month Ben Stephens and Andy Dales, both graduates of the 2018 intake, signed for Football League teams. The most recent and arguably the biggest success story is Sam McCallum who joined Norwich City in January 2020 for a reported fee of £3,500,000 from Coventry City after breaking into the Coventry team and making a total of 35 appearances and scoring 3 goals over 2 seasons with the Sky Blues.

At the time, South Korea had about $304 billion in foreign-exchange debt. The campaign, involving about 3.51 million people nationwide, collected about 227 tons of gold worth about $2.13 billion.  Background  On July 2, 1997, Thailand changed its 13-year-old fixed exchange-rate system. As the exchange rate changed, the price of Thai baht in the foreign-exchange market fell. This was a cause of the East Asian financial crisis. On May 21 of that year, the IMF was asked to provide liquidity-adjustment funds. At the time, the real cause of the foreign-exchange-liquidity problem was controversial. The domestic foreign-exchange market lacked dollars, the South Korean won exchange rate increased, and some financial institutions were unable to repay their foreign debts. Foreign borrowing by financial institutions was blocked, making it difficult to repay a short-term external debt of $30 billion and a long- term external debt of $45 billion. Kim Dae-jung Government motivated the Korean People with the Gold-collecting campaign in South Korea to overcome the debt to the International Monetary Fund. It's reminiscent of the previous \\"Repay debt movement\\" or \\"Korean production movment\\" in 1907. https://www.globalintergold.com/gold-news/read/two-case-studies-how-gold- saved-india-and-south-korea A \\"one-dollar collection campaign\\" received little attention. The Korean Broadcasting System proposed a \\"gold-gathering movement\\" beginning on January 6, 1998, which received nationwide attention.  Campaign  The nationwide gold-collecting campaign was announced on December 25, 1997, when KBS1 first reported the proposal. On January 5, 1998, KBS1 began the campaign with the Housing Bank. The campaign was developed by a number of media organizations following the KBS report. Gold was received by six banks: Housing Bank, Nonghyup, Kookmin Bank, Korea Exchange Bank, Saemaeul Bank, and Industrial Bank. The campaign had two facets: KBS's \\"love of nation\\" and the MBC TV and civic-organization \\"foreign-debt repayment\\". The campaign was conducted from January 5 to April 30, 1998. On January 5, 1998, of gold was received in 44,748 consignments. On January 5 the number of participants exceeded 500,000, doubling (to one million) by January 15. The first KBS campaign ended on January 31, with 1,669,555 participants, and the second campaign was held from February 5 to February 21. A total of 314,515 people participated in the second campaign, contributing . The foreign-debt-repayment campaign led by MBC and consumer and civic groups ran from January 12 to March 14. It had 884,000 participants, and collected . The gold-collecting campaign was most active in January, with participation slowing in February. The Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy estimated the total number of participants at 3.51 million, with 30 percent of the gold collected during the campaign's first 10 days. Participation continued during February, and MBC and the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation led their campaign until March 14. Although the foreign-debt-repayment was extended until April 30, participation decreased significantly after March 14. Campaign participants were expected to receive a confirmation letter from a professional appraiser for 24-karat gold. After export, its dollar value was determined at the exchange rate and the international gold price and the value later returned in won. About 225 tons were raised: 165t in January 1998, 53t in February, 5t in March, and 0.8t in April. An equivalent of $2.17 billion was collected, increasing the amount of gold held by the Bank of Korea by 10 to 20 times. The press disseminated news about the gold-collecting campaign to all social groups, encouraging them to participate. After March, news reports indicated that the campaign hoped to overcome the foreign-exchange crisis and encouraged conformity. The media reported on the participation of companies such as Samsung and Daewoo and individuals such as Lee Jong-bum, President Kim Dae- jung and Lee Kun-hee. They also encouraged participation in the campaign by the general public; Chung Sung-hwan donated the equivalent of ₩500,000. After March 1998, when the campaign was completed, its performance was reported. The report noted the fact that country could overcome its economic crisis primarily by collecting gold. The campaign emphasized voluntarism and patriotism, and was developed for convenient participation.  Results  At the end of February 1998 five financial institutions (including the Housing Bank and Kookmin Bank) stopped collecting gold, and the NACF ceased its involvement at the end of April. The amount of gold totaled about $1.82 billion in foreign currency. An average of per household was collected. Twenty-one thousand people contributed of gold, and 1,735 people consigned in the form of government bonds. The Housing Bank (KBS-Daewoo) collected the most gold (364t), followed by Nonghyup (MBC-Samsung, 48.23t), Kookmin Bank and Saemaeul Bank (SBS-LG, 33.68t), Korea Exchange Bank (4.25t) and Industrial Bank of Korea (1.98t). The campaign repaid the $19.5 billion in IMF-backed debt in August 2001, three years ahead of schedule.  Evaluation  The gold- collecting campaign is regarded as a driving force for a people to overcome a foreign-exchange crisis. According to a 2017 survey conducted by the Korea Development Institute to assess the impact of the 1997 financial crisis, 54.4 percent of respondents cited national unity as the driving force behind recovery; 42.4 percent noted the IMF crisis, and 15.2 percent cited restructuring and reform efforts. Contemporary news articles emphasized voluntary participation to overcome a national crisis and shame associated with not self-sacrificing for the country. Emphasizing the patriotism of the Korean people, it blurred the real reasons for the economic crisis with emotional appeals. After the campaign ended, restructuring became an issue. The collective memory of the campaign was used to justify neoliberalism, chaebols, labor flexibility, over-consumption, and nostalgia for the Park Chung-hee regime; critical reflection on the event was ignored.

In addition to the fire department of the Bundeswehr University Munich, it is the only full-time fire department at a German university. It exists since 1979 and has 58 employees working in three shifts as well as in the day shifts. Its location is the research site of the TU in Garching near Munich. Organizationally, the fire department is part of the Central Department 1 - Unit 15 - of the Technical University of Munich.  Purpose  The purposes of the TU fire department include, apart from fire protection and firefighting on the Garching campus, also general fire department-specific assistance, for example in traffic accidents. Their focus is on fire safety training and respiratory protection training for TU employees, knowledge of the fire alarm systems, maintenance of 3,000 fire extinguishers and checking hydrants on campus. Since the former research reactor Munich (known as Atom-Ei) and the research neutron source Heinz Maier- Leibnitz belong to the objects that are supervised, the TU firefighters have a special training in radiation protection. In major catastrophic events, the TU's fire department also supports units of the Garching Volunteer Fire Department and the Munich Fire Department and vice versa.  History  In 1967, demands were made that the university should organize the fire protection and rescue service itself for the 1957 inaugurated research campus of the Technical University of Munich in the north of Garching, and therefore founded their fire department. Appraisals and legal examinations took place, until 1975-78 when the Faculty of Chemistry had a new building built. At the same time, nuclear legislations were tightened, which resulted in higher demands on the operational readiness of rescue services at the research reactor. For this reason, the head of the Munich Fire Department was appointed consultant and organizer of the development of a fire department for the TU. Which in turn, took the University fire demepatment back to the position that they could rely on civil service personnel and was considered equal to the public professional fire departments. In 1978, the first operational and managerial staff were recruited and trained at the Munich and Augsburg professional fire departments. Part of the building of the technical center of the cogeneration plant was converted into a fire station. In May 1979, 18 of the 48 civil servants required, met the conditions to become active in the firefighting service. On 1 June 1979, the first watch of guards with six officials began their 24-hour service. In March 1985, a newly built fire station could be occupied. In 1991, the university fire department was recognized as a plant fire department and received, in 1996, an expanded operations center. At the beginning of 1999, it was decided to reorganize the vehicle concept of the fire department in order to adapt it to changing requirements. In the course of this, a changeable charger system was introduced and a rescue vehicle was purchased. The plant fire department is a member of the Munich Municipal Fire Department.  Vehicles  The fleet consists of: * Einsatzleitwagen 10/1 (command vehicle) * Mannschaftstransportfahrzeug 11/1 (transporter for the team ) * Hilfeleistungslöschgruppenfahrzeug HLF 40/1 und HLF 40/2 (fire engine to the technical help) * Drehleiter mit Korb 30/1 (turnable ladder with basket) * Ambulance 71/1 * Wechselladerfahrzeug 82/1 und 82/2 * Kleineinsatzfahrzeug 69/1 (very small emergency vehicle) * Smart 89/1 * Teleskoplader (Manitou) (telescopic handler) * Versorgungsfahrzeug (supply vehicle)  See also  * Technisches Hilfswerk  References   External links  *www.feuerwehr.tum.de *Stadt Garching Category:Technical University of Munich Category:1979 establishments in Germany ","title":"Fire department TU Munich"},{"id":"57761321","text":"Red clover.

D'Oyley was a Parliamentarian who served in the New Model Army in Wiltshire and in Ireland. In 1654 he sailed to the West Indies as a lieutenant-colonel in General Robert Venables' regiment. Venables had been ordered to the West Indies to advance the Parliamentarian cause and to repel Spanish advances. Once there, Venables raised a local regiment and appointed D'Oyley as its colonel. After the death of Major-General Richard Fortescue, D'Oyley was elected commander-in-chief of all the Jamaican forces. Although temporarily displaced by the Cromwellian protegés Robert Sedgwick and William Brayne, command of the Jamaican forces ultimately devolved completely upon D'Oyley in September 1657. As military commander, he successfully beat off Spanish attempts to take control of the Caribbean in 1657 and 1658. At the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, King Charles II confirmed him in his position as the first Governor of the Colony of Jamaica, a position he held until 1662, when he was replaced by the Royalist Thomas Hickman-Windsor, 1st Earl of Plymouth. A lot of D'Oyley's time was taken up fighting the Maroons in the mountainous forests of the interior; they were runaway slaves who secured their freedom from their Spanish masters when the English took the island. In about 1660, he persuaded the leader of one of the Maroon bands, Juan de Bolas, to switch sides and join the English.Mavis Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica 1655-1796: a History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 17-20.C.V.

However, D'Oyley was unable to persuade Juan de Serras, the leader of the Karmahaly Maroons, to follow suit, and this group continued to fight against the English.Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica, pp. 25-27. In 1662, D'Oyley returned to England where he established himself in St Martin- in-the-Fields, an Anglican church in the City of Westminster, London. He died in London in March 1675.

Design The Bedford MW was a 15 cwt (760 kg) 4x2 truck, powered by a Bedford six-cylinder inline petrol engine through a four speed transmission. Despite lacking four wheel drive and so being unsuited for off road use, the MW's powerful engine, short wheel base, low centre of gravity and relatively light weight gave it excellent acceleration and almost sports car like handling. The early MWs were open cabbed with a folding windscreen and a collapsible canvas tilt, from 1943 an enclosed cab with doors and perspex side screens was added, retaining the canvas top. The vehicle had a distinctive wide bonnet, necessitated by the need to accommodate a special extra large air filter that was never fitted to production vehicles. History In 1935 the War Office issued specifications for a new 15 cwt 4x2 military truck for service with the British Army, inviting manufacturers to submit designs to take part in annual comparative trials in north Wales, one entrant was a modification of a Bedford Vehicles 2 ton rear wheel drive lorry. Following these trials Bedford fitted a larger radiator and larger tyres, the trials were repeated in 1936 after which Bedford modified the chassis to increase ground clearance and installed a new engine cooling system. For the 1937 trials a new special Bedford WD-1 prototype was produced with a 15 cwt payload, it performed admirably and in 1938 the eventual 72 bhp engine was installed. Between 1939 and 1945 Bedford produced over 66,000 MWs, the vehicles remained in British service until the late 1950s. Use The MW was intended mainly to be a workhorse for the British Army's infantry battalions, but throughout the war it was adapted to a number of roles and was eventually also used by the Royal Air Force, Royal Navy, other government departments and some overseas customers.

This new union was named the Metropolitan Rugby Football Union. There was some discussion about the quality of play that football was producing in 1897. Some quarters declared that the standard had deteriorated over the past few seasons. However, it was suggested by others in the media that football was moving from individual heroics to team brilliance. The addition of talented players from the Junior ranks was welcomed with many of these players selected for representative honours. The 1897 Sydney Rugby Premiership saw Randwick Football Club present its best performance to take all before it. The club were undefeated in all games during the season and won all three main awards, the Sydney Cricket Ground Trophy, Agricultural Society Trophy and the Premiership. Unfortunately, the Agricultural Society Trophy was stripped from the club and awarded to their opponents due to a technicality. Before playing the Semi final, Randwick requested to allow the New Zealander, Tom Pauling, to play for the team. The Union allowed him to play but, due to a protest by the Pirates after the completion of the final, the decision was revised. With the new decision, the Pirates were awarded the Agricultural Society Trophy. After the introduction of new Juniors to the team, the Pirates Football Club transformed their season. During the previous season, the team failed to win a single game and began the new year with a pair of losses. With the arrival of Conlon, Boyd, Evers, McMahon, Ellis, Warman and Baird the team displayed improved form only slightly below that of the Premiers. The team were present in both trophy finals and finished the season runners-up. After the protest against Randwick was upheld, the Pirates were awarded with the Agricultural Society Trophy. Hopes were high for the future. The two older clubs, Sydney University and Wallaroo, experienced less than their usual success during the season. Both teams were in the middle of a rebuilding phase, with older and more experienced players retiring from the game. New young blood was filtering into the ranks with hope that the clubs would soon be back to their high-class best. The 'Varsity displayed an upturn in their performance from previous seasons, giving the club promise for the future. Victory over the Pirates and an excellent game against the Premiers were the highlights of the season. Wallaroo experienced their worst season for a decade. This could be attributed to the injuries to key players, Row and Kelly. The team won only two games during the season and were unable to recruit Juniors of merit. With an infusion of new blood mixing with the sound, experienced players, it is believed that Wallaroo could achieve success once again.

Games were decided by draw with Wentworth and the Pirates facing off for the second successive week. This game ended with a 3 all draw and was replayed on 17 July. In the replay, the Pirates won easily 17 points to 6. In the second semi, Randwick had the better team resulting in a loss for Wallaroo 17 to 3. = Agricultural Society Trophy = After missing out on playing for the SCG Trophy, the Sydney University Football Club still qualified for the Agricultural Society Trophy. As no other teams were still in existence to contend for the trophy, University proceeded directly to the next week of finals.

With the game played on a wet and muddy day, the result was almost what the crowd wanted. The ground was in such poor condition that the referee took a turn in the mud and humorously wore a muddy stain to show for it. The Pirates played a stronger wet-weather game and were able to hold Randwick to a nil all draw. The replay final saw similar cold and squally weather. Despite the conditions, the game was commended for its fine display with both teams playing well. The score was 3 all at half time with Randwick eventually coming away as winners. The fact that Randwick did not score more points was due to the excellent defence of their opponents. Overall, the victors were the better team. = Agricultural Society Trophy = The Wentworth club continued their slow decline from the highs of the previous season. After losing three out of their last four games, several fresh players were brought in to compete against the 'Varsity. For the first 15 to 20 minutes of the game, the two teams were equal. After that, University played with greater 'life' to win the game and progress. Wallaroo were awarded a bye and progressed into the semi finals.  Finals Week 3, 28 August  { align=\\"right\\"  style=\\"font-size:90%; text- align:center; margin-left:1em; margin-right:4em\\" - bgcolor=#ccffcc ! colspan=3RAS Trophy Semi Finals - bgcolor=#fff  colspan=3 - bgcolor=#ccffcc width=150; align=left20px Randwickwidth=2024 - align=left20px University3 - bgcolor=#fff  colspan=2 - bgcolor=#ccffcc align=left20x20px Pirates11 - align=left20x20px Wallaroo7 } = Agricultural Society Trophy = Much of the brightness had disappeared by the time of the semi finals. Representative duties robbed the games of the finest players, with the two semi finals being played at the inconveniently distant Kensington Racecourse. Even with a weak team, Randwick were able to defeat a lacklustre University 24 to 3. The second semi saw a more even contest between the Pirates and Wallaroo. The game was closely fought until the eventual victors were able to take the lead near the end of the match.  Finals Week 4, 28 August  { align=\\"right\\"  style=\\"font-size:90%; text-align:center; margin-left:1em; margin-right:4em\\" - bgcolor=#ccffcc ! colspan=3RAS Trophy Final - bgcolor=#fff  colspan=3 - bgcolor=#ccffcc width=150; align=left20px Randwickwidth=2017 - align=left20x20px Pirates6 } = Agricultural Society Trophy = Prior to the final being played, the Metropolitan Rugby Union reversed their decision to allow the New Zealander, Tom Pauling, to play for Randwick. However, the eventual Premiers were determined to include him in their squad. As a result, there was much ill feeling from the Pirates towards Randwick. This manifested itself in the game with players being called to explain their actions at a later hearing. Both teams were missing players due to representative duties which gave the crowd much hope for a Pirates victory. Eventually, Randwick were victorious, being more able to penetrate the defence of the opposition and make every play count. After the game, the Union made the decision to strip Randwick of the trophy and award it to the Pirates.

Roman soldiers in Syria, many of whom were former Republicans fighting in the last civil war, joined the force, and the Levant and much of Asia Minor were swiftly overrun by Pacorus I and Labienus, respectively. In 39 BC, Antony sent Ventidius, who defeated and executed Labienus in a counter-attack, and then drove Pacorus I out of the Levant. A second Parthian invasion of Syria by Pacorus I resulted in the latter's death and Parthian failure. Antony later began a campaign with a massive force against Parthia, but ended in Roman defeat. Roman–Parthian hostilities formally ended later under the reign of Octavian (Augustus). Background The Parthians had defeated and killed Marcus Licinius Crassus (a member of the First Triumvirate along with Julius Caesar and Pompey), at the Battle of Carrhae. They also maintained relations with Pompey, though never supported him militarily in the latter's conflict with Caesar. After Pompey's death, Caesar planned an invasion of Parthia, but he was assassinated before implementing it. In 42 BC, Parthian forces fought alongside the \\"Liberators\\" (the leaders of Caesar's assassination) against the Caesarians under Mark Antony and Octavian in the Battle of Philippi in the Liberators' civil war. After the Liberators' defeat, in an attempt to resurrect the Pompeian cause, general Quintus Labienus, who had been sent to Parthia to ask for assistance in the last civil war, joined the Parthians, and the Parthian king Orodes II sent him together with his son Pacorus I to invade eastern Roman territories, p. 57 while Mark Antony was in Egypt with Cleopatra. Invasion Orodes II sent his son Pacorus I and Labienus as the commanders of a large Parthian army to invade Roman territory in early 40 BC (or late 41 BC, according to some scholars). According to Vagi, the invasion comprised some 20,000 horsemen. Many Roman forces in Syria defected to Labienus. Antony's commander in Syria, Lucius Decidius Saxa, fled, first to Antioch, and then to Cilicia, where he was captured by Labienus and executed. Several Roman aquilae were then captured by the Parthians. (These aquilae, together with ones captured after the Battle of Carrhae, were later returned after Augustus' negotiations with the Parthians.) Apamea and Antioch then surrendered. After that, the two commanders split: Pacorus invaded Palestine and Phoenicia, while Labienus launched a \\"blitzkrieg\\" in Asia Minor, capturing much of the region and being hailed as Imperator. Pacorus, who had gained a reputation for military talent and moderation, swiftly took all the cities along the Levantine coast with the exception of Tyre (which was notoriously difficult to capture), reaching Gaza by May 40 BC, and receiving homage from the Nabataeans. At the same time, his general Barzapharnes led a force inland. The pro-Parthian Jewish leader Antigonus II Mattathias sent a large subsidy to Pacorus I, and the latter supported him in the fight against the pro-Roman Jewish leaders Hyrcanus II and Phasael, successfully installing him as the new king of Judea. Hyrcanus II and Phasael were captured while trying to negotiate with the Parthians, and were deported to Parthia, while Herod, another leader, fled. Mark Antony left Egypt for Greece and sent Publius Ventidius Bassus to Asia Minor. He scored two victories with minimal forces north of the Taurus Mountains in 39 BC (Battle of the Cilician Gates, Battle of Amanus Pass), capturing and executing Labienus. He then drove the Parthians out of Syria. Another Parthian invasion of Syria in 38 BC under Pacorus I resulted in a decisive defeat at the Battle of Mount Gindarus in Cyrrhestica, with Pacorus I being killed and the Parthian presence in Syria being brought to an end. Silver denarius minted by Labienus in early 40 BC. Uncertain mint in Syria or southeastern Asia Minor. Coins minted by Labienus survive from this period, and were probably minted in Antioch. Aftermath In 38 BC, Mark Antony finally began the campaign against Parthia with a large force, but it resulted in a defeat with heavy Roman losses.

Electroshapable materials are plastics rigid at room temperature, which can take the form of various objects or plastic elements. They can substitute for more common thermoplastic polymers such as PVC, PE, PC, EVA. The particularity of electroshapable materials lies in their ability to become fluid and malleable when an electric voltage is applied to two ends of the material, before becoming rigid again after the voltage is removed. This process can be reversible. This behavior makes thermoforming fast, reversible and easy to use for many applications. One of the major benefits is the improved comfort of everyday products in contact with the human body. Electroshapable materials are particularly useful in so-called thermoformable products, particularly in the field of sports equipment (e.g. ski boots, soles, body protections) and in the medical sector (e.g. splints). Electroshapable materials should not be confused with electroactive polymers because they are not based on the same physical principle.  Physical principle  thumb Electroshapable materials are based on a relatively simple physical principle: it is in fact an electrically conductive thermoplastic material in which are positioned two electrodes for applying an electrical voltage. When an electrical voltage is applied, the polymer will act as a heating resistor because of its resistivity. It will heat up homogeneously by the Joule effect until it reaches its melting temperature, beyond which it becomes sufficiently viscous to be malleable to the hand. Ideally the thermoplastic polymer selected has a relatively low melting temperature (60 °C for example) so that the user can handle it without danger of burning and to reduce the amount of energy required for the transition. Any voltage can be used, both direct current and alternating current. However, the electric power required to do the rigid-malleable transition is proportional to the mass of electroshapable materials to be deformed. Depending on the mass of the element, it will be required a minimum electrical power to achieve the melting temperature. The current is determined by the resistance of the electroshapable element to melt. Thus by the geometry of the element and by the resistivity of the material.  History  Electrically conductive polymers or composites have existed since the 1970s.https://scholar.google.fr/scholar?q=electrically+conductive+polymers&hl;=en However, the concept of electroshapable materials is quite recent; it was developed for the first time in France in 2015 by Pierre-Louis Boyer and Alexis Robert.  Uses   Lack of adaptation of mass produced products  Some rigid objects in contact with the human body have a need to adapt to the morphology of the user, in order to distribute the pressure over the entire human-object interface. In order to improve the comfort of the user and to avoid pressure points, which can cause bedsores. This need to adapt rigid forms comes from the extreme variability of anatomy between individuals; most mass production processes are not adapted to meet this variability. Indeed, these methods are generally optimized to make a single shape, often from a mold or die (for example: plastic injection, metal foil stamping). To address this problem of morphological diversity, manufacturers often have to multiply industrial tools in order to offer several dimensions or shapes to their products. The most prominent example is shoes for which there can be up to fifteen to twenty different sizes. Which is very difficult to handle because: * Cost: Industrial tools such as injection molds are very expensive. Required investment is proportional to the number of reference. * Logistics: With an increasing number of references the stock management also becomes more complicated. Moreover, the manufacturers are very limited in number of product variations, because each is multiplying the number of references. For example, if a shoe manufacturer who proposes a model in fifteen sizes wishes to produce a product in three different colors, he will have to manage 3 × 15, or 45 references. If it wants to make two models, one for large foot and one for thin foot, it will double again to 90 references. Limited by the number of variations, the designers can hardly answer all the anatomical specificities of the individuals. The most common strategic option is to address the products to the physical characteristics of the average individual, which is expected to match the majority of customers, but leaves a significant fringe of users unsatisfied.  Thermoformable products  The so-called thermoformable products (which use thermoplastic elements often at low melting temperature such as PCL) are a solution allowing products to adapt to the anatomy of the user. Thermoformable products make it possible to adapt an initially standard shape to the anatomy of the user, making it possible to adapt more finely to each user than is possible through product variations. Many current applications use the principle of thermoforming, such as: ski boots, shoe soles, medical splints. One of the limitations of these products using conventional thermoplastics is the equipment required for their implementation. Indeed, the heat energy required to raise the material to its melting point is generally provided by the use of an oven or a water bath. The electroshapable materials also make it possible to form product to the user anatomy. = Advantages = *Making the work easier for the end user, who simply needs to connect the product to a calibrated power source. *Speed of the forming process because the material heats intrinsically and homogeneously by Joule effect. So it can melt in seconds, making the whole forming process under a minute. = Disadvantages = *Need for a power supply. *The use of a power supply requires compliance with safety standards, especially if the voltage used is greater than 50 V.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. History Kinsley S. Bingham was born in Onondaga County, New York, in 1808. In his younger years, he studied law, but practiced farming. In 1833, he married and moved to Michigan, moving into a double log cabin with his wife's brother. Unfortunately, Bingham's wife died giving birth to a son, and the boy was sent back to New York to be raised by his grandparents. Bingham began a political career in Michigan, serving as postmaster, justice of the peace, captain of militia, and, in 1836, as the county's first probate judge. In 1837 he was elected to the Michigan State House of Representatives, eventually becoming Speaker. In 1839, he married his first wife's sister. As his new family grew, Bingham made plans to move out of the old double log cabin. He had this frame house constructed in 1841, and the family likely moved in the following year. In 1847, Bingham was elected to the United States Congress, and in 1854 was nominated by the nascent Republican Party as their first Michigan gubernatorial candidate. He served two terms as governor, then in 1859 was elected to the United States Senate. He died in 1861 at home, and was buried behind the house near his wife, The graves were move to a public cemetery later. Description The Bingham House is one of the oldest and finest Greek Revival buildings in Michigan. It is a two-story timber frame structure, with a rectangular central section flanked by single story side wings in a modified \\"basilica\\" style. The house has a lattice work tympanium, a massive entablature over the doorway, and dentilated cornices. The windows are six over six units, and the entrance is flanked by sidelights and topped with a transom. The house was later modified with a portico located at the rear, and the porches of the wings were screened in.

Plot Iris Deerborne is a teenager living in a rural Oklahoma town in 1960. The shy and mousey Iris is emotionally abused by her mother Francie, who wishes her daughter were more glamorous. At school she is bullied by many of the other kids, especially Clarisssa Dell, the popular but insecure \\"queen bee\\" of the school. Iris shares a mutual attraction with Jeff Owings, a fellow student who works for her father, but is too shy to act on her feelings. Iris frequently sneaks out at night to swim in a local pond, wishing that she could \\"disappear\\". One day, while walking to school, Iris is accosted by several boys. They are chased off by Maggie Richmond, a new girl at school who throws rocks at them until they leave. At school the other girls are intrigued by the conventionally pretty Maggie who piques their interest by telling them her father is a glamorous photographer for Life magazine who has photographed movie stars and dignitaries. That night, Iris finds Maggie swimming in her pond. Maggie admits that her father is not a glamour photographer, but instead works for an agricultural trade publication. When Maggie returns home, her stern father beats her for being out late. The family has moved to this small town to escape trouble which Maggie's behavior had caused in the past. Iris and Maggie become fast friends and Maggie has them skip school so they can get makeovers, including new hairdos from the local stylist Hazel Atkins. Iris' new looks and more confident attitude begin to gain her more acceptance from the girls in her school, most of whom are obsessed with finding dates to the upcoming school dance. At the dance, Iris finally gets the nerve to dance with Jeff Owings, surprising the rest of the girls. Later, Maggie's family is thrilled to find out that she has been asked to the prom by popular football player Craig Butler. Maggie's mother takes her out dress shopping for the occasion.

Maggie, in turn, derides Iris as \\"stinky drawers\\" a nickname the other kids had used to bully her. Maggie, ashamed of what she's done and the people she's with, flees to Hazel's house where the two of them kiss. Late that night, one of the girls comes by Hazel's to pick up a jar of hair product meant for her mother. Through the window she sees Hazel and Maggie having sex. She hurries home and tells her parents. The news quickly passes throughout the town. A group of men force Hazel to leave town.

Maggie apologizes to her parents, tells them that they won't have to worry about her anymore and flees into the night. The next morning, Iris learns about what happened. She finds Maggie's father and the police by the pond, a place locally renowned for a woman having committed suicide there. A distraught Mr Richmond tells Iris to tell Maggie to come home and that he doesn't care about her being bad anymore. Iris stands up for her friend, saying that Maggie was never bad. The police are unable to find Maggie, either alive or dead. When a group of boys harass Iris on the road again, she throws stones at them to chase them off, just like Maggie did. When she hears her mother gossiping with a friend, Iris insists that Maggie isn't dead, and that she has fled far beyond the reach of the narrow minded townsfolk. She then informs them that she is going on her first date with Jeff Owings. Iris and Jeff kiss by the pond and then go swimming.

Marcos signed many presidential decrees beneficial only to his associates, while allowing for the forced relocation of indigenous peoples, decreasing workers' wages, and murders of labor activists. Minimum wage was a fixed PHP8.00 per day. Many workers were unemployed or underemployed. It was also during the Marcos presidency when the practice of contractualization began,enabling managements to avoid giving regular, permanent status to employees after six months of work. Strikes were banned and the government controlled trade unions, leaving workers without effective protection against employers who had unfair labor practices and regulations. Furthermore, with each year under Martial Law, economic conditions deteriorated due to a large trade deficit. Between 1974 and 1981, the trade deficit increased from $418 million to $2.2 billion, while the foreign debt increased from $5.1 million to $14.8 billion in 1976 and 1981. A study by the World Bank found that Philippine poverty increased between 1972 and 1978. Real wages for skilled for workers in urban areas fell by 23.8%, and for unskilled laborers the decline was 31.6%. Authors of the study concluded that \\"purchasing power has dropped in both urban and rural areas, in all regions, and practically all occupations,\\" and the gap between rich and poor is \\"worse in the Philippines than elsewhere in the [Southeast Asian] region. In this context, the material conditions of the working class was greatly in contrast to the lavish opulence of crony capitalism under of the Marcos regime. These are some of the factors that propelled workers to resist the Marcos dictatorship. These workers protested against the Marcos regime in forms of silent strikes, sit-down strikes, work slowdowns, mass leaves and the stretching of the break period. The first major strike against the dictatorship was in La Tondeña, then the largest distillery in Asia. Over 500 workers went on strike, led by student activist Edgar Jopson and veteran labor activists, church peoples, labor unions, and the surrounding community. On the second day of the protest, the police cracked down on the area and arrested the workers. Word of the protest spread, becoming one of the symbols of resistance. Marcos responded by proclaiming a decree that outlawed all strikes across all industries. Nevertheless, the strike was a political turning point. The La Tondeña workers' slogan, \\"Tama Na, Sobra, Welga Na,\\" was later adapted by protestors in the final years of the Marcos dictatorship. The workers continued their protests despite the ban. In the following months, around 200 strikes broke out nationwide, with 80,000 participating. In Manila alone, there were 25 strikes, with 40,000 participating. In 1981, after Marcos nominally lifted Martial Law, 260 strikes took place, with over 76,000 workers involved. Labor unions against the dictatorship increased in number and strength under martial law.

The first of the assassin spider family (Araneae, Archaeidae) found in Western Australia, the species was unknown until its collection at Torndirrup National Park near Albany was published in 1987. Taxonomy Formally described as Austrarchaea mainae by Norman Platnick in 1991, the spider was nominated as the type species for the Australian endemic genus Zephyrarchaea. This split from the more widely distributed Austrarchaea was published in 2012, after further specimens were found and collected in nearby areas, along with several other related archaeid species discovered in the region. The spider's distinction as a species is supported by comparative study of genotyped species of archaeids, as is the low mobility and specialised habitat of populations.  Description  A species of Archaeidae (assassin spider) around three millimetres long. One distinguishing characteristic is the presence of six humps on the upper side of the abdomen, not found on any species of Zephyrarchaea but the nearby and closely related Zephyrarchaea janineae; these tubercles are arranged in three pairs. The feature is reduced in collections of the Eastern population near Bremer, suggesting they are an emergent species.  Distribution  Found only near the southern coast of Southwest Australia, a biodiversity hotspot, the species is listed as ‘Threatened’ under the Western Australian Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. The range centres on Torndirrup south of Albany, to the Walpole Nornalup region in the West and eastward to Bremer. The population also occurs inland near the Porongurup range to the North. Zephyrarchaea mainae is restricted to a high rainfall, near coastal habitat of heathland or forest. Most often associated with bushland dominated by Agonis flexuosa (weeping peppermint), or low shrubs, an outlying population has been collected in karri forest.  Habitat  The habitat within the wider range of Z. mainae is restricted to particular assemblages of flora, which the understory of sedges, Lepidosperma gladiatum and Lepidosperma effusum, and other grasses such Empodisma gracillimum form an elevated and complex crown of leaf and branch litter. The habitat is vulnerable to changes in fire regimes, and the species occurs only when it has remained unburnt for many decades.

The blast occurred at a ZANU–PF campaign rally, just after President Emmerson Mnangagwa had finished giving a speech. It was described as an assassination attempt against Mnangagwa, who was unharmed. The bombing resulted in at least 49 injured, including Vice- Presidents Constantino Chiwenga and Kembo Mohadi, and other high-ranking government officials. Two security agents later died of their injuries. The bombing was widely condemned in Zimbabwe and abroad by politicians of both ZANU–PF and opposition parties, and by other public figures. In an interview with the BBC several days after the blast, Mnangagwa blamed the attack on former First Lady Grace Mugabe's G40 faction within ZANU–PF, while stopping short of blaming Mugabe directly. On 27 June 2018, the Zimbabwe Defence Forces stated that they had arrested an individual on the day of the attack. Two more suspects were later arrested, but released without charges.  Background  On the evening of 14 November 2017, elements of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) gathered around Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, and seized control of the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation and key areas of the city. The next day, the ZDF issued a statement saying that it was not a coup d'état and that President Robert Mugabe was safe, although the situation would return to normal only after the ZDF had dealt with the \\"criminals\\" around Mugabe responsible for the socio-economic problems of Zimbabwe. The uprising took place amid tensions in the ruling ZANU–PF party between former First Vice- President Emmerson Mnangagwa (who was backed by the ZDF and the party's Lacoste faction) and First Lady Grace Mugabe (who was backed by the younger G40 faction) over who would succeed the 93-year-old President Mugabe. A week after Mnangagwa was fired and forced to flee the country, and a day before troops moved into Harare, Zimbabwe Defence Forces chief Constantino Chiwenga issued a statement that purges of senior ZANU–PF officials like Mnangagwa had to stop. On 19 November, ZANU-PF removed Mugabe as party leader, replacing him with Mnangagwa. Mugabe resigned the presidency on 21 November 2017. Mnangagwa was sworn in as President on 24 November 2017.  Explosion  President Emmerson Mnangagwa, shown here speaking at a 2015 rally, was the target of the attack. On the afternoon of Saturday, 23 June 2018, Zimbabwe's ruling party, ZANU–PF, was holding a campaign rally at White City Stadium in Bulawayo, the country's second largest city and an opposition stronghold. The rally, which was attended by several thousand people, was held to garner support for the party ahead of the July general elections. It was Mnangagwa's first rally in Bulawayo, which the party has not won since the 2000 elections. The blast occurred in afternoon, shortly after President Emmerson Mnangagwa had finished giving a speech. As Mnangagwa and other party leaders walked offstage to enter a VIP tent, a grenade exploded, creating a cloud of smoke and knocking over people standing close by. Mnangagwa, who was close to the blast but was unhurt, was rushed away by security personnel, while the crowds began running in all directions. Red Cross medics rushed in, treating and evacuating the wounded. State television immediately cut their broadcast after the blast.  Casualties  The bombing injured 49 people, two of whom died two days later, on 25 June. The two deceased were Central Intelligence Organisation security personnel; Colour Sergeant Stanley Mugunzva of the Presidential Guard, who was assigned to Vice-President Chiwenga, and Nelson Dube, an aide to Vice- President Mohadi. A Zimbabwe Republic Police spokesperson state that while the number of injured was official recorded at 49, it could be larger if there were other victims who did not seek medical care. Four security personnel and several chiefs were injured in the blast. While most of the victims sustained minor injuries and were discharged within hours, health officials warned that some are still in critical condition and that the death toll could rise. Among the injured were leading government and party officials. Constantino Chiwenga, the First Vice-President of Zimbabwe and a major figure in the 2017 coup, had minor injuries, as did his wife Marry, who sustained lacerations to her face while trying to rescue one of her aides who had shrapnel in her stomach. Second Vice-President Kembo Mohadi was also hospitalized with injuries to his legs. Oppah Muchinguri, the national chairperson of ZANU–PF and the environmental minister, had one of her breasts ripped off by the blast and was in a state of shock. Deputy Speaker of the House of Assembly and ZANU–PF Women's League leader Mabel Chinomona was also injured, as was ZANU–PF National Political Commissar Engelbert Rugeje, who received shrapnel in his arm. Constantino and Marry Chiwenga, Mabel Chinomona, and Engelbert Rugeje were discharged in the days after the attack, while Kembo Mohadi and Oppah Muchinguri suffered more serious injuries and remained in treatment longer. On Tuesday, 26 June, Mohadi was airlifted to South Africa for treatment. Mohadi, whose legs were injured in the blast, was reported to be in stable condition, though physicians experienced difficulty treating his hypertension. On 27 June, Muchinguri was also flown to South Africa, where she underwent orthopedic and reconstructive surgery. Muchinguri required treatment to address her left breast, which was ripped off by the blast, as well as psychological care and counseling. Vice-President Chiwenga chose to forgo immediate medical treatment so that he could fully participate in campaigning in the run-up to the 2018 elections. On 9 October 2018, Chiwenga and his wife flew to South Africa for medical treatment, where their injuries were reviewed. In addition to injuries sustained from the Bulawayo bombing, Chiwenga also had a bullet lodged in his leg from a separate incident. They remain in the hospital as of 15 October, although their medical review has been completed. Chiwenga remained in daily contact with President Mnangagwa and is expected to return to Zimbabwe later this week.  Aftermath  Immediately after the blast, Mnangagwa was rushed away from the scene by his security personnel. His motorcade drove him to safety at the Bulawayo State House. Victims of the blast were evacuated to Mater Dei Hospital in Bulawayo, and Mnangagwa visited them there hours later. Later, the injured were moved to Manyame Air Base hospital in Harare. Presidential spokesman George Charamba told the state-owned Sunday Mail that the general elections scheduled for 30 July 2018 will be held as planned despite the blast, and said that a state of emergency would not be declared.  Domestic reactions  Shortly after the bombing, the attack was widely denounced by politicians and other public figures in Zimbabwe, while the media, beginning with the state-run Herald newspaper, soon labeled the attack an assassination attempt against President Mnangagwa. In an interview with the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation hours after the blast, Mnangagwa called the attack \\"cowardly\\", offered his thoughts and prayers to the victims, and insisted that the violence would not prevent the upcoming elections from being held. He said that the attack occurred \\"inches\\" from him, but said \\"it is not my time\\", noting that after a number of previous attempts on his life, he was used to it. Without elaborating, he said the perpetrators must have come from \\"outside Bulawayo\\", adding \\"I can assure you these are my normal enemies.\\" The attack was condemned by politicians of both ZANU–PF and opposition parties. First Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga, who sustained minor injuries in the blast, called the attack an \\"act of terror\\" and echoed Mnangagwa, adding that the blast would not affect the elections. Foreign Minister Sibusiso Moyo and former Vice President Joice Mujuru called for peace. Opposition leader and MDC–T presidential candidate Nelson Chamisa condemned the attack and urged the expunction of political violence in Zimbabwe. Other opposition politicians condemning the attack and offering condolences included former Finance Minister Tendai Biti, Senator David Coltart, MP Temba Mliswa, and lawyer and former MDC–T official Alex Magaisa. Notable civilians who denounced the attack included author and filmmaker Tsitsi Dangarembga, musician Thomas Mapfumo, businessman and philanthropist Strive Masiyiwa and his wife, newspaper publisher Trevor Ncube, and exiled judge Ben Paradza. Exiled former ZANU–PF government minister and G40 member Jonathan Moyo, who was expelled during the 2017 coup d'état, took a less sympathetic approach, comparing the blast to the November coup and tweeting \\"Violence begets violence.\\" Patrick Zhuwao, also an exiled G40 politician, urged British Prime Minister Theresa May to dispatch Scotland Yard to investigate the attack, citing the United States's deployment of Federal Bureau of Investigation personnel to investigate a bombing in Ethiopia that happened on the same day. Several days after the blast, several prominent ZANU–PF members, including President Mnangagwa, claimed that the attack was an \\"inside job\\" by dissident ZANU–PF members, and began directing blame towards members of the party's G40 faction. Prior to the 2017 coup, G40 was allied with former First Lady Grace Mugabe, who was Mnangagwa's rival to succeed her husband Robert Mugabe as President. On 26 June, a spokesman for the Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association (ZNLWVA), a Rhodesian Bush War veterans' group allied with ZANU–PF, told journalists that the ZNLWVA condemned the attack, demanded that police release more information, and argued \\"the evil political machinations of G40... cannot be ruled out as suspects.\\" Puparai Togarepi, secretary of the ZANU–PF Youth League, told journalists in Harare that they also believed \\"enemies surrounding Mnangagwa\\" were responsibly for the bombing. An exiled former G40 member and cabinet minister, Jonathan Moyo, tweeted that the attack \\"smacks of an inside job\\". Mnangagwa himself, in a 27 June interview with the BBC, said that he believed the G40 faction was responsible for the attack. Though he admitted this claim was a \\"hunch without evidence\\", he argued that it was \\"the logical and reasonable conclusion\\". Mnangagwa did direct blame at Grace Mugabe, who was in Singapore at the time of the blast, but said that she was \\"politically immature and was easily used as a tool by those who wanted to get at me.\\" The president added that concern about instability in Zimbabwe was unfounded and that the attack would not result in a security crackdown. At a 27 June event, ZANU–PF, the MDC–T, and several other parties signed a peace pledge ahead of the July elections, promising to refrain from hate speech and violence. There, Minister of Home Affairs and Culture Obert Mpofu, whose son was injured by the blast, condemned the \\"evil deed\\" and urged Zimbabweans not to capitalize on the grief of victims and their families. Speaking at the same event, Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission chair Elasto Mugwadi denounced the attack, adding \\"in protecting human rights, we all need to protect the sanctity of life.\\" Mugwadi appealed to all political parties to avoid hate speech, \\"provocative sloganeering\\" and emotional appeals.  International reactions  South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the Southern Africa Development Community, of which he is the chair, would evaluate the matter. The bombing was widely denounced internationally. Via Twitter, the Harare embassies of Australia, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, as well as the European Union's European External Action Service all condemned the attack and offered thoughts and prayers to the victims. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa condemned the bombing, stating that acts of violence and criminality had no place in the democratic process. Ramaphosa, who is also chair of the Southern African Development Community, said that the SADC would evaluate the matter and \\"take appropriate steps\\". At the 43rd Plenary Assembly Session of the SADC Parliamentary Forum in Luanda, Angolan President João Lourenço denounced the bombing as \\"cowardly, criminal, and undemocratic\\", adding that he saw the attacks in Bulawayo and Addis Ababa as efforts to undermine democratic elections in Zimbabwe and Ethiopia. The government of China also condemned the attack in a statement, adding that it hoped for continued stability and peaceful elections in Zimbabwe. Dewa Mavinhinga, Southern Africa director of Human Rights Watch, raised concerns that the bombing could trigger more political violence in an election year that, thus far, had been unmarred by the violence seen before previous elections. In a 29 June statement, former Botswana President Ian Khama condemned the bombing.  Investigations  The Zimbabwe National Army, along with the Zimbabwe Republic Police, clashed during investigations On the day of the attack, the Zimbabwe Republic Police offered an unspecified reward for information leading to the arrest of the perpetrator of the bombing. A police spokesperson said that crime scene investigators were examining the matter. In the days after the attack, unverified details and explanations regarding the attack were reported. One source reported that an explosive was placed underneath the stage on which Mnangagwa was standing, while another source quoted a woman in attendance at the rally who claimed she saw a young child throw a \\"package\\" at the stage just prior to the explosion. According to the woman's claim, which is uncorroborated, the child approached the state and asked to read a poem in praise of Mnangagwa, and was held back by security personnel but pushed through them and threw something towards the stage. On Wednesday, 27 June, 35 security and investigative personnel met in Harare to discuss the investigations. Later that day, police released new details about the perpetrator and details of the attack. After the blast, police interviewed witnesses, a number of whom reported that they saw the same man throw an object at the stage. Police described the suspect as a young male \\"between the ages of 23 and 25\\", about 1.7 meters tall and of dark complexion, who was wearing a yellow ZANU–PF T-shirt at the time of the attack. Witnesses told police that the man lobbed an item towards the stage from about 30 to 35 meters away, but the item missed its target after hitting a rope and then bouncing off a security officer's cheek before landing and detonating. The suspect was allegedly \\"fiddling around\\" with the object before throwing it. After the blast, police and military went after him, but witnesses said they saw soldiers get to him first and arrest him, police reported. The suspect has not been seen since the military apprehended him in the townships outside White City Stadium. The 27 June meeting highlighted rivalries between the Zimbabwe Defence Forces and the Zimbabwe Republic Police amidst the ongoing investigations. Presidential spokesman George Charamba noted that \\"unresolved leadership issues\\" were affecting investigations. These internal conflicts within ZANU–PF and between different security forces were paralleled by alleged tensions between President Mnangagwa and Vice-President Chiwenga, the former Commander of the Defence Forces and a major figure in the 2017 coup. Internal rivalries between Zimbabwean security forces were exacerbated, not alleviated, by the military's arrest of the alleged perpetrator. The military had not responded to the Zimbabwe Republic Police's requests for confirmation of the suspect's detainment, nor to police requests for their Criminal Investigations Department to interview the suspect. Police officials told the Zimbabwe Independent that although they had found some good leads through witness interviews, they lack access to the suspect, so the investigations cannot \\"proceed properly.\\" Currently, investigative units from the military, the police's Criminal Investigation Department, and the Central Intelligence Organisation are based in Bulawayo to investigate the attack. Current investigations lack coordination between the three groups, and there was even conflict over hotel accommodations for investigators. Police investigations concluded that the perpetrator must have been someone with some security background and training, and experience handling weapons. Police said that the way the grenade was handled and launched indicated at least basic security training. Police are currently investigating the source of the explosive, which they say could not have come from police, as they no longer use grenades since the November 2017 coup. Weapons experts are analyzing the debris from the explosion to determine what type of grenade was used and where it might have come from. Police say that their inability to question the suspect, who is in military custody, prevents them from asking about the weapon and its origin, and the suspect's motive. They said they thought he may have been a hired hitman. Investigations show that President Mnangagwa was the likely target of the attack, though investigators have not yet determined with certainty that it was an assassination attempt. Investigators and government officials told the Zimbabwe Independent that had the grenade not deflected off a rope, it likely would have detonated within a fatal distance of Mnangagwa. In a 27 June interview, Mnangagwa stated that he expected arrests to be made soon. Two suspects, residents of Bulawayo's Pumula suburb, reportedly appeared before a magistrate at the Tredgold Magistrates' Court in Bulawayo to answer charges regarding the 23 June bombing. The suspects were identified as John Zulu and Douglas Musekiwa, and it is unclear is one of these men was the suspect arrested by the military the day of the attack. Zulu and Musekiwa were later released without charges.

He played college basketball for the Wake Forest Demon Deacons. Born in Le Havre, France, he began his career at INSEP in Paris, competing with the amateur club Centre Fédéral de Basket-ball of the Nationale Masculine 1 (NM1). He became among of the most sought-after prospects of the class of 2018, and a consensus five-star recruit, after moving to Wesleyan Christian Academy in High Point, North Carolina. Early life Hoard was born in Le Havre, France to an American father and French mother, both with basketball experience. His father Antwon Hoard played for Murray State in college and spent multiple seasons in France in the LNB Pro A. His mother Katia Foucade played for the University of Washington and was a member of the French national team. Hoard's younger sister Anaia, one of four siblings, has played with the French national under-17 team. Besides, his godfather James Wade played professionally in Europe, and his godmother Edwige Lawson-Wade is a former Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) player who has represented the French national team on several occasions. Due to his deep family background in the sport, he became interested in basketball from a young age. Youth career In 2015, Hoard signed a two-year contract with the French athlete institute INSEP in Paris, joining affiliated club Centre Fédéral de Basket-ball (CFBB). With CFBB, Hoard competed in the Nationale Masculine 1, the third-tier division in France, for the 2015–16 season. In April 2015, he was named most valuable player (MVP) of the Jordan Brand Classic International Game, recording 16 points, 7 rebounds, and 5 steals. On April 16, 2016, Hoard recorded a season- high 23 points, shooting 9-of-15 from the field, in a win over Caen Basket Calvados. He finished the NM1 season averaging 8.0 points, 3.5 rebounds, 1.6 assists, and 1.1 steals per game. High school career In the summer of 2016, Hoard arrived in the United States to begin playing basketball for Wesleyan Christian Academy in High Point, North Carolina. He was encouraged to join the program because his father had become friends with its head coach Keith Gatlin during his playing career. After making the move, Hoard said, \\"I just felt like it was time to come over here and compete against the best. A lot of people know me for basketball in France, but I want to make it over here. This is where all the talent is so I want to prove myself.\\" Entering the season, Wesleyan was ranked among the top-10 in the nation by MaxPreps, and in the top-20 by USA Today High School Sports. In the beginning of the season, he spent time adjusting to the American style of basketball. Hoard was rated as a five-star recruit and considered one of the best players of the 2018 class. He was ranked 22nd in the class of 2018 by ESPN. College career On August 26, 2017, Hoard committed to attend and play for Wake Forest University. Before the start of the 2018-19 season, Hoard was named to the Julius Erving Award preseason watchlist. On November 10, 2018, Hoard scored 19 points and 13 rebounds in a 90-78 win against North Carolina A&T.; On November 18, 2018, the Demon Deacons would defeat Valparaiso 69-63 behind Hoard's 14 points and 9 rebounds. On January 2, 2019, he scored 23 points and 15 rebounds in an 83-61 victory over Cornell. On January 15, 2019, Hoard scored 16 points and 10 rebounds in a 71-67 victory over NC State. On February 5, 2019, Hoard tallied 19 points and a career high 17 rebounds in a win over Pittsburgh. As a freshman at Wake Forest, Hoard averaged 13.1 points, 7.6 rebounds, and 1.5 assist per game. National team career Hoard made his debut with the French youth national team at the 2015 FIBA Europe Under-16 Championship in Kaunas, Lithuania. In his first game at the event, he recorded 16 points and 6 rebounds to help defeat Croatia. At the tournament, he averaged 7.7 points, 4.0 rebounds, and 1.2 steals per game, leading France to a fifth-place finish. In April 2016, Hoard represented France at the Albert Schweitzer Tournament, playing six games and averaging 7.0 points, 2.0 rebounds, and 1.3 steals per game, en route to fourth place. He was considered one of the top prospects from the event, although basketball website NBAdraft.net said that he \\"underachieved.\\" However, Hoard drew attention later in the year, at the 2016 FIBA Under-17 World Championship, held in Zaragoza, Spain. He averaged a team- high 22.4 points, 5.7 rebounds, 3.1 assists, and 1.7 steals per game, as France finished in sixth place. On June 23, 2016, in his opening game, Hoard erupted for 41 points against South Korea, shooting 15-of-28 from the field. The performance tied the tournament's single-game scoring record set by Isaac Humphries in 2014. Professional career Portland Trail Blazers (2019–present) Hoard went undrafted in the 2019 NBA Draft. On July 1, 2019, Hoard signed a two-way contract with the Portland Trail Blazers. On October 27, 2019, Hoard was assigned to the Texas Legends of the NBA G League by the Portland Trail Blazers. Hoard was part of Portland's roster that participated at the 2020 NBA Bubble.

Both parents were grandchildren of the Persian king Fath-Ali Shah Qajar. He therefore grew up in one of the most powerful and influential aristocratic families in Iran of the era.[Manoutchehr M. Eskandari-Qajar, Tarikh-e 'Azodi. Life at the court of the early Qajar shahs, Mage Publishers, Washington D.C. 2014, pp. 19-20. ] Since childhood he belonged to the small group of intimate friends and relatives of his cousin Naser al-Din Shah Qajar.[Abbas Amanat, Pivot of the Universe. Nasir al-Din Shah and the Iranian Monarchy, 1831-1896, University of California Press, 1997. ] In 1854 he received the title Eyn ol-Molk and two years later he became Khan Salar, Master of the Royal Kitchens, one of the most important and responsible jobs at court as it entailed preventing any possible attempt at poisoning the monarch. Around 1860 he married his cousin Princess Ezzat od-Doleh, sister of Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, after she divorced her second husband Mirza Kazem Khan 'Nezam ol-Molk'. In 1861 he was chosen as ilkhan (chief) of the Qajars (tribe) and in 1863 he was appointed Governor of Mazandaran, Gorgan and Astarabad and sometime later also of Qazvin, Khuzestan, Mahallat, Shahroud and Bastam. From 1865 he was commander-in-chief of the armies of Mazandaran, Gorgan and Gilan. The actual work in the provinces was done by his half brother Mohammad Ali Khan, as his responsibilities as Khan Salar made it necessary to remain in the proximity of the Shah. In 1864 he was presented with the title Etezad od-Doleh; a title once carried by his great grandfather. In 1866 the Shah gave him the rank of commander-in-chief of Artillery, but the same year he died of the Plague. He had issue with Ezzat od-Doleh and with other wives (among them Ghodrat Malek Khanoum). The descendants in the male line later took the family name Sepahbody (Sepahbodi) as a reference to Shir Khan's military rank. Two of his daughters married to Seyyed Sadr ed-Din 'Sadr ol-Ashraf I' from Mahallat, the uncle of Mohsen Sadr. Through one of his sons Shir Khan is the great grandfather of Farhad Sepahbody and through one of this daughters Shir Khan is the great great grandfather of Hossein Eslambolchi.

Built in 1960, the school joined another existing secondary institution in the city - Owen Sound Collegiate and Vocational Institute (OSCVI). Serving the community for over half a century, the school closed in 2016 and amalgamated with OSCVI. The building is now used for the current Owen Sound high school, Owen Sound District Secondary School.  History  Plans to build a new secondary school in Owen Sound began in 1947, with the creation of an expansion program by the Ontario Board of Education. The job of designing the school was given to the architecture firm Jackson, Ypes and Associates of Willowdale, Ontario. The location of the new school, in a field across from the West Rocks Conservation Area, had once served as pastures for farmers on the west side of Owen Sound. The datestone for the building was laid on June 1, 1960. West Hill was opened to students in September of the same year, with Gordon H. Bailey serving as the first principal.  Amalgamation  The Bluewater Accommodation Review Committee (ARC) began assessing the financial situations of schools in Grey and Bruce counties as early as September 2015. At a meeting in February 2016, the Bluewater District School Board recommended the consolidation of the two Owen Sound high schools under their jurisdiction - OSCVI and West Hill. The amalgamation of West Hill and OSCVI was finally approved at a meeting of Bluewater district trustees on April 19, 2016. In September 2016, the new high school, Owen Sound District Secondary School (OSDSS) was opened in the former West Hill building.

The resources of the crew are taxed to the utmost in trying to cope with a storm which, evidently arising suddenly, eventually drives the vessel on a lee shore, apparently wrecked with loss of all hands. Alonso speaks to the boatswain kindly, Antonio and Sebastian with scorn and abuse, and Lord Gonzalo' is cheerful and witty to the last. -  center;\\"  I  center;\\"  2  style=\\"max- width:300px;\\"  The island. Before Prospero's cell.  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  596 Prospero and his daughter Miranda are standing in front of their home on an island. Miranda has just witnessed the shipwreck, and, overwhelmed with grief at the suffering of those on board, she pleadingly entreats her father, who by his art has raised the storm, to quell its ravages. In justiﬁcation, the old man narrates his own history antecedent to this shipwreck. Twelve years ago Prospero was Duke of Milan. Passionately devoted to his studies, he neglected dukedom and placed its management in the hands of his jealous brother Antonio. The latter confederated with Alonso, the King of Naples, to hold Milan as the ﬁef of his crown, obtaining in return the aid of a Neapolitan army. With the help thus furnished, Antonio made himself master of Milan and ruthlessly turned the lawful duke and his infant daughter adrift in an open and worthless boat. Fortunately, Gonzalo, who reluctantly carried out his master's orders, provided the castaways with the necessaries of life and a bundle of books from Prospero's library. They were cast upon this island — their home ever since. Miranda is soothed to sleep. Prospero's summons Ariel, his spirit servant. From a conversation between the two, we learn that Sycorax, a witch and mother of the monster Caliban, was in former days banished from Argiers, and turned loose upon this island. For a dozen years this witch imprisoned Ariel in the trunk of a tree. Prospero, on arriving on the island, freed Ariel. In gratitude, Ariel has served Propero since then, who has further promised Ariel complete freedom on the accomplishment of certain tasks. Ariel recounts his management of the storm, and how he had provided that nobody died. All, safely landed, were dispersed in groups throughout the island. Ferdinand, King Alonso's son, almost frantic in despair, was sitting alone in an out-of-the- way creek, imagining that he alone was saved. When Ariel has fully reported his exploits, Miranda awakens. Her father suggests a visit to Caliban, his slave. This monster had, on the death of his mother, become lord of the island, where he was found by Prospero. Prospero says he at first treated Caliban kindness, teaching him language and astronomy, but soon perceived that the monster was only ﬁt for serfdom. Suddenly reappearing, Ariel leads Prince Ferdinand into the scene. The prince and Miranda fall in love at first sight. Prospero, however, treats the prince harshly, accusing him of being a spy. Miranda endeavors to mitigate her father's harshness. -  center;\\"  II  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  1  style=\\"max-width:300px;\\"  Another part of the island.  right;\\"  359  On another part of the island are King Alonso, Antonio, Gonzalo, Sebastian, Adrian, Francisco, and others. Alonso grieves because he believes his only son, Ferdinand, is drowned. Gonzalo tries to comfort him with little success. Antonio, Sebastian, and Adrian discuss the recent marriage of Alonso's only daughter Claribel and the Prince of Tunis, from whose wedding they were traveling home. Ariel enters and magically puts to sleep everyone except Antonio and Sebastian. Antonio suggests that Sebastian should murder his brother, King Alonso, and thus himself become King of Naples. They almost do so when the others awake. -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  II  center;\\"  2  style=\\"max- width:300px;\\"  Another part of the island.  right;\\"  170  Caliban is at work on his daily chores when Trinculo, the court jester, arrives.

They are almost overcome by exhaustion, but Sebastian and Antonio are glad that another opportunity will soon be afforded them of carrying out their plot upon Alonso. Invisible to all, Prospero and Ariel enter. A sumptuous banquet is provided before the eyes of the starving courtiers, who are invited to eat, and as they are about to partake, the feast is snatched away by an unseen hand. Ariel now upbraids them for their former crimes, especially the ‘three men of sin,' Alonso, Sebastian, and Antonio. Believing Ariel's voice to be their own evil conscience, they rush off in frantic despair. Gonzalo urges the other members of the company to follow in haste to prevent, if possible, any disaster. -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  IV  center;\\"  1  style=\\"max- width:300px;\\"  Before Prospero's cell.  right;\\"  285  Prospero agrees to the betrothal of Ferdinand and Miranda. Following some fatherly advice to Miranda, he furnishes, for their entertainment, a masque, enacted by Ariel and Ariel's fellows. Ariel enters to say that Stephano, Trinculo, and Caliban are now on their way, still intent on their murderous project. At Prospero's command, Ariel places upon a line some ‘trumpery' taken from Prospero's wardrobe, to catch, as he says, these thieves. Having entered, the drunken three now load themselves with the trumpery. Prospero sends after them his servant sprites, disguised as hounds, eventually driving the thieves into a stagnant pool. -  center;\\"  V  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  1  style=\\"max-width:300px;\\"  Before Prospero's cell.  right;\\"  361  Ariel brings Alonso and his followers to Prospero to hear the sentence which Prospero is about to pronounce. Prospero reveals himself to his brother and to Alonso. Alonso, smitten with remorse, offers to resign the dukedom of Milan and bewails the loss of his son. Prospero remarks that he, too, has lost a daughter, and then, withdrawing a curtain, Ferdinand and Miranda are disclosed, playing at chess. Ariel brings in the master and the boatswain, from whom we learn that the ship has been reﬁtted, that the crew are all safe, and that nobody has died. The wandering plotters, Sebastian and Trinculo, are also brought before Prospero to receive sentence. It is a light one, merely to trim and arrange Prospero's cell for the company's reception.

The NSA is responsible for global monitoring, collection, and processing of information and data for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence Liberian communications networks and information systems. The NSA relies on a variety of measures to accomplish its mission, the majority of which are clandestine. The National Security Agency (NSA) is a merger of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) which was responsible for covert and overt security investigations, whilst the Executive Action Bureau (EAB) was responsible for carrying out clandestine activities for the Executives.  History   Formation  The origins of the National Security Organization can be traced back to the 1950s, where there existed only rudimentary security services. In 1955, largely as a consequence of an alleged attempt of the life of the president, a series of securities bodies were reorganized or created. Between 1955 and 1966, the following came into existence: National Police Force (NPF) (first organized in 1924 and reorganized in the 1950s); National Bureau of Investigation (NBI); National Central Bureau (INTERPOL); Executive Action Bureau (EAB); National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS); Special Security Service (SSS); and Office of National Security. The foregoing represent President William V.S. Tubman Security organizations. President William R. Tolbert Jr., effected mergers and reorganization so that the National Security during the administration of President Tubman, similar function to that of the EAB was carried out by the National Intelligence Service (NISS), but on the highest national level. Conversely, the NISS was dissolved following the death of President Tubman and the subsequent taking over of power by President Williams R. Tolbert, Jr., leaving the EAB at the time as the only clandestine agency. On May 20, 1974, an act repealing sub- chapter D of Chapter 1, Part 1 and subchapter B of Chapter 22, Part II of the Executive Law in Relation to the EAB and the NBI, and creating the NSA was approved. The NSA was left as the only agency solely responsible for gathering national security intelligence, but having to conduct special investigations, whenever the need arises. Later, on August 30, 1974, the Act creating the National Security Agency (NSA) was published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Monrovia, Liberia.  Mission  The National Security Agency (NSA) leads the Government of Liberia in cryptology that encompasses both Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) and Information Assurance (IA) products and services, and enables Computer Network Operations (CNO) in order to gain a decision advantage for the Nation and our allies under all circumstances.

Carl Hostmann founded an Ironworks based on supposed both coal- and orefields in this area. Though there were then found no sufficient coal fields, the company, named \\"Bergbau und Hüttengesellschaft zu Peine\\" was established in 1853. This company ended in insolvency during an economical crisis in 1858. Under Fritz Hurtzig and Carl Haarmann on September 6, 1858 the \\"Aktiengesellschaft Ilseder Hütte\\" was taking over the assets, and in 1861 the production started. Despite the site's unfavorable geographical situation, the factory prospered and rapidly expanded its business. In the era of the German Empire, the company became a major player in Germany's coal and steel industry. In 1872 a rolling mill was added and in 1879 a third blast furnace started work. In 1928 the Ilseder Hütte took a 10 billion US-$ loan from the National City Bank of New York. In 1929 the opening of the Mittelland Canal reduced the transport's costs. World War II caused no damage and the company expanded up to 1970s economic crisis.  Mergers  In 1970 the company merged with the state-owned Salzgitter AG. The ore mining ended in 1978 and in 1983 the last blast furnace was shut down. In 1989 the company became part of PreussagThe Preussag, at this time was an industrial holding company that changed later on its business field to tourism Preussag stopped in 1995 the remaining productive parts such as coking plant, power plant and by-products. The area became an industrial park. The blowing engine building is in use for various events whereas the steam production building was torn down in spring 2010.

This is achieved by sending the network traffic to multiple destinations on an Ethernet network. As a concept related to computer networking, it includes three types of Ethernet modes: broadcast, unicast and multicast Ethernet. BUM traffic refers to that kind of network traffic that will be forwarded to multiple destinations or that cannot be addressed to the intended destination only.Deploying ACI: The complete guide to planning, configuring, and managing Application Centric Infrastructure, Frank Dagenhardt, Jose Moreno and Bill Dufresne, 12 feb 2018 by Cisco PressIP Multicast, Volume I: Cisco IP Multicast Networking by Josh Loveless, Ray Blair and Arvind Durai, 12 Oct 2016 by Cisco Press. Part of the Networking Technology series  Overview  Example of Broadcast traffic Example of Unknown unicast traffic where A is the source and B is the \\"unknown\\" destination Example of Multicast traffic to five destinations Broadcast traffic is used to transmit a message to any reachable destination in the network without the need to know any information about the receiving party. When broadcast traffic is received by a network switch it is replicated to all ports within the respective VLAN except the one from which the traffic comes from. Unknown-unicast traffic happens when a switch receives unicast traffic intended to be delivered to a destination that is not in its forwarding information base. In this case the switch marks the frame for flooding and sends it to all forwarding ports within the respective VLAN. Forwarding this type of traffic can create unnecessary traffic that leads to poor network performance or even a complete loss of network service. This flooding of packets is known as a traffic storm.Juniper Networks TechLibrary Security Feature Guide Multicast traffic allows a host to contact a subset of hosts or devices joined into a group. This causes the message to be broadcast when no group management mechanism is present. Flooding BUM frames is required in transparent bridging and in a data center context this does not scale well causing poor performance.  BUM traffic control   Throttling  One issue that may arise is that some network devices cannot handle high rates of broadcast, unknown-unicast or multicast traffic. In such cases, it is possible to limit the BUM traffic for specific ports in order to have a control on the number of packets or bytes that are flooded on the VLAN to other devices. This threshold is represented in kilobits per second] (kbps), and it can be set for broadcast rate, multicast rate and unknown unicast rate independently.Limiting Broadcast, Multicast, and Unknown Unicast Traffic (BUM)  Network port security  In the case of unknown-unicast traffic, a security issue may arise. To prevent flooding unknown-unicast traffic across the switch, it is possible to configure the network equipment to divert unknown-unicast traffic to specific trunk interfaces in order to split broadcast coming from different VLANs or to use specific trunk interfaces for multiple VLANs.Rate limiting unknown unicast forwarding  BUM handling in VxLAN  The use of VXLAN as overlay technology allows providing data link layer connectivity services between endpoints that may be deployed across network layer network domains. Since those endpoints are logically part of the same data link layer domain, they must be capable of sending and receiving data link layer multi- destination frames (BUM traffic). BUM traffic can be exchanged across network layer network boundaries by encapsulating it into VXLAN packets addressed to a multicast group, so to leverage the network for traffic replication services.Cisco-paper:737855 In Data Plane Learning the broadcast traffic is flooded to multicast group members. In Control Plane Learning addresses are collected and forwarded via BGP. Broadcast traffic is suppressed and VTEP reply to the caller directly. VxLAN can handle BUM in two ways: Multicast and Head End Replication. Multicast is the most common and each VNI (VxLAN Network Identifier) is mapped to a single multicast group, while each multicast group may map to one or more VNIs. When VTEP comes alive it uses the protocol IGMP to join the multicast groups for the VNIs it uses. When VTEP has to send BUM traffic it will send it only to the relevant multicast group. This is a method for VTEP discovery. Head End Replication is only available if using BGP EVPN. It is less efficient than multicast and does not scale well but it is simpler to implement if you do not have a multicast enabled infrastructure. In Host End Replication, when bum arrives, the VTEP creates several unicast packets and sends one to each VTEP that supports the VNI.  BUM handling in EVPN  Dual home device and all-active load-balancing Ethernet VPN (EVPN) and Provider Backbone Bridging EVPN (PBB-EVPN) are next generation solutions that provide Ethernet multipoint services over MPLS networks. In EVPN operations, the Provider Edge (PE) routers automatically discover each other when connected on the same ethernet segment and select a Designated Forwarder (DF) responsible for forwarding BUM traffic.Cisco-paper:731864 In a VXLAN-EVPN, MAC learning occurs via the control plane instead of data plane. Furthermore, it is accepted only traffic from VTEPs whose information is learnt via the control plane, otherwise it is dropped. This presents a secure fabric where traffic will only be forwarded between VTEPs validated by the control plane.Configuring VXLAN BGP-EVPN  See also  * VXLAN * Data Center * Transparent bridging  References  Category:Computer networking Category:Ethernet Category:Network topology ","title":"Broadcast, unknown-unicast and multicast traffic"},{"id":"57763011","text":"Muferihat Kamil (Amharic: ሙፈሪሃት ካሚል, mufärihat kamil) is an Ethiopian politician who was the Speaker of the House of People's Representatives and is currently the Minister of Peace of and the Chairwoman of the SEPDM (Southern Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement), one of the four parties that make up the ruling coalition in Ethiopia, the EPRDF.

The Church generally condemns all forms of violence against gay and lesbian people and all criminal penalties against them. However, the Church in certain countries has on occasion actively resisted efforts to decriminalize homosexuality or to introduce measures to tackle discrimination. The Catholic Church also supports legally defining marriage in civil legislation as the union of one man and one woman, therefore generally opposing efforts to introduce gay civil unions and gay marriage – although some clergymen have expressed support for same-sex unions. The Church teaches that not all discrimination is \\"unjust,\\" and that sometimes the rights of individuals, including gay men and women, can be limited. The Church is active in local, national, and international forums. Dignity and rights of gay men and women The Church holds that all people, including those who are LGBT, are made in the image and likeness of God, giving every human an inherent dignity. This inherent dignity forms \\"the bedrock\\" of Catholic Social Teaching. There is nothing that can diminish a person's \\"inherent and immeasurable worth and dignity\\" or the sacredness of their life, both of which \\"must always be respected in word, in action and in law.\\" Given their inherent dignity, the Catholic Church advocates for and defends the fundamental human rights \\"of every person, irrespective of sexual orientation,\\" including the right \\"to be treated by individuals and by society with dignity, respect and fairness.\\" Church teaching also includes the \\"duty to oppose discrimination in all circumstances where a person's sexual orientation or activity cannot reasonably be regarded as relevant.\\" A 1992 letter from Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger condemned gay bashing. It said that LGBT people \\"have the same rights as all persons including the right of not being treated in a manner which offends their personal dignity,\\" and have the right to work, to housing, and others. It adds that: > It is deplorable that homosexual persons have been and are the object of > violent malice in speech or in action. Such treatment deserves condemnation > from the Church's pastors wherever it occurs. It reveals a kind of disregard > for others which endangers the most fundamental principles of a healthy > society. The intrinsic dignity of each person must always be respected in > word, in action and in law. But at the same time Ratzinger suggested that anti-gay violence could be the fault of victims if they push too hard to seek equal rights, thereby absolving responsibility by those who engage in violent behaviour: > When civil legislation is introduced to protect behavior to which no one has > any conceivable right, neither the church nor society at large should be > surprised when other distorted notions and practices gain ground and > irrational and violent reactions increase. The Church does also teach that rights to public housing, employment in certain industries, or other areas are not absolute and that they can, and sometimes should, be limited for people of all orientations to \\"protect the common good.\\" Acting is this way does not constitute unjust discrimination. The Church teaches that sexual orientation is different from qualities such as race, ethnicity, sex, or age in that it is usually not known unless disclosed. The Bishops' Conference of England and Wales wrote in 1979 that the Church \\"has a serious responsibility to work for the elimination of any injustices perpetrated on homosexuals by society. As a group that has suffered more than its share of oppression and contempt, the homosexual community has particular claim upon the concern of the Church.\\" In 2014, the United Nation's Committee on the Rights of the Child expressed concern in a report about the Holy See's past statements and declarations on homosexuality which it said \\"contribute to the social stigmatization of and violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender adolescents and children raised by same sex couples.\\" The Committee urged the Holy See to \\"make full use of its moral authority to condemn all forms of harassment, discrimination or violence against children based on their sexual orientation or the sexual orientation of their parents and to support efforts at international level for the decriminalisation of homosexuality.\\" The Church had already done so in 2008. Decriminalization of homosexuality National level Cardinal Oswald Gracias condemned \\"all forms of unjust discrimination, harassment or abuse\\" against LGBT people. In various countries, members of the Catholic Church have intervened on occasions both to both support efforts to decriminalize homosexuality, and also to ensure it remains an offence under criminal law. In the 1960s, the Catholic Church supported the call of the Wolfenden report to introduce legislation to decriminalise homosexual acts in England and Wales. In Australia, Cardinal Archbishop Norman Thomas Gilroy supported efforts begun in the 1970s to likewise change the law. In the United States the Catholic National Federation of Priests' Councils declared their opposition to \\"all civil laws which make consensual homosexual acts between adults a crime.\\" In New Zealand in the 1980s, although the Church declined to submit a formal response to the parliamentary enquiry on decriminalization, Cardinal Williams did issue a statement opposing homosexual law reform. In the 1970s and 1980s in Belize, and India, the local churches opposed the decriminalization of homosexual acts. These positions were against those of the Vatican. However, in later years, Cardinal Oswald Gracias, the archbishop of Mumbai, spoke out against India's anti-sodomy law. Gracias, a President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of India and one of the eight members of Pope Francis's Council of Cardinal Advisers, declared it wrong to make gay people criminals, since the Catholic Church \\"teaches that homosexuals have the same dignity of every human being and condemns all forms of unjust discrimination, harassment or abuse.\\" Days after a law was signed criminalizing homosexual acts in Nigeria, an editorial in \\"The Southern Cross\\" (a newspaper run jointly by the bishops of South Africa, Botswana and Swaziland) criticised the law, calling on the Catholic Church in Africa to stand with the powerless and \\"sound the alarm at the advance throughout Africa of draconian legislation aimed at criminalizing homosexuals.\\" It noted the \\"deep-seated sense of homophobia\\" in Africa and said the Catholic church had too often been \\"silent, in some cases even quietly complicit\\" in the face of the new anti-gay measures. At least one bishop argued that the Catholic Church would \\"defend any person with a homosexual orientation who is being harassed, who is being imprisoned, who is being punished.\\" Reports suggested that the influence of Pope Francis may have led to him modify his former position. In Uganda, some bishops joined other religious leaders in calling on parliamentarians to make progress in enacting an anti-homosexuality bill. In 2015, Bishop Giuseppe Franzelli in the Diocese of Lira, denied that the Catholic Church in Uganda is institutionally behind any push towards anti-gay legislation, and called for \\"respect and love\\" for gay people. Rather he blamed fundamentalist US Christian groups as well as \\"individual Catholics, including some bishops,\\" for encouraging greater criminal sanctions. The Papal Nuncio to Uganda, Archbishop Michael Blume, voiced concern and shock at the bill. In Kenya, Bishop Alfred Rotich welcomed a ruling from the High Court in May 2019 which upheld the laws against gay sex. At the United Nations Archbishop Tomasi expressed concern that a UN resolution marked the start of a move to \\"insert gay rights in the global human rights agenda.\\" In 2008, the Holy See, as an observer at the United Nations, called for an end to unjust discrimination and criminal penalties directed against homosexuals. They have opposed, however, a U.N. resolution against violence, discrimination, and criminalization of LGBT people, saying that the wording of the resolution \\"goes well beyond the above-mentioned and shared intent\\" of eliminating discrimination and would pressure countries into legalizing gay marriage. Speaking on the floor of the General Assembly, Archbishop Celestino Migliore, the Holy See's representative at the United Nations General Assembly, said: \\"The Holy See appreciates the attempts made [in the draft declaration] to condemn all forms of violence against homosexual persons as well as urges States to take necessary measures to put an end to all criminal penalties against them,\\" but added that its failure to define the terms \\"sexual orientation\\" and \\"gender identity\\" would produce \\"serious uncertainty\\" and \\"undermine the ability of States to enter into and enforce new and existing human rights conventions and standards.\\" He added in an interview that the proposed declaration would put pressure on countries to enact gay marriage and allow gay couples to adopt children. At the 16th session of the UN Human Rights Council in 2011, during discussion of a Joint Statement on Ending Violence and Related Human Rights Violations Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, the Holy See's representative, Archbishop Silvano Maria Tomasi, stated: \\"A state should never punish a person, or deprive a person of the enjoyment of any human right, based just on the person's feelings and thoughts, including sexual thoughts and feelings. But states can, and must, regulate behaviors, including various sexual behaviors. Throughout the world, there is a consensus between societies that certain kinds of sexual behaviors must be forbidden by law. Pedophilia and incest are two examples.\\" He later said of that resolution that recognizing gay rights would cause discrimination against religious leaders and that there was concern lest consequent legislation would lead to \\"natural marriages and families\\" being \\"socially downgraded.\\" On 28 January 2012, the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, gave a speech calling on African nations to repeal laws that place sanctions on homosexual conduct. Speaking to a journalist, African Cardinal Robert Sarah, president of the Pontifical Council Cor Unum, called the speech stupid. He added: 'Poor countries like Africa just accept it because it's imposed upon them through money, through being tied to aid.'\\" He said that African bishops must react against this move against African culture. Meanwhile, Cardinal Peter Turkson, while recognising that some of the sanctions imposed on homosexuals in Africa are an \\"exaggeration,\\" stated that the \\"intensity of the reaction is probably commensurate with tradition.\\" \\"Just as there's a sense of a call for rights, there's also a call to respect culture, of all kinds of people,\\" he said. \\"So, if it's being stigmatized, in fairness, it's probably right to find out why it is being stigmatized.\\" He also called for distinction to be made between human rights and moral issues. Discrimination laws At a 2009 United Nations event, the Church spoke out against all forms of violence and unjust discrimination directed towards LGBT people, and opposed \\"all violent or discriminatory penal legislation\\" that undermines the inherent dignity of the human person. Australia In 2018, the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference joined the Anglican Diocese of Sydney to publicly call for a religious freedom act to protect religious exemptions to discrimination laws. They said that their teaching \\"makes it clear that a gay person should be assessed for employment on the same basis as anyone else” and that \\"staff in a school could reasonably be expected to support the teachings of the particular religion, to not undermine that teaching and to act as role models to their students.\\" Poland In 1997, Catholic bishops in Poland were successful in opposing the introduction of provisions into the country's constitution that would bar discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. In 2010, the European Union criticized schools and colleges owned by the Catholic Church in Poland for refusing to employ staff that were openly gay. In January 2013, the Catholic Church in Poland publicly thanked members of parliament for voting down a bill that would have allowed same-sex civil partnerships. Archbishop Marek Jędraszewski has called \\"gender ideology\\" an \\"extremely dangerous ideology that leads directly to the death of our civilization\\". During a sermon on August 1, 2019, Jędraszewski called \\"LGBT ideology\\" a \\"rainbow plague\\" and compared it to the \\"Red Plague\\" of Communism. United States In 1975, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops taught that LGBT people \\"should not suffer prejudice against their basic human rights. They have the right to respect, friendship and justice.\\" The following year, Richmond Bishop Walter Sullivan wrote in the Richmond News Leader that “The issue before our community and the [human rights] commission, however, is not the morality of a person’s sexual orientation, but rather a person’s rights and protection under the law. We believe that a person’s sexual orientation, whether it is one we approve or disapprove, is not a proper ground for depriving that person of the basic rights and protections that belong to all human beings.\\" In 1983, the bishops of the State of Washington stated that \\"There are those who think that gays and lesbians inevitably impart a homosexual value system to children or that they molest children. This is a prejudice and must be unmasked as such. There is no evidence that exposure to homosexuals, of itself, harms a child.... Accordingly, there is no need to make efforts to screen out all homosexually oriented persons from our educational system.\\" In 1992, voters in the State of Oregon were asked to vote on a Constitutional amendment that declared homosexuality, pedophilia, sadism or masochism to be \\"abnormal, wrong, unnatural and perverse and they are to be discouraged and avoided.\\" The first two religious leaders to oppose the measure were Bishops William Levada and Thomas Connolly. Connolly said the measure was not \\"fair, just, or appropriate\\" and that it \\"could produce very bad results.\\" He said that the state should not \\"condemn [people] for who they are, and it's wrong to deny them basic human rights.\\" Levada said the amendment was \\"potentially harmful and discriminatory to homosexual citizens\\" and prohibited petitions for the amendment to be circulated on church property. Following regular meetings with members of DignityUSA, Cardinal John O'Connor of New York agreed to support an anti-hate crime bill protecting LGBT people in 1997. Also in that year, in Always our Children, the US bishops taught that \\"the fundamental human rights of homosexual persons must be defended and that all of us must strive to eliminate any form of injustice, oppression, or violence against them.\\" In 2013, the United States Conference of Bishops opposed a bill that would prohibit discrimination in hiring and employment on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity by civilian, nonreligious employers with at least 15 employees. While they expressed their belief that \\"no one should be an object of scorn, hatred, or violence for any reason, including sexual inclination,\\" the bishops declared: \\"We have a moral obligation to oppose any law that would be so likely to contribute to legal attempts to redefine marriage.\\" The U.S Conference of Catholic Bishops intervened in 2017 in the Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. It filed a friend- of-the-court brief in support of the baker who had refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple. It was joined by other Catholic organisations including the Colorado Catholic Conference, Catholic Bar Association, Catholic Medical Association, National Association of Catholic Nurses-USA and National Catholic Bioethics Centre. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the baker. Courts have upheld the dismissal of church employees for entering into same sex marriages. DignityUSA reports that more than 100 employees of Catholic institutions across the US have lost their posts from 2014-17 for being gay or for marrying a same-sex spouse. Same-sex marriage and civil unions A same-sex wedding ceremony The Catholic Church has intervened in national political discourses to enact legislative and constitutional provisions establishing marriage as the union of a man and a woman, in line with the Church's teaching on marriage. In the United States, the leadership of the Catholic Church has taken an active and financial role in political campaigns across all states regarding same-sex marriage. In July 2003, the hierarchy of the Catholic Church in Canada, the country's plurality religion, protested the Chrétien government's plans to include same-sex couples in civil marriage. In Spain and Portugal, Catholic leaders led the opposition to same-sex marriage, urging their followers to vote against it. The Irish Bishops Conference stated in their submission to a constitutional convention that, if the civil definition of marriage was changed to include same-sex marriage, so that it differed from the church's own definition, they could no longer perform civil functions at weddings. Church leaders have also opposed the introduction of gay marriage in Australia, the United Kingdom, Uruguay, Cameroon, Italy, Croatia, the Philippines, and Nigeria. Acceptance and blessings for same-sex unions Cathedral of Our Lady in Antwerp There has been some dissent expressed in recent years by senior and notable figures in the Catholic Church on whether support should be given for homosexual unions. The Bishop of Antwerp, Johan Bonny, called in 2016 for the Church to devise a blessing for homosexual couples that would recognize the \\"exclusiveness and stability\\" of such unions. German Bishop Franz-Josef Bode has argued that debate should begin on permitting the blessing of same-sex unions in Catholic churches in Germany. German cardinal Reinhard Marx has suggested that blessings in Catholic churches for same-sex unions should be considered on a case by case basis. Cardinal Rainer Woelki, the Archbishop of Berlin, has noted the values of fidelity and reliability found in gay relationships. Over 260 Catholic theologians, particularly from Germany, Switzerland and Austria, signed a memorandum in January and February 2011, called Church 2011. It said that the Church's esteem for marriage and celibacy \\"does not require the exclusion of people who responsibly live out love, faithfulness, and mutual care in same- sex partnerships or in a remarriage after divorce.\\" Transgender issues Responding to a document published by the United States Department of Education regarding transgender students, the bishops of the United States said that \\"children, youth, and parents in these difficult situations deserve compassion, sensitivity, and respect.\\" However, they criticized the document for \\"infringing on legitimate concerns about privacy and security on the part of the other young students and parents\\" when allowing transgender students to use facilities designated for the gender with which they identify. The bishops said the government did \\"not even attempt to achieve this balance\\" and pointed to the words of Pope Francis: \\"the young need to be helped to accept their own body as it was created.\\" The bishops of England and Wales had concerns about a proposed 2017 law that would affect transgender youths in schools, and wanted to \\"ensure that there is no bullying of any sort.\\" The Catholic Parliamentary Office in Scotland opposed allowing children as young as 16 to legally change their gender. Diplomatic disagreements In January 2015, the French government announced that it was proposing Laurent Stefanini as its ambassador to the Holy See. Stefanini was chief of protocol for President François Hollande and had served as France's Head of Mission to the Vatican from 2001 to 2005. Cardinal André Vingt-Trois, Archbishop of Paris, sent a letter to Pope Francis in support of Stefanini, a practicing Roman Catholic who is reported to be gay, but has not spoken publicly of his sexuality, nor entered into a legal same-sex relationship. He publicly supported the legalization of same-sex marriage in France in 2013. The Pope met with Stefanini for forty minutes on 17 April. By October the Vatican had neither accepted nor rejected the appointment, and press speculation blamed either Stefanini's sexual orientation, France's recent legalization of same-sex marriage, or Vatican displeasure with the fact that the nomination was leaked for political reasons. France named Stefanini its ambassador to UNESCO in April 2016.

United States, 568 U.S. 266 (2013), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held regardless of whether a legal question was settled or unsettled at the time of trial, an error is “plain” within the meaning of Rule 52(b) of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure so long as the error was plain at the time of appellate review..  Background  Armarcion D. Henderson pleaded guilty to possessing a firearm while being a felon; a federal violation. The sentencing guideline range was 33–41 months, but the judge sentenced Henderson to 60 months to ensure that he had the opportunity to enrol in the Bureau of Prisons drug program. Henderson's counsel did not object to the sentence, but, on appeal, Henderson claimed that the District Court plainly erred in increasing his sentence solely for rehabilitative purposes. Eight days after sentencing, Henderson filed a motion to correct the sentence. The district court denied the motion. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that Henderson did not preserve the error for correction under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, so the court reviewed the decision for \\"plain error\\". Henderson did not show plain error because the error was not clear under current law at the time of trial. The court of appeals denied a petition for rehearing. While the appeal was pending, this Court decided in Tapia v. United States that it is error for a court to “impose or lengthen a prison sentence to enable an offender to complete a treatment program or otherwise to promote rehabilitation.”. While this meant that the District Court's sentence was erroneous, the Fifth Circuit determined that Rule 52(b) did not give it authority to correct the error. In doing so, it concluded that an error is “plain” under the rule only if it was clear under current law at the time of trial, but that, in this case, Circuit law was unsettled until Tapia was decided.  Opinion of the Court  Justice Breyer delivered the majority opinion of the Court in a 6-3 decision. A federal court of appeals normally will not correct a legal error made in criminal trial court proceedings unless the defendant first brought the error to the trial court's attention.See . But Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b), creating an exception to the normal rule, says that “[a] plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the [trial] court’s attention.” The Rule does not say explicitly, however, as of just what time the error must be “plain.” Must the lower court ruling be plainly erroneous as of the time the lower court made the error? Or can an error still count as “plain” if the erroneous nature of that ruling is not “plain” until the time of appellate review? The case before us concerns a District Court's decision on a substantive legal question that was unsettled at the time the trial court acted, thus foreclosing the possibility that any error could have been “plain” then. Before the case was final and at the time of direct appellate review, however, the question had become settled in the defendant's favor, making the trial court's error “plain”—but not until that later time. In our view, as long as the error was plain as of that later time—the time of appellate review— the error is “plain” within the meaning of the Rule. And the Court of Appeals “may...conside[r]” the error even though it was “not brought to the [trial] court’s attention.” Justice Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that an issue of law that is unsettled at the time of the trial cannot be considered \\"plain error\\" for the purposes of appellate review. An error can only be plain if it should have been obvious to the court and the prosecution at the time of the trial. Justice Thomas and Justice Alito joined in the dissent.

Inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright, he designed houses of the Usonian- style architecture for his Arapahoe Acres development in Englewood, Colorado. He also began development of the Arapahoe Hills neighborhood. Early life and education Edward B. Hawkins was born in Denver, Colorado in 1902. He graduated from East High School and studied civil engineering in Fort Collins at Colorado State Agricultural College, now Colorado State University. He studied the work of Frank Lloyd Wright's residential design. Career He worked for Home Builders of America in Chicago as a building superintendent beginning in 1924. He also was a general contractor on the side. During the Great Depression, he worked for the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) building picnic areas, fireplaces, and roads. During World War II, Hawkins worked at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal as a civilian. He also began to design and building houses. He built 35 modern houses in northeast Denver between 1942 and 1949. He established Construction Products Company in Lakewood, Colorado to prefabricate portions of the house that were assembled at the housing site. He manufactured aluminum-frame windows for the houses he developed and for sale to other home builders. In August 1949, he began development the Arapahoe Acres neighborhood in Englewood. The houses display characteristics of Usonian and International Style architecture. With He was accepted by a national program developed by the Southwest Research Institute and the Revere Copper and Brass Company to advance \\"better architect-builder relations and the general improvement of the quality of speculatively built houses\\", which focused on livable, cost-effective housing. He hired architect Eugene Sternberg to develop construction plans and design houses for the neighborhood. Hawkins relocated his pre-fabrication construction shop to be closer to the new development. Houses are oriented for privacy, solar heating, and mountain views. Streets are curvilinear to reduce through traffic. The houses had modern appliances, fireplaces, and used Revere Copper and Brass products. Heating systems were a combination of radiant floor heat and force air heat. Among the press received for the development, Life magazine featured Arapahoe Acres in \\"Best Houses under $15,000; Eight fine, mass-produced examples show buyers what they can get in low-priced homes.\\" After the initial model home was sold for more than $11,500 agreed upon between Hawkins and Sternberg, Sternberg ended the collaborative effort and Hawkins designed all but about 20 houses for the development. Sternberg favored the International Style. Hawkins designed about 70 larger houses in the Usonian style of Frank Lloyd Wright, using natural stone, wood sunscreens and louvers, and glass as a design element. Construction was completed in 1957. Hawkins lived and worked in Arapahoe Acres. He then began development on Arapahoe Hills, which was completed by business partner and contractor Clyde Mannon. Personal life Hawkins was married by 1942 to Charlotte. They retired in 1967 to Vista, California, where he designed his retirement home in a Japanese style. They spent eight years traveling internationally. He died in 1991 and Charlotte died four years later.

Season summary The 24 contestants were divided into two tribes. The Contenders, representing everyday Australians, faced off against the Champions, high achievers in their respective fields. Brian, Jackie, Monika, and Shane were initially outsiders at the Champions tribe. Meanwhile, at the Contenders tribe, Benji took strategic control of the tribe, and three pairs emerged: Benji & Robbie, Fenella & Shonee, and Heath & Tegan (the latter of whom re-entered the game from Exile Beach after getting blindsided by Benji). The Champions dominated challenges until a tribe swap sent Shonee and Tegan to the Champions and Lydia, Monika, & Sharn to the Contenders. Benji and Robbie worked with their new Champions tribemates, while the Contenders on the new Champions tribe tried, but failed, to infiltrate the majority. The merge occurred with 12 players left; though most of the Champions wanted to pick off the rest of the Contenders, Mat and Shane were threatened by Lydia's challenge prowess and blindsided her before Robbie was eliminated. Having lost his closest ally, Benji overthrew the majority to blindside Mat before his own elimination followed. The pairs of Brian & Monika and Fenella & Shonee realigned against Sharn; she played an idol, and Brian's paranoia led to him deviating from their alliance's split-vote plan in order to vote out Fenella. Shonee sought revenge by eliminating Brian's own closest ally Monika, but Brian's victory in the final four immunity challenge led to Shane and Sharn voting out Shonee. Sharn then voted Brian out after winning final immunity, staying true to her final two deal with Shane. Despite being the more strategically and physically dominant of the two, Sharn was criticized for being unlikeable and preaching loyalty despite playing both sides and failing to save her closest ally Mat. Shane, however, despite being less aggressive, was commended for her grace, likeability, underdog status and work ethic despite her advanced age. She won the votes from the female jurors Fenella, Monika and Shonee, plus Mat and Brian to narrowly win the title of Sole Survivor. {class=\\" nowrap\\" style=\\"margin:auto; text-align:center\\" +Tribal phase (Day 1–30) - !colspan=\\"2\\"Episode !colspan=\\"2\\"Challenge winner(s) !rowspan=\\"2\\"Eliminated !rowspan=\\"2\\"Finish - !No. !Air date !Reward !Immunity - !1 1 August 2018 None   1st voted out Day 2 - !2 2 August 2018    2nd voted out Day 5 - !3 6 August 2018    3rd voted out Day 8 - !4 7 August 2018    4th voted out Day 11 - !5 8 August 2018    5th voted out Day 13 - !

The union was founded in 1887. By the end of the year, it already had 2,181 members, and had appointed Benjamin Dean as its full-time agent and secretary. It also affiliated to the Midland Counties Miners' Federation. Membership of the union was fairly constant for many years, but by 1907 had increased to 6,120. It fell to 3,713 in 1911, but was back over 5,000 by 1925. In 1945, the union became the Pelsall District of the Midland Area of the National Union of Mineworkers, with far less autonomy than before. This was subsequently combined with the Cannock Chase District.

PANC-1 was derived from the tissue of a 56-year-old male. The cells can metastasize but have poor differentiation abilities. PANC-1 cells take 52 hours to double in population, have a modal chromosome number of 63, and show G6PD of the slow mobility type. PANC-1 cells are known to have an epithelial morphology and are adherent in cell culture flasks. The cells can be frozen and regrown in culture, provided that they are appropriately warmed. Additionally, PANC-1 cells have a tendency to clump, a feature which can be avoided with trypsinization. PANC-1 cells have been used to study the role of keratin reorganization during the migration of cancer cells, along with calcium-mediated actin reset in response to physiological changes.

The disc and five slender arms are covered with white, pink, red or violet warts, often forming transverse bands of colour on the arms. Description Growing to a maximum diameter of , Echinaster callosus has a small central disc and five slender cylindrical arms. The aboral (upper) surface is densely covered by warty protuberances. The colour of this starfish is variable, but may be orange, pink or violet, with the warts being a contrasting colour, usually white, pink, red or mauve. The white warts often occur in bands, particularly towards the tips of the arms. There are small yellowish-green retractable pedicellaria between the warts. The oral (under) surface of the starfish is white with white warts. There are ambulacral grooves on the underside of the arms along which food is passed by ciliary action. The tip of each arm bears an eyespot, as well as a bundle of suckers. Distribution and habitat E. callosus is found in the tropical and subtropical western Indo- Pacific, its range extending from East Africa and the Red Sea to Micronesia, and from Japan southwards to Australia and New Caledonia. It occurs on coral reefs and on soft sediment, at depths between . Ecology The creeping comb jelly Coeloplana astericola sometimes lives symbiotically on the aboral surface of this starfish, as well as on the Luzon sea star, Echinaster luzonicus. Other associates are small worms and crustaceans, which do little harm, and the triton Charonia tritonis and the harlequin shrimp Hymenocera picta, which both feed destructively on its tissues.

(2017). U.S. Patent No. 9,745,338. Washington, DC: U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. https://patents.google.com/patent/US9745338B2/en It is an orally active estrogen ester – specifically, a C17β sulfonamide–proline ester of the natural and bioidentical estrogen estradiol – and acts as a prodrug of estradiol in the body. However, unlike oral estradiol and conventional oral estradiol esters such as estradiol valerate, EC508 undergoes little or no first-pass metabolism, has high oral bioavailability, and does not have disproportionate estrogenic effects in the liver. As such, it has a variety of desirable advantages over oral estradiol, similarly to parenteral estradiol, but with the convenience of oral administration. EC508 is a candidate with the potential to replace not only estradiol in clinical practice, but also ethinylestradiol in oral contraceptives. Evestra intends to seek Investigational New Drug status for EC508 in the second quarter of 2018. Relative to parenteral routes of estradiol like vaginal, transdermal, and injection, oral estradiol is characterized by low bioavailability and disproportionate effects on liver protein synthesis. Due to extensive metabolism during the first-pass into estrone and estrogen conjugates like estrone sulfate, the oral bioavailability of estradiol and conventional estradiol esters like estradiol valerate is only about 5%, and there is high interindividual variability in estradiol levels achieved. Moreover, because of the first-pass, estradiol levels in the liver are 4 or 5 times higher with oral estradiol than those in the circulation. As a result, oral estradiol has disproportionate estrogenic effects on the hepatic production of lipids, hemostatic factors, / axis proteins, angiotensinogen, and other proteins. This is unfavorable and may result in an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, cardiovascular disease, and other adverse effects. Oral estradiol may also have disproportionate effects in certain tissues like the breasts and uterus, which is a consequence of the large circulating pool of estrone and estrone sulfate that is generated during the first-pass with oral estradiol and the fact that these metabolites can be activated back into estradiol in certain tissues with the requisite enzymes. The pharmacokinetics of EC508 were assessed in rats; its bioavailability was found to be complete (100%), its clearance in blood was low, and its biological half-life was prolonged at about 5 hours. A single oral dose of 5.0 mg/kg EC508 in rats resulted in peak levels of estradiol of 6,104 ng/mL (6,104,000 pg/mL). EC508 itself showed poor activity as an agonist of the estrogen receptor, with an value of 432 nM relative to 2.3 nM for estradiol (a 188-fold difference), indicating that the estrogenic activity of the compound is solely due to hydrolysis into estradiol. EC508 showed very high oral estrogenic potency, around 100 times that of estradiol and 10 times that of ethinylestradiol in rats. This was determined by uterotrophic effect in ovariectomized rats; an oral dosage of 10 µg/day resulted in uterine weight doubling with EC508, while no effect was observed with estradiol and only a small effect on uterine weight was measured with ethinylestradiol. Conversely, across the dosages assessed, oral estradiol and ethinylestradiol showed marked effects on cholesterol and angiotensinogen levels, while oral EC508 and parenteral estradiol showed no effect at all on these hepatic proteins. These findings are in accordance with the notion that oral EC508, unlike oral estradiol and ethinylestradiol but similarly to parenteral estradiol, bypasses first-pass metabolism and the liver. The absence of first-pass metabolism and lack of disproportionate liver exposure with EC508 is thought to be due to reversible binding of the sulfonamide moiety of EC508 to an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase II (CAII). EC508 shows moderate affinity for human CAII, with an for binding inhibition of 110 nM. CAII is highly concentrated in erythrocytes (red blood cells), which are present in large quantity in the blood of the hepatic portal vein. It is believed that following its absorption in the intestines and its entrance into the hepatic portal vein, EC508 is taken up by and massively accumulated in erythrocytes, which prevents it from entering the liver and results in it being transported by erythrocytes straight into the circulation. From circulating erythrocytes, EC508 is thought to be slowly released and then hydrolyzed into estradiol. However, one sulfonamide ester of estradiol related to EC508 known as EC518 showed similar properties with very low or absent binding to CAII and hence probably lacking erythrocyte binding, which raises questions as to whether or how this is possible as well as about the necessity of CAII binding for such properties. Estradiol sulfamate (E2MATE) is a C3 sulfamate ester of estradiol which was developed in the 1990s and was a predecessor of EC508. It binds to CAII, is taken up into and stored within erythrocytes, and shows similar properties to EC508. As a result, E2MATE was under development for potential clinical use as an oral estrogen. However, it showed no increase in estradiol levels and no estrogenic effects in human clinical trials. It appears that there are species differences with E2MATE between rats and primates and that the lack of activity in humans is because E2MATE additionally acts as a highly potent inhibitor of steroid sulfatase. This enzyme is responsible for the hydrolysis of sulfur-based estradiol esters like E2MATE and EC508 into estradiol. By inhibiting steroid sulfatase, E2MATE prevents its own activation into estradiol, which effectively abolishes its estrogenic activity. In addition, it was found that E2MATE was substantially transformed into estrone sulfamate (EMATE) in erythrocytes, which may have further impeded its capacity to be activated into estradiol. In contrast to E2MATE, EC508 is not thought to be a steroid sulfatase inhibitor, and cannot be transformed into the corresponding estrone equivalent. A C17β sulfonamide–proline testosterone ester known as EC586, which has similar properties to those of EC508, is also under development by Evestra, specifically as an androgen and potent oral testosterone prodrug for use in androgen replacement therapy in men.

It offers to be the single point of contact for policy makers, agencies, researchers, and private companies to collaborate with one another on smart transportation efforts around the state. Mission DriveOhio's mission is to serve as Ohio's central hub for \\"smart mobility\\", which it defines as the use of technology to move people and goods from one place to another as effectively as possible. In principle this includes all modes of transportation, including autonomous vehicles, drones, and ride sharing services. However, the initial focus of DriveOhio is to enable cars to connect with and communicate with highway infrastructure, through a fiber optic road network. Specific mission items for the center are established in Ohio Executive Order 2018-01K, which refers to DriveOhio as \\"the statewide center for smart mobility\\": * Establish communication between the agencies building Ohio's infrastructure and the organizations which are developing mobility technology. * Serve as the point of contact for mobility technology organizations that want to innovate in Ohio. * Help Ohio's government to plan for the future of transportation technology. This includes the development of policies, goals, recommendations, and operating standards. * Help to locate financing for new technology. * Work with other state agencies to help Ohio workers transition toward future transportation jobs. History DriveOhio was formed through an executive order by Ohio Governor John Kasich on January 18, 2018. The desire to attract investments and jobs in Ohio was a motivator for creating the program.http://www.dispatch.com/news/20180118/state-creates- driveohio-to-capture-smart-transportation-research Jim Barna, formerly the Chief Engineer for ODOT, was made Executive Director of the new organization. Besides establishing DriveOhio, the executive order also mandates that all state vehicles be equipped with on-board communication devices by 2023. Less than a month after formation, on February 8, 2018, DriveOhio held its first Smart Mobility Summit as a public/private exchange of ideas. On May 9, 2018, Executive Order 2018-04K was signed, which authorizes autonomous vehicles to begin testing in Ohio. Participating companies and municipalities are required to coordinate through DriveOhio. On July 9, 2018, the Transportation Research Center, an automotive proving ground near East Liberty, broke ground on a new facility for testing autonomous and connected vehicles called the SMARTCenter. This center will offer a variety of test scenarios for evaluating autonomous vehicles, and will be equipped with the wireless sensors used by connected vehicles. Structure The Executive Director is appointed by and reports to the current Director of ODOT, and may staff the organization as necessary. There are also two all-volunteer boards, the DriveOhio Government Advisory Board and the DriveOhio Expert Advisory Board. The Government Board represents local government, and the Expert Board represents particular industries. The chairs of both boards are selected by the ODOT Director, and all other members are chosen by the Governor, with no set limit on the size of each board. DriveOhio also absorbed ODOT's UAS Center division, formerly the Ohio/Indiana UAS Center. The DriveOhio UAS Center is headed by Director Fred Judson and is headquartered at the Springfield–Beckley Municipal Airport in Springfield, Ohio. Its mission is to safely study and apply unmanned aerial systems (UAS) technology in the State of Ohio. Projects The agencies which participate in DriveOhio oversee a variety of transportation-related projects. * U.S. 33 Smart Mobility Corridor. A 35-mile section of U.S. 33 will be furnished with fiber-optic cable and dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) units, placed every 600 meters. * Connected Marysville. The City of Marysville and ODOT will be equipping some of their vehicles, along with the vehicles of volunteers, with onboard units to communicate with the highway DSRCs. Honda, which operates the Marysville Auto Plant, will also be providing onboard units for the vehicles of local employees. These joint efforts are expected to result in 10% of all Marysville traffic being able to actively communicate with the highway infrastructure. The vehicle data will initially be used in conjunction with smart traffic signals to try to improve traffic flow and safety. It is also claimed to eventually provide guidance to snow and ice cleanup crews. * I-670 SmartLane. A nine-mile section of I-670 will be turned into the state's first \\"smart lane\\", in which the highway shoulder can be enabled as an extra lane on demand. Construction began on June 27, 2018. * Smart Columbus. The City of Columbus received $50 million in grants to build a smart transportation system. The initiative has many ongoing projects and is seeking additional funding. The city offers a \\"Smart Columbus Experience Center\\" to the public. * I-90 Lake Effect Corridor. A 60-mile section of Interstate 90, located in the far northeast \\"Snow Belt\\" corner of the state, will have DSRC units installed along its length. Wireless units will also be installed on public service vehicles to test the communication system. This area was chosen as a pilot because of its dangerous lake-effect snow conditions. I-90 is part of the \\"Smart Belt Coalition\\" between Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. * Ohio Turnpike. Similar to the I-90 project, the Ohio Turnpike will also receive DSRC units, along with units in a set of test vehicles. * Ground-Based Detect and Avoid Drone Pilot. The UAS Center is partnering with the Air Force Research Laboratory in a test program to fly UAS aircraft in the National Airspace System (NAS) beyond visual line of sight. This requires the development of an unmanned traffic management (UTM) system to track commercial flights, drones, and low-altitude passenger craft. Another facet of the project is provide air-based traffic monitoring on the 33 Smart Mobility Corridor. * Possible future projects include an I-75 smart corridor that extends up into Michigan.

The series stars Maja Salvador, as Lily Cruz, together with an ensemble cast consisting of Tirso Cruz III, Zsa Zsa Padilla, Aiko Melendez, Joseph Marco, Sunshine Cruz, Wendell Ramos, RK Bagatsing, Vin Abrenica, Yen Santos, Christian Vasquez, Roxanne Barcelo, and Miko Raval. Plot Taking advantage of Helena's temporary weakness, the predatory Julio kills her to take over her vast operations under the Asian syndicate's protection. However, he quickly learns that it is not as easy without the triad’s secret password, which Helena leaves with Emilia. In the aftermath of Arnaldo's suicide, Lily and Diego try to pick up the pieces of their lives, but Julio and Emilia are enemies not yet ready to give up. In the mental asylum Emilia is haunted by the evil ghosts of Helena and Arnaldo exhorting her to avenge their deaths by killing Lily and Diego. Consumed with grief, Julio tries to stir up public outrage towards the Torillos but other than the loyalists. Meanwhile, Emilia rises from her insanity and obtains the support of the Asian syndicate with the password her mother gave her. Meanwhile, a group of citizens claiming to be families of victims of the Ardientes locate the biggest and most solid evidence that can finally bring the Ardientes to answer for their crimes. The group approach the Torillos with information about a mass grave the Ardientes began using in the mid-50s when the family first seized power. Unlike the past witnesses who were killed, the mass graves have no living witnesses to silence but hundreds of human remains to explain for. The group, along with Jepoy (Vin Abrenica) and Ana (Yen Santos) find the graves and thousands of skeletal remains. Jepoy and Ana contact local media about the mass grave and stirs up the neighbors to do the same. The media frenzy covering the atrocities committed by the Ardientes emboldens whistleblowers and other victims to speak up, including former accomplices and political supporters like Natalie (Roxanne Barcelo), ex-bodyguards, former assassins, Judge Lustre. At this moment the neighbors and even the defecting Ardiente loyalists staging up a strike on the city. At the Ardiente's, Lily is captured by Julio and dragged to the town square to be executed. Julio and Emilia parade Lily through a gauntlet of loyalists hurling insults and abuses at her. Diego saves her and the execution attempt goes into a halt just before the loyalist mob attempts to execute her. Videos of the mass grave is repeatedly shown on national television and goes viral in social media. Public outrage against the brutality of the Ardientes reach beyond the Ardiente's kingdom and the family loses the support of powerful officials who backed them and allowed them to rule with impunity. A People Power revolution topples the powerful family. With solid evidences and witnesses no longer afraid to speak out, the people of Ardiente file cases of multiple murders, frustrated homicides, Estafa, plunder charges that would send them to prison for a long time, but Julio and Emilia escape capture. Julio vows revenge. While authorities search for them, the city celebrates a new era under the governorship of Diego Torillo. Their joy does not last long when Julio assassinates Diego with a sniper rifle, and escape once again to a Triad safe house. Diego does not survive and the entire province mourn his death. Julio and Emilia learn that the Triad is handing Red Dragon’s operations to Emilia. This does not mean anything to Julio who kills Stefano (Epi Quizon), the Triad’s representative. Emilia finally realizes her father’s direct hand in the murders of her aunt and mother, and that he never respected her as an equal. With intel gathered by Arthur, Lily works with the NBI authorities led by Agent Salonga (Michael Flores) and successfully raid the safe house where the Ardientes and the Triad are gathered. As Lily tries to stop Julio from escaping, Emilia comes face to face with her father, shooting him several times until he dies. Diego's campaign promises: Peace, Hope and Love finally comes to Bagong Ardiente. Emilia's gunshot wounds severs her spine, paralyzes her and she serves her time in prison. Marlon becomes Mayor of Bagong Ardiente and Lily takes over Diego's post as Governor, moving on to Senator and finally as the leading candidate at the polls for President of the Philippines. Camia and Damian (Christian Vasquez) wed after his release from prison. Lily visits Emilia in prison extending an Olive branch and forgives her. Later, in a laboratory at an unspecified place, Julio is shown to be half-alive, having survived his gunshot injury and being connected to an intravenous solution. A gang led by Helena's adopted daughter Venus (Karylle), enters and tortures Julio to death in their actions of playing God.

Reception In a positive review, Deciders Josh Sorokach praised the series saying, \\"Stream it. Absolutely stream it. Overthinking with Kat & June is not only a fresh take on the awkwardness of adult friendship but it’s also a ton of fun. I understand there's no shortage of new content out there, but Overthinking with Kat & June is an absurdly funny comedy not to be missed.\\" In another favorable critique, Metro US Andrew Husband described the series as \\"an occasionally surreal blend of laugh-out- loud comedy and absolute cringe. From Kat and June's frequent fantasizing about their older landlord David to the former’s attempts to prepare the latter for a first date with the help of the twins Tessa and Molly, Overthinking can sometimes emphasize the \\"over\\" in its title. The thing is, it works so beautifully for this show and the kind of comedy it’s trying to accomplish.\\" References External links * Category:2010s American comedy television series Category:2018 American television series debuts Category:2018 American television series endings Category:English-language television shows Category:YouTube Premium original series ","title":"Overthinking with Kat &amp; June"},{"id":"57763956","text":"Kattiannan Arjunan is an Indian politician of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK).

The species is solely known from the Middle Miocene sediments exposed in central Washington in the United States. It is one of three Washington state Acer species described in 1961 from petrified wood. Distribution and paleoenvironment The type specimen was part of a collection compiled by Jay O'Leary, who was then a student of Harvard College, in 1954 from the west bank of the Columbia River near Vantage, Washington. The petrified woods of the area are preserved in an interbed area between the older Grande Ronde Basalt and the younger Wanapum basalts, with the interbed overlain by the Ginkgo Flow, the oldest segment of the Frenchman Springs Member of the Wanapum basalts. K–Ar dating performed on the Grande Ronde Basalts gives an age of 15.6 million years old, and dating of the Frenchman Springs Member gives a date of 15.3 million years old. This places the vantage woods as from the Langhian stage of the Miocene. Mean annual temperature estimates for the vantage paleoclimate were made based on analysis of the fossil wood. Based on a series of wood anatomy characters, a temperature range between . This is distinctly warmer then the modern mean annual temperature of .  Taxonomy  The species was described from the section of mature secondary xylem designated the holotype. The type specimen, number 55226, was preserved in the paleobotanical collections of Harvard College. and was studied by paleobotanists Uttam Prakash of the Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany and Elso Barghoorn of Harvard University. Prakash and Barghoorn published their 1961 type description for A. beckianum in the Journal of the Arnold Arboretum. The etymology of the chosen specific name beckianum is a patronym honoring George F. Beck, a resident of Yakima, Washington, who pioneered the interest and study of the Vantage petrified woods. The species was one of three Acer species described by Prakash and Barghoorn in the paper, along with A. olearyi and A. puratanum. Based on the wood anatomy, A. beckianum is closest in structure to A. negundo, while A. olearyi is closer to A. grandidentatum and A. puratanum is closest to A. circinatum.  Description  The wood shows distinct growth rings which are separated from each other by between one and two layers of thick walled flattened fibers. The vessels in the wood are mostly solitary and have an oval to round outline. When grouped, the vessels are present in sets of mainly two and three, though rare four and five groupings are known. On average the vessel cells range between in length with horizontal to oblique end walls adjoining the next vessel cell and a simple perforation plate allowing fluid passage across the cell wall. The wood has fusiform wood rays, usually in groups of threes, and which are comprised of a single cell type.

Once mounted on a helicopter or an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), it incorporates visual information from a digital camera and elevation data from a Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) system to create a two and three-dimensional colored map with orthorectified, 4 to 6-inch resolution. Buckeye has been used by deployed personnel from the Topographic Engineering Center to support operations in both Afghanistan and Iraq, including Operation Iraqi Freedom. In 2007, it was named by the Army as one of the top ten inventions of 2006.  History  In 2004, the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) in Vicksburg, Mississippi developed the Buckeye system in an effort to provide more accurate geospatial information during asymmetric warfare. At the time, Buckeye provided a higher resolution imagery than Controlled Image Base 1 (CIB1), which was the military standard in terms of resolution range for digital imagery. Initially, Buckeye was designed to provide imagery for change detection applications for detection of improvised explosive devices (IEDs). However, the time delay that occurred every time the geospatial information was delivered to the ground-station caused Buckeye to be more effectively used as a tool for digitally mapping urban areas than finding IEDs. The Buckeye system has been implemented by U.S. forces since November 2004, and the maps of urban terrain collected by the sensors have been used by U.S. military personnel since 2007. By 2016, Buckeye had collected more than 85,000 square kilometers (about 32,819 square miles) of geospatial imagery data in Iraq and more than 200,000 square kilometers (77,220 square miles) of data in Afghanistan, most of which was used to provide rapid tactical response in urban terrain.  Operation  The Buckeye system relies on two major components: the electro-optical (EO) imaging system and the LIDAR system. The EO system utilizes a CCD camera and an embedded imaging computer to obtain the desired images while accounting for the movement of the aerial system to which it is attached. The digital camera is able to operate at exposures as short as 1/4000 sec, eliminating motion blur for images acquired at typical ground velocities of 110 knots. To gather elevation data, Buckeye uses an Optech ALTM 3100 (Airborne Laser Terrain Mapper) LIDAR sensor system, which emits a laser pulse and records the time it takes for the energy to hit the target and return to the receiver. The time of the trip, combined with information regarding the angle of the sensor and the altitude, allows Buckeye to generate a 3D coordinate at the target. The combined efforts of both sensor systems transforms the collected images into a compressed, georeferenced, and colored mosaic, which can then be used to create a 3D map of the area.  Upgrades  Several organizations have contributed to further developments and upgrades. To add another level of visual information, ERDC has worked to combine the EO and LIDAR sensors in Buckeye with infrared (IR) sensors. To prevent the compression computer from overheating and shutting down when operating under direct sunlight and high temperatures, researchers made physical modifications to the 30-pound aerial system that often carried the sensors in the air to direct airflow to the hardware components and programmed the system to drop the CPU load to 66% if the internal temperature exceeded a critical level. The Army Research Laboratory (ARL) in Adelphi, Maryland integrated aspects of the Constant Hawk surveillance system into Buckeye during the Iraq War to refine its three- dimensional capability. However, this upgrade was not implemented until after the war ended in Iraq. Researchers at ARL have also developed a 3D-viewer for Buckeye and other LIDAR systems as part of the Persistent Surveillance- Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (PS-ISR) concept demonstration, a project to prepare the U.S. Army for future warfare. ARL has used Buckeye data to develop Tactical Digital Hologram technology, a variant of 3D holographic technology that compares 3D holographic static images against conventional topographic data for intelligence, reconnaissance, and training purposes.

Dixie Days (also known as Uncle Tom and Little Eva,) is a 1930 animated short film which was produced by The Van Beuren Corporation and released by Pathe. The film, which was directed by John Foster and Mannie Davis, is a take on Uncle Tom's Cabin, as it featured African caricatures as slaves, as they defy their owner and free themselves from them. The name of the film means the cartoon took place in the Southern United States, as Dixie is the nickname of the South. Released on 9 March 1930, the cartoon is also part of the early sound cartoon series entitled Aesop's Sound Fables. However, although the film is part of the series, it is not based on an Aesop fable. Plot Uncle Tom and Popsy going up the mountain. The film begins on a slave ship which comically expands and shrinks like an accordion. On the boat, a set of four animals (one with a guitar) sings \\"Carry Me Back to Old Virginny\\". Once they arrive, Uncle Tom starts to play a recorder outside his cabin. This makes Popsy (as her uncle calls her) descend onto the cabin. Upon arrival, Uncle Tom asks where her friend, Little Eva, is. Just then, she descends onto the cabin. Uncle Tom plays a song, which both Popsy and Little Eva dance to. However, the slave- keeper hears this and takes both Uncle Tom and Popsy as slaves, leaving Little Eva in tears. They are both taken to a slave auction, where they have to perform. The first one to perform is Uncle Tom, who falls over at the end of his performance, due to his lack of strength and malnutrition. In response, the keepers blow raspberries at him after the performance. The second to perform is Popsy, who comically treats the audition block as a xylophone. She is viewed more favourable than Uncle Tom. However, the slave-keepers chant \\"We want either!\\". When they are chanting that, a mother and her baby spots the slave-keepers and comically runs to the mountains. However, one of the slave- keeper spots them and sends blood hounds in order to catch them. The slave- keeper also tries to catch them via paddleboat. They are both unsuccessful, due to Uncle Tom breaking off his chain on his Ball and chain and using it to make the slave-keeper's paddleboat fall off a waterfall. After that, the four animals then sing \\"Dixie\\". Until, a chicken appears and crows. They stop singing and the film ends with the four animals pursuing the chicken. Characters In this cartoon, the main characters are Uncle Tom, Popsy, and a set on slave-keepers. There all both influence the outcome in the short film. There are also a set of African caricatures, who are portrayed as slaves.  Reception  Dixie Days received positive reviews from the cinema magazines at that time. The Film Daily said that the cartoon had some \\"really amusing moments\\". The Motion Picture News said the same, and said the film was \\"ideal as relief from a heavy feature\\".

She is known for her work on the life histories of Sipuncula, as well as for serving as the first director of the Smithsonian Marine Station at Fort Pierce.  Biography and education  Mary E. Rice was born in Washington, D.C. on August 3, 1926 to Daniel Gibbons Rice and Florence Catherine Pyles Rice. She grew up on a farm in southern Maryland and attended school in Oxon Hill.Rice, Mary E. \\"Oral History Interview.\\" Interviewer Pamela M. Henson. Smithsonian Institution Archives. March 22, 2010. https://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_302232. In 1947, Rice graduated from Drew University in Madison, New Jersey with an A.B. in Biology. She first attended graduate school at Oberlin College in Ohio, earning an M.A. in Zoology in 1949. Rice then returned to New Jersey to teach Biology at Drew. In 1950, Rice began working as a research associate at Columbia University's Department of Radiology. She left Columbia in 1953 to accept an appointment as a general physiologist at the National Institutes of Health's National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases. In 1955, she advanced to the position of biologist at the National Cancer Institute. Rice decided in 1961 to pursue a PhD in Zoology at the University of Washington, Seattle, studying the development and phylogeny of sipunculan worms. Upon completion of her PhD in 1966, Rice was appointed Curator and Research Zoologist in the National Museum of Natural History's Department of Invertebrate Zoology. In charge of curating the sipunculan and echiuran collections, Rice devoted her career to the study of Sipuncula, focusing her research on their evolution and development. In 1981, Rice became Director of the Smithsonian Marine Station at Fort Pierce, Florida. When she retired in 2002 after thirty-six years at the Smithsonian Institution, Rice was named Senior Research Scientist Emeritus at the Smithsonian Marine Station. She continues researching sipunculan worms in her retirement.  Administrative career  As the founding director of the Smithsonian Marine State at Link Port, Mary E. Rice guided its growth into a major research center by developing research laboratories and programs and securing support for research fellowships. In 1999, the facility was moved to an eight-acre campus at Seaway Drive. The expanded facility was renamed the Smithsonian Marine Station at Fort Pierce.  Educational career  Over the course of her career, Mary E. Rice was affiliated with several universities. She has served as an Adjunct Associate Professor at the University of Miami (1968–74) and the George Washington University (1970–75). She was also an Affiliate Professor of Biology at George Mason University (1994-2000) and a member of the Graduate Faculty at the Florida Institute of Technology (1996-2000). Rice has mentored many students, including those developing the Evo-Devo approach, and has advised over thirty postdoctoral fellows and eight short-term graduate fellows. She has served as a committee member for thirteen doctoral candidates.Rice, Mary E. Curriculum vitae. https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/hea/sws/docs/RiceCV.pdf. Rice was also responsible for the creation of the Smithsonian Marine Ecosystem Exhibit. Working with nearby officials, she developed the St. Lucie County Marine Center, a county- run facility where the exhibit is housed. Located opposite the Smithsonian Marine Station, the focal point of the exhibit is an enormous 3,300-gallon coral reef aquarium that was previously displayed at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington.  Publications  Rice's first publication, “The influence of glycolytic factors on the potassium and sodium content of Saccaromyces cerevisiae,” was co-written in 1951 with G. T. Scott and M. A. Jacobson. It concerned the physiological effects of sodium on yeast. Rice's first sipunculan paper appeared in 1967, and was entitled, “A comparative study of the development of Phascolosoma agassizii, Golfingia pligettensis, and Themiste pyroides with a discussion of developmental patterns in the Sipuncula,”. Rice has written or co-written over eighty papers in total, most on the classification, development and evolution of the genus Sipuncula.  Honors and awards  Rice has served as President of the American Society of Zoologists and the American Microscopical Society. She was also an elected fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 2019 she was awarded the A.O. Kovalevsky Medal for extraordinary achievements in evolutionary developmental biology and comparative zoology by the St. Petersburg Society of Naturalists.

Historically they have sometimes acted as clandestine churches, tolerated by the authorities to operate discreetly. Since embassies are exempt from the host country's laws, a form of extraterritoriality, these chapels were able to provide services to prohibited and persecuted religious groups. For example, Catholic embassy chapels in Great Britain provided services while Catholicism was banned under the Penal Laws. A similar role was filled for Protestants by the Prussian embassy chapel in Rome, where Protestantism was unlawful until 1871. Upon laws granting freedom of religion, these embassy chapels have often become regularised churches and parishes, such as that of the Dutch embassy chapel to the Ottoman Empire, now The Union Church of Istanbul. History Early modern embassy staff, who commonly lived in the ambassadorial residence, were permitted to have in-house chapels and chaplains, especially where, in the wake of the Reformation, they lived in a country that banned their religious faith. These soon drew members of the same faith to join the worship services in the embassy. The Dutch Republic sponsored chapels in twelve of its embassies, which acted as churches for local Reformed Protestants. Emperor Leopold I sponsored them wherever he could, \\"That Catholic services might be held to comfort the Catholics of the area, and to promote the further growth of this religion.\\"Kaplan, Benjamin J., Religious Conflict and the Practice of Toleration in Early Modern Europe, Harvard University Press, 2007, Chapter 8, p. 186 ff. By the late eighteenth century, a new legal principle had come into being, extraterritoriality, according to which, \\"the ambassador and the precincts of the embassy stood as if on the soil of his homeland, subject only to its laws.\\"Kaplan, Benjamin J., Religious Conflict and the Practice of Toleration in Early Modern Europe, Harvard University Press, 2007, Chapter 8, p. 186 ff. As religious freedom advanced with time, many of the embassy chapels lost their function as safe havens and were converted into churches proper or dismissed. Catholic embassies in London During the reign of Elizabeth I, Catholicism was gradually outlawed in England, and Catholic masses and worship were prohibited, particularly after the Oath of Supremacy of 1559. With the \\"Act to retain the Queen's Majesty's subjects in their obedience,\\" passed in 1581, the celebration of Mass was prohibited under penalty of a fine of two hundred marks and imprisonment for one year for the celebrant, and a fine of one hundred marks and the same imprisonment for those who heard the Mass. The reign of Charles I (1625–49) saw a small revival of Catholicism in England, especially among the upper classes. As part of his royal marriage settlement Charles's Catholic wife, Henrietta Maria, was permitted her own royal chapel (the Queen's Chapel in London, as well as a chapel at Somerset House) and chaplain. Ambassadors of Catholic nations sought to provide relief for persecuted English Catholics by protecting worship at their chapels with diplomatic immunity. The English government attempted unsuccessfully several times to dissuade such use of the Spanish and Portuguese embassies between 1563 and 1611. In 1610, James I asked foreign ambassadors not to allow English priests to celebrate at, or English Catholics to attend, their chapels, but only the Venetian ambassador complied. Starting in 1624, several arrests of English Catholics leaving these embassy chapels were made, which irritated the French ambassador, the Marquis of Blainville. On March 10, 1630, an order in council forbade Catholics to hear Mass at the embassies. The next Sunday, as reported by the Venetian ambassador, guards were placed in front of the French, Venetian and Spanish embassies, and Catholics were arrested as they left the premise; afterwards the Spanish ambassador, Don Carlos Coloma, unsuccessfully tried to obtain their release. Coloma diffused the issue by taking residence in the countryside, and demanding that the English government punish those who had violated his diplomatic immunity. Five years later, on April 12, 1635, the council directed Sir John Coke to inform the ambassadors that their diplomatic rights would not be infringed upon, but that penal laws against Catholics would be pursued. When a priest who had said Mass was captured and escaped to the house of the French ambassador Henri de Saint-Nectaire, where he was then recaptured, he was set free because of the right of extraterritoriality, and his pursuers were punished. Over time, enforcement of the law became lenient; Venetian ambassador Anzolo Corer wrote in 1636 that Mass at the chapel of the Queen and at the embassies was \\"frequented with freedom.\\" In 1637, large crowds attended Mass daily at the Spanish embassy. In eighteenth-century London, there were chapels in the French, Spanish, Florentine, Venetian (in the Haymarket), Portuguese (originally in Golden Square, then in South Street, Grosvenor Square), Austrian (on Hanover Street), Neapolitan (in Soho Square), Bavarian (on Warwick Street) and Sardinian embassies. In London, the streets outside the houses and house chapels of the Spanish, French and Venetian embassies were the scenes of public protests, sometimes violent. The police sometimes attempted to detain British people who attended Catholic services in the embassy chapels. Embassy chapels led to diplomatic tension between the English government and the Catholic governments who operated the embassies between 1625 and 1660. In the eighteenth century, English subjects ceased to be harassed for attending services at the Sardinian embassy.

Type-S  The Acura TL Type-S model was introduced in 2002. It featured a 3.2 L SOHC VTEC J-series V6 and added 35 hp (26 kW) over the base model for a total 260 hp (194 kW). Further upgrades included wheels, firmer seats and suspension. In Canada, the Acura EL doesn't use the Type-S trim, but in 2007, the CSX Type-S trim is offered. In 2002, the Acura CL Type-S was offered, as a 2003 model, with a close-ratio 6-speed manual transmission with a helical limited-slip differential. It used the same powertrain from the 2002-2003 TL Type S. The 6-speed CL deleted some minor interior features from the automatic, such as a center console light. Also, the heated seats only featured one heat setting (vs. high and low in the auto). VSA and TCS were also not found on the 6-speed car, and as such, a 3-channel ABS unit was used. The RSX Type-S had a 200 hp (150 kW) (2002–2004) K20A2 or 210 hp (160 kW) K20Z12005 Acura Brochure http://www.auto-brochures.com/acura.html (labeled in 2006 as 201 hp due to SAE hp calculation revision) in 2005-2006 and a close-ratio 6-speed manual transmission. An automatic transmission was not offered on the Type-S. The Type-S included additional features such as sport-tuned suspension, gunmetal painted wheels, 11.8\\" ventilated front disc brakes, larger sway bars and a Bose 7-speaker (including a subwoofer mounted on the spare tire) audio system. The TL Type-S was introduced once again for the 2007 through 2008 model years. The new TL Type-S received the Acura RL's 3.5-liter V6 tuned to with either a 5-speed automatic with F1 style paddle shifters or a 6-speed manual transmission. The manual transmission includes a limited slip differential. Exterior differences include quad exhaust pipes, restyled rear lamps and front fascia, lip spoiler, wider side sills, Brembo brakes, dark silver 10-spoke wheels, a \\"black chrome\\" grille rather than the standard glossy grille, and exclusive Type-S badging, plus an exclusive new color option, Kinetic Blue Pearl. The interior has Type-S badging on the steering wheel and headrests, more highly bolstered front seats, two-tone seats (only with the Ebony/Silver interior), metal racing pedals, carbon fiber trim, and red interior lighting (as opposed to blue in the base TL). Touch screen navigation is standard and the suspension has been firmed up. The only options are the aforementioned transmission and high performance summer tires (Bridgestone Potenzas) rather than the standard all-season tires (Michelin Pilot MXM4s). The Canadian- exclusive CSX Type-S debuted as a 2007 model and was the last remaining Type-S model when it was discontinued in 2011. It featured a 2.0L i-VTEC engine, an increase of 42 hp (31 kW) over the base CSX engine. The \\"sport-tuned\\" suspension added stiffer springs, firmer damping and thicker stabilizer bars compared to the regular CSX and is supported on 215/45R17 all-season tires and 17-inch alloy wheels. Other additional features included Vehicle Stability Assist, 350-watt 7-speaker audio system, navigation system with voice-command, digital audio card reader with USB and bluetooth connectivity, Type-S badging, rear-deck spoiler, and red-illuminated instrument panel and foot-wells. At the 2018 Detroit Auto Show, Acura announced it will apply the Type-S performance treatment to multiple models by 2020.

In 2004 in the US, Acura offered to the public a factory-sanctioned \\"tuner package\\" version of the TL called the TL A-SPEC. This version features a suspension tuned by Makoto Tamamura, an indication of the TL A-SPEC's aggressive engineering. In addition, an underbody kit, spoiler, limited edition A-SPEC steering wheel, \\"A-SPEC\\" badge on the back, and 18-inch (460 mm) wheels are standard issue on the A-SPEC package.

For the 2005–2008 models, Acura offered an A-Spec package for the RL. The dealer-installed package consisted of a body kit, badging, revised suspension and different wheels. The package was first announced at a late 2004 Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) trade show in Las Vegas. The A-Spec package for sale was distinctly different from the Acura RL A-Spec Concept Vehicle announced and shown as a striking dark red one-of-a-kind custom creation in early 2005 at the Detroit Auto Show. Acura offers an A-Spec variant on most of their vehicles, which includes sportier styling on both the exterior and interior, and a firmer suspension.

It sits opposite the Grand Palace on Sanam Chai Road, in the heart of the historic Rattanakosin Island. The building, in the neo-Palladian style of the neoclassical movement, was built as the Front Soldiers' Barracks in 1882–1884 to designs by Italian architect Joachim Grassi. It has served as the headquarters of the Ministry of Defence since the ministry's establishment in 1887. History The site of the building, just east of the Grand Palace and south of the City Pillar Shrine, used to be the location of three former princely palaces built in the reign of King Rama I (1782–1809). By the time of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V, 1868–1910), the palaces had become disused, and parts of the site were occupied by granaries, stables and silkworm-rearing houses. The building, c. 1880s–1900s Chulalongkorn worked extensively to modernize the country, including replacing the system of corvée labour with a professional standing military. A regiment known as Thahan Na (\\"front soldiers\\"), consisting of about 4,400 men, was created in late 1870s to guard the capital. The need for a permanent residence for the force soon became apparent in the aftermath of a cholera outbreak, during which many soldiers died. The regiment commander Chaomuen Waiworanat (later known as Chaophraya Surasakmontri) accordingly requested that a barracks be built, and construction took place on the site from 1882 to 1884. The building was designed by Italian architect Joachim Grassi, while Surasakmontri oversaw the construction. The building was inaugurated by Chulalongkorn on 18 July 1884. With the formal establishment of the Ministry of Defence in 1887, the building became the ministry's headquarters, a role which it holds to the present. Architecture The building is designed in neo-Palladian style, following a three-storey rectangular floor plan with a central courtyard, built of masonry with load-bearing walls. The façade, facing west towards the Grand Palace, is marked by a central pediment supported by Doric-order columns, which is flanked by two wings with gates leading into the courtyard. Windows line all three levels of the building's exterior, which is decorated with pilasters in superimposed order. While the front of the building is perfectly symmetrical, its wings taper towards the rear, as necessitated by the shape of the plot, which the building entirely fills except for the front lawn. It is surrounded by streets on all sides (Sanam Chai to the west, Lak Mueang to the north, Rachini to the east, and Kanlayana Maitri to the south). According to the original plans, the central structure was to contain an armoury and military museum on the top floor, officer's meeting rooms on the middle, and sword- fighting practice areas below. The wings housed sleeping quarters on the upper floor, meeting and training rooms on the middle, and armouries and provisions storage areas on the lower floor. The north wing hosted artillery units, a military hospital, and stables, while the south wing hosted infantry and engineering units. At the rear of the south wing was a connected clock tower (since removed), which also housed water pumps and storage tanks—the building was built with metal plumbing. The central courtyard was used for drills and exercises. The building has undergone several additions, including an extended portico at the front, a new section running alongside the original northern wing, and annexes at the rear (east side) of the complex, where a granary and bathing and swimming pools used to be located. The building received the ASA Architectural Conservation Award in 1997, and was registered as an ancient monument by the Fine Arts Department in 1998. Cannon museum The Phaya Tani cannon in 2003, pointing away from the building In the front lawns of the building, arranged in a garden display, are a large collection of bronze cannons. The display was initiated by King Vajiravudh (Rama VI, r. 1910–1925), who was probably inspired by his experience at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Sixty-three guns were once displayed on the lawn, according to a 1921 survey, but many have been relocated and forty currently remain. Almost all of the cannons bear inscribed names, such as \\"Uprooter of Phra Sumeru\\" () and \\"The Wind that destroyeth the Earth\\" (). The largest and most famous is the Phaya Tani, which was captured from Pattani (then capital of the Pattani Kingdom) in 1786. The display has been reorganized many times. In 2004, several guns including the Phaya Tani were rotated to face the building, prompting rumours that the ministry was trying to avoid bad luck resulting from the guns pointing towards the Grand Palace, as they had previously done, in an attempt to alleviate the South Thailand insurgency. This was denied by ministry permanent secretary General Oud Buangbon, who said that it was part of a re-landscaping project, done in accordance with a request from the Ministry of Tourism and Sports and advice from the Fine Arts Department, and also to mark the ministry's 120th anniversary. The display has since been reorganized again, so that all the guns now point sideways. In 2014, the ministry inaugurated the exhibit as an outdoor museum, titled the Ancient Artillery Museum, with information placards and scheduled guided tours. The garden also features two large gajasiha statues and musical fountains.

He has written three books for violin, viola, and guitar; each serves as a method for beginners, in order to get the students and the music teachers ready for the approach of The Royal Conservatory of Music's Program: * Violin Series: Beginners (Violin School) * Viola Series: Beginners (Viola School) * Guitar Series: Beginners (Guitar School) For this sake, he also transcribed necessary concertos for viola with his own style of fingerings: * Viola Series: Viola Concertos (Viola School) And wrote a Scales Book from Introductory Grade to the 9th (according to the Royal Conservatory of Music's Program), in his own method and fingerings inspired from that of Professor Ivan Galamian and Professor Robert Skelton: * The Complete Viola Technique Book: Viola Series, technical requirements: Intro - 9 (Viola School)  Articles  Mehabadi has written more than 100 articles about art and music, most of which are published in different specialized magazines. From 1990 to 2000, he was the editor of the classical music section of The Art Quarterly magazine (Faslnamye Honar). Many of his articles were published in this magazine; such as: * (The Latest Edition) * (The Latest Edition) * * (The Latest Edition) * (The Latest Edition) * (The Latest Edition) * (The Latest Edition) * (The Latest Edition) * (The Latest Edition) * * (The Latest Edition) * * (The Latest Edition) * (The Latest Edition) * (The Latest Edition) * (Part 1: The Latest Edition), (Part 2: The Latest Edition), (Part 3: The Latest Edition), (Part 4: The Latest Edition), (Part 5: The Latest Edition) * (The Latest Edition) * (The Latest Edition) * (The Latest Edition) * (The Latest Edition) * (The Latest Edition) * * * (The Latest Edition) * During the lifetime of Ahang Music Quarterly, he was the editor of its classical music section. Moreover, he has a few articles about music and theater, including the reviews on “Three Sisters” from Anton Chekhov, “An Enemy of the People” from Henrik Ibsen, etc., all published in Theatre (Namayesh) Monthly Review: * *  Compositions  Mehabadi has composed many pieces in different forms for ensemble, which are often played in his concerts with SOL Music Ensemble and other music groups; including “Love of Freedom” , “Sonata in a minor: Nostalgia” , “Lirico”, “Three Movements for Sorrow” , “San Fantasy”, “Romance in G” , “Andre Gide Sonata”, “Letter” for piano and string ensemble, etc. Beside his own compositions, he has also arranged many of classical pieces for his ensemble.  Personal life  Poetry and painting are Mehabadi’s two main leisure activities. Since a teenager, he has been interested in poetry, like his father who was fond of philosophy and literature, and showed a good talent in this field. This was a beginning for him to write his thoughts into poems throughout his life. Now he has several poetry books of his own in which his life philosophy could be perceived. In 1985 Bahman Mehabadi and Ahad Manteqi collected and published a selection of the poems of their contemporary Iranian poets, in the book \\"The Voice of the Contemporary Poetry\\" (Sedaye She're Emrooz): * At Tabriz Music Art School, Bahman Mehabadi used to take painting classes of Professor Ibrahim Moqbeli. Since then he still paints in Oil Color and Water Color. Today he has around 50 paintings. It was with such a background that he decided to design the cover of many of the SOL Music albums. SOL Music's logo is one of his graphic designs as well.

Ditchburn on the Thames. They established a yard at Dudman's Creek, Deptford where they started building iron ships.Arnold, AJ, 2000, Iron Shipbuilding on the Thames 1832-1915, Ashgate, Aldershot, p27 In 1838, their yard was completely destroyed by fire. It was suspected arson by rival wooden shipbuilders. They moved the business to the Orchard House Yard, Canning Town, taking over the premises of the recently bankrupt firm of William and Benjamin Wallis.Arnold, AJ, 2000, Iron Shipbuilding on the Thames 1832-1915, Ashgate, Aldershot, p28 After Ditchburn's retirement in 1846, Mare continued to run the firm, and expanded the company on the west side of Bow Creek, before dissolving the partnership in 1847. The following year, he was accused in court of threatening Ditchburn but the accusations also went the other way and the case was dismissed. In 1855, Mare found himself in financial difficulties due to several government contracts. It culminated in Mare declaring insolvency, Mare's father-in-law took over the firm and renamed it Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Co. Following the bankruptcy, Mare managed the shipbuilding company belonging to W. & H. Pitcher at Northfleet until it also failed in 1857. By 1859 he had found sufficient backing to re-establish himself, this time as C.J. Mare and Co, Millwall.Arnold, AJ, 2000, Iron Shipbuilding on the Thames 1832-1915, Ashgate, Aldershot, p85 Mare's business expanded and, in 1861 he took over the part of Napier's yard which John Scott Russell had unsuccessfully used to attempt to re-establish his own shipbuilding enterprise. It remained in Mare's name until being bought out by Overend, Gurney and Company in 1862. Subsequently he did not thrive financially, was bankrupted again in 1874 and died destitute in Stepney.The Globe, 18 February 1898, p4, column D Political career Mare was first elected Conservative MP for Plymouth in 1852, but was the next year unseated for bribery and corruption during the election campaign.

When the governor is out of the state, the lieutenant-governor acts as the governor. This office has often been held concurrently by the Chief Justice of Victoria. History Prior to the separation of the colony of Victoria from New South Wales in 1851, the area was called the Port Phillip District of New South Wales. The Governor of New South Wales appointed superintendents of the District. In 1839, Captain Charles La Trobe was appointed superintendent. La Trobe became Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria on Victoria's separation from New South Wales on 1 July 1851. On Victoria obtaining responsible government in May 1855, the title of the then incumbent lieutenant-governor, Captain Sir Charles Hotham, became the Governor of Victoria. When Victoria became a state, the letters patent provided for a lieutenant-governor, but the office was not filled. Instead, following the practice in New South Wales, the Chief Justice of Victoria acted as the governor when required. This changed on 6 November 1886, when Sir William Stawell, the outgoing Chief Justice, was appointed lieutenant governor. The conferring of honours on retiring dignitaries was a common practice in the UK at the time. After his death in 1889, the position again became vacant until Sir John Madden was appointed lieutenant-governor on 10 June 1899. He had already acted as governor by virtue of being Chief Justice, but in line with Stawell's precedent, his direct appointment as lieutenant-governor superseded the administrative power of the Chief Justice.

The Treaty of Frankfurt of 1871 instituted most favoured nation status between Germany and France.Tracy, p. 87. During the 1850s and 1860s Germany was a net exporter of grain and its farmers opposed tariffs for industry as this might have led to reprisals by Britain against German grain.Tracy, p. 87. However, industrialists favoured tariffs against British goods to safeguard their infant industries and therefore came to believe that winning over the farmers to protectionism was crucial.Tracy, p. 87. In the late 1870s world grain prices started to fall due to the opening up of the American prairies to cultivation following the settlement of the Midwest after the Civil War. The increase in railways also helped cheapen grain (which also aided Russian farmers).Ashley, pp. 42-43.Gerschenkron, p. 37.Taylor, p. 156.

The adoption of protectionism by the Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, signalled a shift towards a greater reliance on the Conservatives for support rather than on the National Liberals.Carr, p. 134. The tariff was supported by the two Conservative Parties and the Centre Party and opposed by the Progressives and the Socialists, with the Liberals divided.Eyck, p. 253. The tariff protected the great landowners east of the Elbe--the Ostelbier or Junkers--from competition from cheap American grain.Eyck, pp. 258-259. Without protection many of these landowners would have declined; the tariff preserved the economic existence and the political ascendancy of the Junker class.Eyck, p. 259. Many working men considered the tariff a tax on their food. Along with the Anti-Socialist Laws that banned the Social Democratic Party, the tariff helped alienate the working class from the state. The historian Erich Eyck argued that if Germany's political culture at the beginning of the 20th century differed from Western Europe, agricultural protection was largely responsible.Eyck, p. 259. Tariff rates The tariff of 15 July 1879 imposed moderate import duties on grain and raised the duties on livestock products.Tracy, p. 88. Wheat, rye and oats were subject to a duty of 1 mark per 100kg.Tracy, p. 88. On 22 May 1885 these were increased to 3 marks and on 21 December 1887 to 5 marks. On 6 December 1891 the duties on wheat and rye were lowered to 3.50 marks, that on oats to 2.80 marks. On 25 December 1902 the tariff was again modified, with wheat subject of a duty ranging from 7.50-5.50 marks and that on rye and oats to 7-5 marks. On 1 March 1906 the duty on rye was changed to 5.50 marks, those on rye and oats to 5 marks.Tracy, p. 88.

Illinois, 360 U.S. 264 (1959), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the knowing use of false testimony by a prosecutor in a criminal case violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, even if the testimony affects only the credibility of the witness and does not directly relate to the innocence or guilt of the defendant. Background  Prior case law  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides: The Supreme Court of the United States has repeatedly addressed whether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is violated when prosecutors knowingly use false testimony in a criminal trial. In 1935, the Supreme Court briefly wrote in Mooney v. Holohan. that prosecutors violate the Due Process Clause if they knowingly present perjured testimony. The Court expanded on its decision in 1957 in the case Alcorta v. Texas, in which it held that a prosecutor's neglect to correct false testimony is equivalent to knowingly presenting perjured testimony. However, in Alcorta, the Court refrained from setting a specific standard regarding when false testimony becomes material enough to warrant reversal of a conviction.  Proceedings in state court  Henry Napue was tried in an Illinois state court on charges of murder. At his trial, the prosecution's primary witness, George Hamer, who was serving a 199-year sentence for the same murder, testified that the prosecution had not offered any reduction of sentence or other reward for his testimony.The following colloquy took place on direct examination: > \\"Q. Did anybody give you a reward or promise you a reward for testifying? > \\"A. There ain't nobody promised me anything.\\" After cross-examination, on redirect, the testimony was reinforced: > \\"Q. Have I [the Assistant State's Attorney] promised you that I would > recommend any reduction of sentence to anybody? > \\"A. You did not.\\" . The prosecutor did not dispute or otherwise correct Hamer's testimony. Based primarily on Hamer's testimony, Napue was convicted and sentenced to 199 years in prison.. After Napue's conviction, the Assistant State's Attorney who prosecuted the murder filed a petition to reduce Hamer's sentence. In the petition, the Assistant State's Attorney wrote that he had \\"promised\\" to Hamer that \\"a recommendation for a reduction of his [Hamer's] sentence would be made and, if possible, effectuated\\"Napue, 360 U.S. at 267. if he agreed to cooperate by testifying against Napue and several other defendants. The petition referred to the agreement to seek a lower sentence for Hamer as a \\"compact entered into between the duly authorized representatives of the State of Illinois and George Hamer\\", and noted that Hamer testified only after being given \\"definite assurance\\" of a recommendation for a lower sentence.Napue, 360 U.S. at 267–268. Napue subsequently filed a post-conviction petition asking for reversal of his conviction, arguing that Hamer's testimony that he was not promised a lower sentence was false, and that Assistant State's Attorney's knowing failure to correct Hamer's statement rendered Napue's conviction unconstitutional. The trial court held a hearing at which the Assistant State's Attorney testified that he had only promised to help Hamer if Hamer's assertion that he was just a reluctant participant in the murder was true. The Assistant State's Attorney went on to testify that there was no promise to reduce Hamer's sentence if Hamer testified, and that his petition to lower Hamer's sentence used language that \\"[he] should not have used\\". On the basis of the Assistant State's Attorney's testimony, the trial court denied the petition to overturn Napue's conviction. Napue appealed to the Supreme Court of Illinois, which affirmed the denial of Napue's petition with two justices dissenting. The Supreme Court of Illinois disagreed with the trial court and found that the Assistant State's Attorney had promised Hamer a recommendation for sentence reduction, and that the Assistant State's Attorney knew that Hamer was lying by testifying to the contrary. However, it held that because a public defender had testified that he would try to reduce Hamer's sentence, the jury was aware that Hamer would be trying to reduce his sentence, and that accordingly, Hamer was not entitled to relief. Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren delivered the opinion of the Court Napue asked the Supreme Court to review the case, which granted certiorari.Napue v. Illinois, cert. granted, 358 U.S. 919 (1958). Chief Justice Earl Warren delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. The Court held that because the credibility of a witness can often be critical in the jury's verdict a prosecutor's knowing failure to correct false testimony violates the Fourteenth Amendment even when the testimony presented affects only the credibility of the witness and does not directly relate to the innocence or guilt of the defendant. The Court further held that the false testimony must be corrected by the prosecution whether the prosecutor actively sought false testimony or simply allows it to occur. The Court reiterated that prosecutors have a duty to seek to correct false testimony when it occurs in order for a trial to be fair, and held that any false testimony allowed by the prosecutor that may affect the outcome of trial creates a violation of due process rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Applying those standards to Napue's case, the Court held that because the prosecution knowingly failed to correct false testimony made by its witness that \\"may have had an effect on the outcome of the trial\\",Napue, 360 U.S. at 272. Napue's due process rights had been violated. The Court accordingly reversed Napue's conviction. Subsequent developments After Napue, in 1963, the Supreme Court decided Brady v. Maryland, a landmark case in which the Court held that Due Process Clause requires prosecutors to disclose all exculpatory evidence to the defendant. In 1972, the Court decided in Giglio v. United States that it is a due process violation if a prosecutor fails to correct perjured testimony if the prosecutor's office was aware of the lie, even if the individual prosecutor in the courtroom was not. In Giglio, the Court also decided the threshold for materiality for Napue claims, holding: \\"A new trial is required if the false testimony could [...] in any reasonable likelihood have affected the judgment of the jury\\".

Investigation and trial  The suspects could be identified using recordings by security cameras. The trial began on 12 June 2018 and prosecutor Stina Lundqvist charged the defendants with aggravated arson and a hate crime and demanded an eight year prison sentence for each and deportation for all. All three suspects, who were aged 19 to 24, were sentenced by the District Court of Gothenburg 25 June 2018 for having committed a hate crime, gross unlawful threat (Swedish: ) and attempting to commit gross damage to property (Swedish: försök till grov skadegörelse) against the Jewish congregation and Jews in general, but did not uphold the charge of aggravated arson as the firebombs were not considered powerful enough. The main suspect was a 22-year-old asylum seeker from Gaza, but his asylum application to Sweden rejected. He received a sentence of two years in prison and deportation with an attendant ban on returning until 2028. According to the District Court of Gothenburg, the crime was serious enough to motivate deportation of all three, but the Swedish Migration Agency had given the other two perpetrators permanent residence permits. The elder of the other two accused received prison sentences of two years and the younger one year and three months. The three were born 1994, 1996 and 1999. The prosecutor pointed out that anyone watching the security camera recordings would be in no doubt the intent was to burn down the synagogue and that the court decision had happened due to technicalities, but also expressed satisfaction that the hate crime charge had been upheld. In July 2018, the verdict from the district court was appealed by the three suspects, who are migrants. The prosecutor also announced her intention to appeal the verdict to pursue a conviction for aggravated arson. (Swedish: grov mordbrand).

Kennedy, 456 U.S. 667 (1982), was a United States Supreme Court decision dealing with the appropriate test for determining whether a criminal defendant has been \\"goaded\\" by the prosecution's bad actions into motioning for a mistrial. This matters because the answer determines whether a defendant can be retried. Ordinarily, a defendant who requests a mistrial can be forced to stand trial a second time, see United States v. Dinitz. However, if the prosecution's conduct was \\"intended to provoke the defendant into moving for a mistrial,\\" double jeopardy protects the defendant from retrial. The Court emphasized that only prosecutorial actions where the intent is to provoke a mistrial — and not mere \\"harassment\\" or \\"overreaching\\" — trigger the double jeopardy protection..  Background  Kennedy was charged with stealing an oriental rug. During the first trial, the State of Oregon called as a witness an expert on Middle Eastern rugs who could testify as to the value and the identity of the rug in question. The prosecutor had the following exchange with the witness: Based on this exchange, Kennedy moved for a mistrial, and the trial judge granted the motion. When the state then attempted to retry Kennedy, he moved to dismiss the charges because of double jeopardy. The Oregon Court of Appeals found in Kennedy's favor. The Court of Appeals ruled that the prosecution had not meant to force a mistrial, but still sided with Kennedy because it viewed the prosecution as \\"overreaching.\\"  Opinion of the Court  The Supreme Court then rejected the standard used by the Court of Appeals, stressing that only \\"conduct intended to provoke the defendant into moving for a mistrial\\" would protect a defendant from a second trial following a mistrial.

History The Canon de 120 mm L modèle 1878 was one of a series of heavy artillery pieces designed by Colonel Charles Ragon de Bange. On 11 May 1874 three de Bange heavy cannons (120 mm, 155 mm, 240 mm) and two mortars (220 mm, 270 mm) were ordered by the French Army. The mle 1878 was advanced for its time due to being built completely of steel instead of a steel liner and cast iron reinforcing hoops of the previous Canon de 240 mm C mle 1870-87. Design The 120 mm L mle 1878 was a breech loaded gun with a de Bange obturator and used separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. It had a box trail carriage, two wooden spoked wheels with steel rims and an unsprung axle. The 120 mm L mle 1878 was lighter and more mobile than its heavier brother the Canon 155 mm L mle 1877. It had roughly the same range and rate of fire as the Canon 155 mm L mle 1877, but it fired a lighter projectile. The 120 mm L mle 1878 was classified as a siege et de place (stationary siege gun) for the defense and attack of Fortifications. In line with this mission, the carriage was tall because it was expected that its barrel would project out over a forts parapet and use its range to provide counter-battery fire against enemy artillery. First world war Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. Fortresses, armories, coastal fortifications, and museums were scoured for heavy artillery and sent to the front. Suitable field and rail carriages were built for these guns in an effort to give their forces the heavy field artillery needed to overcome trenches and hardened concrete fortifications. An early drawback of the gun was that it involved considerable time to prepare a firing platform made of timbers before use. An external recoil cylinder was then bolted to the platform and connected to the bottom of the gun carriage. Without it, the gun had no recoil mechanism and when fired the gun rolled back onto a set of ramps behind the wheels and then slid back into battery. In order to traverse the carriage had to be levered into position and due to its lack of recoil mechanism, it had to be re-aimed after every shot, which limited its rate of fire. An early modification to make the guns suitable for field use was the fitting of Bonagente grousers to the wheels to improve balance and reduce ground pressure on soft ground. An added bonus was they slowed recoil and didn't require extensive site preparation to bring the guns into action. At the outbreak of WWI, there were 2,417 in reserve or at forts. Due to its light weight, good range, and heavy shell 120 were chosen to equip horse-drawn artillery units at the outbreak of the First World war in order to give them heavy artillery and they could be towed at . The end of the box trail could be attached to a limber for towing and each gun was provided with a caisson for ammunition. For transport, the 120 mm L mle 1878 could be transported in one piece by a horse team in comparison to the Canon 155 mm L mle 1877 which needed to have its barrel removed from the carriage and transported separately. However, the barrel could be pulled rearward and fastened to the trail for transport. Experiments with motor traction during 1914 were successful and there was a requirement for 100 batteries to be motorized in 1915. Motorization promised speeds of and although mobile, the carriage was lightly built which negatively affected its durability when used as a field piece. During the Second Battle of Champagne in 1915, 60% of the pieces never reached the front due to being damaged during transport and afterwards towing speed was restricted to . Second world war At the end of the first world war, there were still 526 guns in French service. In 1939 there were 600 pieces in reserve and During the Second World War. A number equipped the forts of the Séré system of Rivières des Hauts-de- Meuse (Fort Troyon and Fort Liouville ) with another 92 in artillery regiments of the Maginot Line. A number were also still in use with Belgium, Finland, Italy, and Poland. Variants *Affût-truck Peigné-Canet mle 1897 – Was developed by Lieutenant Colonel Peigné and engineer Gustave Canet at the turn of the century. This conversion involved mounting the guns on variable gauge rail wagons which ran on narrow-gauge tracks at the forts of Verdun, Toul, Épinal, and Belfort. Each fortress was supposed to have twelve 155 C and eight 120 L guns on the same carriage. These allowed the guns to be quickly re- positioned to different parts of the fort and brought up ammunition and supplies. The guns were mounted on flatbed rail-cars with folding side panels that created a circular base when unfolded, they were also stabilized with four folding outriggers. The guns were mounted on articulated center pivot gun mounts which provided high angles of elevation, 360° of traverse and an integrated hydro-pneumatic recoil mechanism. *Gun Shields – In 1914 some guns were fitted with gun shields, but the protection provided was poor and they rattled excessively during transport so they were removed. *Carriage and recoil mechanism – It is believed that in addition to mounting the barrel of the Canon de 155 mm L mle 1877 on a carriage that Schneider designed for the Russian M1910 Howitzer to create the Canon de 155 L modèle 1877/14 Schneider, a limited number were also built with Canon de 120 mm L modèle 1878 barrels. *120 mm L mle 1878/16 – In order to replace losses and expand the numbers of guns in service the mle 1878 was put back into production in 1916. The resulting guns were classified as mle 1887/16 and incorporated the following changes: a simplified and strengthened carriage, the carriage didn't need to be connected to a limber for motor towing, increased 45° elevation, and the gun barrel didn't need to be withdrawn before transport. Lastly, the closing mechanism for the breech was reworked. *Armata wz. 1878/09/31 and wz. 1878/10/31 – This conversion carried out in 1931 by the Starachowice Arsenal in Poland involved removing the barrel from the original carriage and mounting them on the carriages of 152 mm howitzer M1909 and 152 mm howitzer M1910 captured during the Polish-Soviet War. The recoil mechanism, lower height and integral loading tray improved the rate of fire to three rounds per minute and an enlarged propellant chamber gave higher velocity and slightly improved range . Approximately 48 guns were converted. Ammunition Types of ammunition available were: * Common * Gas * High Explosive * Incendiary * Shrapnel Users * - At least 2 artillery batteries remained in active use until the Second World War. One battery saw limited combat use with the 5th Army Corps,https://18daagseveldtocht.be/grote-eenheden/legerkorpsen/vde- legerkorps/ while another battery was employed as coastal artillery. https://18daagseveldtocht.be/artillerie/legerartillerie/5de-regiment- legerartillerie * – During the Winter War 78 guns were given to Finland. After Poland was defeated Germany sold 24 captured wz. 1878/10/31 guns to Finland and these served until 1944. * * – During the First World War Germany operated as many as 40 captured guns and after French ammunition supplies ran out they produced their own ammunition. * – Received by the French during the First World War. Used in the Macedonian front, they later equipped the Heavy Artillery Regiment of the Army of Asia Minor during the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922, and were still used during World War II * – During the First World War 160 guns were delivered to Italy and at the outbreak of the Second World War 74 guns were still in operation. After the occupation of Southern France, another 59 were added. * – The Germans captured a number of these guns but their use is unknown. * – 54 guns were supplied to Poland in 1919 and 48 were later converted to Armata wz. 1878/09/31 and wz. 1878/10/31. * – 72 guns were supplied to Romania during the First World War. * - An unknown number were used by Serbia during both the Balkan Wars and First World War. * - US troops used a combination of French and British artillery during the First World War due to insufficient production of US made guns.

The site, discovered in 1996 and systematically excavated since 2007, extends along the valley of the small Tollense river, to the east of Weltzin village, on the municipal territories of Burow and Werder. Thousands of bone fragments belonging to many people have been discovered along with further corroborative evidence of battle; current estimates indicate that perhaps 4,000 warriors from Central Europe fought in a battle on the site in the 13th century BC. As the population density was approximately 5 people per square kilometer, this would have been the most significant battle in Bronze Age Central Europe known so far and makes the Tollense valley currently the largest excavated and archaeologically verifiable battle site of this age in the world. Discovery and Excavation The Tollense valley. The find site is near Burow, in the upper half. In 1996, a voluntary conservationist reported finding a humerus bone at the Tollense riverside at low water with an embedded arrowhead made of flint. Preliminary archaeological excavations began the same year around this site and further human and animal bones were found. During the following years, a club made of ashwood was discovered as well as a hammer-like weapon made of sloe-wood and more bones. The Tollense near Burow today Since 2007, the area has been excavated systematically under the direction of the local State Office for Culture and Conservation, the State Office for Conservation of neighbouring Lower Saxony, and the University of Greifswald. Divers of the local Society for Underwater Archaeology carefully searched the Tollense riverbed and -bank and found more human remains. Since 2009, the MV Ministry of Culture has supported research in the area and on the findings, joined since 2010 by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. The primary focus lies on exploring the extent of the site and excavating the main site covered by about of peat. As of late 2017, had been excavated, but the entire battlefield is estimated to be at least ten times that size. Volunteers have surveyed the grounds with metal detectors, investigating mainly the dug-out material from the Tollense. Greifswald's Department of Geography examined the geological make-up of the valley and determined the river's former course, and laser scanning was used to chart the terrain surface. The human remains were analysed at Rostock University. Site Situated in the North German plain, north of Berlin, the site stretches for several hundred meters on both sides of the small river. Within the plain, the Tollense meanders in a wide valley between marshy meadows and low hills. During the last millennia, the river's course has been only slightly modified. In the Bronze Age, the landscape was relatively open; human influence was small as the population density at that time is estimated to have been only 3 to 5 people per sq. km. \\"In 2013, geomagnetic surveys revealed evidence of a long bridge or causeway stretching across the valley. Excavated over two dig seasons, the submerged structure turned out to be made of wooden posts and stone. Radiocarbon dating showed that although much of the structure predated the battle by more than 500 years, parts of it may have been built or restored around the time of the battle, suggesting the causeway might have been in continuous use for centuries—a well-known landmark.\\" The valley of the Tollense during a winter flood, close to Kessin and Weltzin Results As of late 2017, the remains of some 140 men had been identified. Most of these were young men between the ages of 20 and 40, but there were also at least two women identified among 14 skeletons that were genetically tested. Before March 2016, about 10,000 human and 1,000 animal bones had been found; by March 2018, that number had risen to a total of about 13,000 fragments. The total number of dead is estimated between 750, to more than 1,000. The total number of fighters might have ranged between 3,000 and more than 5,000, assuming a casualty rate of 20-25%. In one spot, 1,478 bones were found within just , potentially the remnants of a pile of corpses or a final pocket of resistance. Radiocarbon dating indicates a timeframe between 1300 and 1200 BC, the Nordic Bronze Age. As no clear traces of healing have been found on any of the wounds, the whole encounter seems to have taken place in not much more than a day. A quarter of skeletons \\"show signs of healed traumas from earlier fights, including three skulls with healed fractures\\", so many trained and experienced warriors seem to have taken part. Initially, alternative explanations were considered, in part because \\"[b]efore Tollense, direct evidence of large-scale violence in the Bronze Age was scanty, especially in this region\\". However, the location in a swamp and the lack of any ornaments or pottery made a cemetery unlikely (as local preference at the time was for dry ground). Furthermore, the victims were mostly male and between 20 and 40 years of age, killed by a variety of weapons and wounds; therefore mass human sacrifice seemed unlikely. Spears, clubs, swords, knives, sickles and arrows were used during the battle. Many of the skulls (of which over 40 were found) show signs of battle wounds, with a bronze arrowhead found in one of them. By late 2017, about 50 bronze arrowheads had been found. Remnants of the arrows' wooden shafts provided a further possibility for dating with more than a third dating to the same time as the bones. Contrasting these arrowheads with others made from flint and with wooden clubs, it has been surmised that two differently-equipped groups confronted each other. No swords have been found so far, but bones show cutting traces typical for this type of weapon. Some combatants rode into battle as evidenced by horse bones (of at least five horses) found on site. The original arrowhead's position in the initially found humerus bone shows that an archer on foot wounded a horseman. The fact that almost no material finds were made between the bones except for single arrowheads, suggests that the corpses were robbed after the battle. Given that most remains are no longer in anatomical connection, the victors probably threw the dead into the river, which carried them downstream. They were then deposited in a calmer part of the river, covered by turf and thereby partially conserved. In 2010, a golden spiral ring was found on the banks of the Tollense; then in June 2011, a similar one, long and weighing 10 g. The material was identified by X-ray diffraction as tin. These findings are of special importance because of their rarity and because tin was vitally needed for making bronze. In fact, these are the oldest known tin items in Germany. The chronologically closest similar find is one from Hallstatt (Austria) - 600 years younger. At first, research on the remains by Aarhus University suggested that the combatants stemmed from two populations. Fighters of one of the groups were thought to have come from a distant region, as they had a diet including millet, which was allegedly not widely known in the North at that time, but this latter claim has been refuted. Palaeogenetic and strontium analyses were used to shed further light on the combatants' geographical origin but revealed no decisive evidence, according to State Archeologist Jantzen. Research on 14 skeletons in 2020 confirmed they all hailed from Central Europe and were genetically similar. None of those individuals was able to digest milk - although this trait (nowadays common in Europe) was hitherto thought to have spread several thousand years earlier. It has been speculated that a better-armed group from the South or West wanted to cross the river on their way north- or eastwards on a strategic, long- established causeway. This road might well have been used for long-distance trade in tin and luxury goods (e.g. pearls from the Persian Gulf, found near Halle, or Mediterranean glass pearls found close to nearby Neustrelitz; both from 1200 BC). The battle seems to coincide with a period of heightened militancy 3,250 years ago, as metal became increasingly scarce north of the Alps and populations seem to have moved. Significance The overseeing State Archaeologist Detlef Jantzen claims this to be the oldest archaeologically verifiable battlefield in Europe and one of the 50 most important find sites worldwide. He also said: \\"The Tollense site has a dimension that nobody would have deemed possible for our region.\\" Helle Vandkilde, archeologist at Aarhus University commented \\"Most people thought ancient society was peaceful, and that Bronze Age males were concerned with trading and so on [...] Very few talked about warfare.\\" A group of 5,000 combatants implies that they had been gathered, organised, fed, briefed, and led into battle. According to the researchers at the site, this would have been an astounding feat for the time, probably enabled by a central government. This would mean that socio-political development in Central Europe was more advanced and more bellicose than previously assumed, roughly at a time when Egypt and the Hittites concluded their famous peace treaty. \\"The well-preserved bones and artifacts add detail to this picture of Bronze Age sophistication, pointing to the existence of a trained warrior class and suggesting that people from across Europe joined the bloody fray.\\" Bibliography * Jantzen et al. 2011.

When the registrar, Reese Happersett, refused to allow her to do so, Francis filed a lawsuit. \\"Since women were not allowed to file suit on their own behalf, Virginia was named as co-plaintiff.

In 1854 Watkinson and Robey Engineers and Millwrights were manufacturing Portable Engines and machinery of every description in Rumbold Street, Lincoln.Details of the Rumbold St Foundry are given in:Page C. (2017), A History of Michael Penistan Junior, Agricultural Engineer, Lincoln, Lincolnshire History and Archaeology, Vol. 49,(2014) Published 2017. They were joined by George Lamb Scott, but in 1855 Watkinson, who had previously worked for Clayton & Shuttleworth of Lincoln, left the company. The business then became Robey and Scott and moved their premises by 1856 to Canwick Road, Lincoln.White’s Directory of Lincolnshire 1856, pg.135 Another partner, Thomas Gamble, joined the firm and Scott resigned in September 1856 to found his own manufacturing company in Manchester. The company then became Gamble & Robey, but by 1868 was known as Robey & Co Ltd. Robert Robey died in 1876 and the firm continued as a partnership led by John Richardson. In 1893 Robey & Co became a limited company. By 1913 Robeys were makers of steam motor wagons, tractors and ploughs and in the First World War manufactured aircraft. The company was purchased by Babcock International in 1984. Robey’s Engineering Products Threshing Machines Robey Trust, Tavistock - threshing machine Threshing machines were one of the mainstays of Robeys products. In 1859 an impressive threshing machine was exhibited at the Manchester and Liverpool Agricultural Show. Threshing machines continued to be made until the 1930s and were often sold with portable engines or traction engines to drive them. Threshing machines developed little in design over this period. They were often also sold with elevators. The Robey Trust in Tavistock has threshing machine No. 3331 of c1880 and is the oldest known surviving Robey threshing machine. Portable Engines Messrs. Robey & Co Ltd, Lincoln portable compound engine 1890s An early report of a Robey portable engine was in July 1855 when the Stamford Mercury reported Messrs. Robey and Scott, of St. Rumbold's lane Foundry, on Monday 1st sent off for the Crimea a tenhorse power high pressure portable steam-engine. It single-cylinder engine, and ……would be adapted to bear the rough usage it will have to encounter. It understood that to be put to the various purposes and to supply the troops with bread. Stamford Mercury - Friday 13 July 1855 pg 3 Portable engines continued to be made until the 1940s. It was from Portable Engines that Traction engines were developed. Robey traction engines Robey Traction engine towing a thrashing machine 1862 Taplin Lincoln Traction Engine 1862 Robeys were in the forefront of traction engine development. The idea that a portable engine could be converted to drive itself under its own power evolved around 1859. The traction engine, in the form recognisable today, developed partly from an experiment in 1859 when Thomas Aveling modified a Clayton & Shuttleworth portable to become self-propelled by fitting a long driving chain between the crankshaft and the rear axle.Bonnett H (1975) ‘’Discovering Traction Engines’’ Shire Publications Ltd, pg 5. Lincoln manufacturers rapidly developed this idea. Robey's first design was to develop a traction engine steered by a man in front of the boiler. This was displayed at the International Exhibition of 1862 and the illustration shows the traction engine towing a thrashing machine. At the same Exhibition Benjamin Dutton Taplin who had an iron foundry by St Peter at Gowts in Lincoln, showed a traction engine of the form that became standard. Also in May that year a Traction engine described as Taplin, Robey and Co. was exhibited at the Bath and West Show. Taplin, who appears to have been too ambitious in the development of his business, had become insolvent at the end of May The London Gazette Publication date:30 May 1862 Issue:22630 Page:2815 Grace’s Guide and it seems likely that Robey had acquired his stock in trade. Robeys continued to produce traction engines that could be steered by a man at the front and a traction engine of this type was exhibited by Robeys at Manchester in 1869.Grace’s Guide Illustration Robey steam tractor, Pendle Knight thumb 125pxRobey traction engine By 1875 the Traction engine exhibited at the Smithfield show was of the more conventional type and around 1879 Robey's made a number of Box's Patent Traction engines. Box's Patent engines had an ingenious device to raise the rear driving wheel of the traction engine and these engines were used particularly for longer distance road transport.\\"Southworth\\" Robeys continued traction engine and steam tractor manufacturing well into the 20th. century. Road Steam vehicles Robey Steamer Robey patent highway locomotive 1862 Robeys were pioneers in developing road steamers. In 1862 an illustration was included in illustrated catalogue of the Industrial Department of the International Exhibition of 1862 of Robeys' Patent Highway Locomotive. No information is given about its specifications. Later Robey steam road vehicles were based on the designs of Robert William Thomson, using his patented rubber tyre, and were driven by a vertical boiler.Fletcher W. (1891) Steam Locomotion on Common Roads Thompson's steamers were intended for drawing passenger vehicles or for heavy haulage on roads. The first of these was the ‘‘Advance’’, commissioned by the Woolwich Arsenal in 1870 and trials were carried out in December 1870. For the first test a covered wagon and an omnibus were attached to the steamer at Robey's works in Canwick Road, and, with a load of 45 passengers, proceeded at a smart pace — not less than six miles an hour —over the iron bridge over the Witham, and up Lindum Hill, a gradient of one in nine achieving a speed of between four and five miles. The 'Advance' then turned on the hill-top with its train in a circle and the run down the hill, which is a full half- mile, was made at times at a great speed, the crowd of sight-seers all running to keep up with it. A second test used two four-wheeled trucks, each weighing three tons and carrying loads of two tons. The 'Advance' was then driven up Canwick Hill, to the south of Lincoln a gradient of one in eight. The purpose of this experiment was to show the capacity of the Steamer for drawing heavy loads on ordinary roads and was successfully accomplished. A later test in July, 1871, used another road steamer, which was made to draw two large omnibuses, filled with passengers, from Lincoln to Grantham, and the trip was completed satisfactorily.Grace’s Guide Over the next two years Robeys built 32 of these vehicles, which were either 8 or 12 horse power versions. A large proportion were exported. These included three to Vienna and others to Ireland, Italy, Greece, Moscow, New Zealand, Australia and Chile. A further Thomson steam vehicle was built in 1877, but apart from traction engines, Robeys appear to have discontinued making road steam vehicles until 1904, when they started manufacturing steam road lorries.”Brooks”, pg.5. Railway Steam Engines Between 1876-84 six steam railway engines were produced. From 1889 to 1924 two narrow gauge engines “Joubert’’ and ‘‘Kruger’’ were used on the Oriental & Sheba valley railway in Transvaal. Similar engines went via the agent Rose Innes to Chile.“Brook”. pg. 95. Robey Steam Rollers Robey Trust - steam rollers Robey's steam rollers were produced mainly after the First World war. Various Australian municipalities imported the Robey 10 T rollers between 1923 and 1927. Robey Steam Wagons Robey were very early in developing steam road vehicles and Started developing Steam Wagons 1906 Graces Guide Tipper Steam wagon Around 1925 Robey's won a contact for the supply of steam tipper lorries to Ceylon.

Winding Engines Papplewick Pumping Station, steam winding engine. - geograph.org.uk - 1777442 These were used as winding engines in colleries. Robey's had developed winding engines by 1894 when an article and illustration of a Robey Compound Underground Hauling Engine was published in 'The Engineer'. An example steam of a winding engine is now at Papplewick Pumping Station. It was built by Robey in 1922 with a horizontal duplex steam winding engine. It was used at Linby Colliery and, although the smaller of the two steam winders, was the coal-puller. It was a fast engine and continued in use until 1982. It was moved to Papplewick in 1983. It is fully restored and runs more or less as it would have been in service. It is one of very few surviving duplex winders and the only one that can be seen operating. First World War Aircraft Production In addition to licence-built designs, Robey designed and built the Robey-Peters Gun-Carrier for the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS). This large 3-seat fighter was ordered by the RNAS in 1916 and the first prototype took off on its maiden flight at Bracebridge Heath in May 1917. The aircraft crashed and was not repaired, with the second machine remaining uncompleted. Second World War and Post War Production Production from 1939 centred on gun mountings, frigate engines and other heavy items. After the war the capacity and expertise of the company was used to fabricate everything from converters for steelworks to parts for the Jodrell Bank radio telescope. In the firm's last years before final closure in February 1988, production was mainly of boilers in oil, gas or solid fuel fired versions which were made in larger numbers.Robey Trust: A brief introduction to Robeys Robeys Works, Canwick Road, Lincoln Robey Lincoln Factory 1879 Robeys Globe Works, Canwick Road Lincoln Robeys rapidly became an important employer in Lincoln and by 1865 were employing 114 men. The works covered a total area along Canwick Road of seven acres and around 1870 the name of Perseverance Ironworks was changed to the Globe Works. The layout of the works is shown in a print of 1879 The facade on the Canwick Road originally had a large entrance way surmounted by a tower. This may have been designed by the Lincoln architect William Watkins. Watkins had designed an extension to the factory in 1873. Watkins had also been architect for a large house built for Robert Robey, overlooking the nearby South Park. A new fitting shop had been added in 1871Lincoln Building Application No 226, 3/01/1871 In 1883 a Coffee Palace and Workmen Mess rooms were built on the opposite side of Canwick Road.Now No 93 Canwick Road. Lincoln Building Application No 1479, 19/09/1883 The main entrance on Canwick Road, surmounted with a globe above the door must date from about 1910. The site was developed over the next few years. A cooling tower was built in 1912 Lincoln Building Application No 5066, 11/09/1912 During the First World War considerable additions were made, including new workshops on the Canwick Road and on the Coultham Street side. Some were to designs by the architect F. W. Horton. A new power house with chimney was added in 1915 Lincoln Building Application No 5327, 14/07/1915 A shop and offices for aircraft production were added on the Canwick Road side at a late stage in the war Lincoln Building Application No 5463, 16/01/1918 The Robey Charitable Trust in Tavistock  Robey Trust - steam rollers. The original 1930 steamroller is in the foreground The Robey Trust is based at the New Perseverance Ironworks, is a charity dedicated to continuing the traditions of the Robey Engineering Company of Lincoln. This involves not only the maintenance in working order of many Robey engines, the vast majority of them steam engines, but also continuing and transmitting to coming generations the expertise required to preserve and run these machines.Devon Museums net The trust was formed as the result of the acquisition of the Robey Tandem Steam roller No 42693 which was rescued from a children's playground in 1983. This was the first engine to be owned and restored by the Robey trust. The Trust also possess other steam rollers including a Tri-tandem No 45655. This engine was built in 1930 and was working for long enough to help construct Britain's first major motorway, the M1. The Trust also has in its collections stationary engines and a Robey 6-ton Steam Wagon (no 42522) made in 1924. The Trust holds a growing archive of historical and technical publications, drawings and photographs and is always pleased to receive items to add to the collection or to copy and return. A 'Robey Register' is being compiled to record details of Robey manufactures known to exist worldwide.Robey Trust  References  Literature *Brooks R.

Voiced by actress Holly Hunter, the character is a superhero who possesses superhuman elasticity, granting her the ability to stretch any part of her body to great proportions. Helen is introduced in the first film as an accomplished superheroine forced into retirement with her husband Bob (Mr. Incredible) after superheroes are outlawed.  Development  When designing the Incredibles family, Brad Bird wanted each of their superpowers to be related to their personality. He felt that as a mother, Helen was required by society to be pulled in many different directions, which led to her being given an elastic ability. Regarding the choice to make Helen the star of Incredibles 2, Bird insisted that it was unrelated with the #MeToo movement, and was instead a choice that came naturally with how the writers wanted to progress the story.  Appearances  In The Incredibles (2004), Helen is seen as Elastigirl in the time before superheroes are banned. She married Bob Parr (Mr. Incredible) and starts a family: Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack. She gives up her vigilante job to become a housewife while her husband worked. When Bob starts to act sneakily, Helen suspects an affair and confronts him. Later, when she discovered her husband is in trouble, she pilots a jet to rescue him, accompanied by Violet and Dash. In Incredibles 2 (2018), the main plot of the film involves Helen becoming the face of a campaign to make superheroes legal again by giving them good public relations through successful missions that don't cause collateral damage to the city. Although she ends up becoming Evelyn's victim, she is then rescued by her children, with Helen finally learning of Jack-Jack's first of 17 superhuman abilities. Following that was a showdown on a plane between Elastigirl and Evelyn which resulted in a humiliating defeat, and almost death for Elastigirl.  Powers and abilities  Elastigirl's primary superpower is elasticity, which allows her to stretch various parts of her body to many different sizes. This ability can extend to shapeshifting, as she can use elasticity to change her form and density, as when she morphed into a boat and a parachute. She can achieve superhuman levels of strength, durability, and agility using her elasticity powers. In addition to her powers, Elastigrl is a capable pilot, operative, and tactician, as well as an exceptional hand-to-hand combatant.  Critical reception  Syfy Wire praised the sequel for making its hero a \\"kickass mom\\". Upon the release of Incredibles 2, there was some discourse surrounding the sexualization of Helen's character. Hundreds of fans on social media described the character as \\"thicc\\", a slang term referring to having large buttocks combined with a narrow waist, while The New Yorker likened the character to Anastasia Steele from Fifty Shades of Grey.

It was built from 1885 to 1900. It is also known as Walter Sully & Co. Pty Ltd. It today houses the Broken Hill Regional Art Gallery. The property is owned by Broken Hill City Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Walter Sully established his first store in Silverton in 1882. In 1885 he moved to Broken Hill and erected a two-storey stone building with an arched, galvanised iron roof. This was used as the first post office in Broken Hill, commencing operation on 1 November 1886. An adjoining building was erected some years later in two separate parts – an office and a grocery store. This may have been around 1900. The office was reputedly in the centre building. On 29 November 1907 Walter Sully & Co. Pty Ltd was formed as a limited company with Walter Sully as chairman, H. B. Sweetapple as Managing Director and five other directors. In 1924 Sully died in England and Sweetapple became Managing Director. Sweetapple held this position until 1971 when Mr K. Hammond became Managing Director. Sullys provided all the heavy machinery and equipment for the development and exploration of Broken Hill's mineral field: explosives, candles, timber, metal machinery, general hardware, paints, tractors and liquor. The firm had its own livery stables and blacksmith at the rear of the buildings. Vines 1987: 5 Sully's Emporium ceased business in 1985, by which time it was the longest-serving commercial business in Broken Hill. In 1998, the building was purchased by the Broken Hill City Council as a new home for the Broken Hill Regional Art Gallery. It subsequently underwent a heritage refurbishment under architect Elizabeth Vines, preserving many heritage features and winning a number of heritage awards. Following the completion of the renovations, the gallery relocated to the emporium building in October 2004.  Description  The Walter Sully Emporium is situated on the north- west side of Argent Street, adjoining The Silver City Working Men's Club. The ground is flat and without any substantial vegetation. The ground is partially covered by bitumen. The building is a two-storey stone structure with a cellar covering the rear sections of the building. The first stage (1885) comprises the double fronted shop with staircase to the overhead gallery and to the cellar. The second stage (c.1900) comprises two shops with a cellar underneath. The walls were originally exposed stone with red brick quoining and parapet detailing. Later, probably during the building of the 1900 extension, the facade was unified with render detailing and a veranda erected to unify the front elevation. The shopfronts are timber, the original design copied in the extension. Between 1939 and 1957 all the facade detailing was removed and has been replaced with cement render. Pilasters (built 1900) divide the shopfronts with quasi-corinthian capitals and a new verandah has been added. The verandah has a timber framed roof of shallow convex shape, steel posts of two sizes and a concealed gutter behind the fascia hoarding. The building roof is galvanised iron. The roof to the original building is a shallow barrel shape with small steel bow truss supports. The roof to the later section comprises two gables concealed behind the shop parapet with a central box gutter and ending in two hips with roof ventilators at the north end. Corrugated iron outbuildings, a brick explosive store, underground tank and underground well are also located on the site.Vines 1987: 9 &12 The building was reported as being in poor physical condition at the time of its heritage listing, prior to the renovations by Broken Hill City Council.  Heritage listing  The emporium was the longest surviving commercial business in Broken Hill until its closure and was instrumental in the development and exploration of the mineral field. It forms part of an important Argent Street streetscape.Vines 1987: 4 Walter Sully Emporium was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. It is the earliest surviving commercial business in Broken Hill until its closure in 1985 and was associated with two well known Broken Hill families, the Sullys (1885–1924) and the Sweetaples (1924–1985). The business provided all the heavy machinery and equipment for the development and exploration of Broken Hill's mineral field. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The emporium is a strong element in the Argent Street streetscape. Erected in two stages, the two storey buildings are notable, despite defacement of the facade by removal of original facade mouldings and the single storey verandah. It forms an integral part of the streetscape. (vines 1987: 4) The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The interior survives in original condition, retaining early office furniture and timber store shelving. The upper residence floors retain early finishes which, although in poor condition, provide a catalogue of decorative finishes utilised in Broken Hill from c.1900 – c.1940.Vines 1987:4  See also   References   Bibliography  *  Attribution  External links Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register Category:Buildings and structures in Broken Hill, New South Wales Category:Commercial buildings in New South Wales Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register ","title":"Walter Sully Emporium"},{"id":"57765164","text":"Holckenhus is a late 19th-century, residential perimeter block located between Dantes Plads (Nos. 2–6), H.

In the film D'Souza presents a revisionist history comparing the political climate surrounding the 45th President of the United States Donald Trump to that of the 16th President, Abraham Lincoln. The film argues that the Democratic Party from both eras was critical of the presidents of the time and that the Democrats have similarities to fascist regimes, including the Nazi Party. The film was written and directed by Dinesh D'Souza and Bruce Schooley, and produced by Gerald R. Molen. It was produced on a budget of . Death of a Nation was released in the United States on August 3, 2018 and grossed $5.9 million. Film critics criticized the film as propaganda, and both critics and historians noted its falsehoods and misrepresentations. Owen Gleiberman of Variety said, \\"D'Souza's bogus conflation of liberalism and Nazism is really his way of denying the white-supremacist appeal that runs right down the middle of the Trump presidency.\\" Several publications called the film one of the worst of 2018, and review aggregator Metacritic identified it as the worst-ranking film (out of almost 12,000) in the website's history. The film was nominated for four parody-style Golden Raspberry Awards, winning two. Synopsis The documentary compares the 45th President of the United States Donald Trump to the 16th President of the United States Abraham Lincoln, and explores the role of the Democratic Party in opposing both presidents. In the documentary, D'Souza accuses the modern Democratic Party of racism, and attempts to demonstrate how Democrats have used accusations of racism, white supremacy, and fascism as a tool to discredit the political right. He said that the modern political left is currently using these types of accusations in attempts to remove Trump from office \\"by any means necessary.\\" D'Souza also attempts to demonstrate a connection between the Democratic Party's past racism and advocacy for white supremacy and the current party, while saying that the Republican Party has not advocated such things. In addition, D'Souza claims that fascism is a left-wing, rather than right-wing ideology, and that fascist regimes such as the Nazi Party have historically both praised the Democratic Party and used American racial law to inspire their own racial laws. These statements are used to draw parallels between the modern political climate surrounding the election and presidency of Donald Trump with the historical events surrounding Abraham Lincoln's election, presidency, and assassination. Cast The following figures appear in the documentary: Interviews * Dinesh D’Souza, conservative political commentator * Robert Paxton, political scientist * Allen C. Guelzo, Civil War historian * Edwin Black, syndicated columnist and investigative journalist * Stefan Kühl, sociology professor * Richard B. Spencer, white supremacist * James O'Keefe, conservative political activist Re-enactment actors * Victoria Chilap as Sophie Scholl * Pavel Kříž as Adolf Hitler * Rafael Pražák as Benito Mussolini * Don Taylor as Abraham Lincoln Title The title of the film is a reference to the 1915 film The Birth of a Nation, which portrayed the Ku Klux Klan as a heroic force. In Death of a Nation, D'Souza revisits a scene from his earlier documentary, Hillary's America, showing a reenactment of progressive Democratic President Woodrow Wilson screening The Birth of a Nation in the White House. D'Souza said the film was a statement by Democrats at the time, and regarding the name of his documentary, that \\"ironically, my argument is that if you play out the logic of the progressive Democrats, ultimately they will kill America.\\" The Arizona Republics film critic Bill Goodykoontz recognized Death of a Nation as a play on The Birth of a Nation but questioned if making a connection to the \\"hugely influential yet horribly racist film\\" was appropriate. Production The film is based on Dinesh D'Souza's books The Big Lie and Death of a Nation. D'Souza said the basis for his documentary were the books Hitler's American Model: The United States and the Making of Nazi Race Law by James Whitman, and Racism: A Short History by George M. Fredrickson. The film was produced on a budget of $6 million. Release Theatrical run Death of a Nation had its world premiere in Los Angeles, California on July 30, 2018. Figures in attendance included D'Souza, his wife and executive producer Debbie D'Souza, co-producer Aaron Brubaker, conservative political commentator Tomi Lahren, and political candidate Antonio Sabàto Jr. The political documentary premiered in Washington, D.C. on August 1, 2018, being co-hosted by D'Souza and President Donald Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. Also in attendance were United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson, former sheriff David Clarke, reporter Lee Stranahan, alt-right internet troll and conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec, and former Deputy Assistant to the President Sebastian Gorka. * Quality Flix, a subsidiary label of the Christian faith-based film production and distribution company Pure Flix, commercially released the documentary in 1,032 theaters in the United States on August 3, 2018. It was the first political documentary in a decade to be released at over a thousand theaters (the last documentary being Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed), with most documentaries usually being released in select theaters. Death of a Nation was released alongside Christopher Robin, The Spy Who Dumped Me, and The Darkest Minds, and was projected to gross around $3 million in its opening weekend. It grossed $2.3 million, which was the lowest opening of D'Souza's wide releases, and ranked 13th at the box office. Varietys Rebecca Rubin described the performance as a \\"mediocre debut\\" with a \\"tepid\\" average of $2,248 per theater. She said while a documentary grossing over a million dollars would be impressive, it was \\"not exactly promising\\" for a film released in over a thousand locations. It dropped 58.1% to $988K in its second weekend. When compared to D'Souza's previous films, The Guardian theorized that the film's diminishing box office returns can be attributed to the hypothesis that—similarly to trends seen with Michael Moore's left-leaning political films—\\"the success of a partisan political documentary is dependent upon the opposing party being in power during the time of its release.\\" The film grossed a total of $5.9 million in its theatrical run. PostTrak reported that filmgoers gave the film a score of 4 out of 5 stars, while The Hollywood Reporter wrote that those polled by CinemaScore (which was paid by Death of a Nations filmmakers to conduct polls of audiences) gave it a grade of \\"A\\" on an A+ to F scale. Note: CinemaScore polls audiences automatically if a film is distributed to a certain number of theatres. If a film has smaller distribution, the producers may pay CinemaScore to conduct a private polling. Yahoo! News reported, \\"Exit polls show 57% men, 86% over 25, with 41% being over 55 and 69% Caucasian and 10% Hispanic.\\" Varietys Rubin said the documentary \\"has generated some positive sentiment among conservatives\\" such as The Daily Caller journalist Stephanie Hamill. There were dozens of Republican Party watch parties of Death of a Nation across the United States. The New York Times reported the moviegoers' takeaway after one such screening, \\"It was a confirmation of a worldview they feel is often unjustly ridiculed or intentionally ignored. They said it spoke to their deep-seated fears about the fate of the country if Democrats prevail in the November midterms, and did so using the raw, flame-throwing rhetoric that, to them, signals a Trump-like authority and authenticity.\\" Home media Quality Flix and Universal Pictures Home Entertainment released Death of a Nation on home media. It was released on digital HD on , 2018 and on DVD and Blu-ray on , 2018. The Texas Patriots PAC mailed discs to undecided voters ahead of the United States midterm elections on November 6, 2018. Reception Film critics Critics panned the documentary. Haaretzs Adrian Hennigan said they were \\"unmoved by D'Souza's claims for authenticity\\". Hennigan said, \\"Some critics questioned whether they should be giving any space to the filmmaker's right-wing guff in praise of Trump and off-the-screen rants against liberals.\\" The film was sharply criticized for drawing parallels between Democratic Party and Nazi Party ideologies. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 0% based on 13 reviews, with an average rating of 1.75/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 1 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating \\"overwhelming dislike\\". At the end of 2018, the publications The A.V. Club, Variety, Chicago Tribune, and The Playlist listed Death of a Nation among the worst films of the year. * * * Metacritic ranked the film as the worst of 2018 and reported that it also ranked last among the 11,819 films the website had scored in its history. Peter Sobczynski of RogerEbert.com described Death of a Nation as \\"shabbily constructed and artistically bankrupt ... D'Souza's usual stew of cherry-picked facts, overt omissions, inept historical reenactments, slanders, innuendos, stuff taken from his earlier movies, shots of him walking pensively through empty areas and clips from other and better movies\\". He added that the documentary \\"could well be of service to future historians struggling to make sense of our current madness\\". Owen Gleiberman, reviewing for Variety, said, \\"Dinesh D'Souza goes over the top—of hate, and of truth—in his latest documentary, a radical-right screed that equates liberalism with Nazism.\\" Gleiberman compared the film to D'Souza's previous documentaries, \\"Death of a Nation breaks through to a whole new slime-o-sphere of over-the-top ideological libel.\\" The Hollywood Reporters Frank Scheck called the documentary \\"painfully unendurable\\" and that D'Souza's new film was more \\"hyperbolic and hysterical\\" than his past films, particularly with the claim that \\"Democrats... are merely fascists and Nazis, minus the cool iconography\\". Scheck also found the film to have \\"many poorly staged, cheesy historical reenactments featuring actors who wouldn't pass muster at a small- town dinner theater\\". The critic concluded, \\"For all of its incendiary arguments, Death of a Nation is ultimately tedious and repetitive.\\" Bill Goodykoontz, reviewing for The Arizona Republic, described the documentary as \\"messy, unintentionally hilarious\\". Goodykoontz said he gave D'Souza's 2016: Obama's America \\"a somewhat positive review\\" based on craft and despite \\"live- action recreations that are laughably inept\\" and a lack of narrative flow. He said, \\"D'Souza does some of what he did in Hillary's America, taking established facts... and pretending like they are some sort of secret that he alone has uncovered. He addresses some of the counterarguments to his positions... But he's not putting his claims together in any form that makes sense.\\" D'Souza blamed the negative critical reception and the resulting Rotten Tomatoes score on critics being leftist and suppressing his message with negative reviews. Conservative figures The conservative online magazine American Thinker claims that the film's broader points are reasonable, but that the film \\"oversimplifies, sometimes distorts, and excludes inconvenient facts.\\" The commentator stated that despite the film's flaws, the film makes an accurate case that modern Democratic policies of \\"statism and socialism\\" have caused black Americans to have increased dependence on the government, which the commentator describes as \\"a form of enslavement.\\" Golden Raspberry Awards Death of a Nation was nominated for four Golden Raspberry Awards — annual parody awards also known as the \\"Razzies\\" — and won two. President Donald Trump won for Worst Actor based on clips of him appearing in Death of a Nation and Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 11/9. Trump and \\"His Self Perpetuating Pettiness\\" also won for Worst Screen Combo in both documentaries. Death of a Nation was nominated for Worst Remake, Rip-off or Sequel, being connected with D'Souza's previous film Hillary's America. Death of a Nation was also nominated for Worst Screenplay. Historical accuracy In addition to film critics, historians criticized the film for its falsehoods and misrepresentations. Historian Adam Tooze said of the film's premise that the contemporary US Democratic Party's policies matched the Nazi Party's policies is false. The Independent reported, \\"[Tooze] said it was commonplace for conservatives to try and smear progressives by saying the Nazis also had a welfare programme... almost all political parties in Europe in the 1920s supported some sort of welfare scheme. The difference, he said, was that the Nazis were bent on launching 'all out war'.\\" Historian Robert Paxton, who appears in the documentary, said he was interviewed under false pretenses and had his confirmation of Mussolini and Hitler's welfare programs shared without context. Mic reported, \\"[Paxton] forcefully pushed against the idea that fascism is a feature of progressive ideology, explaining that while fascists of the 20th Century often used leftist rhetoric and appeals, they went on to betray those principles in favor of corporatism and conservative elite.\\" Paxton found \\"D'Souza's conclusions to be a distortion of history\\". Historian John Broich, associate professor at Case Western, said the film's premise of connecting liberalism with fascism is a category error, \\"a fallacy in which one compares or conflates things that actually belong in different categories\\". Broich continued, \\"Fascism and leftism belong in fundamentally different categories, because the essence of fascism was, and is, anti-leftism... While historians certainly debate the details, they all agree with this basic precept about the core of fascism.\\" Broich quoted Paxton, who specializes in fascism, \\"[Fascism is] dictatorship against the Left amidst popular enthusiasm.\\" Historian Kevin M. Kruse of Princeton University debunked one of the film's central arguments—that Southern Democrats who were against African Americans' civil rights did not defect from the Democratic Party when it began supporting such civil rights—saying that many voters, but only some politicians, defected.

Ravi shot to fame in the UK in 2014 when he mobilised his charity to help the people of Somerset after heavy rain and high winds caused huge amounts of damage to property and land. Later that year the people of Somerset nominated him to appear on the national hit TV show 'Surprise Surprise' as a way of saying thank you for his support. He received a family holiday and a new car. In 2015 Ravi helped the people of Nepal after an earthquake killed nearly 9,000 people and injured nearly 22,000. He encouraged his newly made friends from Somerset to help. The BBC made a film about Ravi in 2016 titled 'The Selfless Sikh' which documented his journey to northern Iraq, where he provides aid to Yazidi families who have fled their homes to escape the brutality of Islamic State. The film follows Singh into the heart of Iraqi Kurdistan as he delivers aid to Yazidi refugees in makeshift camps, barely 70 kilometres from the IS stronghold of Mosul. In 2016 Ravi's team assisted motorists stranded in the Dover traffic chaos by delivering 6000 water bottles. Some travellers spent up to 15 hours at a standstill on the M20. Ravi was praised widely on social media.

Lyrics for \\"Awake, our drowsy souls\\" (1769), by Elizabeth Scott History It was first published in the Baptist Collections of Ash and Evans, Bristol, 1769, No. 307, in 5 stanzas of 6 1., and appointed as \\"A hymn for Lord's Day Morning.\\" From that collection it passed into several later hymnals, including John Rippon, John Dobell, and others. By the early 20th-century, it was almost entirely unknown to modern hymn-books except in the United States, having been superseded by \\"Awake, ye saints, awake, And hail\\", and others as a recast of the same in 4 stanzas (stanza iii. being the original with \\"and\\" for \\"while,\\" 1. 3) made by Thomas Cotterill, and given in the first edition of his Selection, 1810. This form of the hymn had somewhat extensive use in Great Britain and the U.S., and is usually ascribed correctly to \\"Elizabeth Scott and Thomas Cotterill.\\" Alternate versions In many of the modern American hymnals, stanza iv. is omitted; but the English generally give the text from Cotterill as in Baptist Psalms and Hymns, 1858. In this case, the only alteration is \\"blest \\" for \\"bless'd \\" in stanza i., line 5. Another form of the hymn is:— \\"Servants of God, awake.\\" It consists of st. i.—iii- of Cotterill's recast, slightly altered. It appeared in the Harrow School Hymn Book, 1855, and from then on passed into Church Hymns, 1871, No. 39. In the Hymn-Book of the Evangelical Association, Cleveland, Ohio, 1881, No. 604, stanzas i., ii. are given as \\"Children of God, awake \\"; and in the Marlborough College Hymns, 1869, stanzas i.—iii. as \\" Come, sons of God, awake.\\" The authorship of \\"Awake, ye saints, awake\\" is ascribed to Cotterill, on the ground that he wrote the most of what is its present form. In Caleb Evans's Collection, fifth edition, 1786, it appears in five stanzas, commencing, “Awake, our drowsy souls.\\" Rippon has it with the same text and the same title: “A Hymn for the Lord’s Day Morning.\\" Evans credits it to “D,” that is, Dr. Philip Doddridge, but Dobell, who reprints it in six stanzas, has assigned it to “Scott”. It was altered about the year 1810 by Cotterill, for his Sheffield collection. The original was discovered in manuscript, in the library of Yale College, where it remained. Professor Frederic Mayer Bird gave much care to Scott's biography and hymns, and elaborately annotated this manuscript volume in the columns of the New York Independent.

Pimentel graduated from East Providence High School where he served as President of the Young Democrats club. Pimentel is currently working for the Latino Policy Institute at Roger Williams University.  Editorials  Pimentel has written editorials for several news agencies, most prominently Al-Jazeera, The Guardian and The Providence Journal. Pimentel's commentary is usually regarding immigration policy and Dreamers and is often critical of the Trump Administration for ending DACA and Congress for its lack of action to protect Dreamers.  Activism   Immigration policy  Pimentel's main policy focus is US immigration reform. Pimentel has rallied other Dreamers both in his native Rhode Island and in Washington, D.C. to push for a permanent fix for DACA recipients. On a national level, Pimentel has been critical of the Trump Administration's positions on immigration and ending the DACA program. Pimentel has also been critical of congressional inaction on the issue of Dreamers. Pimentel has advocated for Dreamers both with his local congressional delegation and leaders in Washington D.C. In Rhode Island, Pimentel has lobbied both the Governor of Rhode Island and the Rhode Island General Assembly for legislation granting undocumented immigrants driver's licenses. While Pimentel's efforts have been unsuccessful to-date, Rhode Island did pass a law to continue issuing driver's licenses and other protections offered under DACA to current recipients regardless of future federal policy. Due to his extensive work on the issue, he was asked to introduce Governor Gina Raimondo at the bill signing. Pimentel was also cited as one of Rhode Island's politically 'Hot' individuals by news site GoLocalProv.  Other issues  While attending East Providence High School, Pimentel advocated against high stakes standardized testing in schools, particularly the PARCC test in Rhode Island, encouraging parents to 'opt out' their students. In late 2015, controversial 'dancing cop' Tony Lepore had been scheduled to perform during the holidays in East Providence, Rhode Island, Pimentel's home town. Lepore had been removed from his long standing job directing traffic in Providence, Rhode Island after a series of events leading to racial tensions in the city. Pimentel organized and led protests along with Black Lives Matter and other local civil rights figures which successfully forced Lepore to withdraw.

These behaviors can include aimless wandering, hypersensitivity to loud sounds and brightness, weakness or coordination issues, and the incapability to nurse. Neonatal Maladjustment Syndrome is often referred to as Dummy Foal Syndrome by the equine community due to the aimlessness of the foals, nicknaming them “wanderers” or “dummy foals”.  Symptoms  Often symptoms of NMS do not always exhibit themselves immediately after birth, as foals will at first appear normal. Often it takes a number of hours for the foal’s odd behavior to become noticeable. These behaviors can include: * Head-pressing * Inability to find udder or nurse * Inability to right itself upon standing or walking * Muscle weakness * Limited flight reaction * Sensitivity to light and sound * Limited reaction to light and sound * Sensitivity to touch * Limited reaction to touch * Licking, chewing or biting stall walls or feeders * Wandering In severe cases, a foal can start to experience seizures. These seizures range from short, mild lapses to longer, full body seizures.  Possible causes  Oxygenation While it is unknown exactly what causes NMS, many vets and horse owners believe it is due to a lack of oxygen available to the foal during the very important perinatal period, which means shortly before, during or after the birth (also known as foaling). This could stem from under oxygenated blood flow, decreased blood flow or damaged blood cells. The lack of oxygen could also come from early placenta detachment, where the placenta detaches from the uterus for a longer period of time than normal births. Many things could cause this detachment, although twin births, uterine or urinary infections, low blood pressure and other diseases increase the risk. Neurosteroids Another possible cause, as theorised and researched by the University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, could be neurosteroids that are essential and active while the foal is in utero. Foals receive stimulation of certain neurosteroids that keep them “quiet” during gestation. This is important for the health and safety of both mare and foal. If a foal were to move around similarly to humans during gestation, injuries and possible miscarriage could occur. These neurosteroids ensure that the foal remains relatively still in the womb. However, after the birth it is important that these neurosteroids stop. Horses are prey animals, with a strong flight response. If these neurosteroids continue to suppress the movement and reactions of a foal, it would be at a greater risk in the wild. Foals should be up and ready to run around shortly after birth, typically within a few hours. It is thought that the “switch” that changes these neurosteroids occurs during birth. While the foal is moving through the birth canal, the pressure exerted on the foal’s body acts as that switch. Most live births take between 20–40 minutes. It is during this time that the sedative neurosteroids stop production, signally the foal to “wake up”. This theory is supported by the discovery of sedative neurosteroids in the bloodstream of foals, shortly after birth, that develop NMS.The neurosteroids are capable of crossing the blood brain barrier. This allows them to affect the central nervous system of the foal.  Treatments  Early diagnosis and intervention is extremely important. While the foal may not be cured, early treatment can vastly increase capabilities and quality of life. Intravenous Treatment One way to treat a dummy foal is through a mixture of neuroprotective agents, known colloquially as a “dummy jug”. This can allow for treatment of the possible neurosteroids still in the bloodstream, as well as adding additional vitamins through IV fluids. Additional help can come in the form of nasogastric tube feeding or bottle feeding, if the foal is able to bottle feed. While these may not entirely help solve the problem, they won’t negatively affect the foal in any way. Madigan Foal Squeeze Procedure A common treatment for NMS has long been used by farmers, equine vets and breeders. This treatment uses series of ropes and knots wrapped around the foal, then pressure is applied for a set amount of time. While this method has long been used, it wasn’t until 2015 that it was named. The name Madigan Foal Squeeze Procedurecomes from one of the central researchers at UC Davis, a veterinary professor and expert on neonatal equine health named John Madigan. These ropes are applied around the midsection of the foal, and pressure is applied by pulling the ropes with a medium amount of pressure for about 20 minutes. This mimics the pressure felt during active birth. This is thought to help the neurosteroids signal the “off switch”. Overall Goals The main goals with any treatment for foals with NMS is to ensure proper nourishment in the early hours of life. Foals should begin nursing from the mare within the first couple hours after birth. If they are not, a veterinary physician should be contacted immediately. This can be counteracted by using a nasogastric feeding tube or bottle feeding, as stated above. The next goal is to help the damaged nerve cells in any way possible. This includes protection for healthy cells and stopping to damage to any more cells. This can be done using some approved drugs aimed at preventing or lessening seizures in the foals, and limiting potentially swelling of muscles and brain tissue. This all helps to limit any further damage caused by oxygen deprivation. In any case, an equine veterinarianshould be called and consulted before any treatment is applied. With early intervention and appropriate treatment, studies show that up to 80 percent of foals diagnosed with NMS after brith can make a full recovery and mature into a fully functioning adult.  Connection to humans  The UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine is currently leading the way in researching NMS in America. They not only looked deeply into possible causes and effective treatments, but also how this syndrome could provide answers to other issues. One standout connection to NMS comes from childhood autism spectrum disorder. The researchers noticed that many symptoms of NMS looked similar to the symptoms of childhood autism and illness. The tactile response from the foals seems to mimic some anecdotal stories of touch helping newborn babies with illnesses. This practice is becoming more and more widespread in the United States, often referred to as kangaroo care, a process where a newborn baby is immediately giving to the mother or father for skin-to-skin contact. There is also precedent for further research into neurosteroids in humans. Past research has shown that there are similar neurosteroids concentrations in humans as seen in the foals that present with neonatal maladjustment syndrome. This approach to possible links between human medical science and veterinary science is known as One Health.

However, unlike oral testosterone and conventional oral testosterone esters such as testosterone undecanoate, EC586 has high oral potency, may undergo little or no first-pass metabolism, and may not have disproportionate androgenic effects in the liver. As such, it may have a variety of desirable advantages over oral testosterone, similarly to parenteral testosterone, but with the convenience of oral administration. Evestra intends to seek Investigational New Drug status for EC586 in the fourth quarter of 2018. Relative to parenteral routes of testosterone like transdermal and injection, oral testosterone is characterized by very low bioavailability, a short duration of action, and disproportionate effects on liver protein synthesis. In relation to its low oral bioavailability, testosterone is almost inactive via the oral route, and has not been commercially marketed in an oral formulation. The C17β undecanoate ester of testosterone, testosterone undecanoate, shows somewhat improved oral bioavailability (7%) due to some absorption through the lymphatic system, and is the only oral form of testosterone that is marketed for medical use. However, aside from its marginally improved oral bioavailability, testosterone undecanoate has many of the same issues that oral testosterone has. It has a short duration and must be taken 2 to 4 times per day; it is not absorbed under fasting conditions and must be taken with a meal that contains at least a moderate amount of fat (19 g); it results in a disproportionate and unphysiological increase in circulating dihydrotestosterone levels due to first-pass metabolism; there is high interindividual variability in testosterone levels achieved; and it can cause gastrointestinal side effects; among other issues. Because of its limitations, oral testosterone undecanoate has modest clinical effectiveness relative to injected testosterone esters and is considered to be a secondary choice for therapy. The pharmacokinetics of oral EC586 have been briefly assessed in rats in a small pilot study. Oral EC586 showed area-under-the-curve (AUC) levels that were more than 100-fold greater than those of oral testosterone propionate, the C17β propionate ester of testosterone (AUC0-3h = 330 ng/mL and 2.5 ng/mL, respectively, for doses of 3.0 mg/rat each). As such, EC586 would appear to possess strongly increased oral bioavailability, potency, and systemic exposure relative to testosterone propionate. Additional research and details on the pharmacokinetics and properties of EC586 are to be published \\"soon\\". The mechanism for the absence of first-pass metabolism and lack of disproportionate liver exposure with oral administration has been elucidated for a closely related sulfonamide–proline estradiol ester known as EC508, which shows the same properties as EC586. It is thought to be due to reversible binding of the sulfonamide moiety of EC508 to an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase II (CAII). EC508 shows moderate affinity for human CAII, with an for binding inhibition of 110 nM. CAII is highly concentrated in erythrocytes (red blood cells), which are present in large quantity in the blood of the hepatic portal vein. It is believed that following its absorption in the intestines and its entrance into the hepatic portal vein, EC508 is taken up by and massively accumulated in erythrocytes, which prevents it from entering the liver and results in it being transported by erythrocytes straight into the circulation. From circulating erythrocytes, EC508 is thought to be slowly released and then hydrolyzed into estradiol, an estrogen and the active hormonal form of EC508. However, one sulfonamide estradiol ester related to EC508 known as EC518 showed similar properties with very low or absent binding to CAII and hence probably lacking erythrocyte binding, which raises questions as to whether or how this is possible as well as about the necessity of CAII binding for such properties. In any case, whatever the mechanisms, they are likely to be in common for EC508 and EC586. EC508 is also under development by Evestra, specifically as an estrogen and potent oral estradiol prodrug for use in menopausal hormone therapy in women and as a hormonal contraceptive to prevent pregnancy in women.

Having already lost the tie, the Belarusians played Karatchenia against Mardy Fish in the last of the reverse singles, but the match was abandoned three games in due to rain. Karatchenia partnered with Thomas Fabbiano to win the boys' doubles championship at the 2007 French Open, beating Kellen Damico and Jonathan Eysseric in the final. His professional career was limited to Futures tournaments and he won a total of three ITF doubles titles. In both 2007 and 2008 he appeared in four further Davis Cup ties for Belarus.

He holds the Tomlinson Chair in Science Education at McGill University. Harpp published more than 230 chemistry articles in peer-reviewed publications, his main research interest being organosulfur and selenium molecules. In addition, 20 of his articles on teaching innovation were published. He was appointed as Tomlinson Chair in Science Education in 2013, with the mandate to \\"advance the understanding and practice of science education\\". With Joseph Schwarcz and Ariel Fenster, Harpp is a founding member of the Office for Science and Society. Harpp experimented throughout his teaching career with various visual media, from photographic slides to 8mm movies. With his colleagues at the Office for Science and Society, he pioneered the McGill COurses ONline initiative. A proponent of massive open online courses, Harpp thinks students can benefit from having access these academic opportunities: \\"What if the best organic chemistry course, anywhere, was put on by somebody from, say, the University of Illinois, why shouldn’t we [assign it at our university]?\\" Harpp is also interested in academic integrity. He followed up on his research on the prevalence of cheating by university students by inventing (with others) a computer program that spots cheating in multiple-answer exams. Use of the software, with the introduction of multiple versions of each exam, is credited to practically eliminating this type of cheating at McGill's: \\"I think 90 per cent of the students who tend to cheat will [look at all the obstacles] and say, 'Nah.'\\" Harpp did his Bachelor of Arts at Middlebury College (1959), his Masters at Wesleyan University (1962) and his Ph.D. at the University of North Carolina (1965).

DiBella (born May 17, 1943) is a Connecticut politician and businessman who has served as Chairman of the Board at the Metropolitan District Commission of Connecticut since 2002, a post he previously held from 1977 to 1981. DiBella is currently a lobbyist, and a Principal at CMD Ventures LLC., a company which specializes in real estate management and property development. Personal life William DiBella was born in the city of Hartford, Connecticut in 1943. He is married to Donna DiBella and together they have a son named Marc who is also a politician and lobbyist in Hartford. William DiBella resides with his wife in Old Saybrook and with his son at his son's apartment in Hartford's iconic, I.M. Pei designed, Bushnell Tower; but for political reasons he maintains legal residency in Hartford. Political career Local DiBella's political career got its start when he was elected as a member of the Hartford City Council, a position he would hold from 1971 to 1979. He was also Deputy Mayor of Hartford from 1975 to 1977, serving under Mayor George A. Athanson. State In 1980 DiBella ran for the State Representative in Connecticut's 1st assembly district defeating Republican challenger Anthonye S. Esposito 75.1% to 24.9%. This district consists of Southeastern Bloomfield and Northwestern Hartford, he served as Representative from 1981 to 1983. In 1983 he was elected to the Connecticut State Senate representing Connecticut's 1st Senate District which includes the southern half of Hartford and northern half of Wethersfield, he stayed in the Senate until 1996. William A. DiBella served as the Majority Leader of the Connecticut Senate from 1992-1994. MDC The Metropolitan District Commission of Connecticut is a public municipal corporation empowered by a 1929 Charter from the Connecticut State Assembly, as the water and sewage supplier for much of Metro Hartford the MDC has immense power. It operates with an exceptional level of autonomy and even has its own police force. DiBella was first appointed to the MDC Board of Directors in 1977 and served until 1981. He was appointed a second time to the Board in 2002. Scandals Residency In 2016 a complaint was made that DiBella did not meet the legal residency standards of a Hartford resident. The complaint was made that DiBella lived in Old Saybrook, Connecticut with his wife while claiming to live in Hartford even though he owned no property there. DiBella claimed that he was living with his son Marc when in Hartford and had his own bedroom in their apartment. The State of Connecticut Election Enforcement Commission investigated the claim and found in DiBella's favor in part because he kept a toothbrush and other minor toiletries at his son's apartment and he also received mail there. Involvement in Corruption and Racketeering In 2008 a Federal Court ordered William A. DiBella to pay a penalty of $795,000 for his role in a fraudulent investment scheme. It was alleged that DiBella was involved in a scheme with former Treasurer of the State of Connecticut Paul J. Silvester in which they received kickbacks from Thayer Capital Partners in return for steering $75 million in State Retirement and Trust Fund business to them. DiBella used his career as a lobbyist to cover up the illegal income. The US Securities and Exchange Commission became interested in DiBella during the course of a bribery investigation into Silvester, Thayer Capital, and Thayer Executive Fred Malek. The relationship between DiBella and Malek went beyond Malek's relationship with Silverster; DiBella testified in federal court that Fred Malek told him \\"I need you for the new treasurer,” the incoming Denise Nappier. DiBella's contract also required him to assist Malek personally with \\"ongoing investor relations.\\" The scheme moved much of the State Retirement and Trust Fund into high-risk, long term, non-liquid private equity funds that unbalanced the investment plan, increasing the risk of a long term failure. DiBella co-conspirator Silvester served 79 months in prison for his leading role in the racketeering and corruption. This was one in a long series of court cases in the 1990s and 2000s involving corrupt Connecticut politicians, political corruption was rampant at the highest level in Connecticut during and before this time with a number of Connecticut Politicians serving federal time in the coming years, including Governor John G. Rowland, Bridgeport Mayor Joe Ganim and Hartford Mayor Eddie Perez. MDC DiBellas position as MDC Chairman was not affected by his fraudulent and corrupt undertaking, even though there have been widespread calls for him to step down. The Federation of Connecticut Taxpayer Organizations has added DiBella to their “Hall of Shame” of politicians who grossly betray the public's trust. Fellow MDC Commissioner Mark Pappa stated that “If this was a publicly traded company this conversation wouldn't even happen because there's no question Mr. DiBella would not be sitting here.” Press His relationship with the press has been contentious, a New York Times article claims that his nickname among the press is \\"the Ken doll from hell.” a nickname that makes light of his trademark hair and flashy style.

Initially the group was praised by many pro-ISIL circles on social media in early 2015 claiming it was ISIL expanding into the Daraa Governorate as the group used a similar banner to ISIL however the group held no links to ISIL, in an official statement the group described itself as “an Islamic group…[working] to support the religion of God and make His word highest”, however the group also has not shown any hostilities towards ISIL like many of its allies such as the Southern Front and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (formerly al-Nusra). The group did not take part in fighting between other opposition groups that it is allied with against ISIL affiliates in Southern Syria but a portion of its members did defect to the ISIL affiliated groups at odds with the group's opposition allies. In early and mid 2017 the group joined the Bunyan al-Marsous operation room and took part in several offensives in Daraa against pro-government forces. The decision to join the same operations room with other mainstream opposition groups caused further defections from the group, with many fighters either joining the ISIL-affiliated Khalid ibn al-Walid Army or simply going home.

Rushaway’s Unprecedented Derby Double\\" Background Breeding Rushaway was bred by the prominent Thoroughbred owner, breeder and Hialeah Park Race Track proprietor Joseph E. Widener at his Elmendorf Farm in Fayette County, Kentucky. Rushaway's sire was Haste, owned and raced by Widener and trained by Hamilton Keene. His race wins at age two included the 1925 Grand Union Hotel Stakes and the Saratoga Special Stakes. As a three-year-old in 1926, Haste had a third-place finish in the Belmont Stakes then went on to win the Withers Stakes followed by a gutsy win under jockey Earl Sande over Edward Bradley's Bagenbaggage in the inaugural running of the Fairmount Derby.Fairmount Derby Notes: Aftermath of the First Running of Collinsvilles Great Race and Wonderful Finish., Daily Racing Form, 1926-06-22 Haste's sire was Maintenant, a French-bred son of William K. Vanderbilt's French champion Maintenon. Sent to the United States as a three-year-old, Maintenant was a powerfully built stallion who stood seventeen hands. A Daily Racing Form article described him as a 'whale'. Maintenant debuted at Aqueduct Racetrack and on July 11, 1915 won a mile race with ease.The Thoroughbred Record, July 1, 1916, Vol. 84 No. 1, page 33 However, injuries limited his racing career. Rushaway's dam was Roseway, a daughter of multiple stakes winner Stornoway. Roseway won the 1919 1000 Guineas Stakes, a British Classic race for fillies run over a distance of one mile at Newmarket Racecourse. In the Epsom Oaks, the other Classic for fillies, Roseway ran second to Bayuda. Roseway was sold for breeding usage by her owner/breeder Sir Edward Hulton and in 1925 new owner Joseph Widener brought her to the United States to stand at his Kentucky stud farm. 1935: two-year-old season As a two-year-old, Rushaway had limited success on the racetrack. His best result in a stakes race was a third in the six furlong Joliet Handicap at Lincoln Fields Race Track in Crete, Illinois. 1936: three-year-old season At age three, Rushaway showed some promise after a win over seven furlongs in the February 18 Orlando Purse at owner Joseph Widener's Hialeah Park.New York Times February 19, 1936 article titled \\"Rushaway Takes Orlando Purse\\" A few weeks later in early March, Alfred Tarn, an English-born trainer from Winnipeg, Manitoba, purchased Rushaway for a price reported to be $10,000.Winnipeg Free Press Newspaper Archives Saturday, May 23, 1936 - Page 27 Less than a month later, Rushaway showed his new owner his potential when, on March 29, he broke the track record in winning the mile and one eighth Louisiana Derby at Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans.New York Times\\", March 30, 1976 article titled Rushaway Takes Louisiana Derby On April 18, Rushaway traveled to Arlington Downs in Arlington, Texas where he ran second by one length to the Milky Way Farm Stable colt, The Fighter.New York Times\\", April 19, 1936 article titled \\"The Fighter Defeats Rushaway By Length in Rich Texas Derby\\" A \\"Very Remarkable\\" and \\"Unparalleled\\" racing feat Rushaway's back-to- back wins in a two-day period was and remains a most noteworthy achievement which the Daily Racing Form (DRF) reported was \\"a feat without known precedent in this country or abroad.\\" The accomplishment was made even more remarkable because Rushaway was carrying top weight in the eight-horse field by three pounds yet won by 6 lengths and did it in a new race record time for the mile- and-a-quarter distance.

Baseball '95 (stylized as RBI Baseball '95) is a baseball video game developed and published by Time Warner Interactive exclusively for the 32X in North America in 1995. It is the last game in the R.B.I. Baseball series to be released on a Sega platform, and follows RBI Baseball '94. RBI Baseball '95's history is curious as it was originally announced at CES 1995 for the Sega CD, as well as the 32X, priced in the US at $49.95 and $54.95 USD respectively. For some reason, the game instead moved onto a cartridge, effectively becoming a 32X exclusive, and its price at launch was upped to $59.95. Gameplay and updates RBI Baseball '95 plays differently from its Genesis/Mega Drive predecessors in one very noticeable form: Unlike any of the prior entries going up to 94, all of which had the player delivering pitches and hitting the ball from a view above and behind the umpire (with windows in the upper corners to show runners at first and third base), all instances of this now take place from the catcher's point of view, aimed to deliver a more \\"up close and personal\\" sense of realistic experience while making use of the Super 32X's software rendering and sprite scaling capabilities. When the ball has been hit, the familiar gameplay of the franchise returns, with the player and computer guiding the runners and defense across the baseball field to either get an out or score a run; as with traditional baseball, the game ends when a team has a higher score than their opponent at the end of the ninth or relevant extra inning. Returning for 95, in regards to extra modes, are the ability to play Home Run Derby, tour each stadium in an overhead view, look at the statistics of every team's players, play the traditional Game Breakers that have been present from RBI Baseball IV to 94, attempt to successfully master twenty different defense tactics in the Defense Practice minigame, and create your own teams; not returning for this game is Pickles, a minigame exclusive to 94 that required the player to use the defense to get out one or multiple runners in a single play, which like Home Run Derby and Defense Practice, gives the player twenty different scenarios per session. For the first time since RBI Baseball IV in 1992, virtually all of the sprites of the players, umpires, field, and ball (among others) have been completely redrawn, making use of the higher palette of the Super 32X and increasing their sprite count for increased fluidity; this also would apply to the Scoreboard shown in between the start and halfway point of each inning. Some sprites and virtually almost every vocal cue by sportscaster Jack Buck from 94 are recycled for this game, though this came at a cost: Due to possible technical limitations, and likely also the game's shorter development time, all of the short animated movies from RBI Baseball IV to 94 that would play in the first and third base windows throughout the game (such as fans doing the wave, a player having a close slide at a base, the spitball, the Basebrawl during a hit by pitch, and the coach delivering signs, among many others) had to be downsized in sprite dimensions and put in Ggayscale; the Crazyball feature that was made popular in 94, which would replace all of the normal sound effects of the game with comical cartoon and gag sound cues, was also removed. As how it has been with every entry since the Genesis/Mega Drive version of RBI Baseball III, the Password system that 95 uses has unique codes that allows you to access an Animation Test/Sprite Viewer, find hidden messages placed within the game's code by the developers, and the ability to play as the Warner Corporate and Dream Team for an extra difficult challenge (with Warner Corporate replacing Team Tengen, which was present from III to 94). Reception Next Generation reviewed the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"RBI '95 is not the worst baseball game, but for the first 32-bit baseball game, it makes no strides forward.

It is the third generation distributed messaging middleware open sourced by Alibaba in 2012. On November 21, 2016, Alibaba donated RocketMQ to the Apache Software Foundation. Next year, on February 20, the Apache Software Foundation announced Apache RocketMQ as a Top-Level Project.  History  The development of RocketMQ can be divided into three stages. The first generation uses the push mode in data transportation, and relational database in data storage. It shows low latency in message delivery and meets the command of a typical E-commerce platform with distributed transactions. The second generation uses the pull mode in data transportation, and file system in data storage. It paid more attention to stability and reliability, and shows a comparable performance to the first generation in response time and Kafka on log collection. The third generation combines the Pull mode with some Push operations. It inherits the advantages of the first and second generation, and shows high performance in concurrency and massive amounts of data scenarios.  Features  Much comparison have been made between all kinds of messaging solutions, and it is widely known that when the number of topics increases dramatically, the throughput of RocketMQ dropped much less than Kafka. Because the characteristics of high performance, high reliability and high real time ability, more and more efforts have been made to the combination of RocketMQ and other protocol component in all kinds of messaging scenarios such as MQTT. {  width=\\"100%\\" !Client SDK !Protocol and Specification !Ordered Message !Scheduled Message !Batched Message !BroadCast Message !Message Filter !Server Triggered Redelivery - Java, C/C++, Python, Go, Nodejs Pull model, support TCP, JMS, OpenMessaging Ensure strict ordering of messages,and can scale out gracefully Supported Supported, with sync mode to avoid message loss Supported Supported, property filter expressions based on SQL92 Supported - !Message Storage !Message Retroactive !Message Priority !High Availability and Failover !Message Track !Configuration - High performance and low latency file storage Supported timestamp and offset two indicates Not Supported Supported, Master-Slave model, without another kit Supported Work out of box,user only need to pay attention to a few configurations }  Architecture  809x809px RocketMQ consists of four parts: name servers, brokers, producers and consumers.

NameServer Cluster  The lightweight component for service discovery and they can be used to read and write routing information. Each one records global information, and supports fast storage expansion.  Broker Cluster  They use lightweight TOPIC and QUEUE mechanisms to manage data storage. To realize fault tolerance, 2 copies or 3 copies of data are provided. And Client can get message in Push and Pull model. In addition, disaster recovery and rich metrics statistics are also supported.  Producer Cluster  Producers can be distributed deployed, and messages from producers to brokers can be balanced through multi-path. In addition, fast failure and low latency are supported.  Consumer Cluster  Consumers can also be distributed deployed in the push and pull model, and they can subscribe message real-time, consume message in the unit of cluster. Message broadcasting is also supported.  Applications  There are at least five aspects Apache RocketMQ could relate to: * The integration of heterogeneous systems； * Decoupling between applications; * Backbone in the event-driven mechanism and complex event architecture model; * Data replication channels; * Integration with flow calculation engine; * Stream data access.  Community Maintenance  The RocketMQ team have done much to active the community. Meetups, Workshops, ApacheCon and Code Marathon are regular held in BeiJing, ShenZhen, HangZhou to attract new contributors and committers. The OpenMessaging benchmarking suites are currently available for the RocketMQ and it makes RocketMQ keep the pace with the global standard for distributed messaging.

The Shreshta twins were born in the town of Khalanga in western Nepal, and named for India's sacred rivers. Their surgery took more than 100 hours, triple the previous record and was made possible by advanced computer imaging which had never been used before in Singapore. Although both survived the surgery, believed to be only the second of its kind, they had varying degrees of impairment. Ganga subsequently died in 2008 of pneumonia and meningitis. In 2016, a book was published in Singapore about their lives.

The possible irreducible indices were classified by Jacques Tits, and this classification is reproduced below. (Because every index is a direct sum of irreducible indices, classifying all indices amounts to classifying irreducible indices.) Organization of the list An index can be represented as a Dynkin diagram with certain vertices drawn close to each other (the orbit of the vertices under the *-action of the Galois group of k) and with certain sets of vertices circled (the orbits of the non-distinguished vertices under the *-action). This representation captures the full information of the index except when the underlying Dynkin diagram is D4, in which case one must distinguish between an action by the cyclic group C3 or the permutation group S3. Alternatively, an index can be represented using the name of the underlying Dykin diagram together with additional superscripts and subscripts, to be explained momentarily. This representation, together with the labeled Dynkin diagram described in the previous paragraph, captures the full information of the index. The notation for an index is of the form gX, where * X is the letter of the underlying Dynkin diagram (A, B, C, D, E, F, or G), * n is the number of vertices of the Dynkin diagram, * r is the relative rank of the corresponding algebraic group, * g is the order of the quotient of the absolute Galois group that acts faithfully on the Dynkin diagram (so g = 1, 2, 3, or 6), and * t is either ** the degree of a certain division algebra (that is, the square root of its dimension) arising in the construction of the algebraic group when the group is of classical type (A, B, C, or D), in which case t is written in parentheses, or ** the dimension of the anisotropic kernel of the algebraic group when the group is of exceptional type (E, F, or G), in which case t is written without parentheses.

The film takes a fictional look at the societal problems that could ensue from widespread computer shutdowns caused by the Year 2000 problem, also known as the Y2K problem or the Millennium bug. The film premiered November 21, 1999 on NBC. The film's airing sparked a controversy after some utility and banking industry trade associations, including the Edison Electric Institute, asked TV stations not to air the film. Before the film aired, executive producer David Israel called the concerns \\"silly.\\" \\"My guess is some of the things we say are going to happen might happen, and some we say might won’t,” he told Variety in November 1999. \\"It's not like Y2K is a big secret.\\" The film was harshly criticized by critics and preceded by a disclaimer that stated that “This program does not suggest or imply that any of these events could actually occur.” Background Executive producer David Israel and his partner, Patrick Caddell, developed the idea of making a Y2K disaster film in the summer of 1998. “We were sitting at my kitchen table and concocted this thing and went and pitched it,” Israel told the Los Angeles Times in 1999. “Frankly, I was astonished that nobody else pitched it. When we were able to clear the title ‘Y2K,’ I was flabbergasted. I was surprised we are the only fictional thing that got made.” Another Y2K-themed film with the same title and starring Louis Gossett Jr., Sarah Chalke and Malcolm McDowell was produced and released straight to video in 1999. Plot Nick Cromwell (Olin) is an MIT-trained freelance computer systems analyst who works at a Seattle nuclear power plant. With the Y2K computer bug shutting down computer systems around the globe after midnight on January 1, 2000, Cromwell first is in Washington, D.C., arranging for an arriving airplane to land without the benefit of runway lights. Then, after word leaks a Swedish nuclear power plant has had a meltdown just a few hours earlier after that country ushered in the year 2000, Cromwell must hop a supersonic jet back home to Seattle, where Cromwell’s family lives, to prevent a meltdown at the same kind of power plant. That requires the evacuation of a 10-mile radius of the plant, including Cromwell’s wife, Alix (Vernon), who is a doctor delivering a millennium baby. Further complicating matters for the Cromwells is the fact that although Alix has told their two children to stay home, 16-year-old daughter, Kelly (Jane McGregor), sneaks out to party. This requires Alix to roam the city looking for her. Other disasters around the country include power failures crippling the entire Eastern seaboard, computers unlocking all doors in a Texas prison and Jay Leno of ‘’The Tonight Show With Jay Leno’’ continuing to broadcast.

Wired wrote that the film had a “hackneyed approach to storytelling,” and was “a rather pedestrian action movie,” while the Washington Post's Tom Shales dismissed the film for being insufficient as a thriller, noting that \\"it never quickens the pulse or sets the senses on edge the way a thriller ought to do. It merely catalogues random catastrophes that could possibly maybe might occur at midnight when we leave the miserable 1900s behind and plunge headlong into the 2000s.\\" ZDNet's Mitch Ratcliffe called it \\"indescribably silly.\\" Several media outlets also took aim at the film for its technical inaccuracies, including ZDNet, which highlighted more than 25 \\"myths\\" from the film, and Computerworld, which printed a \\"Fact or Fiction?\\" rundown.

His depictions of scenes from the life of the disadvantaged and lower- class people of his time mark him as the first Belgian social realist painter.Jean-Philippe Huys and Dominique Marechal, Realism: From Living Art to Free Art, in: Howe, Jeffery W., (editor), Courbet: mapping realism: paintings from the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium and American collections by Courbet, Gustave, 1819-1877, McMullen Museum of Art; Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, 2013, p. 24-25 These works made him the precursor of Belgian Realist artists such as Constantin Meunier and Eugène Laermans.Charles DE GROUX, peintre, in: J.-K. Pansaers, Les Artistes Belges Contemporains], Brussels, Eugene de Seyn, 1912 Life Charles de Groux was born in Comines, a commune bordering on Belgium in the French Nord department. His father Jean Baptiste Joseph de Groux was a ribbon manufacturer. Charles was the 7th of 10 children. His family moved to Brussels in November 1833. Despite several attempts in later life to become a naturalised Belgian citizen, he remained a French national throughout his life.Leclercq, Émile, Charles de Groux, Brussels: Imprimerie de Ve Parent et fils, 1871 The farewell Charles de Groux attended courses at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels. From 1843 he studied under François-Joseph Navez who was a director of the Académie and a neo-classical painter.Navez, François Joseph. Benezit Dictionary of Artists. Retrieved 21 Jun. 2018 He lived in those days a Bohemian life style. In 1849 he married Jeanne Geyssens of Brussels. The couple would have five children, one of whom called Henry became a prominent Symbolist painter. In April 1851 he left for Düsseldorf where he stayed for a year. Around 1853 de Groux had his first success with his work The Drunk (Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium) (another version referred to as The farewell on the art market in 2017). This work depicting a dying woman, her drunk husband and their young children in a cramped and poorly lit room signaled a clear break with the lofty and elegant style and subjects of his master Navez. De Groux became an illustrator of the satirical periodical Uylenspiegel founded by Félicien Rops, a prominent Belgian illustrator and draughtsman. Rops and de Groux met Gustave Courbet several times at the exhibitions of the latter in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. Courbet's influence on de Groux's aesthetic choices is evident as early as 1853. The eviction He became a member of the Société royale belge des aquarellistes (Royal Belgian Society of Watercolorists) founded in 1856 to promote watercolor art in Belgium through the organisation of annual exhibitions.Edmond Picard, Exposition rétrospective de la Société royale belge des Aquarellistes. Au Cercle Artistique et Littéraire, La Belgique Artistique et Littéraire, vol. 4, July–September 1906, pp. 152-155 He joined in 1868 the Société Libre des Beaux-Arts (Free Society of Fine Arts), an organization formed in 1868 by Belgian artists to react against academicism and to advance Realist painting and artistic freedom. Based in Brussels, the society was active until 1876, by which time the aesthetic values it espoused had infiltrated the official Salon.Arto: Aperçus historiques The Belgian government of that time promoted monumental art as a means of promoting nationalism and a revival of the arts in the young Belgian state.Anna Bergmans, Middeleeuwse muurschilderingen in de 19de eeuw: studie en inventaris van middeleeuwse muurschilderingen in Belgische kerken, Leuven University Press, 1 January 1998, p. 22 One of the projects promoted by the government was the decoration of the Ypres Cloth Hall. Charles de Groux was among various Belgian painters such as Jan Swerts and Godfried Guffens who were invited by the Belgian government to decorate the Ypres Cloth Hall. De Groux created his designs but died before he could realise the paintings. He was also invited to provide designs for the stained glass windows of the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula, which were executed by Jean-Baptiste Capronnier.The Stained Glass Windows of St Michael and St Gudula Charles de Groux died on 30 March 1870 in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode at the age of 44. Work The blessing before supper Charles de Groux worked in different media, including oil painting, watercolor, pastel, engraving and lithography. He started out as a painter of history and religious scenes in the Romantic style then prevalent in Belgium. He later developed his own realist style which shows the influence of Courbet as well as genre painters of the 17th century. Around 1853 de Groux had his first success with his work The Drunk (Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium) (another version referred to as The farewell on the art market in 2017). It depicts a woman who is lying sick and dying on her bed while her drunk husband holding a bottle is brought in by two young children. The sober palette and the execution that neglected detailed depiction for global effect as well as the subject matter were de Groux' radical break with the Classicist style of Navez in favor of the 17th century genre painters such as Adriaen Brouwer. During this period de Groux painted many compositions depicting the disadvantaged people of his day in their misery and vices such as alcoholism and lassitude. Often he depicted scenes with priests and pilgrimages. He still painted some history scenes in this later phase such as The death of emperor Charles V (Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium) and Frans Junius preaching the Reformation in secret in Antwerp. The drunk De Groux' social realist works contain many religious overtones and references. This is obvious in his The blessing before supper, a solemn depiction of a peasant family saying grace before supper. The painting was closely linked to Christian representations of the Last Supper.Jared Baxter Davidson, Van Gogh's Last Supper: Transforming the guise of observable reality, in: Anistoriton Journal, vol. 14 (2014 ‐ 2015) Charles de Groux influenced many young, realistic painters, including his pupil Constantin Meunier and Eugene Laermans. Even the later society painter Gustave Léonard de Jonghe painted early in his career a social realist painting called Pilgrims Praying to Our Lady of the Afflicted or Our Lady of Mercy (1854, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium), which was clearly influenced by de Groux' social realist works. Vincent van Gogh is known to have admired de Groux's work The blessing before supper. Van Gogh's The Potato Eaters was inspired by this work of de Groux. Van Gogh also praised Charles de Groux for his excellent 'types'. He was of the view that de Groux' studies and drawings displayed the same 'white-hot' passion that he found in the head studies of Frans Hals and Honoré Daumier, and in the novels of Zola and Balzac.Chris Stolwijk, Sjraar van Heugten, Leo Jansen, Nienke Bakker, Van Gogh's imaginary museum: exploring the artist's inner world, Harry N.

Throughout this two-thousand year long period, significant innovations and variations of homes existed, but house design generally incorporated a set of qualities that made Chinese home architecture distinct from that of other cultures and regions. As highlighted by the classic siheyuan style, this included an emphasis on extended family units in a single dwelling, distinct separation of various elements of the household, alignment with the cardinal directions and wooden construction; all in line with Confucian hierarchy and Feng Shui.  History  Chinese home design was originally more heterogeneous than it is today. In addition to the orthodox square shape, evidence of round dwellings are common in early archaeological sites. Over the span of several millennia, architecture was influenced by the development of Chinese thought, narrowing the range of acceptable layouts closer to the mature siheyuan style. As Han Chinese culture spread from out from the Yellow River Valley, dwellings in the outlying regions retained influence from the dwellings of the native cultures. For instance, Yue homes in southern China were traditionally built on wooden piles due to the humid climate. When Han migrants moved to the region, they initially adapted this style before the standard Han practice of raised earth foundations eventually re-asserted itself. After the form of the traditional chinese household had settled, this basic layout changed very little, especially for commoner's dwellings.  Layout commonalities   Organisation  By the later imperial period, the structure of homes in China had coalesced into a form that reinforced Neo-Confucian ideals that emphasised a firm separation between social roles and classes. This was especially true in the homes of the upper classes, which had the resources to delegate specific sections of the home to different sexes, age groups and occupations. = Directional structure = Alignment along a north/south axis was ubiquitous among Chinese homes, as dictated by the paradigms of order and harmony with nature. Home units were constructed facing south, with individual buildings following the alignment of the greater structure, with perfect symmetry. This resulted in the classic siheyuan structure, with identifiable \\"wings\\" each facing one of the four cardinal directions. Extended family units generally assigned different wings of the home to different branches of the family, with older and more respected family members taking more auspicious positions. This often included buildings in the sunnier, more private rear of the compound. The ancestral shrine of the family where the common ancestors of the inhabitants where honored was either located here or in the center of the property. Less important positions facing the east and west of the compounds were relegated to junior branches of the family, while more periphery locations were relegated to servants and other less important activities. Buildings that were especially important such as the ancestral/ceremonial hall were often marked with taller and more ornate roof structures, as opposed to the other homes and buildings within the compound. As these buildings were generally in the back of the home directly facing the entrance, this served to enhance the symmetrical beauty of the home's alignment.  Construction  Traditional Chinese dwellings were overwhelmingly built out of wood, especially after the earlier dynastic period. Stone dwellings and those made from dirt were relatively uncommon even when such materials were common in the local area. As the centuries drew on, lumber became less and less common on the North China plain with bricks and stone becoming common construction materials for walls and public edifices. Despite this, the popularity of wood remained very high, with varying grades of timber being used by upper class as a means of showing their wealth. This focus on wooden construction has led to a relatively poor rate of survival, with very few homes remaining from before the Ming era, even fewer of were homes belonging to commoners due to lower quality construction materials and lack of maintenance. Therefore, much more is known about upper-class historical dwellings.  Regional variation  Due to differences in culture and climate, the standard shape and style of homes varies from region to region. Homes in southern China often had sloped roof structures owing to the increased frequency of rainfall, while the arid northern climate made flat roofs more practical. Courtyards were emphasised in order to maximise sunlight in the north, while they were generally not as important in the very sunny south. Additionally, homes were rarely built with more than one story in the northern plains, but quite common in the mountainous south where building space was less available. Notable exceptions to the ubiquitous use of wood include the Yaodong, the traditional homes of Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces which were cut into soft loess rocks into mountainsides, Lingnan architecture, which is generally of green brick construction, and the Tulou, traditional Hakka walled villages in Fujian and Guangdong which were built largely out of brick and earth.

On the recommendation of Wang Yinglai, he was accepted by the University of Cambridge to study under David Keilin at the Molteno Institute for Research in Parasitology.  Career  Tsou aboard a ship to England, August 1947 Tsou's doctoral thesis was on the properties of the haemprotein cytochrome c. According to Edward Slater, the research was the first step towards the eventual discovery of protein's structure. After he and his wife both acquired their Ph.D. degrees in 1951, they returned to the newly established People's Republic of China and Tsou became a research professor at the Shanghai Institute of Physiology and Biochemistry where Wang Yinglai served as a deputy director. After 1958, Tsou was a member of the team at the Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry that first achieved the total chemical synthesis of insulin in 1965. His major contribution to the project was to form the disulphate bridges by joining two synthetic polypeptides using oxidation. His method for calculating the chemical modification of proteins is known as Tsou's equation. In 1981, he was awarded the State Natural Science Award, First Class, for this achievement. In 1970, Tsou moved to Beijing to help look after his ailing father-in-law Li Siguang, and transferred to the Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. It was in the midst of the Cultural Revolution, when scientific activity was frozen in the anti- intellectual political atmosphere. When American biochemist Emil L. Smith, a fellow alumnus of the Molteno Institute, visited Tsou following Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China, Tsou used reagent bottles filled with water to maintain a pretense of scientific research.  Awards and honors  After the end of the Cultural Revolution, Tsou was able to resume his research and was elected as an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1980. He pioneered the study of enzyme inhibition kinetics, for which he was awarded the TWAS Prize in Biology in 1992. Despite losing an entire decade of his prime, he published at least 118 papers, mostly in international journals. In 1990, his autobiography was published in Comprehensive Biochemistry Volume 27. By the end of his career, he won the State Natural Science Award First Class three times and Second Class three times. Asteroid 325812 Zouchenglu, discovered by astronomers with the PMO NEO Survey Program at the Purple Mountain Observatory in 2008, was named in his memory. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 9 January 2020 ().  Activism  Tsou and Li at their wedding, with Li's parents Li Siguang and Xu Shulin Tsou was a strong advocate against academic fraud and pseudoscience, and led a public campaign against what he called \\"unhealthy practices\\" such as administrators' interference in scientific research. At the Institute of Biophysics, Tsou raised objections to Director Bei Shizhang's display of his achievement in cell formation. The criticism poisoned his relationship with Bei, making Tsou feel \\"uneasy\\" at the institute. Scientist Rao Yi later raised the same objections and praised Tsou's probity.  Personal life  In 1948, Tsou married Li Lin (Anna Tsou), a fellow Chinese student at the Department of Metallurgy of Cambridge. Li was the daughter of the renowned geologist Li Siguang, who was in England to preside over their wedding, and she would become a prominent physicist. Tsou later recalled the Cambridge years as the best time for his family. Their daughter, geologist Zou Zongping (), was born in the 1950s in China. Li Lin was also elected as an academician of the CAS, making the Li-Tsou family the only one in China that produced three academicians (including Li Siguang). Despite suffering from cancer in old age, Tsou continued to work until his death. He died in Beijing on 23 November 2006, at the age of 83.

History 250px For the first time, the flag of Riga was mentioned in 1232 (in the book vexillum civitatis Rigensis), but its color and form are not known. After Riga joining the Hanseatic League in 1282 sources mention that the flag of Riga ships has a white cross, but the shape and color of the flag are not indicated (in the beginning of the 14th century it was known that Riga had a black flag with a white cross). After 1582, the flag of Riga was white with a red coat of arms of the city, while in the middle 17th century, thanks to the city's heroism defending against Grand Duchy of Moscow troops, the king of Sweden assigned his royal colors to Riga: a blue flag with a yellow cross, with in the center of the cross two keys were crossed on the red shield. The flag was used until 1860.Feodala Riga. — R., 1978 The blue-white flag of Riga, which was used today, was created in 1673, when it was approved in the statutes of Riga - blue and white bands in rectangular shape, with the coat of arms of Riga in the center. The flag was used alongside with the flag given by the Swedish king. From the 1900s until 1917, a new tricolor flag with equal blue, red and white bands was approved for Riga. During the 1920s the blue-white flag of Riga was restored, and officially approved on 4 May 1937 until 1940. During the era of Soviet Latvia, Riga adopted a new flag, with different obverse and reverse side of the flag. The obverse side of the flag consisted of Lenin's portrait with a laurel branch and the inscription \\"Workers of the world, unite!\\" in Latvian. The reverse side of the flag consisted of the coat of arms of the Latvian SSR, and the inscription \\"Riga City\\" in both Latvian and Russian. Current flag The current flag, the blue-white flag was restored in 1995. The flag consisted of a horizontal bicolour of blue and white, with the coat of arms of Riga in the middle.

On June 22, the fire crossed into Inyo National Forest. The next day, the fire had spread due to heavy winds, growing to over and moving closer to Mammoth Lakes at approximately seven miles southwest. The Lions Fire has been burning in high elevations, approximately 6,000 to 8,000 in elevation, thriving on red fir. Strong winds overnight expanded the fire to . A temporary flight restriction was put in place over a five-mile radius on June 25. By the next day, the fire had burned into the Stairway Creek, northwest of the middle fork of the San Joaquin River. It also reached the Butte Fire (2017) footprint, which slowed the Lions Fire's westward movement. The Lions Fires expanded to over by the morning of June 28. As of June 30, the fire had slowed its progression and was seven percent contained and had burned . July 1 marked the fourth day of burn-out operations on the Lions Fire. By July 5, the fire had grown to and was 60 percent contained, due to lack of fire growth and crews reinforcing firelines, to mitigate concerns about dryer weather and high winds. Air quality remained poor in Mammoth Lakes and the surrounding areas. By late August, the growth of the Lions Fire slowed, with containment gradually increasing. On October 1, 2018, InciWeb declared the Lions Fire to be inactive, as no more hotspots were detected within the fire perimeter. By then, the fire had burned at total of . Impact Health Wind patterns caused the fire's smoke to impact the air quality of Mammoth Lakes and other areas east of the fire. A Lions Fire public information officer describes the fire and fire ecology to a group of students at Minaret Vista on July 1, 2018 Recreation The Lions fire impacted visitor access to the Ansel Adams Wilderness, during which trails, in both Inyo and Sierra National Forests, heading towards the fire zone were closed to hikers. Environment Due to the fire's location in a designated wilderness area, fire crews used Minimum Impact Suppression Tactics, such as air assistance and hand construction, to minimize their impact on the landscape, supporting a healthy ecosystem. This also provides for better firefighter safety and reduction of hazardous vegetation.

TRAIN consists of revisions to the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, or the Tax Code This reform includes packages that make changes in taxation concerning the personal income tax (PIT), estate tax, donor's tax, value added tax (VAT), documentary stamp tax (DST) and the excise tax of petroleum products, automobiles, sweetened beverages, cosmetic procedures, coal, mining and tobacco. The prominent feature of the tax reform is that people who earn P250,00 annually or P21,000 monthly and below are exempted from paying personal income tax (PIT). This includes minimum wage earners, who were also exempted in the former tax system. On the other hand, those earning over P250,000 have tax rates following a set PIT schedule. Essentially, greater income is taxed at higher tax rates. This denotes that low to middle income-earners get to have a higher take home pay, while high income-earners have a bigger contribution to tax revenues. Increase in consumption taxes intend to counterbalance PIT tax exemptions. The TRAIN LAW is one of the primary ways in which the 2020 and 2040 vision of the Duterte administration is to be achieved, and so, it had optimistic projections about its effect on the economy, development and poverty alleviation in its inception. Regardless, contentions about the passing of this law has been present since the beginning and the subsequent reception by the people since its ratification has been controversial. In the first quarter of 2018, both positive and negative outcomes have been observed. The economy saw an increase in tax revenues, government expenditure and an incremental growth in GDP. On the other hand, unprecedented inflation rates that exceeded projected calculations, has been the cause for much uproar and objections. There have been petitions to suspend and amend the law, so as to safeguard particular sectors from soaring prices. Vision and goals of TRAIN Law The TRAIN Act aims to address the reputed weaknesses of the Tax Code, specifically through the following objectives: First, it intends to simplify the previous system to make it more straightforward and intuitive. Second, it intends to create a more “just” scheme wherein taxation is staggered and distributed on the basis of financial capability and the underprivileged are able to reap more advantages. Third, it intends to improve the efficiency by which tax is collected, particularly tackling issues of compliance. The changes instituted by the tax reform is expected to be able to increase revenues to finance the infrastructure, healthcare and education programs of the Duterte Administration. This is all while expecting to reduce tax remitted by the poor and receiving a greater portion of revenues from the wealthiest in the population through personal income tax (PIT) and consumption taxes. The tax received from the latter will also subsidize, through unconditional cash transfers, the poorest 10 million households, who are not benefited by the greater take home pay amendment. On a long-term scale, TRAIN Act is just the first from a series of tax reforms, as part of the CTSP, which will be one of the principal means by which the 2020 and 2040 vision of the incumbent administration is to be achieved. The vision in 2020 is that poverty will be reduced from 21.6% to 14%, while 2040 sees the Philippine nation as having “eradicated extreme poverty”, established “inclusive economic and political institutions where everyone has equal opportunities” and achieved “high-income country status”. This can be achieved if economic growth can be sustained by at least 7% each year and if the source of growth can be shifted to investment from consumption. This means prioritizing investments on people through \\"health, education, life-long training, social protection, infrastructure, and research and development\\" and investments on infrastructure to boost productivity. Legislative history House of Representatives House Bill No. 4774 is credited as the original measure that led to the TRAIN Act. It was endorsed by the Department of Finance (DOF) to the Philippine House of Representatives on September 26, 2016 as the first package of a wider CTRP. It was filed before the legislature on January 17, 2017 by Congressman Dakila Cua of Quirino. Cua is also the chairperson of the Ways and Means Committee of the Congress which deals on taxation. After thirteen hearings which was done within the span of four months, the House Bill No. 4774 was consolidated with 54 other tax-related bills to come up with a House Bill 5636, a substitute bill which had \\"moderate\\" changes from House Bill 4774. The substitute measure was approved on May 8. The DOF requested President Rodrigo Duterte to declare the bill as \\"urgent\\" on May 29, 2017. Bills passed on the second reading by the Congress but are not certified \\"urgent\\" by the president could only be voted upon after copies of the given measure is provided to House of Representatives members three days before the day of the third and final reading. On May 31, 2017 just before the 17th Congress adjourn its first regular session, the bill passed the final reading with 246 voting for and 9 against the bill. Only one made an abstention. Most of those who opposed were from the Makabayan bloc. Senate A version of the bill was filed in the Senate in March 2017 by Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III. By May 2017 six public hearings were conducted by the senate. The Senate had to wait for the House of Representatives version to get pass before it could start plenary discussions like other bills on budget or tax and appropriations. The Senate voted 17–1 to approve the Tax Reform Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) bill, with Sen. Risa Hontiveros being the lone dissenter on Nov 28, 2017. On the succeeding voting for the TRAIN, the positive votes were cast by Senators Sonny Angara, Nancy Binay, Frank Drilon, JV Ejercito, Chiz Escudero, Win Gatchalian, Dick Gordon, Gringo Honasan, Loren Legarda, Joel Villanueva, Koko Pimentel, Grace Poe, Ralph Recto, Tito Sotto, Cynthia Villar and Migs Zubiri. The negative votes were cast by Senators Ping Lacson, Risa Hontiveros, Bam Aquino and Antonio Trillanes IV. Duterte's certification of the TRAIN as \\"urgent\\" allowed the bill to get passed the second reading on November 28, 2017. Within the same day, the Senate bill passed the third and final reading with 17 senators voting for the bill. Only Risa Hontiveros voted against the bill. Bicameral Conference Committee The Bicameral Conference Committee consolidated the bills passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate. The committee then approved a bill which favored the Senate version on December 11, 2017 and prepared a report after for ratification of both chambers of the Congress and signing of the President. the House of Representatives and the Senate ratified the version of the bill prepared by the Bicameral Conference Committee on December 13, 2017.  Signing into law and partial veto  President Duterte exercised his veto power to void 5 provisions of the law. The provisions vetoed were the following: 1\\\\. Reduced income tax rate of employees of Regional Headquarters (RHQs), Regional Operating Headquarters (ROHQs), Offshore Banking Units (OBUs), and Petroleum Service Contractors and Subcontractors; 2\\\\. Zero-rating of sales of goods and services to separate customs territory and tourism enterprise zones; 3\\\\. Exemption from percentage tax of gross sales/receipts not exceeding five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000.00); 4\\\\. Exemption of various petroleum products from excise tax when used as input, feedstock, or as raw material in the manufacturing of petrochemical products, or in the refining of petroleum products, or as replacement fuel for natural gas fired combined cycle power plants; and 5\\\\. Earmarking of incremental tobacco taxes.  Summary of amendments  These were the revisions made to the Tax Code: {  - Amended Sections 5, 6, 24, 25, 27, 31, 32, 33, 34, 51, 52, 56, 57, 58, 74, 79, 84, 86, 90, 91, 97, 99, 100, 101, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 112, 114, 116, 127, 128, 129, 145, 148, 149, 151, 155, 171, 174, 175, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 186, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 232, 236, 237, 249, 254, 264, 269, and 288 - Created Sections 51-A, 148-A, 150-A, 150-B, 237-A, 264-A, 264-B, and 265-A -  Repealed Sections  35, 62, and 89 }  Complementary measures  There are four (4) complementary measures undertaken to ensure the income from the TRAIN Law will be properly allocated for the development of the Philippines as a nation. These are the Tax Administration, Ear Making, Infrastructure Projects, and Social Programs.  Tax Administration  Steps to modernize and refine the tax administration processes are undertaken to support the changes in tax policy so as to improve security against tax crimes and to ensure taxpayer compliance. On top of improving electronic systems (e.g. eBIR forms, Electronic Filing and Payment System, mobile payments) the following reforms are implemented * Mandatory fuel marking * Provision for use of electronic receipts * Connection of cash registers and point of sale machines to BIR servers for real time reporting of sales and purchase data * Relaxation of bank secrecy laws and automatic exchange of information to allow for more effective prosecution of criminal cases  Ear Marking  For 5 years from the law's enactment, all revenues will be set aside for infrastructure and social programs only, with a 70% and 30% portion respectively. = Infrastructure Projects = Infrastructure projects that will receive priority funding include the Build, Build, Build Program that tackles the problem of congestion through the construction of public transport systems and road networks and the refurbishing and enhancing of military facilities. Additionally, part of the 70% will be allocated to the building of sports facilities in public schools as well as amenities that will allow access to potable water in public spaces. = Social Programs = The social programs that will receive priority funding from 30% of revenues include: *Programs for sugar farmers to increase productivity, provide livelihood opportunities, develop alternative farming systems, and enhance farmer's income *Social mitigating measures and investments in education, health, social protection, employment, and housing for poor and near-poor households *Unconditional cash transfer to the poorest 10 million households *Social benefits card to determine qualified beneficiaries (fuel vouchers for PUJs, fare discount for all public utility vehicles, discounted purchase of NFA rice, free skills training under TESDA)  Unconditional cash transfers (UCT)  In order to provide provisional protection for vulnerable households from the initial shock of the TRAIN Law, unconditional cash transfers are dispensed. On the first year, beneficiaries receive Php200 per month. In the succeeding 2 years, they receive P300 per month. The UCT is obtained from oil excise tax revenues. In addition to the UCT, social welfare cards are provided to aid in continuous conferring of benefits and subsidies to the poorest households. This includes subsidies for \\"medicine, transportation, rice, and vocational trainings\\". Key Provisions  Package One  The overarching goal of the first package of the TRAIN is to \\"create a simpler, fair, and more efficient system\\". Through this program, the richer tax payers of the Philippines will pay a greater contribution to enable the government to execute its programs and services targeted to the general improvement of the country, especially the less fortunate. There are six (6) main key provisions, three (3) additional excise taxes, and four (4) financial taxes. = Lowering the Personal Income Tax (PIT) = \\"The TRAIN lowers the Personal Income Tax (PIT)for all taxpayers except the rich\\". Effectively, personal taxes will be reduced for 99% of the Philippine tax payers. The new PIT is summarized in the table below {  - ! Annuable Income Tax !! Tax Rate !! Percent of Taxpayers -  0–250,000  0%  83% -  Over 250,000-400,000  20% of the excess over 250,000  8% -  Over 400,000-800,000  30,000 + 25% of the excess over 400,000  6% -  Over 800,000-2,000,000  130,000 + 30% of the excess over 800,000  2% -  Over 2,000,000-8,000,000  490,000 + 32% of the excess over 2,000,000  1% -  Over 8,000,000  2,410,000 + 35% of the excess over 8,000,000  0.1% } Additionally, Minimum wage earners are still exempted from PIT. The Law also ensures a minimum wage earner who incurs a small raise will not have his overall salary (with the PIT deducted) less than minimum wage. Also, married couples where both parties are working may be exempted up to a total of P500,000. This does not include the exemption from the first P90,000 of their thirteenth month pay and additional bonuses. Finally, Self-employed and professionals with gross sales below VAT can only pay 8% flat tax instead of their income and personal tax. = Simplifying Estate and Donor's Tax = The TRAIN aims to simplify property purchases, transfers and donations in order to make the land market more efficient thus ensuring the usage of properties is maximized. The Estate Tax is now reduced to 6% based on the net value of the property. It also has a standard deduction of P5 million as well as a P10 million exemption on the family home. The Donor Tax is also reduced to 6% of the net donations for gifts above P250,000 yearly. = Simplified Value Added Tax (VAT) system = The government's aim to elevate the less fortunate in the Philippines and drive development is exemplified as the TRAIN repeals 54 out of 61 of the non-essential VAT exemption. In order to protect these less fortunate persons, as well as small and micro businesses, they are exempted from tax on goods and services of marginal establishments. VAT exempt tax payers now have the option to * PIT schedule with 40% OSD on gross receipts or gross sales plus 3% percentage tax * PIT schedule with itemized deductions plus 3% percentage tax, or * Flat tax of 8% on gross sales or gross revenues in lieu of percentage tax and personal income tax. \\"TRAIN aims to clean up the VAT system to make it fairer and simpler and lower the cost of compliance for both the taxpayers and tax administrators\\". As such, VAT exemptions are now only limited to health, education and raw agriculture food. In 2019, medicines for hypertension, high cholesterol and diabetes will be exempted from VAT. Similarly, purchases from senior citizens and persons with disabilities. Housing that costs less than P2 million shall also be exempted starting in 2021. = Increasing the Excise Tax of Petroleum Products = This tax aims to increase efforts towards decreasing the consumption of harmful fuel, and veering towards a healthier, more sustainable future. The price of fuel also varies due to the global inflation of oil. Listed below is the effect of the Petroleum Excise Tax (note: the additional excise tax is per liter) {  - ! Excise Tax per Liter !! Current !! 2018 !! 2019 !! 2020 -  LPG  0  Php1.00  Php2.00  Php3.00 -  Diesel  0  Php2.50  Php4.50  Php6.00 -  Regular and unleaded premium gasoline  Php4.35  Php7.00  Php9.00  Php10.00 } Listed below are the new excise taxes for specific fuel products for the year 2018 {  - ! Petroleum Product !! Excise Tax per Liter -  LPG  Php1.00 -  Bunker Fuels  Php2.50 -  Diesel  Php2.50 -  Petcoke  Php2.50 -  Kerosene  Php3.00 -  Avgas  Php4.00 -  Gasoline  Php7.00 -  Naphtha  Php7.00 -  Asphalt  Php8.00 -  Asphalt  Php8.00 -  Lubricating Oil  Php8.00 -  Paraffin Wax  Php8.00 -  Refined Fuels  Php8.00 } = Increasing the Excise Tax of Automobiles = The table below summarizes the excise taxes on automobiles. The second column illustrates the tax rate on vehicles based on their specific price range. The third column portrays the actual average effective tax rate. Because the TRAIN law increases the PIT of 99% of the population, their increase in net income will still be more than enough to compensate for the effects of the excise tax on automobiles. This means they still benefit from the TRAIN as they incur additional disposable income in the end. In addition, because richer tax payers tend to purchase more cars, the additional revenue from this tax will mostly come from them. {  - ! Automobile prices !! Tax Rate !!Average effective tax rate -  P600,000 and below  4%  3% -  P600,000 to P1,000,000  10%  8% -  P1,000,000 to P4,000,000  20%  15% -  P4,000,000 and above  50%  30% } = Excise Tax on Sweetened Beverages = \\"The SSB (Sugar- Sweetened Beverages) tax will promote a healthier Philippines\\". It achieves this by reducing the increasing number of diabetes and obesity cases, through raising awareness, promoting the consumption of healthier products and encourage companies to innovate healthier alternatives. The new tax imposes P6 per liter on drinks containing sweeteners and P12 per liter on drinks containing high-fructose corn syrup. Milk, 100% natural juice and 3-in-1 coffee drinks are exempt from the excise tax.  Additional Excise Taxes  There are three additional excise taxes, namely on Coal, Cosmetics and Tobacco. = Coal Excise Tax = Coal is a cheap source for power generation and has its uses in multiple industries such as the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. It is also a prime ingredient for activated carbon, carbon fibre and silicon metal. However, it remains a major source for air pollution in the Philippines. The aim of the excise tax is to shift towards renewable energies and generate additional income for building infrastructures and social services. The excise tax on coal will increase from its original P10/Metric Ton(MT) to P50/MT on both domestic and imported coal. P50/MT will be added each succeeding year until January when the rate would have reached P150/MT. = Cosmetics Tax = Starting 2018, all cosmetic surgeries, aesthetic procedures, and body enhancements intended to improve, alter, or enhance a person's appearance are now subject to a tax of 5%. However, procedures necessary to ameliorate a deformity arising from, or directly related to a congenital or developmental defect or abnormality, a personal injury resulting to an accident or trauma, or disfiguring disease, tumor, virus or infection are tax-exempted. = Tobacco Tax = The excise tax on cigarettes aims to reduce the amount of smokers and respiratory and cardiovascular diseases one can catch from the act, as well as generate additional revenue for health oriented programs and services. From its original excise tax of P30.00 in 2017, the tax on tobacco increased to P32.50 on January 1, 2018, P35.00 on July 1, 2018, will increase to P37.50 on January 1, 2020, and P40.00 on January 01 2020. Afterwards, it will increase annually by 4% from January 1, 2024.  Financial Taxes  There are four taxes that were adjusted along with the TRAIN Law. Firstly, Documentary stamp tax increased by 100% except on loans with only 50% increase, but not for savings, property, and non-life insurance. Secondly, Foreign currency deposit unit (FCDU), the final tax increased from 7.5% to 15% on the interest income. Thirdly, Capital gains of non-traded stock increased from 5% to 10% final tax on net gains. Finally, Stock transaction tax'stransaction value increased from 0.5% to 0.6%.  Others  Finally, there are three additional taxes that do not fall under the aforementioned categories. These are the Tax on lotto winnings and PCSO prizes, Documentary Stamp Tax, and Mining Tax. With the implementation of the TRAIN Law, all PCSO lotto prizes are taxed at 20% if the prize exceeds Php10,000. The documentary stamp tax has been doubled, resulting in stamp taxes ranging from Php1.50 to Php3.00. Finally, excise tax rates on all non-metallic minerals and quarry resources, and all metallic minerals including copper, gold and chromite, will be doubled, from 2% to 4%, ss well as excise tax on indigenous petroleum, which will be doubled from 3% to 6%.  Effect of TRAIN Law  The three main categories the TRAIN Law affects with its first package are Growth in the Economy, Employment Generation, and Effect on Inflation. The DOF projects the economy to grow by 1.3% by 2022 with a 0.42% inflation due to the excise tax increase (this is still within the 2-4% target inflation by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP); it also predicts to create half a million jobs over the next ten years, and eight million over the entirety of its life, as well as lift 250,000 Filipinos out of poverty. Through the increase in excise tax, Package 1 will be able to generate Php134 Billion. The actual effects in 2018 are elaborated below.  Growth and Economy  For the first quarter of 2018, the government was able to raise Php619.84 billion. This represents a 16.4% growth in revenue compared to the first quarter of 2017. In monetary terms, the government was able to raise Php87.44 billion more in this quarter of 2018 compared to the previous year. \\"The Philippine economy expanded by 6.8 percent in the first quarter of 2018, making it still one of the fastest-growing economies in the region even as rising inflation reduced consumption and productivity in some sectors.\\" DOF Secretary Carlos Dominguez III claimed tax revenues grew by 18.2%, \\"exceeding the 9.7 percent nominal gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\\" Departments that saw immediate benefits from Package 1 include the Bureau of Internal Revenue and Bureau of Customs, both with a 14.2% and 24.7% increase in revenue. This translates to a total of Php423.1 billion and Php129.8 for both departments respectively. Other government departments were able to expand their investment and growths during the first quarter as well due to the increase in income. Insofar as expenditures go for the first quarter of 2018, the total amounted to Php782.0 billion, growing by 27.1%, which also outstripped the 9.7% nominal GDP growth due to the estimated 40.0% increase in capital outlays. Dominquez also said that the expenditure effort also rose by 2.73%, which is the highest increase since 2003. This results in a larger contribution towards GDP growth. As such, revenue effort grew by 0.91%. In addition, public construction expanded by 25.1%, thus boosting GDP growth by 0.4%. On the other hand, government consumption increased by 13.6%, contributing an incremental 1.4% to the growth of the GDP.\\"'Strong macroeconomic fundamentals backed by tax reforms and the Build, build, build program will continue to boost economic growth to the optimum 7-8 percent level as the competitiveness of the economy rises and more jobs are created,' he said.\\"  Inflation  The inflation rate in June—which exceeded both government and market expectations—was the fastest pace in at least five years. Year-to-date, inflation averaged 4.3 percent, above the BSP's 2-4 percent target range. It peaked at 5.2 percent for the same month. For the previous months, inflation was pegged at 4.6 percent and in the same period in 2017, 2.5 percent. This was primarily due to the higher annual rate posted in the heavily weighted food and non-alcoholic beverages index at 6.1%. The country's food index went up by 5.8% in June 2018. It was 5.5% in the previous month and 3.1% in June 2017. The following annual mark-ups were also observed for the following food groups * Rice (4.7%) * Corn (14.1%) * Other Cereals, Flour, Cereal Preparation, Bread, Pasta and Other Bakery Products (2.4%); * Meat (5.0%); * Vegetables (8.6%); * Sugar, Jam, Honey, Chocolate and Confectionery (3.9%); and * Food Products not Elsewhere Classified (3.1%). As for the rest of the food groups, they either slowed down or remained at their previous month's rate. Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia claims that the inflation will most likely peak on the third quarter of the year and start tapering off by October.  Reception  The TRAIN Law finally took effect in January 2018. Since its implementation, there have been numerous individuals for and against the new tax reform, such as Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno who has expressed support for the law as the additional revenues provide funds for government initiatives. Notable government figures in opposition of the current law, that is they are calling for amendments or suspensions to specific excise tax increases or to the law as a whole, include Sen. Risa Hontiveros, Sen. Bam Aquino and Sen. Grace Poe. Ultimately, President Duterte stated on June 2, 2018 \\"Well the law was enacted by Congress. I leave it to Congress to decide whether or not to amend, suspend or modify the law. Leave it to Congress\\", in a press briefing.  Support and opposition  =Support= The senators who voted for the bill were Senators Sonny Angara, Nancy Binay, Frank Drilon, JV Ejercito, Chiz Escudero, Win Gatchalian, Dick Gordon, Gringo Honasan, Loren Legarda, Joel Villanueva, Koko Pimentel, Grace Poe, Ralph Recto, Tito Sotto, Cynthia Villar and Migs Zubiri. =Appeal to foreign investors= One of the goals of the TRAIN law is to make the economic environment of the Philippines more appealing to foreign investors. The reforms being implemented by the Duterte administration have been recognized and lauded by international institutions, leading to strong investor confidence and better growth prospects for the economy. This is also being pushed forward by the Department of Finance by submitting its proposal for Package 2 of its tax reform program to congress which aims to reduce corporate income tax rates and rationalize fiscal incentives. =View from an economic stand point= According to the DOF's chief economist, Gil Beltran, the moderate rise in inflation is only temporary and remains manageable under a robust economy even with the implementation of the TRAIN law. It will be remedied by the increased spending on infrastructure and social services to keep inflation in check in the future which was what the president was hoping to achieve with the implementation of this law. The train law is seen as a long-term measure that would hope to push the economy to a much higher development path, create more jobs and improve the living conditions for our people. However this comes with the rising of inflation which would be mitigated by lower income tax rates and implementing cash transfers for the short-term, and; the health, education, social protection, and infrastructure programs in the medium- and long-term. =Opposition= =Burden to the Poor= One of the recurring problems that is being discussed when it comes to the TRAIN law is the burden that it will impose to the poor. As crafted, the TRAIN promises to let marginal earners and minimum salaried workers of smaller tax or even tax exemption. But critics are quick to point out that the alleged windfall of tax-free income will be blown away when basic commodities that the marginalized sector of society traditionally buy and consume every day will now be sporting increased price tags that are out of reach and beyond the imagination of poor families. =Macabayan Bloc= There were objections made by the Macabayan Bloc, a leftist group who filed a petition for a temporary restraining order (TRO) against the law. The petition is anchored on the argument that the tax law bill was invalid because there was no quorum when the House of Representatives ratified the joint bicameral conference report on the measure, and there was no voting involved. The petitioners provided links to official videos and photos that would show there was no quorum “with barely 10 people on the floor.” The petitioners also provided that another requirement was not met which was the majority vote. According to the petitioners, a vote whether viva voce or nominal, was not taken. The official video of the process shows Tinio and Zarate repeatedly objecting to the ratification, but Abu and Defensor continued with the process until the voices of the petitioners were no longer heard because the microphone had been turned off. Aside from the House rules, the petitioners said Section 16(2), Article VI of the Constitution that requires a quorum was also violated. =Call for Suspension= Three senators called for the suspension of the implementation of Republic Act No. 10963 or the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (Train) law as consumers and transport groups complained of soaring prices of commodities. These were on the grounds that the law was not beneficial to the majority of Filipinos, due to the increase in prices of oil products and commodities, a family has incurred an additional expense of P2,644 monthly for farmers and P3,640 for workers. =Amendments= Senator Bam Aquino wanted to pass a measure that seeks to amend the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) to protect Filipinos from soaring prices. Aquino explained that the Senate's version of the TRAIN law had a safeguard that would automatically suspend fuel excise tax if the forecast rate was exceeded and this amendment was to bring that sole safeguard back. According to the senator, this was a necessary step in order to protect the future well beings of the Filipino people.

Jorn, 400 U.S. 470 (1971), was a United States Supreme Court decision clarifying when a criminal defendant may be retried after a mistrial. In this case, where a trial judge abruptly declared a mistrial to prevent the prosecution's witness from incriminating himself, a second trial was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause. Jorn was charged with numerous counts of assisting in the preparation of fraudulent income tax returns. He was tried in the United States District Court for the District of Utah. Among the government's witnesses were five taxpayers whom Jorn had allegedly assisted in preparing fraudulent returns. As the first of these witnesses was called, the trial judge became concerned the witness was about to incriminate himself, and refused to allow the witness to testify until the same had consulted an attorney. Upon learning that all five witnesses were in the same situation, the judge discharged the jury and aborted the trial. The case was then set for retrial before a different jury, but Jorn argued that retrial was forbidden by double jeopardy. The question of when a retrial is permitted after a mistrial is flexible and depends on the circumstances of the case. Here, the trial judge had acted sua sponte, abruptly discharging the jury without input from either the prosecution or defense. The Court used the framework of United States v. Perez to evaluate this action, asking whether there was \\"manifest necessity\\" to declare the mistrial. Here, the Court concluded, \\"the trial judge here abused his discretion in discharging the jury,\\" suggesting instead the possibility of a continuance. Justice Harlan pointed out the potential injustice of subjecting the defendant to a second trial, writing, \\"Reprosecution after a mistrial has unnecessarily been declared ... subjects the defendant to ... personal strain and insecurity.\\" In conclusion, since there was not \\"manifest necessity\\" for the trial judge to declare the mistrial, Jorn could not be reprosecuted.

There are many factors that play a part into an area's cuisine, with a few being religion, location, and status. Diets across the early modern world varied throughout time and location. The most prominent religions in the early modern era were Islam, Buddhism, and Christianity and each of these religions had their own views on what could be consumed. Trade and status also influenced the diet consumed in a particular region. Trade changed the available resources and allowed for luxury goods to be incorporated into the local region's supply.  Factors of cuisine  Religions, such as Islam, Buddhism, and Christianity, played a factor into the available diet through having specific dietary restraints and regulations. There are some religions, such as the Islamic faith, that specify how certain foods must be consumed or removed from the diet. Other religions have general guidelines as to which foods can be consumed, such as the vegetarian lifestyle that is a basic principle in the Buddhist religion. However, some religions had little to no dietary restrictions, such as the Christian principle of only drinking alcohol in moderate amounts. Early modern trade was essential to cuisine as various information and goods were traded and developed. Major trading items included food items, silk, fur, and knowledge of trade routes to merchants. One of the most influential trade routes were the fishing routes as they provided a consistent food source as well as held economic power. The spice trade was essential to the trade and development of certain food items and cuisines as well as to providing the connection of trade routes to other continents, specifically the New World.  Location  The geographic region largely determined the type and amount of food that would be available naturally and through trade. Diets also varied depending on climate as each climate created different environments for specific plants and animals to live in, both of which work together to produce diets for that region. One notable difference would be that tropical regions having more natural vegetation incorporated into that region's diet while arctic regions depend on the fishing industry. Trade also was a large influence in which items were available and able to be traded and thus, spread to other regions. The early modern world saw the expansion of the spice trade through Spanish, Dutch, and Chinese trade routes. Following the established trade routes of the Spice Trade, items that were circulated includes pepper, cotton, aromatics, slaves, animals, jewels, clothing, and dyes. In addition to goods being traded, knowledge of food preparation and also worked to add to the field of botany.  Status Differences  Status is another factor that played into the available diet and is reflected in the different diets between the peasants and the upper class. The upper class had more wealth and access to various goods and trade opportunities, allowing their diet to include more luxury goods, items that were more expensive and refined. Peasants in the early modern world commonly ate a diet that consisted of \\"gruels, pottages, and ... grains\\". Peasants often were farmers, cultivating food items and non-food items, with the most common items being cotton, rice, and sugar cane. The upper class also had access to more techniques and technologies which provided a foundation to the cuisine specific to a certain region or territories. Technology in the early modern period include mills, simple grindstones, food- processing technologies, etc.  Luxury goods  With the expansion of trade, a wider variety of luxury goods were able to be traded and incorporated into the region's diet. Luxury goods were often goods or food items that were not natural to the region and were only available through specific trade routes. The upper class had access to these items and held \\"banquets [that were] as opulent as possible, with as many rich dishes as possible, larger quantities of food, and extravagant use of spices\\". The Spice Trade allowed spices as well as currency, like gold, to become less of a luxury as overtime they became incorporated as common goods through trade or were consistently available through merchants' supplies.

Widely credited as Guyana's premier historian, Rodway helped to establish national institutions such as the Royal Agricultural and Commercial Society of British Guiana and the British Guiana Museum. A fellow of the Linnean Society, in later years he served as Editor of the colony's literary and scientific journal, Timehri. Rodway is the namesake of both a sub-species of Violaceous Euphonia – Euphonia Violacea Rodwayi, as named by Thomas Edward Penard – and the Gold Tetra, or Hemigrammus Rodwayi, named by Marion Durbin Ellis. A History of British Guiana, from 1668 to the Present Time, Guiana: British, Dutch and French and Hand-book of British Guiana are considered some of Rodway's major works.  Early life  Born 27 February 1848 in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, England to James and Edith Rodway (née Harding), Jabez Rodway – later to take his father's first name – was one of nine children. His father was a hawker and his mother came from a local family of weavers. Aged 13, James began work as an apprentice with a local chemist, some years later taking a position as a pharmacy assistant in Hitchin, Hertfordshire. It was from here that Rodway responded to a newspaper advertisement calling for clerks overseas in British Guiana, inspired by his reading on exploration and studies of the tropics, including Charles Waterton's Wanderings in South America. Rodway was offered a position at Joseph Kleine & Co. and set sail aboard the R.M.S Seine on September 2, 1870, aged 22.  Career   Work as a botanist  Hardback cover of Rodway's In The Guiana Forest, published by alt= Following his arrival in the capital city of Georgetown, James Rodway – as he was now known – worked four years for Joseph Kleine & Co. before becoming manager of a pharmacy. Alongside reading the few history books available on the colony, the works of Henry G. Dalton and George Hanneman Bennett, in order to better acquaint himself with his new home Rodway continued to cultivate the avid interest in botany that had begun back in England as a child. He now read much of what existed on the flora and fauna of British Guiana and the Americas. Along with this came the wider personal study of insects, fish, topography and more. In any time he was able to do so, Rodway took the opportunity to walk many miles to record local plant and animal life extensively; as early as 1871, he began the first of his frequent boat trips along rivers and creeks to the Guyanese interior where he would come into contact with both the native and the Boviander populations. These journeys, with Rodway's detailed journaling of his discoveries and observations along their course, were to later inform much of his written works. The keen botanist steadily amassed an extensive herbarium, all the contents of which were self-described. Meanwhile, Rodway became known for his development of various orchids and ferns in the greenhouse of the Georgetown home he purchased in 1880, and won first prize at a flower exhibition held in the city's Botanical Gardens. Rodway was eventually approached by both James Thomson, Editor of The Argosy newspaper and Everard im Thurn, founder and first Editor of Timehri magazine – established in 1882 as the official publication of the nation's Royal Agricultural & Commercial Society. Thomson and Thurn encouraged him to put his acquired knowledge to wider use writing articles and studies for the respective institutions specific to the colony's wildlife as well its rural and Amazon-based communities. Until his death, almost no subsequent issue of Timehri would be published without one or more of Rodway's articles. By the 1890s, Rodway was an established name in British Guiana in the field of botany. 'The Struggle for Life in the Forest' would be the article to establish Rodway in the wider world beyond the colony. Published in 1891 for Timehri and again for the Smithsonian Institution, it was highly remarked upon by W.T. Stead, in the Review of Reviews. That same year, on 17 December, Rodway was elected as fellow of the Linnean Society of London. These developments encouraged Rodway to propose a book to the London-based publishing company T. Fisher Unwin – one that would be devised primarily from his previous botanical articles. In the Guiana Forest – Studies of Nature in Relation to the Struggle for Life was subsequently published in 1894. With the positive reception to this book, Rodway established himself as an authority on the subject of British Guiana – in particular across the English-speaking world – even being referenced by the philosopher Herbert Spencer in his material. Throughout his life, as with his historical work, Rodway's writing featured in newspapers, journals and magazines from England to Australia.  Work as a historian  A 1921 issue of the Royal Agricultural & Commercial Society's science and literary publication, the Timehri Journal. James Rodway was Editor at this time – F.L.S stands for 'Fellow of Linnean Society'. In his career as colony historian, James Thomson of The Argosy was again instrumental in encouraging Rodway to hone his talent for research to deliver content for the publication. Nicholas Darnell Davis, a colonial official of British Guiana, one-time Postmaster-General and later author, also encouraged Rodway to use his skill in archiving the nation's history. It was suggested Rodway begin this venture with an episodic series, charting British Guiana's historical development in chronological fashion. This ran in The Argosy from August 1885 through to March 1886. Impressed by the evident dedication and detail to have gone into producing this extensive literary project, Charles Bruce – the colony's recently appointed Lieutenant Governor – enquired whether Rodway might consider compiling a catalogue from the extremely old and poorly maintained colonial documents in his office building, some dating back to the days of Dutch control over the territory. Rodway was enthusiastic and – after securing permissions from Governor Bruce to transcribe many of the documents from home – began the monumental task with the aid of a hired translator who would be able to decipher the old Hollandic dialect where necessary. The project would take months and ultimately see Rodway hand over the management of his pharmacy to his son full-time. It would be access to these files – the first comprehensive English translation of testimonies and accounts recorded by members of the colony's former Dutch administration and plantocracy – that would lead Rodway to write what would be considered the most seminal literary history of British Guiana to date. A History of British Guiana, from 1668 To The Present Time, in three volumes (1891–1894), sought to clear up the inaccuracies of prior historians by closely comparing and referencing both Dutch and British records. Rodway's later historical works include The West Indies and the Spanish Main (1896), Guiana: British, Dutch and French (1912), and The Story of Georgetown (published in 1903 and revised in 1920 – a special edition was presented to the Prince of Wales this same year on his tour visit to Georgetown).  Later years  Rodway held the positions of Assistant Secretary at the Royal Commercial & Agricultural Society (1886–1888), Librarian at the Royal Commercial & Agricultural Society and Curator of British Guiana Museum (1894–1899). In addition, Rodway was Editor of Timehri well into his older years. James Rodway and wife, Keturah (Kate) Rodway c. 1900s.  50th anniversary  On 30 December 1920, James Rodway celebrated his 50th anniversary as a settler in British Guiana. He was honoured before friends and colleagues from across the country and beyond by Governor Sir Wilfred Collet at a meeting at the Royal Agricultural & Commercial Society. At the event Rodway was awarded an annuity of £50 – approximately equivalent to £2,250 when adjusted for inflation today – in recognition of his literary and scientific contribution to the colony. On this occasion, Rodway's last great work appeared in The Argosy: a revised 'The Story of Georgetown'.  Personal life  Rodway married Keturah (Kate) Johanna Reedon in Georgetown on 13 February 1873. His marriage to the Guyanese-born Creole may have formed the inspiration for Rodway's only published fictional work: the novel In Guiana Wilds: A Study of Two Women (1898). Rodway family Rodway's descendants have comprised many notable figures in the cultural, educational and political history of Guyana, as well as the wider Caribbean region. Notable members of the Rodway family include James Rodway's grandson James Alwyn (\\"Sonny\\") Rodway, a Queen's College educator and later mentor to Nobel Prize-winning poet Derek Walcott. Walcott would go on to establish the \\"James Rodway Memorial Prize\\" for St.Lucian poets in his honour. 'Sonny' Rodway's wife was Guyanese composer Valerie Rodway. Great-grandsons include Adrian Rodway – a journalist central to events of the Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation strike of 1964, supported by Michael Manley – and political activist Brian Rodway, one of the founding members of the Working People's Alliance party and close confidant of Walter Rodney.

Although associated with the Italian lyric repertoire, she also excelled in lyric soprano roles of the French repertoire such as Manon, Marguerite, and Juliette, which brought her international fame. Biography Ana María González was two years old when she emigrated with her family to Mendoza, Argentina, where she began studying piano and singing with Franca Cavalieri, debuting on Radio Libertador de Mendoza at an early age. At age 17 she settled in Buenos Aires, where she perfected her skills at the Teatro Colón Higher Institute of Art, studying with the eminent Argentine soprano Hina Spani. She won the Gold Medal of the Fondo Nacional de las Artes. González debuted at the Teatro Colón in 1973 as El niño in Ravel's L'enfant et les sortilèges, followed by El retablo de maese Pedro, Gretel in Hansel and Gretel, and Micaela in Carmen (with Régine Crespin in the title role) in 1976. She continued to appear at the Buenos Aires venue in roles such as Susanna, Gilda, Nannetta, Adina, Pamina, and Euridice (with Margarita Zimmermann as Orfeo). Later she assumed a repertoire of greater lyrical scope that included Mimi and Musetta in La bohème by Giacomo Puccini, as well as Magda (La rondine) and Liù (Turandot) by the same composer, Marguerite in Faust by Gounod (in the staging by Sergio Renán), the title role in Massenet's Manon, Anne Trulove in Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress, and Juliette in Gounod's Roméo et Juliette (directed by Cecilio Madanes in the 1977 season and revived in the 1980s). In 1980 she was recognized as the best Argentine soprano of the season by the Asociación Verdiana Argentina. She returned to the theater in Buenos Aires in 1993 and played Antonia in The Tales of Hoffmann together with Canarian tenor Alfredo Kraus. Her international debut in Avignon in Roméo et Juliette was followed by Mimi in La bohème at Covent Garden, La Traviata at the Vienna State Opera and in Hamburg, Deutsche Oper am Rhein in Düsseldorf and Duisburg, the Paris Opera with Roméo et Juliette (again with Alfredo Kraus), Bordeaux, Teatro Regio di Parma (as Donna Elvira in Don Giovanni with Renato Bruson and Faust with Kraus), Modena (The Tales of Hoffmann), Palermo (La bohème), as well as performances in Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Peru, Chile (La rondine), and Uruguay (Don Carlo and Turandot). Other roles included Elisabetta in Don Carlo, Amelia in Simon Boccanegra, Nedda in Pagliacci, and Alice Ford in Falstaff. In Spain she performed at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona (Roméo et Juliette, Manon, Pagliacci with Piero Cappuccilli), at the Palau de la Música (Goyescas), in Madrid at the Teatro de la Zarzuela (Roméo et Juliette, The Tales of Hoffmann, Don Giovanni, and Marina), at the Teatro de la Maestranza in Seville, Granada, Malaga, the Cuenca Festival, in Oviedo (Marina, Simon Boccanegra, L'elisir d'amore, and Faust), in A Coruña (La traviata and Liù in Turandot), in Santiago de Compostela, and in the opera festivals of Las Palmas and Tenerife. Other appearances included Thaïs for the Massenet Festival of Saint-Étienne and the Opéra comique of Paris, Warsaw, Rotterdam, recitals with Giacomo Aragall, José Carreras, Giuseppe Giacomini, and zarzuela recitals with Alfredo Kraus in 1987. González dedicated herself to teaching as a professor at the Conservatori Superior de Música del Liceu in Barcelona and was invited to the centenary functions of the Teatro Colón in 2008. She was awarded the Gold Badge of the City of Oviedo as Illustrious Citizen, and the Konex Award as one of the five best singers in the history of Argentina in 1989.

It is an oral prodrug of progesterone with improved pharmacokinetic properties. The compound was developed in an attempt to address the poor oral pharmacokinetics of progesterone, including its very low bioavailability and short biological half-life. These properties of progesterone are thought to be caused by its low water solubility and high metabolic clearance rate due to rapid degradation in the intestines and liver. Drugs with low aqueous solubility are not absorbed well in the intestines because their dissolution in water is limited. P4-3-CMO (as the potassium salt) showed water solubility that was increased by more than four orders of magnitude relative to progesterone (solubility = 9.44 mol/L and 0.0006 mol/L, respectively). In addition, it showed an in vitro terminal half-life in rat liver microsomes that was 363-fold longer than that of progesterone (half-life = 795.5 minutes and 2.2 minutes, respectively). As such, P4-3-CMO could have both improved absorption and increased metabolic stability relative to progesterone. However, the compound has not been further assessed nor studied in humans.

Description Prasophyllum pictum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single shiny, dark green, tube-shaped leaf, long and wide with a purplish base. Between about nine and twenty two flowers are crowded along a flowering spike long, reaching to a height of up to . The flowers are sweetly scented and are white with brown, pink and purple tones. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is broadly egg-shaped to lance-shaped, long, wide and has three to five darker veins and a pointed tip. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, long, about wide and joined to each other, at least when the flower first opens. The petals are white with a pink to red central area, linear, long and about wide. The labellum is white, oblong to lance-shaped, long, about wide and turns sharply upwards through more than 90°. There is an egg-shaped to wedge-shaped yellow callus with a dark green base in the centre of the labellum and extending well past the bend. Flowering occurs between late November and late December. Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum pictum was first formally described in 2018 by David Jones and Lachlan Copeland from a specimen collected near Ebor and the description was published in Australian Orchid Review.

It is the type species of the genus Apalus. Description This species is a long predominantly black beetle which has distinctive yellow-orange elytra each with a single black dot near the posterior end of each elytron. The females have a swollen abdomen and some of its segments are yellowish in colour. Distribution Apalus bimaculatus is a widespread species over much of Europe, as far north as southern Scandinavia although it is absent from Great Britain. Habitat and biology Apalus bimaculatus occurs in sandy area such as coastal dunes and riparian floodplains as well as being found in man made habitats such as sand pits and sand quarries. It is a cleptoparasite of the solitary bee Colletes cunicularius. The adults of this beetle emerge early in the spring to mate and to lay their eggs near the nesting aggregations of their host bee. They are short-lived and the females die after mating and the eggs hatch from the body of their mother and the larvae crawl out of the protection of their mother's corpse. The first instar of larvae, the triungulins, are thought to be phoretic and to be carried to the host's nest by attaching themselves to the adult bees when they emerge from their natal nests in the spring, although this has not been conclusively demonstrated in A. bimaculatus. The triungulins do however react to the secretions of the adult host bees, orienting their movements towards them and this may be the first stage of being carried to the nest. Once in the nest they consume the pollen stores of the bee as well as any unhatched eggs or larvae and overwinter to emerge in the early Spring. Conservation status Globally Apalus bimaculatus is not regarded as threatened or endangered and in Scandinavia this species is regarded as Least Concern in Sweden, although in the past it has been assessed as \\"at risk\\" or \\"near threatened\\". Local populations are considered to be vulnerable to human development and programmes of translocation have been used to conserve populations of both the beetles and the nesting aggregations of Colletes cunicularius they use to host their larvae. In Norway it was similarly regarded as being rare but has since been shown to be quite common in the south with at least 20 populations known, one reason for its apparent scarcity is that it in the Spring it emerges very early, earlier that most entomologists.

Early Life  Lozano was born in Del Rio in the early 1980s. He served as a former security forces patrolman in the U.S. military. During his time with the US Air Force, he was tasked with enforcing the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, notifying gay service members of their discharge. As a result, Lozano, who is gay, said he chose not to reenlist. He worked as a flight attendant thereafter. Political Career Lozano prioritized efforts to clean up the San Felipe Creek and volunteer at local non-profits. According to Lozano, he decided to enter political life in 2016, supported and encouraged by his former high school classmates during a class reunion event. He was critical of the city's economic policies, which he says left the local economy stagnant even as neighboring cities boomed. He called on Millennial voters to break Baby Boomers' hold on local political power. A Democrat, he ran against incumbent mayor Robert Garza on a May 5th, 2018 election, and won in a landslide, receiving 62% of the votes. A later recount confirmed the result. His victory received attention in The Huffington Post and the national LGBT press, which highlighted both his military career and his flamboyant image. Mayor Lozano is influential within Del Rio. He is also a key figure within the Middle Rio Grand area. On August 26th, 2020 Mayor Lozano was nominated and appointed as Third Vice President on the Middle Rio Grande Board of Directors, which represents multiple counties within the Middle Rio Grande Region. Lozano was appointed as Segment 3 Chairman to represent the Segment 3 portion of the Ports to Plains feasibility study under Texas House Bill 1079. Under his leadership, Lozano has worked alongside other mayors and judges within the Val Verde, Maverick, and Webb counties to prioritize the current and future needs for an interstate grade level structure serving the port of entries. Mayor Lozano also serves on the Ports to Plains Advisory Committee that is chaired by Mayor Dan Pope of Lubbock, Texas.

The Legislative Council was elected on 16 March and the House of Assembly between 9 August and 5 September. These were the first elections contested on a more-or-less two-party basis after the emergence of responsible government in 1872. Party divisions were still hazy at the time of the elections, but the result was a narrow victory for opponents of the Progressive Party of Cecil Rhodes, despite the Progressives winning the popular vote. Incumbent Prime Minister Gordon Sprigg had become aligned with the nascent Progressive party, and was succeeded by William Philip Schreiner, an Independent supported by the Afrikaner Bond, upon the inauguration of the new House of Assembly. Electoral System Twenty-three members of the Legislative Council were elected from nine constituencies termed \\"provinces,\\" seven of which elected three members each by cumulative voting, and the remaining two provinces one member each. The House of Assembly was composed of 79 members elected from 39 electoral divisions which elected between one and four members each, in which each voter had as many votes as there were candidates to be elected, but was not permitted to cast them cumulatively, as for the Legislative Council. Results House of Assembly The fact that voters in different constituencies could cast varying numbers of votes, and that votes were not counted where any candidates ran unopposed, means that raw popular vote totals are a poor estimate of party support. Alan John Charrington Smith's analysis of voting patterns estimated that support was approximately 43,243 voters (57.35%) for the Progressive party and 32,165 (42.65%) for its opponents.

Lineages of bhāṇakas were responsible for preserving and transmitting the teachings of the Buddha until the canon was committed to writing in the 1st Century BC, and declined as the oral transmission of early Buddhism was replaced by writing. Early Buddhist era Academic consensus and Buddhist tradition holds that all early Buddhist traditions preserved their texts via oral transmission- significant evidence of this includes the structure and distinctive features of early Buddhist texts, the absence of Vinaya regulations dealing with writing and writing materials, and terms derived from practices of listening and recitation used to describe the Buddha's teaching and the acts of the early Sangha. The bhāṇaka system is believed to have originated in India, but the majority of the literary and inscriptional evidence relating to bhāṇakas comes from Sri Lanka. Scholars suspect that the same techniques were used by the monks of all early Buddhist schools to fix and transmit the contents of the Agamas, but outside of the Theravada tradition little information about the pre-literary period of these traditions is available. The earliest evidence for the association of monks known as bhāṇaka with knowledge and recitation of specific parts of the Buddhist canon dates to the 2nd or 3rd Century BCE. All schools of Buddhism agree that shortly after the death of the Buddha, a council of his senior students was held to clarify and record his teachings. At this gathering (known as the First Buddhist Council), Upali was questioned regarding the contents of the Vinaya and Ananda was similarly questioned regarding the Dhamma. Once the council had agreed on the contents of the teachings, they acknowledged their acceptance of the sutras by reciting them together. Subsequent major and minor councils are depicted as following the same basic procedure to compare, correct, and fix the contents of the canon, with specialists in each area of the collection called upon to recite the complete text for confirmation by the gathered Sangha.  Theravada tradition  Buddhaghosa reported that according to the oral tradition of the Mahavihara, each of the four Nikayas were entrusted to an individual elder of the early Sangha and their students for preservation. Ananda was given responsibility for the Digha Nikaya, Sariputta for the Majjhima Nikaya, Mahakassapa for the Samyutta Nikaya, and Anuruddha for the Anguttara Nikaya. Scholars doubt that the sutras and four Nikayas were established in their final form this early, with K.R. Norman suggesting that this story may be a reflection of later practices. Some texts of the Theravada Abhidhamma Pitaka and Khuddaka Nikaya clearly originate after the First Council, but Theravadins have generally regarded portions of the Abhidhamma as being included at this stage as part of the dhamma/suttas. Texts known to have relatively late origins (after the Third Council) are included in the Theravada accounts of the First Council. Texts that did not fit into any of the four Nikayas were assigned to the Khuddaka (which included the Abhidhamma in some traditions). In the Theravada commentaries, references are found to bhāṇakas that specialized in each of the four Nikayas, as well as Jataka-bhāṇakas, Dhammapada-bhāṇakas, and Khuddaka- bhāṇakas. Each group of bhāṇakas was responsible for reciting and teaching their texts, and seem to have exercised independent judgement as to how their texts were organized and the versions of stories and doctrines that they preserved- variant readings between versions of content preserved in both the Digha Nikaya and Majjhima Nikaya, for instance, may be attributable to the preservation of different versions by different schools of bhāṇakas. Different schools of bhāṇakas may have 'closed' their canon at different times, and seem to have differed in some cases in which texts of the Khuddaka Nikaya and Abhidharma Pitaka they accepted as canonical. Stupa inscriptions from India dating to the 2nd Century BCE mention bhāṇakas who specialized in teaching the sutras or knew the four Nikayas/Agamas but do not represent them as specializing in a single Nikaya. By contrast, cave inscriptions from Sri Lanka ranging in date from the 3rd Century BCE to the 1st Century CE make specific references to monks who specialized in the Samyutta Nikaya, Majjhima Nikaya, or Anguttara Nikaya. Roles as bhāṇaka of a particular Nikaya were passed down from teacher to student. KR Norman suggests that the Theravada practice of organizing bhāṇakas by Nikaya may not have originated until after the Second Buddhist Council. The Dipavamsa mentions a 'nine-fold' organization of the early texts being divided into individual chapters at the First Council, which may reflect an earlier method of organization. References to abhidhammikas (specialists in the Abhidhamma) but not to Abhidhamma-bhāṇakas in the Milindapanha may suggest that the bhāṇaka system originated before the Abhidhamma Pitaka was 'closed' by the Theravadins (dated by them to the era of Ashoka at the Third Buddhist Council) but, since the Abhidhamma may have been recited by some variety of sutta-bhāṇaka, could also indicate that being a specialist in a branch of texts was distinct from being responsible for its recitation.  Decline  No fixed date has been established for the end of the bhāṇaka tradition, but scholars generally believe that the tradition went into decline as the Buddhist canon increasingly began to be preserved through written texts. Buddhaghosa wrote about the bhāṇakas as though they were contemporary in approximately the 5th Century CE, but may have been reflecting the perspective of the earlier Sinhala commentaries- his remarks don't definitively establish that the bhāṇaka practice persisted into his own era. The Culavamsa refers to a bhāṇaka as late as the 13th Century CE, but by this date the term may have become generic for a preacher or specialist in recitation, rather than a monk who preserved a significant portion of the canon by memory.

Together, in 2010, they already founded the publishing house Console Syndrome, which was then bought by Pix’n Love Éditions. During the four years they worked with Pix’n Love, Mehdi and Nicolas published and often co-wrote many video game essays, such as Zelda: The History of a Legendary Saga, The Legend of Final Fantasy VII and Metal Gear Solid: Hideo Kojima’s Magnum Opus. Since 2015, with their new publishing house, Third Éditions, they pursue their editorial approach: to analyze the greatest series in video game history. Thanks to two successful Kickstarter campaigns, they’ve now reached the international market with English translations of their books.  History  Born in 1984, Mehdi El Kanafi and Nicolas Courcier both grew up in Muret, near Toulouse (France). They tell their story in The Third, the annual Third Éditions’s newspaper. While they often crossed each other on a basketball court, their true journey started in middle school. They recount the years spent discussing about their new common interest: video games. They read a lot of specialized magazines, and once they turned 20, they launched their own fanzine, Console Syndrome, dedicated to video games. After seven issues, Console Syndrome knew a second life through a website also called Console Syndrome. Once we were free from our studies, we founded our own company in 2010, say the two partners, who managed to seduce some big companies such as Ubisoft. Their first company was bought by Pix’n Love, and then they stood on their own two feet starting from 2014. In three years only, Third Éditions became a major publishing house dedicated to video games and pop culture in France. Some books, such as Zelda. The History of a Legendary Saga, have sold more than copies. Third Editions’s editorial line is defined that way: Every book is written under three major perspectives: genesis, background, and analysis. The goal is to take a major franchise or game, and professionally strip it down to the core. Going from the gameplay analysis to the lore explanation or even how the sound was intended to work on the player. Thanks to their first Kickstarter campaign in 2016, which successfully collected €139,296, Third Éditions managed to translate several books in English. Another successful Kickstarter campaign in 2018 allowed them to translate more books from their list.

Though presently in Perth and Kinross, Keillor, which lies on the border between Perth and Kinross and the council area of Angus, was originally in Angus (previously known as Forfarshire) until the area was transferred to the historic county of Perthshire (now Perth and Kinross) in 1891. A very old surname, the first Keillor family lived at Keillor where they had historically held a family seat. Retrieved 26 June 2018 Although originally a Scottish name, it is also historically concentrated in Northern England, most notably in the region of Yorkshire. The Keillor Stone. A Bronze Age tumulus at High Keillor near Keillor in Perth and Kinross Until the gradual standardization of English spelling in the last few centuries, English lacked any comprehensive system of spelling. Medieval Scottish names, particularly as they were anglicized from the original Gaelic, historically displayed wide variations in recorded spellings as scribes of the era spelled words according to how they sounded rather than any set of rules. This means that a person's name was often spelled several different ways over a lifetime. As such, different variations of the Keillor surname usually have the same origin.

Deo Tibba – Climbing, Hiking & Mountaineering It is situated in the Pir Panjal Range of mountains. It lies to the southwest of Manali above Jagatsukh village. The first reconnaissance of Deo Tibba was made by General Bruce's guide, Furrer, who reported that one of its ridges looked climbable from the Hamta nala. The route to the summit of this peak has a challenging terrain as a climber has to cross over steep ice passes, glaciers with crevasses, rock fall area and moraine. The peak is exceptional in a way that the summit is not a pointed ridge but a snow dome just like an ice cap. It requires a load ferry, crossing technical terrain difficulties, using fixed ropes, crampons, ice axe etc. It is sometimes misunderstood as a beginner's peak for novice mountaineers as it is relatively easier when compared to Stok Kangri and often climbed by NCC and local agencies. As per local beliefs, Deo Tibba is the assembly site of the gods. According to the Hindu mythology, the dome shaped peak of Deo Tibba is where the gods sit. Hence the name Deo meaning ‘Gods’ and Tibba meaning ‘hill'.

History  Extraction of oil by industrial method started in 1848 in Baku. The first metal processing plant was built in 1858 in Baku. In 1859, the oil refining plant was put into operation in Baku. In subsequent years, mechanical engineering and metalworking enterprises were established to serve these sectors due to the development of oil, chemistry and shipping. During 1911–1913 years, there were 12 machine-building plants in Baku, and 127 metalworking enterprises were operating in Baku at the beginning of World War I. 8066 people worked in the construction of those enterprises. During the Second World War, mainly spare parts for military technic, military equipment and weapons were produced in the machine – building plants moved from many industrial cities of the former Soviet Union to Baku. The development of the machine-building industry in the Republic is related to the development of the oil industry in the late 19th and early 20th century. The equipment imported from abroad was repaired in the workshops of the Nobel brothers, Rothschild, Taghiyev, Mukhtarov, Benkendorf in subsequent years. These workshops are the basis of future machine-building plants. During the Great Patriotic War, 95% of productive capacity of Azerbaijan's machine- building enterprises was directed to the production of military technic and equipment. The majority of machine-building equipment of Azerbaijan are produced by enterprises that are part of “Azneftkimyamash” OJSC. In the past, about 70% of the equipment using for oil and gas extraction and repairs of wells in the entire oil-producing area of the Soviet Union belonged to Azerbaijan.

The film was based on the true story of Joseph (Mac) Duffy, who in 1990 pleaded guilty to four counts of grand theft for con schemes in Orange County and was subsequently dubbed in the media as 'the Playboy of the Coast Highway'.\\"'Highway Heartbreaker' Revisits Road to Ruin\\" by Rick Vanderknyff, Los Angeles Times, March 28, 1992.  Plot  Catherine (Linda Gray) is a wealthy and lonely woman who has been handicapped ever since getting involved in a car accident, which she herself caused on the day of signing her divorce papers four years prior due to driving under the influence. During the accident she broke her back and suffered third degree burns. One day while driving on the highway, she meets Mickey Kenton (John Schneider), who claims to run investments for his father. She immediately falls for his charms and they start dating straight away. One day, he borrows $30,000 from her for a 'promising stock offer' in medial equipment, then vanishes following the money transaction. Catherine grows convinced that he is kidnapped and contacts private investigator Bert Quinn (Brock Peters), but he quickly finds out that Mickey is a con man. Quinn tracks Mickey down and threatens to unmask him. Meanwhile, Mickey meets Alex (Heather Locklear), an overworked but very ambitious stock broker on the verge of breaking in a major corporate client. Her father (Dick O'Neill) disapproves of her car purchases which she claims will help her land the breakthrough she desperately wants. She is immediately infatuated with Mickey, who now claims to be in international trade. Aspiring to get into international trade herself, Alex repeatedly meets up with Mickey in hopes of starting a joint venture. When one day she lands a deal with the corporate client, she uses the $15,000 acquired from the deal to invest in a business deal with Mickey. A day later, he tells her the stakes have been raised and that he needs an additional $25,000 dollars, which in reality he intends to use to buy a car. Even though she does not have the money, she draws him the cheque, hopeful that she will land another deal within the company. However, immediately after signing the cheque she finds out that the major client has pulled back. However, Mickey is unwilling to return her the money and threatens to harm her if she goes to the police. She nevertheless contacts the police, who reveal that Mickey is a con man with several aliases. By that time, Mickey has already moved on to his new victim, Annie (Tracy Nelson), a young woman running a charity for a church who needs to raise $5,000 dollars for a children's clinic on a short term. Mickey lures her into a private investment deal, claiming that she can get $6,000 dollars out of a $1,000 dollar investment. While staying at her place, he is once again approached by Quinn and realizes that the private investigator will not leave him alone. Therefore, he decides to return to Catherine and convinces her that he had to leave town for a while for his mother's funeral. She forgives him and allows him to move in with her. Meanwhile, the police and Quinn build a strong case against Mickey and track down the car that he bought with Alex's money. Alex immediately heads out to the car dealer to retrieve the car and finds Catherine, who was told by Mickey that the car was bought in her name. Alex tells Catherine that Mickey is a con man, but she refuses to believe her. A short while later, Mickey is arrested and the media reveal all of his cons. Alex and Annie are the only two victims stepping forward, and Alex even sells all of her belongings to finance the case against him. Despite the media attention and the warnings of her teenage daughter Emily (Dedee Pfeiffer), Catherine bails him out of jail and elopes with him. When the trial against Mickey starts, however, she slowly starts to believe the accusations against him and eventually teams up with Alex and Annie. At that moment, Mickey claims to have left to Arizona for work, but the bail requires him to call in once a day. In Arizona, he is already working on a new victim when the three women lure him into town with a fake story. When he arrives, he is arrested and sent off to jail. In the closing credits, it is revealed that Mickey was given a suspended sentence, contingent upon restitution to his victims. However, no restitution was ever made.

History of the Coins   Introduction  On March 26, 2018, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas introduced the New Generation Currency Coin Series which was circulated through banks on March 27. The new series features native Philippine flora. Sentimo denominated coins feature a stylized representation of the Philippine flag on the obverse. Peso denominated coins depict the portraits of renowned national heroes of the Philippines on the obverse. The coins are struck in Nickel-plated steel for all six denominations, in response to the widespread hoarding and melting down of the coins, decreasing the cost of production of minting the coins and address concerns of the discoloration of the coins due to the humid, tropical environment. However, the 10-sentimo coin is not included in this series, because it was removed as a general circulation coin. In July 2019, the BSP announced plans to replace the ₱20 bill with a ₱20 coin by the 1st quarter of 2020.https://www.rappler.com/business/235646-bangko-sentral-pilipinas-to- create-philippine-peso-20-coin In September 2019, Benjamin Diokno, the current BSP governor, announced that the ₱5 coin, being confused for the ₱1 coin, will have a revised design, featuring a wave edge or scallop shape and enhanced security features. The ₱20 coin, also in the same announcement, received its final designs in the same month and the two coins will be released for circulation in December 2019. The 5-piso coin, however, will have a nonagonal shape, while the 20-piso coin, will be bimetallic and the 20-piso coin will be the second bimetallic coin in circulation after the 10-piso coin of the New Design/BSP series.

They have produced two documentaries and run a YouTube channel that has over 6.5 million subscribers and 720 million views.  History Storror was established in 2010 by seven parkour athletes from Horsham (West Sussex), who grew up together. The team started with the Cave brothers and Drew Taylor, who were inspired by Jump London (2003) and Jump Britain (2005) documentaries. They began uploading videos to their YouTube channel, originally called StorrorBlog. They later met other members of British parkour communities and in 2010 established the Storror group and YouTube channel. In 2011 and 2012 the team filmed two cliff jumping videos in Malta that included jumps from Azure Window. In 2016, team member Max Cave leaped between the roofs of two Hong Kong skyscrapers and uploaded it to Instagram. They also filmed several other videos in Hong Kong which were published later.

The name of the unit was in honour to Italian communist Gastone Sozzi, assassinated in 1928 by camicie nere, of Fascist orientation. History After the Spanish coup of July 1936, which was seen by many anti-Fascist unions as a Fascist uprising against the democratically elected Republic, a series of Italian anti-Fascists departed to Barcelona from Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Grenoble and Saint-Etienne. On September 2, around eighty Italian volunteers arrived to the Carlos Marx Barracks in the city, including at least two elements of different nationalities and some athletes that had come to Barcelona to participate in the People's Olympiad. On September 3, the column was officially established. Three groups of Italian volunteers had been created in Barcelona. The first, very small, left with the first columns of Catalan volunteers to the front. The other two gave rise to the Giustizia e Libertà Centuria -of Anarchist orientation, although directed by the Socialist Carlo Rosselli- and the Gastone Sozzi Centuria, with Gotardo Rinaldi as commander and Captain Francesco Leone as political commissar. The Catalan authorities had planned the unit to go to the Aragon Front, but it was integrated into the PSUC Liberty Column as the 22nd Centuria of the unit. The centuria arrived in Madrid on September 8, and quickly collaborated with the Fifth Regiment in the defence of the city. On September 13, it was already fighting in the 1300 Hill, in Cenicientos, in the Extremadura Road. The centuria was framed as the 3nd Company of the Garibaldi Battalion on October 10. Between October 16 and 18, the men of the centuria fought in Chapinería, before being sent to the base at Albacete. It was then attached, with mainly Italian volunteers, to the XI on October 22, and later the XII International Brigade.

He was the president of the Fédération Internationale des Sociétés d'Aviron (FISA), the International Rowing Federation, from 1949 or 1950 (sources differ) until his death. Mullegg was born in 1890 in Murten, Switzerland. He had an interest for many sports but his passion was for rowing. As a rowing official, he was involved in organising the Olympic rowing competitions in Amsterdam (1928), Los Angeles (1932), Berlin (1936), London (1948), Helsinki (1952), and Melbourne (1956). He became president of FISA when he succeeded Rico Fioroni in 1949 or 1950. Aged 64, Mullegg obtained a pilot's license. He was piloting a plane near the Parc de Mon Repos in Lausanne when the engine lost power. Mullegg was killed in the crash and his two passengers, French rowers Jean Méry and Louis Patricot, suffered serious injuries. He was survived by his wife and succeeded by Thomas Keller as president of FISA. Mullegg is credited with conceiving the idea of having World Rowing Championships. The first world championships had been planned for 1958 in Philadelphia but at the FISA congress in 1957, the Americans withdrew from organising the event. Work on contingency plans stopped when Mullegg died. At the FISA congress in November 1958, it was agreed that world championships would proceed and the inaugural World Rowing Championships were held in 1962 in Lucerne.

Meanwhile, Wentworth's eclectic mix of misfits are fracturing as the powers of love, deception and revenge threaten to break them apart for good. The onset of dementia finds Liz clutching at any semblance of hope, while Boomer has to deal with her feelings after the break-up of her family. Cast Promotional image of the cast.

Foxtel's head of drama and Wentworth executive producer Penny Win said: \\"It's hard to believe we are already rolling the cameras on season seven of Wentworth. It feels like only yesterday we were reintroducing Foxtel viewers to such iconic characters like Bea Smith and 'The Freak' Joan Ferguson. The way in which our audience, both locally and internationally, has embraced and connected with the show goes to prove that people will watch, embrace, love and continue to support quality Australian drama. New cast members joining the show during the season, included Dr. Greg Miller (David de Lautour), Sean Brody (Rick Donald), Narelle Stang (Morgana O'Reilly), and Kylee Webb (Geraldine Hakewill). Original ending Season seven of Wentworth was intended to be the final season; however, in December 2018, it was announced that the series was renewed for an additional 20 episodes which will broadcast through 2020 and 2021. Following the renewal, several scenes from the final episode had to be cut, and new scenes were shot and inserted to lead the story into the eighth season. The cut scenes, which were intended to give closure to the series, included Franky and Bridget with Vera and Baby Grace, while another scene featuring three new prisoners who have arrived at Wentworth (cameo appearances by original Prisoner cast members Val Lehman, Fiona Spence, and Colette Mann who played Bea Smith, Vera Bennett, and Doreen Anderson/Burns, respectively).

The report is meant to assess the views of Sikhs living in the UK and to provide this information to the government, non-governmental organisations, companies and other groups. It is one of the largest projects to study the needs and wants of Sikhs in the UK.  History  Rt Hon left left The BSR was founded by Jasvir Singh in 2012 and is created annually by a team of research analysts, lawyers, academics, social workers, senior consultants and managers who work on the BSR on a voluntary basis. The Editor of the report is Jagdev Singh Virdee MBE who is a British statistician. The report takes approximately 500 man hours and costs £30,000 to create every year. The purpose of BSR is to \\"identify the needs and wants of the 432,000 strong Sikh population in the UK.\\" The BSR is \\"one of the few large-scale surveys undertaken of Britain's Sikhs\\" and it is one of the largest projects to study this group of people in the country. BSR is launched annually in Parliament. The report has been quoted in the British Parliament, referred to in pieces of research and white papers relating to Sikhs or faith in general, and used by public bodies, the corporate sector and third sector groups. The report is also meant to help other non-Sikh organisations better work with Sikhs in the UK. The BSR fills a gap in information relating to modern Sikhs in Britain. In 2019, the report was used to support the first Sikh National History and Awareness Month.  Content  The report, which focuses on the views of Sikhs living in Britain, is organized into several sections including an introduction, review of relevant literature, research methodology and then goes into the selected feedback areas. The report also addresses recommendations for areas in people's lives that need improvement. BSR has focused on different subjects over the last few years. In 2018, the focus of the report was mental health which has subsequently led to a new generation of Sikhs more open to discussions and leading the dialogue regarding mental health within the British Sikh Community. In the first year, the respondents were selected through an online study, which the BSR acknowledged as being skewed towards those who have internet access.  Awards and nominations  The British Sikh Report team have been awarded a wide range of awards recognising their community work including: *In the 2019 New Year Honours, Dr Jagbir Jhutti-Johal, the academic advisor to the British Sikh Report and senior lecturer in Sikh studies at the University of Birmingham received an OBE for services to higher education, faith communities and the voluntary sector. *In the 2018 Birthday Honours, Jagdev Singh Virdee, the editor of the British Sikh Report received an MBE for services to statistics and the Sikh community in the UK. He is the most senior expert in official statistics amongst Sikhs globally. * In the 2018 New Year Honours, Onkardeep Singh a founding trustee, received an MBE for services to faith communities and young people in the UK. He became the youngest person of South Asian heritage to receive this award. * In the 2017 New Year Honours the Chairman, Jasvir Singh (barrister), received an OBE for services to faith communities and social cohesion in the UK.

It linked a lower terminus near the lakeside and the church of Santa Maria degli Angioli with an upper terminus adjacent to the Hotel Bristol. The upper station was on the third floor of a tower, linked with a footbridge to the hotel. The line had a single track and single car, which was balanced by a vertically operating counterweight in the tower. The line opened in 1913. In 1973 it was gifted by its owner to the City of Lugano. The Hotel Bristol closed in 1981, and the funicular followed in 1986. The line remains in existence, in an abandoned state. In 2012 the line was listed as a cultural property of regional significance. In April 2018 the Lugano city authorities announced a competition, with a CHF36,000 prize, for the best idea for a future for the funicular. In September of the same year, the same authorities requested a loan of CHF325,000 for a study into the future of the funicular and how it could form part of a wider plan for improved access to the lake. It is estimated that restoration as a static monument would cost CHF2.6 million, and a return to operation would cost CHF5.5 million. When in operation, the line was in length and climbed a vertical distance of , with a maximum gradient of 44% and an average gradient of 38.7%. It was of gauge.

He was sentenced for the murders of three people committed in 1999.\\"Sedrati the thief of lives\\" Article of September 2, 1999 published in Le Nouvel Observateur number 1817. The various pieces of two bodies (the third body was never found) were thrown into the Marne-Rhine Canal near Nancy. In his judicial career, he was involved in five disappearances and sentenced for three murders.  Facts and the investigation   The first body  In May 1999 a fisherman discovered a human right foot in the Canal de jonction de Nancy. He immediately informed the river police, who at first thought that the foot had been severed by a boat propeller. The next day, a putrefied human head was retrieved 500 meters away from the spot where the foot had been discovered. A few days later bones, a sternum, ribs and a third patella (that is to say, there was a second victim) that were fished in the vicinity of the canal. The next day a hand was discovered near the Nancy canal; finally, one week after the discovery (the right human foot), the left foot was retrieved by the River Police. The medical examiner responsible for collecting the various pieces of the human body found that the limbs were sectioned surgically and excluded the hypothesis of an accident: it was therefore a homicide. The police could not take fingerprint from the found hand because it was too badly decomposed. The River Brigade Police sent their hand to be analyzed in Paris where the only section of research are able to solve this type of problem. A few weeks later the laboratory managed to put a name to the found hand: Hans Gassen, a German who had served a prison sentence and who had been released a few months previously. Police learned that Gassen was living in the house of another German who was also a former prisoner named Hans Muller. Muller had reported Gassen's disappearance on May 21, 1999, one week before the discovery of the dismembered body in the canal. At the same time, the police learned that Gassen received a lot of phone calls from two locations: a house in Nancy and an apartment near Nancy. During a search of both places the authorities discovered that a certain Philippe Grossiord regularly called Gassen and that Grossiord was an alias used by a man called Nadir Sedrati to avoid apprehension. Nadir Sedrati was known to the police since he had been arrested for fraud and identity theft and had shared a cell with Gassen and Muller. Sedrati was released from prison in March 1999, after both him and Gassen were both arrested for a confrontation. Muller declared that Hans Gassen left his home at 4 AM because he had an appointment on May 21. Gassen had to call back, but he never did. The phone calls proved that Muller was at home at the time of the disappearance of his friend, clearing him as a suspect. As for Sedrati, he said that it was Muller who killed Gassen during a dispute that went wrong: he declared that Muller, Gassen, two Dutchmen and two Moroccans were at home to discuss business (a supposed trafficking) and that he had left because that affair did not concern him; he then supposedly heard Gassen and Muller argue violently and saw Muller kill Gassen. French and German police did not believe him and searched Sedrati's house. In his apartment they discovered a woodchipper, a kitchen knife, a butcher's saw and several brownish spots on the floor, the sink and woodchipper. The police thought it was blood but had no proof of it. And by digging deeper into the apartment they realized that a bag is hidden in a cushion. The bag contained a jar filled with white powder and police believed it was drugs (either cocaine or heroin). A few weeks later the police learned that the white powder collected from Sedrati is cyanide, which suggested that Sedrati poisoned Gassen with cyanide (the police also discovered that Sedrati bought 20 kg of cyanide under the identity of a certain Joel Royer). The police began to catch a glimpse of what happened to Sedrati: Gassen had an appointment with Philippe Grossiord but it was Nadir Sedrati who received it. Sedrati had to tell Gassen that he had to wait for Grossiord; this last coming Sedrati have proposed to Gassen to have a cup of coffee mixed with cyanide. Gassen suffocated, fainted and somebody (presumably Sedrati) dismembered his body, whose various pieces were thrown into the canal. But what puzzled the authorities is that Gassen's head was in a state of advanced decomposition. They thought that the head was thrown into the canal 6 weeks ago while Gassen had died 2 to 3 weeks ago. Digging again in Sedrati's apartment they discovered in the basement lime and learned that the lime can delay the identification of a body when a part of the body was immersed in it, whereas Gassen's head seemed more rotten for the others. Nadir Sedrati was brought before the investigating judge and was subsequently imprisoned. He claimed he was innocent and the police discovered that Sedrati had no apparent motive to kill Gassen if not for the money, because Sedrati had stolen the victim's bank card to make some withdrawals (300 francs).  The second body  Police now had to solve the mystery of the third patella found at the same time as Gassen's pieces. They learned that Gérard Steil and Norbert Ronfort, two other killers who knew Nadir Sedrati, have been missing since spring 1999. The police thought that either Steil or Ronfort was the second victim found in the canal. For this, they decided appeal to the family of the missing men to take a DNA sample. This was complicated, but the police still managed to collect the DNA of two people (a close friend of Steil and a close friend of Ronfort). Pending the results, the investigation showed that Gérard Steil was released from prison in October 1998 and that he found work for six months in Strasbourg as a delivery driver and housed in a home in the city. His contract soon expired, but Steil still planned to work under a certain Philippe Grossiord, who had contacted him for work within his company Inter Europe Diffusion. Gérard Steil made the trip by train from Strasbourg to Nancy for the job interview, where he must have been with Grossiord and had to be back in Strasbourg on Monday morning. Steil arrived at the company, which turned out to be a fictional company invented by Grossiord (AKA Sedrati). The company's headquarters were located in a room at the back of Nadir Sedrati's apartment. Then Sedrati called the home in which Steil lodged and that he would not come back because he started work in society. The police quickly concluded that Sedrati killed Steil. However the motive for the crime was unknown but the police believed that only interest for Sedrati to kill Steil was the poor pension that affected the victim. Moreover, the second patella belonged to Steil, so the police and the River Brigade of Nancy decided to drain the whole canal to find possible remains. In November 1999, remains were recovered in the canal and actually belonged to Gérard Steil.  A third victim?  Moreover, Norbert Ronfort, another acquaintance of Sedrati who disappeared just like Steil, left prison in early 1999 and had a goal: get in touch with his family and buy a motorhome. The police also learned that Ronfort had told Nadir Sedrati about his plans and that he received a phone call from Inter Europe Diffusion. The company boasted about selling motorhomes and, attracted by the offer of a certain Philippe Grossiord, Ronfort had agreed to meet him to acquire the motorhome. Since this conversation, Norbert Ronfort disappeared and his body still hasn't been found. Nadir Sedrati was indicted in the murder of Hans Gassen, Gérard Steil and Norbert Ronfort, even though his body was never found.  Trial  The trial of Nadir Sedrati began in April 2002 and lasted several days. Sedrati still proclaiming his innocence. The blood found on the linoleum and on the sink made it possible to confirm that Sedrati had killed his victim(s) in the kitchen. Sedrati was sentenced to life imprisonment with a 20-year lock-in period. He tried to appeal this conviction.  Second trial  Nadir Sedrati's second appeal trial opened in May 2003. In this second trial, Sedrati seemed tired and sad. A dramatic twist occurred: a jailed woman who knew Norbert Ronfort claimed to have seen him in 2000 (one year after Sedrati's arrest). A bailiff was sworn in to question this woman about what she knew. The young woman claimed to know Norbert Ronfort and claimed that they had crossed paths in 2000. Her testimony seemed coherent and in good faith. Norbert Ronfort's location then hovered over the Sedrati trial. Psychiatric experts say Sedrati could re-offend anytime. Moreover, he usurped the identity of two other missing persons (one in 1985 and another in 1995) and was accused of murdering them. The bodies of these two people have not been found to date. The jury did not take into account the testimony of the imprisoned woman and resentenced Nadir Sedrati to life imprisonment with a 22-year lock-in period. Sedrati appealed in cassation. His appeal was dismissed in October 2003.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. History The first European settlers in what is now Livingston County, Michigan arrived in the 1820s. However, the population grew rapidly, and in 1833 Livingston County was created, and its government was organized in 1836. The two-year-old village of Howell was chosen as the county seat, due to its central location. However, many county residents protested the designation, and the county had to rent rooms to use as offices. It was not until 1847 that the first county courthouse was constructed. This building served until 1874, when it was replaced. By the early 1880s county officials realized that the new 1874 courthouse was too small for the county's needs. The county rented office space from nearby businesses, and prisoners were housed at the county jail in neighboring Shiawassee County. The county Board of Commissioners formed a building committee, which recommended a new facility, and voters approved the proposal in 1889. The county hired Detroit architect Albert E. French to design a new courthouse; construction started in 1889 and was completed in 1890. In the early 1970s, the county considered replacing the courthouse, but renovated it instead. Description The Livingston County Courthouse is a two-and-one-half story brick structure with a half-basement of rough-cut limestone ashlar. The building is relatively symmetrical, spanning five bays on the east and west facades and seven bays at the north and south. The three center bays on the north and south project slightly. A limestone ashlar belt course demarcates the first and second floors; limestone is also used for the entryway arches, lintels, and window hoods. The building is topped with a multi-gabled hip roof and a central clock tower. The interior contains oak and maple woodwork, which is of particularly fine quality in the circuit courtroom, which contains the original judge's desk, carved railing, spectator seats, and wainscoting, as well as bookcases and a carved oak wall clock. Many interior entryways are richly carved with floral decorations and gargoyles. Walls in many of the public areas are decorated with unusual floral adamants.

A previous smaller synagogue had been built in 1790s, funded by the German- Jewish merchant Jacob Marcus. The current synagogue was built between 1855–1858 in a neoclassical manner based on designs made by the architects Edvard Medén and Carl Stål.

Prior to that, Bailey was Deputy President and Deputy Vice-Chancellor at the University of Manchester. He is a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, the Institution of Civil Engineers, the Institution of Structural Engineers and a member of the Institution of Fire Engineers. Bailey left school at 16 to start work as an apprentice draughtsman at a construction firm in London, and worked for several design consultants. Aged 22, he began a degree in civil and structural engineering at the University of Sheffield, graduating with a first class BEng in 1992, followed by a PhD in 1995, and postdoctoral work in building fire safety. He joined the University of Manchester in 2002 as Professor of Structural Engineering, and became Head of the School of Mechanical, Aerospace and Civil Engineering in 2007. His leadership achievements at Manchester include the launch of high-profile research projects, including the BP International Centre for Advanced Materials, the National Graphene Institute (£61m of funding support) and the Sir Henry Royce Institute (£283m of funding). As a non-executive director, he is on the boards of several charities and organisations. Bailey is author of more than 130 research papers, conference papers and practical design guides, and has been awarded nine prizes for his research work. His main specialties are fire safety engineering of structures, membrane action, wind loading and steel- concrete composite systems. Bailey is well-known globally in the field of structural fire engineering and has published 10 practical fire design guides/books. This has included the publication of the ‘Bailey’ fire design method, which has been used in design software and distributed to 2,500 companies in 20 countries. He has been a third party reviewer for a number of projects and an Expert Witness on a number of incidents including the World Trade Centre. Bailey is one of the four experts to sit on a Government independent expert advisory panel on building safety, set up in December 2017 to advise on immediate safety action following the Grenfell Tower fire, and chaired by Sir Ken Knight, former London Fire Commissioner and former Government Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser. The panel has produced extensive building safety advice. In 2018, Bailey was awarded an Honorary Professorship by Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU) in China. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to engineering. Bailey was involved in a controversy during the Coronavirus pandemic in 2020 when the students’ union claimed that he had refused to allow the them to access the UK government's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) to claim more than their actual wage bill. The University responded by clarifying that the students’ union was in fact prohibited by government guidelines from being able to claim more than their actual wage bill from the CJRS and that the University had committed to making sure that student workers were paid their expected wages.

The site is dedicated to 547 fallen soldiers and civilians of Slabinja who were killed during the World War II in Yugoslavia. Author of the monument is Stanislav Mišić. The construction of the monument was completed in 1981. According to a Croatian researcher Sanja Horvatinčić, this monument seems to be directly inspired by the 1919 Russian constructionist poster Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge by El Lissitzky.  Work on the monument  In the late 1970s, many in Slabinja felt it was necessary to build a proper memorial complex to commemorate the people who had died defending the region during World War II. With help from national League of Communists and regional union of fighters (SUBNOR), the local council of Slabinja organized the monument's construction project, choosing Zagreb-based sculptor Stanislav Mišić to create the complex. The monument was symbolically unveiled to the public on 30 May 1981, on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the people's uprising against oppression and also was the same month in which the village was finally liberated from Axis forces in 1945. The occasion was celebrated by thousands of the region's inhabitants during a ceremony that included theatrical plays and poetic readings by writer Đorđe Đurić. Speaker of the Parliament of SR Croatia Jure Bilić held a speech during the opening ceremony, while retired Yugoslav Air Force Major General Zdravko Kolar unveiled the monument.  Monument description  The central sculptural element of the monument is a 15 meters tall spire clad in stainless steel, with a large red-painted concrete triangle intersecting the spire at a sharp angle. Arranged around the monument are five engraved stone markers telling the detailed story of Slabinja from 1941 to 1945. On the central stainless steel spire of the monument are engraved the names and ages of 547 fallen victims (107 soldiers and 441 civilians) of the Axis occupation and aggression. Additionally, in front of the monument, there are five engraved stone markers set into the ground.

He stopped tributes from Enijies in Esanland from being paid to the Oba of Benin, and stopped any appeal cases being taken from Esanland to the Oba's Palace of Benin for retrial during the time of Ozolua n'Ibarmoi (or Ozolua the Conqueror).  History  alt=a black-and-white image of a tree Agba N'Ojie inherited the Uromi throne after the death of his father Onojie Ijesan, the first Onojie of Uromi. He wanted to free his kin from the control of the old Benin Empire. The general population of Esan kngdoms initially relocated from Benin City during the rule of Oba Ewuare. These small settlements extended through interior development and recorded movements from Benin around five centuries ago. Such movements into the zone may have occurred before this date. They were driven by ousted sovereigns, bosses, culprits and others who had abandoned Benin City for the uninhabited woodland before 1460 Ewuare's reign as the Oba of Beni. This was done either through the self-centeredness and outrages of a portion of the Obas, or following the cataclysmic common wars over progression. The recorded relocation out of Benin City occurred amid Oba Ewuare's reign in the fifteenth century when the Oba lost his two children and made some unforgiving laws restricting the subjects from cooking, washing, or having sex for extended periods of time. The Oba tried to battle against the parties that migrated into Esanland but failed. Oba Ewuare's pugnacious nature drove him to conquer 201 towns but not Esanland. For many of the scattered settlements in Esanland, the Oba needed to use discretion to bring them under Benin's dominion. He welcomed Esan pioneers or their agents to Benin for a détente. He was prepared to perceive and respect his guests with the title of Onojie, which means king. There is no record of any individuals who received the invitation and disregarded it. They have vanished from history. For the future, Esan laid on the individuals who went to Benin and took the title of Onojie. Agba's father was one of the pioneers initiated by Oba Ewuare in 1463 as the first Onojie of Uromi. At the time when Agba assumed control over the position as the Onojie after the passing of his father, Onojie Ijesan found the way Oba Ewuare used discretion and manipulations to bring the Esan people under the Bini control, choosing to end the Bini control over the Esan people. When Oba Ozolua/Ozolua N'Ibaromi (Ozolua the Conqueror) extended a hand of friendship to Agba Nojie of Uromi, King Agba of Uromi, bluntly and gallantly refused the friendship with the Oba, saying it was not an honest friendship and a gesture whose essence was dead on arrival. Indeed, that was a blow to the ego of Oba Ozolua, and war was declared between the two generals, Oba Ozolua of Benin and Onojie Agba Nojie of Uromi, eventually becoming the Bini Esan War. Bini Esan War During the 16th century, the Uzea War, which is also known as the Bini Esan War, occurred between the Uromi kingdom and the Kingdom of Benin. The War lasted for many years due to a refusal of friendship from Oba Ozolua of Benin by Onojie Agba N'ojie of Uromi. Oba Ozolua moved with his warriors to Esanland and beheaded the Onojie of Uzea during the war, which ended in the town of Uzea when Oba Ozolua was beheaded in Esanland. King Agba N'ojie of Uromi did not die immediately but vanished into Ahojie bush and was never seen again. The people of Esan defined him as a God of War and is worshipped today under a tall kapok tree. After the war, the original coinage of Esan Gbe Edo was struck, meaning Esans has defeated the Binis. At that time, it was also used by the Esans. The Bini warriors went back home after the defeat, and told of the intense, dreadful nature and gallantry of Esans. A peace treaty was signed between the Esans and the Binis, which the Esans call Ukoven. This was done and sealed by planting the Ohimi tree and pledging the Ohimi oath, \\"Esan I Gbedo...\\", which is known today as \\"Esan Igbe Edo\\" meaning Esans will no longer attack Binis. Esan kingdoms would loan soldiers to the Benin Kingdom, such as during the Idah War of 1515-1516, and on three occasions when some Obas of Benin were denied their throne, they went to Esanland and were led by Esan warriors back to Benin to reclaim their throne as Oba. An example of this is Oba Osemwende (1816–1848). Death Agba N'Ojie Shrine Agba N'Ojie of Uromi's exact date of death was never confirmed because he vanished into Ahojie bush in Uromi and was never seen again. Worship Alu-Agba Deity is a god of war and is worshipped under a tall kapok tree every Uromi first market day by the Esan people. They believe Agba N'Ojie has the power to protect them during the war and hard times.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. History August Westphal was born in 1833 in Germany, and arrived in this area with his parents in 1844. In 1853 he purchased the first 80 acres of this farmstead, and in 1855 he married Barbara Emsbery. The couple eventually had nine children. They originally lived in a small frame house located northwest of the present farmhouse. In 1868 they built a large barn on the farm, and in 1975 constructed the Italianate farmhouse. The farm prospered, and Westphal eventually owned 205 acres. In 1916, the Westphals retired and moved to another house, selling the farm to Conrad Seim, another German immigrant. The Seim family farmed the property until 1967, when the land was sold to a developer. The farmhouse and surrounding buildings remain on a four-acre parcel. Description The August Westphal Farmstead contains a large farmhouse, two barns, a corn crib, wagon shed, chicken coop, smokehouse, privy, and water-shed, located in a cluster. The farmhouse is a two-story vernacular Italianate structure with two single- story additions. The house sits on a fieldstone foundation, and is sided with clapboard. The front entrance is through a porch, and includes an unusual arrangement of two separate, arched doors, side by side, with one opening into the parlor and one into the living room. The house is topped with a belvedere. Sawn-wood ornamentation decorates the porches, bevedere, bay window, and the window hoods. The interior of the house is unusually ornate for a farmhouse, and includes plaster cornices and ceiling medallions, as well as false fireplaces in the living room and dining room with decorative wooden mantels.

It was the 87th running of the event, as organised by the automotive group, the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO) since . The round was the last in the 2018–19 FIA World Endurance Championship and the second time in the season that the series had visited Le Mans. A test day was held two weeks prior to the race on 2 June. A Toyota TS050 Hybrid shared by Mike Conway, Kamui Kobayashi and José María López started from pole position after Kobayashi set the overall fastest lap time in the second qualifying session. The race was won by the Toyota trio of Fernando Alonso, Sébastien Buemi and Kazuki Nakajima after López slowed in the 23rd hour due to a wired tyre pressure sensor system, which incorrectly indicated a puncture on a tyre that was later found not to have any issues. It was Alonso, Buemi, Nakajima and Toyota's second consecutive Le Mans win. The No. 7 Toyota finished almost 17 seconds behind in second position. The No. 11 SMP Racing BR1 of Mikhail Aleshin, Vitaly Petrov and Stoffel Vandoorne was the highest-placed non-hybrid LMP1 car in third place. The Signatech Alpine team of Nicolas Lapierre, André Negrão and Pierre Thiriet won the Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2) category with the Jackie Chan DC Racing Oreca 07 car of Ho-Pin Tung, Gabriel Aubry and Stéphane Richelmi second. On the 70th anniversary of Ferrari's first overall Le Mans victory the AF Corse team won the Le Mans Grand Touring Endurance Professional (LMGTE Pro) class with James Calado's, Alessandro Pier Guidi's and Daniel Serra's 488 GTE Evo from a Porsche 911 RSR driven by Richard Lietz, Gianmaria Bruni and Frédéric Makowiecki. The Le Mans Grand Touring Endurance Amateur (LMGTE Am) category was led for most of the time by Keating Motorsports' Ford GT of Jeroen Bleekemolen, Felipe Fraga and Ben Keating which was the first to finish the race. It was later disqualified for an oversized fuel tank and Project 1 Racing's Porsche of Jörg Bergmeister, Patrick Lindsey and Egidio Perfetti inherited the class win. The result won Alonso, Buemi and Nakajima the LMP Drivers' Championship by 41 points over Conway, Kobayashi and López. Thomas Laurent and Gustavo Menezes of the Rebellion Racing team finished third ahead of Aleshin and Petrov in fourth and the Rebellion duo of Neel Jani and André Lotterer in fifth. Porsche's Michael Christensen and Kévin Estre finished tenth in LMGTE Pro to claim the GTE Drivers' Championship with 155 points. LMGTE Pro class race winners Calado and Pier Guidi passed Bruni and Lietz to end the season in second place. Background The dates for the 2019 24 Hours of Le Mans were confirmed at a meeting of the FIA World Motor Sport Council in its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on 19 June 2017. It was the 87th Le Mans race, the final automobile endurance event of the 2018–19 FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC), and was the second visit to Le Mans during the season. The race was proposed in 1922 by the automotive journalist Charles Faroux to Georges Durand, the president of the automotive group, the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO) and the industrialist Emile Coquile to test car reliability and fuel- efficiency. It is considered one of the world's most prestigious motor races and is part of the Triple Crown of Motorsport. After winning the 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps, Toyota drivers Fernando Alonso, Sébastien Buemi and Kazuki Nakajima led the LMP Drivers' Championship with 160 points, 31 ahead of their teammates Mike Conway, Kamui Kobayashi and José María López in second. 38 points were available for the final race, which meant Conway, Kobayashi and López could win the LMP Drivers' Championship if they won and Alonso, Buemi and Nakajima finished eighth or lower. With 140 points, Porsche's Michael Christensen and Kévin Estre led the GTE Drivers' Championship by 36 points over their second-placed teammates Gianmaria Bruni and Richard Lietz. Christensen and Estre needed to finish eighth or better to claim the title as Bruni and Lietz needed to win at Le Mans and their teammates to attain a sub- par result. The LMP1 Teams' Championship and the GTE Manufacturers' Championship had already been won by Toyota and Porsche, respectively.  Regulation changes  Following a two-lap victory for Porsche in the Le Mans Grand Touring Professional (LMGTE Pro) category in , the ACO revised Le Mans' safety implementation system after team managers raised procedural concerns. Full course yellow flags mandating cars to slow to in the event of an accident were implemented for the first time at Le Mans. The system became the preferred method of slowing the race as opposed to deploying three safety cars and enforcing slow zones. The ACO also permitted drivers to enter the pit lane during safety car conditions and exit it before a second safety car passed by so that they could remain in the same group of vehicles when racing resumed. Entries The ACO Selection Committee received 75 applications for entries between the LMP1 (Le Mans Prototype 1), LMP2 (Le Mans Prototype 2), LMGTE Pro and LMGTE Am (Le Mans Grand Touring Amateur) categories from 20 December 2018 to 30 January 2019. The automotive group initially planned to accept 60 cars into the race but wishing to not exclude applications of a \\"high standard\\" they allowed 62 to race. The ten-panel Selection Committee took steps to ensure that the two additional required pits would be operational in time for the 2019 edition. Automatic entries Automatic entry invitations were earned by teams that won their class in the 2018 24 Hours of Le Mans. Teams who won championships in the European Le Mans Series (ELMS), Asian Le Mans Series (ALMS), and the Michelin Le Mans Cup were also invited. The second- place finisher in the ELMS LMGTE championship also earned an automatic invitation. The ACO chose two WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (WTSC) teams to be automatic entries regardless of their performance or category. As invitations were granted to teams, they were allowed to change their cars from the previous year to the next, but not their category. The LMGTE class invitations from the ELMS and ALMS were allowed to choose between the Pro and Am categories. ELMS' LMP3 (Le Mans Prototype 3) champion was required to field an entry in LMP2 while the ALMS LMP3 champion was permitted to choose between LMP2 or LMGTE Am. The Michelin Le Mans Cup GT3 champion was limited to the LMGTE Am category. On 11 February 2019, the ACO announced the initial list of automatic entries. Driver Misha Goikhberg, who was invited to the race by winning the Jim Trueman Award for being \\"the top-placed gentleman driver\\" in the WTSC's Daytona Prototype International category, transferred his automatic entry to WeatherTech Racing per an agreement. {  style=\\"font-size: 85%;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Reason invited ! scope=\\"col\\"  LMP1 ! scope=\\"col\\"  LMP2 ! scope=\\"col\\"  LMGTE Pro ! scope=\\"col\\"  LMGTE Am -  1st in the 24 Hours of Le Mans  Toyota Gazoo Racing  Signatech Alpine Matmut  Porsche GT Team  Dempsey-Proton Racing -  1st in the European Le Mans Series (LMP2 and LMGTE) ! rowspan=\\"9\\"   G-Drive Racing  colspan=\\"2\\"  Proton Competition -  2nd in the European Le Mans Series (LMGTE) ! rowspan=\\"1\\"   colspan=\\"2\\"  JMW Motorsport -  1st in the European Le Mans Series (LMP3)  RLR Msport ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  ! rowspan=\\"1\\"  - WeatherTech SportsCar Championship at-large entries  Misha Goikhberg  Ben Keating -  1st in the Asian Le Mans Series (LMP2 and GT)  rowspan=\\"1\\"  United Autosports  colspan=\\"2\\"  CarGuy Racing -  1st in the Asian Le Mans Series (LMP2 Am)  ARC Bratislava ! rowspan=\\"1\\"  ! rowspan=\\"1\\"  -  1st in the Asian Le Mans Series (LMP3)  Inter Europol Competition ! align=\\"center\\"  – or –  Inter Europol Competition -  1st in the Michelin Le Mans Cup (GT3) ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  ! rowspan=\\"3\\"   colspan=\\"1\\"  Kessel Racing } Entry list and reserves For the 2019 event, the list of race entries was revealed in two stages: the first 42 cars were announced on 11 February with the rest of the field and 10 reserve cars in the LMP2 class and the two LMGTE categories announced on 1 March. The ACO attributed the 2018–19 FIA WEC's format as a reason for the alteration. In addition from the 34 guaranteed entries from the FIA WEC, 15 came from the ELMS, nine from the WTSC, five from the ALMS and a solitary one-off Le Mans specific entry. In addition to the 62 entries given invitations for the race, 10 were put on a reserve list to replace any withdrawn or ungranted invitations. Reserve entries were ordered with the first replacing the first withdrawal from the race, regardless of the class and entry. The Spirit of Race team announced the withdrawal of their Ferrari 488 GTE Evo on 21 March, citing \\"an unavoidable family commitment\\" as the reason. Duqueine Engineering's Oreca 07-Gibson car was promoted to the race entry as a result. That same day, Michael Shank Racing withdrew its Algarve Pro Racing-run Oreca 07 car from the reserve list because the team was ninth in that list. On 16 April, on the day that the ACO announced that two additional temporary pit garages would be constructed to raise the number of cars for the event to 62, the No. 32 United Autosports Ligier JS P217-Gibson and High Class Racing's No. 20 Oreca 07 were the two cars promoted from the reserve list to the race entry. With the subsequent withdrawal of the Ebimotors LMGTE Am car from the reserve entries, five reserves remained on the list: the Eurasia Motorsport, Panis-Barthez Compétition, IDEC Sport, Team Project 1 and TF Sport teams.  Pre-race balance of performance changes  The FIA Endurance Committee altered the LMP equivalence of technology and the LMGTE balance of performance to try to create parity within each category. All non-hybrid LMP1 cars had their maximum fuel flow increased from to with the Toyota TS050 Hybrid's unchanged at . The Toyota's minimum weight was set at , the turbocharged non-hybrid LMP1 vehicles at and the non-turbocharged privateer LMP1 cars at . For the LMGTE Pro class, the Porsche 911 RSR and BMW M8 GTE had respective ballast increases of and and less turbocharger boost curve for lower performance. The Ford GT's weight was increased by and its turbocharger boost curve altered to raise its top speed. Conversely, the Aston Martin Vantage, the Chevrolet Corvette C7.R, and the Ferrari 488 Evo had of ballast removed and the Ferrari's turbocharger boost curve was made more powerful. In LMGTE Am, the Ford was made heavier than the Ferrari 488 GTE. The 2017-specification Aston Martin Vantage had of weight deducted while Porsche had no performance changes. Testing A test day held on 2 June required all race entrants to participate in eight hours of driving divided into two sessions. Toyota led the morning session with a lap of 3 minutes, 21.875 seconds from Buemi. His teammate López was second and led until Buemi's lap. Gustavo Menezes' No. 3 Rebellion R13 car followed in third, with Vitaly Petrov and Stéphane Sarrazin's SMP Racing BR1 cars fourth and fifth. Filipe Albuquerque's No. 22 United Autosports Ligier car led in LMP2 with a 3 minutes, 32.245 seconds lap, ahead of Pastor Maldonado's No. 31 DragonSpeed, the Graff of Tristan Gommendy and Nyck de Vries' Racing Team Nederland Dallara P217 cars. Billy Johnson's No. 66 Ford led LMGTE Pro for most of the session until Antonio García's No. 63 Corvette overtook him. Francesco Castellacci's Spirit of Race Ferrari was the fastest car in LMGTE Am from Jeff Segal's JMW Motorsport Ferrari. Mechanical issues on Jordan King's No. 37 Jackie Chan DC Racing Oreca and Marco Sørensen's No. 95 Aston Martin and Paul-Loup Chatin's crash into a tyre barrier at Indianapolis corner disrupted the session. Buemi was fastest early in the second session with a lap of 3 minutes, 20.068 seconds, which he later improved to a 3 minutes, 19.440 seconds to lead all entries. Conway improved the No. 7 Toyota's best lap for second. The fastest non-hybrid LMP1 entry was André Lotterer's No. 1 Rebellion in third, followed by Stoffel Vandoorne's No. 11 SMP BR1 and Nathanaël Berthon's No. 3 Rebellion cars. With a time of 3 minutes, 28.504 seconds, Ho-Pin Tung improved the fastest time in LMP2, moving Jackie Chan past Maldonado and Nicolas Lapierre's No. 36 Signatech Alpine car. The No. 63 Corvette continued to lead in LMGTE Pro with a 3 minutes, 54.001 seconds lap from Mike Rockenfeller, three- hundredths of a second faster than Harry Tincknell's No. 66 Ford and Tommy Milner's No. 64 Corvette. Toni Vilander's No. 62 WeatherTech Ferrari was fastest in LMGTE Am.  Post-testing balance of performance changes  Following testing, the ACO again altered the LMP1 equivalence of technology. All normally aspirated cars had a maximum fuel level per stint of and a limit of for turbocharged cars. Toyota had a one-lap per stint advantage of fuel load from the 2018 race reinstated with pit stop fuel flow rate changes. The FIA changed the balance of performance to dictate all LMGTE vehicle to have a fuel tank larger than in testing. Practice A single, four-hour free practice session on 13 June was available to the teams and saw variable weather throughout as several cars spun. Vandoorne led from the final half hour before Kobayashi went fastest with a lap of 3 minutes, 18.091 seconds with less than two minutes left of practice. The Rebellion team was third with a lap from Menezes, Alonso was fourth and Bruno Senna's No. 1 car fifth. Four Oreca vehicles led in LMP2, with Chatin's IDEC entry ahead of Maldonado's No. 31 DragonSpeed and Jean-Éric Vergne's No. 26 G-Drive cars. Two Porsches led in LMGTE Pro; Christensen's No. 92 911 RSR was fastest with a lap of 3 minutes, 52.149 seconds. Mathieu Jaminet's No. 94 car was second and the fastest Ferrari was Sam Bird's third-placed No. 71 AF Corse car. Matt Campbell of the Dempsey-Proton team helped Porsche to be fastest in LMGTE Am ahead of Giancarlo Fisichella's Spirit of Race Ferrari and Pedro Lamy's No. 98 Aston Martin. Satoshi Hoshino slid through a gravel trap in the Porsche Curves and crashed the No. 88 Dempsey-Proton car against a barrier, which necessitated a full course yellow flag to recover it to the pit lane. Tracy Krohn had an accident in the sister No. 99 car on the Mulsanne Straight and stopped the session for ¾ of an hour to clear debris and repair a barrier. Krohn was transported to The Centre Hospitalier Du Mans for observation and FIA medical personnel advised him to desist from racing for one week. The No. 99 Dempsey- Proton Porsche was later withdrawn because the team did not wish to elevate the car to the LMGTE Pro class with Krohn's co-drivers Patrick Long and Niclas Jönsson as a duo. Qualifying The first qualifying session began late on Wednesday night under clear conditions and on a dry track. Toyota again led early on with a 3 minutes, 17.161 seconds lap from Kobayashi. The fastest two non-hybrid LMP1 vehicles were Egor Orudzhev's No. 17 SMP and Thomas Laurent's No. 3 Rebellion car in second and third. Alonso's No. 8 Toyota and Ben Hanley's No. 10 DragonSpeed car were fourth and fifth. Maldonado took provisional pole position for the DragonSpeed team in LMP2 with a 3 minutes, 26.804 seconds lap. Lapierre and Albuquerque were second and third in class. With 46 minutes to go, Roberto González spun the DragonSpeed car at the entry to the Ford Chicane. As he restarted the car to return to the pit lane, he and the left-hand side of Conway's unsighted Toyota collided, sending Conway airborne and over González's front bodywork. Both drivers were unhurt as debris littered the track. Repairs to the Toyota in the garage took 20 minutes to complete. Tincknell's No. 66 Ford led LMGTE Pro with a 3 minutes, 49.530 seconds time after a faster lap from García's No. 64 Corvette was disallowed because he improved it under yellow flag conditions. Nick Tandy's No. 93 Porsche was 0.028 seconds slower in second and Alex Lynn's No. 97 Aston Martin was third. The No. 66 Ford had an earlier excursion when driver Olivier Pla spun into the gravel trap at the exit to the Porsche Curves and hit a tyre barrier. Recovery vehicles extricated the car and Pla drove slowly to the pit lane. Porsches took the first three places in LMGTE Am, with Matteo Cairoli's No. 77 Dempsey-Proton vehicle fastest from Jörg Bergmeister's No. 56 Project 1 and Julien Andlauer's sister Dempsey-Proton cars. After the session, the No. 7 Toyota's monocoque was replaced due to a deep crack discovered during an inspection; Conway and González shared responsibility for the crash and the former incurred a suspended three-minute stop-and-go penalty. Kamui Kobayashi (pictured in 2010) took overall pole position in the No. 7 Toyota TS050 Hybrid. Thursday's first qualifying session saw faster lap times in every class. Kobayashi improved provisional pole position to a 3 minutes, 15.497 seconds lap and his teammate Nakajima moved to second. Mikhail Aleshin moved the No. 11 SMP car to third and Neel Jani set a lap that put the No. 1 Rebellion car fourth after its best time from the first session was deleted due to an incorrect fuel flow meter. Sarrazin could not improve and SMP's No. 17 car fell to fifth. Early in the session, Laurent's engine failed on the Mulsanne Straight and laid a large amount of oil on the track. The session was stopped for 20 minutes for track marshals to extricate the No. 3 Rebellion car from the side of the exit to Mulsanne corner and dry the oil. Maldonado improved his best lap to 3 minutes, 26.490 seconds to keep the DragonSpeed team ahead in LMP2. Jackie Chan's No. 38 car of Stéphane Richelmi went faster to go second and Lapierre fell to third after his electrical system was repaired. In LMGTE Pro, Christensen's lap of 3 minutes, 49.388 in the final ten minutes moved the No. 92 Porsche to the class lead. García moved the No. 63 Corvette to second as Ticknell fell to third. Cairoli and Bergmeister retained the first two positions in LMGTE Am as Fisichella moved the Spirit of Racing team to third place. As temperatures cooled in the final session, over half of the field improved their fastest laps, but Kobayashi's pole position lap went unchallenged. It was Toyota's third pole in a row at Le Mans since the 2017 race; Conway and Kobayashi's second and López's first. Orudzhev led the session with a 3 minutes and 16.159 seconds lap for third. Menezes took fourth and Vandoorne fifth. Senna's engine failed and he stopped at Arnage corner after an hour. In LMP2, Oreca cars took the first six positions as Gommendy gave the Graff team pole position with a 3 minutes, 25.073 seconds lap. Loïc Duval was 0.282 seconds slower in second as Maldonado fell to third. Porsche, and later Ford, led in LMGTE Pro before Sørensen earned the 2018 Aston Martin Vantage its second class pole with a 3 minutes, 48 seconds lap. Tincknell and García were second and third in class, respectively. Cairoli improved the No. 88 Dempsey-Proton Porsche's provisional pole lap in LMGTE Am to a 3 minutes, 51.439 seconds ahead of his teammate Campbell. Thomas Preining moved the No. 86 Gulf car to third in class. Lamy's No. 98 Aston Martin's got beached in a Mulsanne Straight chicane gravel trap and stopped the session for 25 minutes as it was extricated. Post-qualifying Following qualifying, the stewards deleted all of the Graff team's fastest lap times from the third session after driver Vincent Capillaire failed to stop at the scrutineering stand at the entry to the pit lane for a weight check. The team incurred a €1000 fine and fell from pole position to 14th in LMP2, elevating the IDEC squad to the class pole and the Signatech team to second place. The ACO altered the balance of performance in both of the LMGTE categories. The Aston Martin's turbocharger boost was reduced and its fuel capacity lowered by to reduce its performance. Every car bar the Chevrolet Corvette received a weight decrease of . In LMGTE Am Porsche had of ballast added to their cars and the same amount removed from the Fords. The Ferrari and Aston Martin LMGTE Am cars had no performance changes. Qualifying results Pole positions in each class are denoted in bold.

61 -class=\\"sortbottom\\" colspan=\\"10\\" - } Warm-up A 45-minute warm-up session on Saturday morning took place in dry and sunny weather. Kobayashi set the fastest lap late on at 3 minutes, 19.647 seconds with his teammate Buemi in second. Laurent's No. 3 Rebellion was the fastest non-hybrid LMP1 car in third. SMP's two cars of Petrov and Sarrazin were fourth and fifth. Vergne recorded the fastest LMP2 lap at 3 minutes, 28.763 seconds, which was 1.4 seconds faster than Duval. Estre's No. 92 Porsche was the quickest car in LMGTE Pro while Ben Barker helped the marque to be fastest in LMGTE Am. While the session passed without a major incident, a brief full course yellow flag procedure was used to clear debris on the circuit. Race Start and opening hours The weather was dry and sunny before the race; the air temperature was between and the track temperature . Approximately 252,500 spectators attended the event. The French tricolour was waved at 15:00 Central European Summer Time (UTC+02:00) by Charlene, Princess of Monaco to start the race, led by the starting pole sitter Conway. Menezes overtook Buemi and Petrov to move into second place on the first lap and held it until Buemi demoted him to third soon after. Conway reset the race track lap record on the fourth lap with a 3 minutes, 17.297 seconds time to lead his teammate Buemi by 15.5 seconds. At the close of the hour, García, in Corvette's No. 63 car, took the lead of LMGTE Pro from Nicki Thiim's No. 95 Aston Martin on the inside before Indianapolis corner, as Lapierre and Fisichella moved to the front of LMP2 and LMGTE Am on pit stop rotation respectively. Senna's No. 1 Rebellion was forced to drive slowly to the pit lane to replace a puncture and the car fell down the race order. In the second hour, Conway continued to pull away from his teammate Buemi. Vergne ran in clear air to be less than a second behind Lapierre's LMP2 leading No. 36 Signatech car. Spirit of Race's No. 54 Ferrari, now driven by Thomas Flohr in lieu of Fisichella, relinquished its lead of LMGTE Am to Andlauer's No. 77 Dempsey-Proton Porsche and was behind Jeroen Bleekemolen's No. 85 Keating Ford after a second sequence of pit stops. A full course yellow flag was activated 3 hours, 42 minutes in after the left-front tyre was punctured on de Vries' Racing Team Nederland Dallara car. This moved González's No. 31 DragonSpeed vehicle to third in LMP2 which he later lost to King's No. 37 Jackie Chan car at Mulsanne Corner. Job van Uitert's G-Drive entry, which had taken the lead of LMP2 from Lapierre's Signatech car, incurred a ten-second stop-and-go penalty taken at its next pit stop because his co-driver Vergne was observed speeding during the full course yellow flag. Van Uitert recovered the lost time he had lost in the pit lane and retook the lead from the Signatech car, now driven by Pierre Thiriet, into the first Mulsanne Straight chicane. The No. 64 Chevrolet Corvette C7.R retired after contact with the No. 88 Dempsey-Proton Porsche 911 RSR The LMGTE Pro class lead became a multi-car battle between representatives of four of the five manufacturers, with the first five positions separated by less than ten seconds. During the fifth hour, Berthon's No. 3 car fell behind the SMP duo of Aleshin and Sergey Sirotkin because of a two-minute pit stop. Further down the field, Daniel Serra's No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari passed Rockenfeller's LMGTE Pro class-leading No. 63 Corvette. Porsche sought to conserve tyre wear and fuel usage rather than challenge for the lead in LMGTE Pro, promoting Laurens Vanthoor's No. 92 Porsche to the class lead from Serra on pit stop strategy. Felipe Fraga's No. 85 Keating car overtook Christian Ried's No. 77 Dempsey- Proton Porsche to lead LMGTE Am. Not long after, John Farano crashed the No. 43 RLR MSport car at Tetre Rouge corner and the safety cars were deployed to slow the race. When racing resumed, André Negrão's Signatech car overtook Roman Rusinov's G-Drive car into the second Mulsanne Straight chicane for the LMP2 lead. Serra duelled Vanthoor and retook the lead of LMGTE Pro into Indianapolis corner. Earl Bamber moved the No. 93 Porsche past Rockenfeller for third in class. Shortly after, the right-rear corner of Marcel Fässler's No. 64 Corvette and the left-front corner of Satoshi Hoshino's No. 88 Dempsey- Proton Porsche made contact in slower traffic in the Porsche Curves. Fässler veered into an outside concrete barrier and his car was retired due to heavy damage. Hoshino brought his car into the garage for repairs to its front but it was later retired for safety reasons. Fässler was unhurt and FIA personnel performed a precautionary CT scan on him at the circuit's medical centre. The safety cars were required once again as track marshals worked for 16 minutes to clear debris. As the safety cars were recalled, the gap to López and Nakajima had fallen to ten seconds and Bleekemolen had extended the lead over Jeff Segal's No. 84 JMW Ferrari in LMGTE Am to three minutes. Sunset to night At the start of the seventh hour, Laurent's No. 3 Rebellion overtook Aleshin's No. 11 SMP car on the outside in the Porsche Curves for third. Light rain began to fall soon after, cathcing out Laurent who spun after braking for the second Mulsanne Straight chicane and veered right into a barrier. The impact removed the front bodywork from the No. 3 Rebellion and a small chunk landed on the No. 11 SMP vehicle. The accident led to a third safety car intervention to clear debris, during which repairs to the No. 3 Rebellion car took 3 minutes, 38 seconds, later rejoining in fifth position, behind the SMP entries. After racing resumed, López used slower traffic through the second Mulsanne Straight chicane to pass his teammate Nakajima for the overall lead. The lead of LMGTE Pro changed to Estre's No. 92 Porsche from Alessandro Pier Guidi's No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari after a sequence of pit stops. In LMP2, Vergne used his newer tyres to reclaim the lead of the class from Negrão into Indianapolis corner. López was forced to relinquish the overall lead to Nakajima in the eighth hour when he ran wide into the Mulsanne corner gravel trap. García's No. 63 Corvette took second place in LMGTE Pro with successive passes on Tincknell's No. 67 Ford and Per Guidi's No. 51 Ferrari on the outside at Indianapolis corner. Conway's No. 7 Toyota retook the race lead from Buemi's No. 8 after pit stops. James Calado moved the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari past Christensen's No. 92 Porsche for the LMGTE Pro lead during the ninth hour. Wei Lu lost control of the No. 84 JMW Ferrari at the second Mulsanne Straight chicane but continued without losing second position in LMGTE Am. During hour ten, Lynn damaged the No. 97 Aston Martin's spoiler in the Porsche Curves and a local slow zone was employed to check for damage to the barriers. Lynn returned to the pit lane and the car rejoined the race after half an hour of repairs. Not long after, Sørensen's No. 95 Aston Martin spun across a gravel trap and sustained heavy rear-end damage in an impact against the barrier at Indianapolis turn. Safety cars were required for the fourth time and caused the lead of multiple classes to grow. Conway increased his lead over Buemi to more than a minute and Van Uitert's G-Drive car was 1 minute, 21 seconds ahead of Thiriet's Signatech entry. The safety cars separated the LMGTE Pro field, leaving the No. 51 Ferrari and the No. 92 Porsche one minute ahead of the No. 93 Porsche, which passed the No. 63 Corvette for third in class. Orudzhev's third-placed SMP BR1 lost control on the exit to the Porsche Curves and crashed rearward into an outside tyre barrier at high speed. He was unhurt; the accident necessitated the car's retirement and a fifth safety car period. During the slow period, Conway relinquished the lead to his teammate Buemi because he made a pit stop and was required to stop at the exit of the pit lane until the nearest safety car passed by. After the safety cars were withdrawn, Berthon's No. 3 Rebellion vehicle took third overall, while the lead of LMGTE Pro switched from Serra's No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari to Vanthoor's No. 92 Porsche. As the race approached its halfway point, Kobayashi relieved Conway in the No. 7 Toyota and a faster pit stop than Buemi returned him to the overall lead. Henning Enqvist went wide at Indianapolis corner and crashed the No. 49 ARC Bratislava Ligier car against a tyre barrier. The car was extricated from a gravel trap by a crane before he crashed for a second time, against an outside barrier entering the Porsche Curves. The damage to the car's front-right bodywork forced its retirement and the sixth deployment of the safety cars until the close of the 12th hour. When racing resumed, the two Toyota cars were less than two seconds from each other and Estre's lead over Serra in LMGTE Pro fell to 2.2 seconds. The No. 92 Porsche subsequently entered the garage for repairs to a defective exhaust system and a change of brakes. Repairs took 20 minutes to complete and Estre resumed in ninth position in LMGTE Pro. Serra's No. 51 Ferrari retook the lead of LMGTE Pro 90 seconds ahead of the No. 93 and No. 91 Porsches of Tandy and Bruni. The No. 4 ByKolles CLM P1/01 car of Tom Dillmann stopped after Arnage corner with a broken gear selection mechanism that necessitated its retirement, requiring a slow zone extending to the exit of the Porsche Curves as the car was extricated by recovery vehicles to behind a trackside wall. Kobayashi increased the No. 7 Toyota's lead over Alonso to more than a minute due to minor underbody damage to the No. 8 car. The two lead Porsche cars in LMGTE Pro drew to near half a minute behind Pier Guidi's Ferrari. Morning to early afternoon In the early morning, some LMGTE cars took the opportunity to change brake discs to ensure that they completed the race. Michael Wainwright crashed the No. 86 Gulf Porsche against a wall at Indianapolis corner and Sergio Pianezzola's No. 60 Kessel Racing Ferrari got beached in a gravel trap in the Porsche Curves at the same time. Both incidents promoted the activation of a full course yellow flag procedure. Recovery by track marshals allowed both cars to return to the race. Kobayashi and later López extended the lead over their teammates Alonso and then Buemi to 1 minute and 20 seconds. Calado's LMGTE Pro leading No. 51 car made a scheduled pit stop and ceded the class lead to Lietz's No. 91 Porsche as Serra relieved him. Not long after, Maldonado lost control of DragonSpeed's No. 31 car leaving Tetre Rouge corner and hit a barrier frontward. Maldonado was unhurt but the damage to the car necessitated its retirement. The safety cars were deployed for more than half an hour. Serra was able to retake the lead of LMGTE Pro with a one-minute lead because the three cars ahead of him made pit stops and were required to stop at the exit of the pit lane. The No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari 488 GTE Evo won in LMGTE Pro on the 70th anniversary of Ferrari's first outright Le Mans win After the safety cars were withdrawn, Ben Keating's Ford ran into a gravel trap at the first Mulsanne Straight chicane, from which he escaped without damage to the car and retained the lead of LMGTE Am. Menezes' No. 3 Rebellion car incurred a three-minute stop-and-go penalty for a procedural error on the team's usage of tyre compounds, promoting Vandoorne's No. 11 SMP car to third overall. Just after Menezes rejoined the race, he spun into a gravel trap in the Porsche Curves and returned to the garage after vehicular assistance. 17 hours and 25 minutes in, Tung's No. 38 Jackie Chan car slowed with a puncture and returned to the pit lane to retain third position in LMP2 from François Perrodo's No. 28 TDS car. The G-Drive team continued to lead in LMP2 until Rusinov relinquished the position it had held for 171 consecutive laps to the Signatech car, when he could not start the car due to a starter motor problem that required the removal of the rear bodywork covering its engine. The team lost 20 minutes in the garage and four laps to fall to seventh in class. Two lengthy pit stops to rectify braking issues on Berthon's No. 3 Rebellion car dropped him to sixth and elevated the LMP2 leading Signatech car of Lapierre to fifth overall. In LMGTE Pro, diverging strategies for AF Corse's No. 51 Ferrari and the No. 63 Corvette created a difference of around five laps between both cars and changed the category lead several times. De Vries' Racing Team Nederland Dallara car had a straightline crash against a barrier on the entry to Indianapolis corner due to a possible broken right-front suspension arm. It damaged the car's front bodywork and de Vries required repairs in the garage. The safety cars were deployed for the eighth time as track marshals took 25 minutes to clear debris. In LMGTE Pro, the safety cars had again separated the field, leaving Calado's No. 51 Ferrari three minutes ahead of Jan Magnussen's No. 63 Corvette after the latter made a pit stop and had to stop at the exit to the pit lane. After the safety cars were recalled, Magnussen spun and damaged the left-front corner of his car in the Porsche Curves. Repairs in the garage lasted six minutes and he returned to the circuit eighth in LMGTE Pro. The crash elevated the No. 91 and No. 93 Porsche cars of Lietz and Tandy to second and third in class and provided Calado with a 1 minute lead. Finish The No. 7 Toyota TS050 Hybrid was forced to give up the race victory due to an incorrect wired antenna on its tyre pressure sensor system Almost 23 hours into the event, the race leading No. 7 Toyota of López slowed on course due to a wiring fault with the antenna on the car's tyre pressure sensor system, which indicated to the team that it had a front-right puncture. As it occurred late on the track, he was able to make a pit stop; Toyota switched only one tyre to lessen the time lost in the pit lane. Lopez rejoined the track ahead of Nakajima's No. 8 car. However, the sensors on his car continued to notify Toyota that its front- right tyre was punctured, prompting the team to ask an tyre engineer from Michelin, to check its pressure; no issues were discovered. López yielded the lead that the No. 7 car had held for 191 consecutive laps to Nakajima. Toyota had discussed and decided against invoking team orders to switch the positions of both vehicles. López entered the pit lane for a second time to replace all four tyres. It transpired that the left-rear tyre was the punctured wheel. Nakajima achieved victory for the No. 8 Toyota, completing 385 laps, 16.972 seconds ahead of the No. 7 car. SMP, unable to equal Toyota's pace, were six laps behind in third position with its No. 11 car. The Rebellion team were fourth and fifth with the No. 1 and No. 3 entries. It was Alonso, Buemi, Nakajima and Toyota's second successive Le Mans win. The trio won the LMP Drivers' Championship; it was Buemi's second endurance championship since 2014, Alonso's third motor racing world championship and Nakajima became the first Japanese driver to win an FIA-sanctioned world title. Signatech's Lapierre, Negrão and Thiriet was unchallenged for the rest of the race to win in LMP2, earning the team and drivers the LMP2 Championships and Lapierre his fourth class win. The No. 38 Jackie Chan car finished 2 minutes, 22 seconds later in second position and the TDS team were third. On the 70th anniversary of Ferrari's first overall Le Mans victory, AF Corse won in LMGTE Pro, giving Calado and Guidi their first class victories and Serra's second. The car finished 49 seconds ahead of Porsche's No. 91 entry and its No. 93 car took third in class. Porsche's Christensen and Estre finished tenth in class to win the GTE World Drivers' Championship. The Keating Ford of Bleekemoen, Felipe Fraga and Ben Keating led for 273 consecutive laps in LMGTE Am to finish first in the category. Project 1's Bergmeister, Patrick Lindsey and Egidio Perfetti followed 44 seconds later to finish second in class and win the Endurance Trophy for LMGTE Am Drivers and Teams. JMW's Ferrari completed the class podium in third. There were eleven outright lead changes amongst two cars during the race. The No. 7 Toyota's 339 laps led was the most of any car. The No. 8 Toyota led six times for a total of 46 laps. Post-race The top three teams in each of the four classes appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and spoke to the media in a later press conference. Alonso and Buemi agreed that the No. 7 crew deserved to win the race. Buemi added, \\"I was really happy to finish second but what happened to them is really hard. When [the mechanical issues] happened to me and Kazuki in ’16, it was really hard too. I am really sorry for them. It’s motorsport.\\" Alonso likened the No. 7 car's issue to its lost win on the final lap in and him finishing second in the Formula One World Championship three times, \\"When you arrive at the last moment and you are unable to finish the job, you feel bad and I feel sad. I feel for my teammates because they are not only teammates but friends as well. They deserve it today.” López said that he was emotional driving to the pit lane to replace the Toyota's supposed puncture and that it was painful. The No. 85 Keating Motorsports Ford GT was disqualified from the race results and lost its LMGTE Am class victory due to an oversized fuel tank. One day after the event, the FIA imposed a penalty of 55.2 seconds on the LMGTE Am winning No. 85 Keating Ford for transgressing a regulation that dictated the minimum refuelling time at a pit stop be no less than 45 seconds. ACO scrutineers discovered that the car's refuelling pit stops were completed in 44.4 seconds, with a discrepancy of six-tenths of a second multiplied by its 23 pit stops, and further multiplied by four to give a number of 55.2 seconds. The car was later disqualified because its fuel tank was discovered to be more than the LMGTE Am maximum mandated capacity of . Keating Motorsports did not appeal the disqualification. The No. 59 Project 1 Porsche was promoted to the class victory, the No. 84 JMW Ferrari to second and the No. 62 WeatherTech Ferrari to third. Keating stated that a rubber bladder inside a fuel cell expanded by during the race and the team's refuelling rig was made more efficient by six- tenths of a second. The stewards deemed Fässler responsible for the accident between the No. 64 Corvette and the No. 88 Dempsey-Proton Porsche in the Porsche Curves and issued a fine of €7,000 and six penalty points were added to his race licence. His co-driver, Oliver Gavin, said that Hoshino put Fässler in a position to hit the barrier by unexpectedly changing his direction after allowing faster cars to pass him and called for such manoeuvres to be reviewed. Vergne said he felt disappointed due to his car's unreliability and noted that made the race interesting. Estre stated his belief that the No. 92 Porsche team could have challenged for the victory in LMGTE Pro had car issues not intervened. The role of the safety cars affecting LMGTE Pro received a mixed response. Andy Priaulx of the Ford team stated that the safety cars should have been used to close up the field, \\"If you’ve just pitted, which we needed to pit, it just messes it up so much. It just neutralizes the race and then you end up with this huge separation. For the second year in a row, it’s kind of taken away the spectacle at the end.\\" Lietz stated his belief that all of the safety car periods were correctly deployed for safety reasons. The Corvette Racing team manager, Ben Johnson, said he was unsure why some safety car periods were deployed in lieu of full course yellow flags to slow the race and called for clarity on when to use the procedure. Alonso, Buemi and Nakajima took the LMP Drivers' Championship with 198 points. They were 41 points ahead of their teammates Conway, Kobayashi and López in second position. Laurent and Menezes followed in third place with 114 points, ahead of Aleshin and Petrov in fourth with 94 points and Neel Jani and Lotterer in fifth with 91 points. With 155 points, Estre and Christensen won the GTE Drivers' Championship, 18 ahead of Calado and Pier Guidi in second. Bruni and Lietz followed in third position with 131 points and Tincknell and Priaulx were fourth with 90 points.

It was mounted to the front of a vehicle and used heat to prematurely detonate any hidden improvised explosive devices (IEDs) while the vehicle was at a safe distance away from the blast. It was developed by the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) in 2006 during the war in Iraq to counter the rise of IED-related deaths.  Inspiration  During the Iraq War, the rising number of troops killed and wounded by underbelly IEDs buried by insurgents in the middle of the road prompted the U.S. military to funnel billions of dollars into the development of several countermeasures to either detect the explosive or minimize the damage. However, the frequent delays in producing and delivering these countermeasures to Iraq lead to shortages in effective IED-defeating technology. As a result, several soldiers on the battlefield ended up improvising their own solutions that took advantage of how the passive infrared sensors on the IEDs reacted to heat signatures. One unnamed soldier proposed mounting a large hair dryer to the front of the vehicle to blow hot air on the road to prematurely set off any hidden IEDs and clear the path. Another soldier supposedly purchased a toaster at a bazaar, plugged the appliance into his Humvee, and attached it to the end of a long pole that was welded to the front of the vehicle. These and other similar ideas led JIEDDO to develop Rhino in 2006, one of their earliest innovations. The initial design consisted of a glow plug that was placed inside a metal ammunition can, which was then attached to a 10 ft long metal pole with the other end mounted onto the front of a vehicle. The glow plug acted as a heat decoy, which triggered any nearby IED’s infrared sensor prematurely and fired the copper explosively formed penetrator (EFP) slug at the Rhino instead of the vehicle behind it. The countermeasure proved to be a success at the time as U.S. forces found that the Rhino could not only take the impact of an EFP but also, in rare cases, continue working afterwards.  Changes  Despite the favorable outcome of the Rhino’s initial run, insurgents soon began making modifications to the IEDs to account for this countermeasure. Within six weeks, the aim of the EFP was adjusted so that the slug was fired 10 feet back from the Rhino to hit the vehicle. In response, JIEDDO and researchers at the Army Research Laboratory in Adelphi, Maryland designed and developed the Rhino II, which came with a telescoping pole whose length could be adjusted to change the position of the heat decoy. More than 16,000 Rhino II devices were deployed to the U.S. Army and Marines in Iraq by the end of 2008, costing around $1,800 each to produce. Before long, the Rhino II was featured on almost every U.S. vehicle in Iraq. However, by 2010, newer IEDs began to use high-powered radio waves from coalition jammers instead of heat signatures to set of the EFP as a countermeasure against Rhino II. Currently, more than 34,000 Rhino gadgets have been deployed to U.S. troops overseas.

He began his career playing semi-professional football for Northwich Victoria and New Mills in the Northern Premier League. He won the Cheshire Senior Cup with Northwich in 2011, scoring both goals in the final. He joined Southport in 2013 and established himself in the Conference Premier with 80 league appearances in two seasons, also winning three caps for the England C team. He signed with Macclesfield Town in September 2015 and soon established himself in the first-team, helping the club to reach the 2017 FA Trophy final. He played all 46 league games of the 2017–18 National League title winning campaign and made his debut in the English Football League the next season at the age of 28. He signed with Port Vale in August 2020. Club career Early career Born in Manchester, Fitzpatrick started his career at Stockport County before joining Northern Premier League Premier Division side Northwich Victoria in November 2010. Having made over 30 appearances for the club over the course of the 2010–11 season, scoring five goals, he signed a new contract at the end of the season. He scored both of Northwich's goals in their 2–0 victory over Altrincham in the Cheshire Senior Cup final. As a result of a lack of first-team action, Fitzpatrick was released by Victoria in October 2011 in order to join Northern Premier League Division One South side New Mills. Fitzpatrick made ten appearances for New Mills, scoring four goals, before rejoining Northwich Victoria on 23 December 2011. Northwich finished the 2011–12 season in second place but were actually relegated due to financial issues. In the summer of 2012, Fitzpatrick rejoined New Mills on a permanent basis. The \\"Millers\\" finished third in the 2012–13 campaign, but lost out to Trafford in the play-off semi-finals. Whilst playing in the Northern Premier League he also turned out for Altrincham Sunday League pub side Brookland's Tap and worked a full-time job in Human Resources for a claims company. Southport After an impressive season at New Mills, he joined Alan Wright's Southport on 28 July 2013. In Fitzpatrick's first season in the Conference Premier, he made 46 appearances and scored his only goal on the last day of the 2013–14 season, \\"a stunning 30-yard strike\\" in a 2–1 win over FC Halifax Town at Haig Avenue, won him the club's Goal of the Season award. His second season at the club saw him make 37 league appearances under three different managers: Martin Foyle, Gary Brabin and Paul Carden. Macclesfield Town Following trial periods at Crawley Town and Stevenage, Fitzpatrick joined Macclesfield Town in September 2015 on a four-month contract. In January 2016, his contract with the club was extended until the end of the season. After making 37 appearances for Macclesfield during the 2015–16 season, with Fitzpatrick praised for his performances, he signed a one-year contract extension at the end of the season. The 2016–17 campaign saw Fitzpatrick make 37 league appearances, whilst he also played in the 2017 FA Trophy final at Wembley Stadium, where Macclesfield lost 3–2 to York City. He signed another one-year contract extension in the summer. The 2017–18 season was another successful season for Fitzpatrick as he appeared in every one of Macclesfield's 46 league matches as the club finished top of the National League, and were promoted to League Two, with Fitzpatrick signing a new two- year contract with Macclesfield Town as a result. He was also named in the Non-League Paper's National League Team of the Season, alongside teammate Danny Whitaker and manager John Askey. On 4 August 2018, he made his first appearance in the English Football League (EFL) in a 3–2 defeat to Swindon Town, before going on to make 40 appearances, scoring thrice in a season where Macclesfield would marginally survive relegation, finishing 22nd. The 2019–20 season saw Fitzpatrick make 21 appearances without scoring as Macclesfield would survive relation despite a points deduction as a result of Bury's expulsion from the Football League, with the \\"Silkmen\\" eventually finishing 23rd. Fitzpatrick accused the EFL of unfairly treating the club as they were deducted a total of 13 points, whilst the League Two campaign was ended early due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England. However on 11 August, the EFL won an appeal to an independent arbitration panel to deduct a further four points from Macclesfield, relegating the club into the National League and handing a reprieve to Stevenage. He was released at the end of the 2019–20 season. Port Vale On 25 August 2020, Fitzpatrick signed a one-year contract with Port Vale after impressing on trial. He said the decision to sign up was \\"a no-brainer really\\" as he previously worked well with former Macclesfield manager John Askey and players such as Danny Whitehead. International career On 19 November 2013, Fitzpatrick made his debut for the England C team in a 2–2 draw with Czech Republic U21. He won further caps against Slovakia U23 and Hungary in May 2014.

Developed between 1903 and 1914, it is a good example of industrial development of the period. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The American Mills Web Shop is located in West Haven's northeastern Allingtown section, extending east and south at the junction of Front Street and Orange Avenue (United States Route 1). The principal elements of the complex are a large weave shed, a single story structure extending along Front Street, and the administrative building, which faces Orange Avenue and is two stories in height. A smokestack and boiler room are located behind these buildings; a more extensive set of outbuildings once also occupied the roughly parcel, but have been demolished. The weave shed has a particularly well- preserved sawtooth roof, a period innovation that brought daylight to the interiors of large industrial spaces. With The complex was begun in 1903 by the Narrow Fabrics Company, which specialized in manufacturing elastic fabrics used in applications such as industrial machine belts, zipper backings, brake linings, and automotive safety belts. The company grew rapidly, enlarging the plant substantially in 1909 and 1914. In 1914, a series of corporate mergers was accompanied by a name change to the American Mills Web Company. It remained in operation until 1970, and underwent rehabilitation for other uses in the early 1980s.

The video for \\"Chaos and Earthquakes\\" was shown in early August 2018, followed by a United States tour with American rock bands He Is Legend and Letters from the Fire to promote the album.  Critical reception  Regarding lead song \\"Empty Batteries\\", Ray Van Horn of Blabbermouth.net states, \\"Though the track offers little new other than the usual melodic proto core NONPOINT have long served to its fans, there's urgency to the strumming and the song's dense projection.

The former hinges on clobbering chugs and quick-strike drum fills while the former moves freely against a steady beat and circular guitar melodies.' Jedd Beaudoin of Popmatters describes \\"Chaos and Earthquakes\\" as \\"a state of the personal union, a call to perseverance despite knowing that you stand on the precipice of utter destruction\\".

Since 1950s it is the largest North American manufacturer of prefabricated cedar homes. In the 1960s it was the largest US manufacturer of A-frame houses. The company operates as a third-generation, family-owned private company.  History  Lindal Cedar Homes was established by Sir Walter Lindal in the end of 1944 in Toronto, Canada as Colonial Homes. Lindal studied architecture at the University of Ottawa and sold lumber before World War II. During the war he served in the Canadian Army Corps of Engineers and became interested in prefabricated housing. Lindal originally picked Toronto as it was at that time Canada's fastest growing city. In 1962, the company built a sawmill outside Vancouver, British Columbia, next moved to Tacoma and finally settled in Seattle in 1971. Since 1950s it is the largest North American manufacturer of prefabricated cedar homes. In the mid 60s, after relocating to Tacoma, the company entered the A-frame houses market. In 1965 it developed a patented low-cost A-frame house that made it market leader in this segment. In 1971, Lindal Cedar became a public company in and traded on NYCE until March 2001, when the family bought the company out. In 1973, the firm established a Japanese subsidiary, Lindal Cedar Homes K.K. It had, however, limited success in Japan selling only 50 or 60 houses a year in the early 90s. In 1983, the company bought Justus, a US prefabricated homes company established in 1954, and added Justus designs to its product line. Around the same time, in 1982, it has discontinued its A-frame business. In 1999 the company had 180 showroom dealers. The company has experienced hard times due mainly to the rising price of western red cedar from Canada. It has been losing money since 1997 and had to cut costs, sold a sawmill in British Columbia and launched new lines of cheaper precut homes. Walter Lindal died in 2011. In November 2018, the company sold its office grounds in Seattle, located in an A-frame building near Interstate 5, a move that the company's CEO Bob Lindal explained as a necessary step forward for the company. \\"We can no longer justify for ourselves or our international network of independent dealers to build a model home on the side of a freeway,\\" he said.  Building Method  Lindal Cedar Homes relies on traditional post-and-beam construction while using architectural-grade glulam posts and beams for added stability and endurance. It is suitable for green building.  Design  In 2003, Lindal Cedar Homes partnered with the architect Michael Graves to produce Michael Graves Pavilion, a set of 3 low-cost pavilions distributed through Target. In 2004, it hired architect Jim Cutler, an architect behind Bill Gates's house, to design two floor Reflection Home Series. In 2009, Lindal Cedar Homes, was selected as a production company for three prefab houses designed by Marmol Radziner and Turkel Design for Dwell Homes. These houses were included into The Green Design 100 list compiled by TIME. In 2012, a Gambier Island house from this collection designed by Joel Turkel of Turkel Design won Best in American Living Awards from the National Association of Home Builders. In 2011, the company delivered a custom-designed 7,500 square-foot house in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, their largest ever. In 2013, Lindal Cedar introduced the Lindal Architects Collaborative, hiring 8 architectural firms (including Altius Architects, Bates Masi + Architects, Carney Logan Burke Architects, David Vandervort Architects, Dowling Studios, the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture, Marmol Radziner and ZeroEnergy Design) to design houses using post-and-beam structure. As of 2014, the company had more than 3000 home designs.

The film stars Seána Kerslake, James Cosmo, Kati Outinen, Simone Kirby, Steve Wall and James Quinn Markey. The story follows a young woman who begins to suspect that her son's disturbing behavior is linked to a mysterious sinkhole. The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on 25 January 2019. It was released on 1 March 2019, by Wildcard Distribution in Ireland and by Vertigo Releasing in the United Kingdom. Plot Sarah and her son Chris move to the Irish countryside to start a new life in a rented house next to an old forest, after leaving Chris's father. While driving, Sarah almost hits an old woman named Noreen standing in the middle of the road, causing the car's sideview mirror to break and fall off. When she exits the car to retrieve the mirror, Sarah notices Noreen whispering to herself before she turns to stare at Chris in silence. After returning home, Chris becomes frightened by a spider and Sarah catches it in a jar. Outside, Chris asks her why they came here without his father, and says that his father would have killed the spider instead of releasing it. An upset Sarah releases the spider from the jar and Chris stamps on it before running away from her and into the forest. Sarah follows Chris, but is unable to catch him. She starts to get worried and eventually comes upon a large sinkhole in the middle of the forest. Believing that her son might be hurt, she turns around in a panic and discovers Chris standing behind her. At a dinner party with friends that evening, Sarah discovers that one of her friends was in the same class with Noreen's son James when the pair were children. Her friend says that Noreen once burst into the classroom screaming before being restrained and taken to the principal's office before the police arrived. James was consequently taken out of school, and a few months later, murdered by Noreen after she ran him over. Later that night, Sarah awakens to sounds downstairs. She discovers that the door is open, and flees into the forest, believing Chris has run away. After returning home, she calls the police, only to discover Chris standing in the doorway of his bedroom. Sarah visits a doctor the next day and is prescribed anxiety medication. While driving Chris home from school, Sarah comes across Noreen, who is standing in the middle of the road again. Sarah exits the car and asks her to move, before meeting Noreen's kindly husband Des. The two talk, while Noreen approaches the car. She notices Chris and becomes enraged, screaming that he is not Sarah's son while hitting the window with her head. Des pulls her away, and Sarah drives home in shock. Sarah visits the couple's house the day after, and discovers Noreen has been mysteriously murdered in a gruesome way, having her head buried in the dirt. Sarah attends Noreen's funeral, and notices that all the mirrors in Noreen’s house are covered with black cloths. Des explains to Sarah that Noreen believed their son James was an imposter; she could apparently tell by looking at James’s reflection in a mirror, and the habit soon became an obsession. Sarah asks what happened to James, and Des contradicts her friend when he replies that he was hit by his car after he didn't see James dart into the road. Sarah and Chris's relationship begins to fracture; Chris suddenly develops a fondness for spaghetti bolognese, a dish he previously hated, and when Sarah confronts him about finding his toy soldier in the forest during a run, he grows enraged and pushes the dinner table towards her in an uncharacteristic display of strength. Sarah hears strange noises whilst bathing one night and later observes Chris catching and eating spiders in his bedroom. The next day, she visits the doctor who tells her that everything is normal. Despite this, she is convinced Chris isn't himself. Sarah and Chris sit down for breakfast after she finishes the task of wallpapering the house. While Chris is eating, Sarah tells him that she loves him, and Chris begins to touch her face. When his fingers touch the scar on her forehead, he suddenly digs them into her skin. Sarah wakes up, and realises it was a nightmare. She watches Chris perform in the school talent show. During his verse, Chris zones in on Sarah and begins to speak his lines in an emotionless voice. Sarah then flees from the hall, and later from Chris when he is walked back to her by a teacher. Sarah hides a camera in her son's room in an effort to monitor Chris' nighttime behavior, and after watching the footage she becomes more convinced than ever that he is not her real son. She takes the camera over to Des’s house to show him the evidence. However, when she does, he becomes enraged and throws the camera at the floor. Confronting him, Sarah asks Des to tell her if he truly doesn't believe her, to which Des replies that he can't. Eventually, Sarah ascertains that Chris is a changeling. While Chris watches television, she says they're going to play one of their favourite games - in which Sarah counts to three, and then they both pull faces. But after she counts, Chris just stares at her blankly. Sarah then tells him that he is not her son while being backed into the kitchen by Chris. The changeling snaps, and begins to throw her across the kitchen repeatedly. An injured Sarah later wakes in the garden, where Chris is shown digging a hole, before he drags her over and begins to bury her headfirst in the same manner as Noreen. He then falls asleep (having been drugged by Sarah, with the medication she got from the doctor) and Sarah frees herself. She drags Chris to the house's basement and finds the broken car mirror. Placing it to the side of Chris, he is shown to be a demonic entity. He begins to revive and after a minor scuffle, Sarah locks him in the basement and flees to the forest's sinkhole. Sarah eventually finds the real still-alive Chris buried deep in the ground. As the two escape, she is followed by a changeling in the form of a monster. As they reach the end of the tunnel, Sarah sees the changeling's hand on her wrist and frantically hits it with the torch. The hand suddenly turns to human flesh, and Sarah shines the light down the tunnel to see that the monster has taken her form. Sarah and Chris return to the house, and Sarah enters to retrieve the car keys before setting the house on fire with the changeling that was Chris still inside. She and the real Chris drive away to start a new life back in the city; Sarah begins to attend university, and Chris happily settles into their new house. But one day, while Chris is playing on his bike outside, Sarah takes some pictures of him through the window. Viewing the pictures, she sees that Chris's face is very blurry compared to the rest of the image. The final shot shows that Sarah has covered the walls of the living room in mirrors.

In 2013 the club had 1,012 members.  History   From the Kreisklasse to the Oberliga and East German cup winners  SV Stahl Thale, then known as BSG EHW Thale, started playing in the Kreisklasse Quedlinburg in 1946, won the Bezirksklasse West in the 1948–49 season and achieved promotion to the DDR- Oberliga in 1950 after a 3–1 final win against BSG Hydrierwerk Zeitz and reaching third place in the promotion play-off round. They were also successful in the FDGB-Pokal, the East German cup, that year, beating BSG Finow 14–1, ZSG Schuhmetro Weißenfels 2–1 and BSG Märkische Volksstimme Babelsberg 3–2 to reach the final on 3 September 1950 at the Walter-Ulbricht- Stadion in East Berlin, where they beat fourth-placed Oberliga team BSG KWU Erfurt 4–0 in front of a crowd of 15,000 to clinch their first and only East German cup title. Thale started into their first Oberliga season in 1950–51 with the same successful team. At the end of the season, the club came in seventh with 17 wins from 34 matches and were the best promoted team of the season. Striker Werner Oberländer was the third-best goal scorer of the season with 31 goals. After a weaker 1951–52 season, where the club placed 13th out of 19 teams, they reached their best Oberliga result, placing fifth in the 1952–53 season. In the 1953–54 season, however, with only four wins and the worst goal difference of all teams with 28:59, Thale placed last and was relegated to the DDR-Liga.  Football between the second and third tiers  In the 1954–55 season, Thale was unlucky in that the DDR-Liga was reduced from three divisions to one. Since their seventh place was not sufficient for qualification for the new format, they faced the second relegation in a row. The team spent the next seven years in the third-tier II. DDR-Liga until its abandonment in 1963, resulting in a move to the less prestigious Bezirksliga Halle. It took another twelve years at the third level of East German football until Thale won the Bezirksliga in 1976 and thereby qualified for the DDR- Liga. Although the league only had very little sporting value after being expanded to five divisions, Thale finished ninth out of twelve teams in 1977 and were relegated back to the Bezirksliga as second to last in 1978. There, the team could regenerate, won the Bezirksliga again and spent the next five years in the DDR-Liga. They spent three more seasons in the Bezirksliga from 1984 to 1987. By then, the DDR-Liga had been reduced to two divisions again and the Bezirksliga champions had to participate in promotion play-off rounds. While Thale failed to win this play-off in 1985, they were promoted back to the DDR-Liga a year later and managed to stay there until the end of East German football, even finishing the 1987–88 season as runners-up of the southern division.

In 1992, the football team wanted to separate themselves from the rest of the club and founded Sportvereinigung Thale 04 to commemorate the club of the same name founded in 1904. However, the newly created team had too little sporting substance and was therefore relegated to the fifth-tier Verbandsliga Sachsen-Anhalt at the end of the 1992–93 season. After relegation to the sixth-tier Landesliga in the 1999–2000 season, the new club was disbanded and the team returned to SV Stahl Thale in 2001. After spending the 2002–03 season in the seventh-tier Kreisliga Quedlinburg, they were promoted back to the Landesliga in 2005. At the end of the 2010–11 season, the club was relegated to the eighth-tier Landesklasse Sachsen-Anhalt. In 2013, they returned to the Landesliga for five seasons before dropping to the Landesklasse again.

The goal of close coupled cooling is to bring heat transfer closest to its source: the equipment rack. By moving the air conditioner closer to the equipment rack a more precise delivery of inlet air and a more immediate capture of exhaust air is ensured. The proximity of the cooling system with the server cabinet allows a high-performance solution  Air Conditioner Types  Commercially available close coupled solutions can be divided into two categories: Open-Loop and Closed-Loop.  Open-Loop Configuration  Open-Loop configurations are not totally independent from the room they are installed, and air flows interact with the ambient room environment. = In-Row Air Conditioners = Row-Based Air Conditioning units are installed inside the rack rows. Air flows generally follow short and linear paths, reducing, in this way, the necessary power needed to start up the fans and increasing the energy efficiency. A Row-Based cooling solution offers one advantage with respect to the Room-Based solution, since the former one can be better adapted to the needs of cooling for specific rows; it is anyway appropriate not to locate the conditioning units at the beginning or at the end of the rows to maximise their performance. = Rear Door Heat Exchangers = This type of solution is based on the substitution of the rear door of an existing rack. These heat exchangers leverage the front-to-back air dissipation of most of the IT equipments: the servers dissipate warm air, which passes the heat exchanger coil and is returned to the room at an agreeable temperature. The cooling units of this category do not occupy additional space, so they are particularly indicated either to cool all the spaces originally designed as data centers, or to integrate an already existing cooling system. = Overhead Heat Exchangers = Generally, a heat exchanger of this type discharges air from the ceiling into the cold aisle whereas the exhaust air rises into the vents in the ceiling; in Close Coupled system cases, the units are positioned directly above the servers, making the cold air delivery and hot air return much more precise. A system of this type, being positioned vertically, does not need further floor space in the room.  Closed-Loop Configuration  The Closed-Loop cooling typologies act independently from the room they are installed; the rack and the heat exchanger work exclusively with one another, creating an internal microclimate. = In Rack Cooling = The cooling system is adjoint to the server rack and both of them are completely sealed; the solid doors on the enclosure and In-Row Air Conditioners contain the air flow, directing cold air to the server inlet and exhaust air, by using fans, through the cooling coil. The Close-Loop design allows a very focused cooling at rack level and it is possible to install very dense equipment disregarding the ambient environment, giving flexibility to use unconventional spaces to install the IT equipment.  Efficiency  In the traditional layout, the fans must move air from the perimeter of the room, under the raised floor, and through a perforated floor tile into servers intake. This process requires energy, that varies depending on the typology of the structure. Often, under the raised floor, holdbacks (large cable bundles, conduits) exist, requiring additional fan energy to move the required cold air volume. Being that in Close Coupled solutions the cooling system and the equipment rack are close to one another, the energy needed is reduced. With an In-Row typology the cooling unit is incorporated in the row of racks and, providing air directly to the row, there are not impediments to consider under the floor. It is estimated, that when integrated, a Close Coupled system can guarantee up to 95% of annual energy reduction compared to a traditional CRAC system of equal cooling capacity. Some cooling typologies can be associated to fans with variable velocity that adapt in better ways to the workload, so also to the internal temperature of the rack. Having fans that work at the minimum velocity satisfying the requirements of the Data Center is very important for energy consumption. It is verified that the percentage of energy saved, hence the total energy cost decreases in a more than proportional way with respect to the decrease of air flow (for example, by reducing the fan velocity by 10% we save 27% of energy). {  + !% FLOW !HOURS !ANNUAL ENERGY !ANNUAL COST !RPM !SAVINGS - 100 8760 49.774,43 1.742,10 2040 0% - 95 8760 42.774,64 1.493,64 1938 14.26% - 90 8760 36.285,56 1.269,99 1836 27.10% - 85 8760 30.567,72 1.069,87 1734 38.59% - 80 8760 25.484,51 891,96 1632 48.80% - 75 8760 20.998,59 734,95 1530 57.81% - 70 8760 17.072,63 697,01 1428 59.99% } Efficiency is also represented by modularity. With a Close Coupled solution in is indeed possible adding new conditioners in forecast of an increase of the Data Centre capacity. Despite the fact that some past studies have speculated a very elevated growth of sales of Close Coupled solutions, more recent studies have instead shown a more contained growth. The reason seems to be due to the fact that the In-Row solutions offer significant energy savings as the rack densities are close to the 8-10 kW threshold; today's average densities for medium-sized data centers are instead about 5 kW and energy savings do not fully justify the higher cost of investment for the cooling system.  Refrigerated Water Temperatures  In traditional systems, the refrigerated water supply temperatures typically vary between 6 and 7 °C and cold water is in fact necessary to generate cold air that compensates for the rise that occurs on the floor of the data center, since the cold inlet air and the hot exhaust air interact. However, it is necessary to ensure that the inlet temperature is between 18 and 26.5 °C as established by the ASHRAE. Some types of Close Coupled systems allow warmer water inlet temperatures due to the proximity of the refrigeration system and the design of the cooling coil while remaining within the guidelines of the ASHRAE. Since the refrigerators represent 30-40% of the energy consumption of a data center and that this is largely due to mechanical refrigeration, a higher water inlet temperature allows increase the hours in which free cooling is possible and therefore increase the efficiency of the refrigerator.  Close Coupled system of Google Data Centers  Google Data Center - Photo: Connie Zhou For several years now, Google, according to the statements of the vice president of Data Centers, Joseph Kava, restructures the cooling system of its Data Centers every 12 – 18 months, also focusing on Close Coupled type systems. In 2012 Google published a photo gallery that shows the design of its cooling system, followed by an explanation of Data Center Vice President Joseph Kava, of how it works. In the data center shown the rooms serve as cold corridors, there is a raised floor but there are no perforated tiles. Cooling occurs in closed corridors with rows of racks on both sides while cooling coils using cold water serve as the ceiling of these warm corridors, which also house the pipes that carry the water to and from the cooling towers housed in another part of the building. The temperature of the air is generally maintained around 26.5 °C, getting warmer more and more due to the contact with various components, up to about 49 °C. When air is directed by fans in the warm closed corridor where, reaching the top of the room passes through the cooling coil and is cooled to room temperature. The flexible piping connects to the cooling coil at the top of the hot aisle and descends through an opening in the floor and flows under the raised floor. From the statements of Kava \\"If we had leaks in the conduits, the water would sink down into our raised floor. We have a lot of experience with this design, and it has never happened a large water loss\\" , the presence of an emergency system for any water leaks is confirmed.

Kava also stated, referring to other types of cooling systems with installations on the ceiling to return the hot exhaust air to the air conditioners of the computer room (CRAC) located along the perimeter of the raised floor area, that The whole system is inefficient because the hot air is moved over a long distance while traveling towards the \\"CRAC\\", while a Close Coupled system is significantly more efficient.

The building was designed by Architect Hilley. It is also known as CBC Bank and Commercial Banking Company. The property is owned by Dubbo Regional Council and was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The building was originally the premises of the first bank in Dubbo, erected by the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney. The building was constructed in 1867 to the design of the Architect Hilley. For many years it was the town's finest building and the only bank until 1876. When the bank moved further north the building became the offices of Talbragar Shire Council, established in 1907. In December 1979 the Dubbo Council and Dubbo Museum and Historical Society advised the Heritage Council that the Talbragar Shire building was under threat of demolition and requested protection under the Heritage Act, 1977. Following amalgamation of Dubbo and Talbragar the future of the building was uncertain. To provide security to the building an Interim Conservation Order was placed over the building on 2 May 1980. In recognition as an important item of the State environmental heritage and to ensure the protection of the building a Permanent Conservation Order was placed over the building on 23 July 1982. It was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  Description  Styled in a restrained Victorian Italianate manner, the dressed sandstone facades of the building are almost severe, lightened only by round-headed window openings arranged in pairs on the Macquarie Street facade and in triad on the Bultje Street facade, string courses at first floor level and rusticated quoins. The iron roof is obscured by the substantial projecting cornice. The building is two storeys and has an extensive cellar. Much of the original interior is intact; lath and plaster walls and ceilings.  Modifications and dates  It appears that the building may have been sandblasted for cleaning with subsequent erosion damage. Repointing with cement mortar also. *1984 - Heritage Council approval granted minor alterations to convert ground floor into a restaurant and upper floor into two offices. *1989 - Heritage Council approval for demolition of rear and erection of new addition. *1989 - Heritage Council approval for signage, and exterior colour scheme. *1990 - Heritage Council approval for internal fitout for offices.  Heritage listing  As at 3 October 2000, constructed of sandstone to the designs of the architect Hilley in 1867, the building represented a substantial vote of confidence in the future of Dubbo by the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited, the first Bank to open for business in Dubbo and the first to construct major premises in the town. The building makes an important contribution to the streetscape of Macquarie Street and is complemented by the Old Imperial Hotel building.

The Tapandegan refers to its acts as an act of protest demanding from the Iranian leadership to improve the economy and to stop ignoring the demands of the Iranian people. News agencies categorized this group's acts as “a new form of protest in Iran.” History The Tapandegan first appeared publicly on May 24, 2018 when they hacked the arrival and departure monitors at Mashhad International Airport and on June 6, 2018 when they also hacked the arrival and departure monitors at Tabriz International Airport. The group posted anti- government messages and images, forcing the airports’ authorities to turn off manually those monitors one-by-one. Airport officials in both cities turned off the sign boards for several hours after the hacking and made apologetic public statements. The Iranian authorities confirmed both cyber-attacks shortly after they took place and they were widely reported by the Iranian official press and the international news wires and agencies. Name and alias The group's name is in the Persian language meaning Palpitaters. Based on the messages they posted on those hacked monitors, the news sources noted that the group supports the national protests of the people in Iran demanding economic improvements. Iran has seen frequent nationwide protests this year by demonstrators angered by local and national officials and business leaders who they accuse of corruption and oppression. The two anti- government hacks at Iranian airports are the only incidents of their kind since the protests began in late December. Hacking history Hacking attacks in Iran have been on the rise recently. In August 2016, Internet security experts warned that hackers have found access to banking and contact details of millions of Iranians by hacking into their Telegram accounts. However, it is not yet clear whether this was a genuine warning or an attempt by hardliners in the Iranian government to convince people to leave Telegram and migrate to home-grown messaging services, where the government has easy access to users’ private information and can intercept their communications. First hack: The Mashhad International Airport According to The Associated Press’ report from Tehran, Iran’s official IRNA news agency reported that The Tapandegan “managed to interrupt routine broadcasts on monitors” at the Mashhad International Airport on Thursday evening, May 24, 2018, “replacing them with images of anti-government protests from January [2018]”“for several hours.” Sources report that according to a statement posted by the hackers on the monitors, the group protested to “wasting Iranians lives and financial resources in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria by the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC).” The message posted on sign boards also protested against the IRGC's presence in Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere in the region. The group also hacked the email of Mashhad airport civil aviation head, Mohsen Eidizadeh and sent the news of its hack from his account. Mashhad is the city where massive anti- government demonstrations started on December 28 and spread to over 100 other Iranians cities. It is a religious city where the holy shrine of the 8th Shiite Imam is located. Local authorities and clerics in the city are among the staunchest hardliners. The group expressed support for the people of Kazeroon, a city in Fars Province, where people have been demonstrating against the state of months. Second hack: The Tabriz International Airport According to The Associated Press’ report from Tehran, Iran's official IRNA news agency reported that on June 6, 2018, the hackers “have disrupted the arrival and departure monitors in the Tabriz international airport in the country’s northwest.” The hackers defaced sign boards in the evening, showing a protest message against “wasting Iranians’ resources\\" and expressing support for Iranian truckers who have been on strike across Iran for several weeks. Iranian truck drivers went on strike for more than a week beginning May 22 in several parts of Iran, using social media to mobilize and share images of themselves protesting low wages and rising business costs. The Iranian state-run site, Young Journalists’ Club (YJC), “quoted Tabriz Governor Aliyar Rastgoo as saying the incident happened Wednesday at 9:30 p.m. local time.” A Tabriz airport official Mostafa Safaei confirmed the day after the cyber-attack that the monitors turned off following the hack and engineers quickly restored the system, and the incident was under investigation. Translation of the message posted by the hackers on the monitors in Persian reads: Attention, attention. We, Tapandegan, in another protest action, are currently taking control of the computer systems of this airport. Two weeks ago, in protest against the wastage of the Iranian people’s money and lives by (Iran’s) Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, we took control of the computer systems in Mashhad airport. Today, by voicing our support for Iranian strikers, we are doing the same thing. Until when will this regime deprive people of their rights to have a better livelihood and economic situation?! Until when?! We will not choke off our voices. We will continue these actions. If you support us, take a photo of this and share it The Tapandegan assumed responsibility for the hacking in a tweet on June 7. News of the hacking broke almost immediately on social media as Iranians posted tweets and pictures of the incident. However, the posts came under pseudonyms as users inside Iran fear a heavy-handed clampdown by the government. Sources report that The Tapandegan sent an email to Iranian journalists saying, “Two weeks ago, we took over the computer systems of Mashhad Airport in support of the national protests. We protested against wasting Iranian lives and assets by IRGC [The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]. And, today, we support the truck drivers, the bazar, and the strikers”. Third Attack: Hacking into the Islamic Republic International Broadcasting (IRIB) and the Iranian Embassy in Berlin Chief of Iran's cyber police, Seyed Kamal Hadianfar, claimed that the hackers who attacked Mashhad and Tabriz airports have been identified and arrested.According to a report by AsiaOnline, on January 17, 2019, the Tapandegan hacked allegedly into IRIB's computer systems, including IRIB's director Mr. Asgari, his deputy Mr. Abutalebi, and IRIB's political news director Mr. Seyyed Mehdi, and the email of the Iranian counselor in Berlin Mr. Zamani, and sent out emails and SMS through them to IRIB's employees, the Majlis speaker Ali Larijani and other Majlis members, as well as journalists. This email, according to this report, claims that top secret information is leaked regarding the transfer of two Trillion Touman each year in USD, double to Iran's Foreign Ministry annual budget, by Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif to the Lebanese Hizballah, via his advisor Shirkhodaei, his special team, and the Iranian ambassador to Lebanon. The group claims that they got hold of documents related to this information while hacking into IRIB's computer systems and the email of the Iranian counselor in Berlin. Tapandegan blamed Zarif for money laundering while he himself had been accusing other offices in Iran of money laundering. AsiaOnline.ir published the entire email allegedly sent by The Tapandegan. Documents Exposed This group hacked the emails of the Islamic Republic's authorities. They hacked Tehran Municipality's Gmail account, and this way entered the Municipality's Twitter and Instagram accounts, and sent an email through the municipality's email system to the members of the Iranian Parliament Majlis including the Speaker Ali Larijani, Ali Motahari, Mahmoud-Sadeghi and ten other Majlis members, complained concerning the economic mismanagement and absence of social justice, and asked for the trial of the corrupt individuals and for putting an end to the rampant corruption in the country. The Tapandegan calls to stop corruption by the Iranian leadership through exposing allegedly top-secret related information received from insiders and whistleblowers. August 2, 2018, the Tapadengan exposed a letter received from a whistleblower, which claimed that ministries and IRGC have been ignoring the direct order, by Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei to limit and downsize IRGC's involvement and control over the private sector and the economy. The leaked information included names of IRGC's subsidiaries, which operated as private companies. August 20, 2018: The Tapandegan exposed a top secret document, which was leaked to the group, regarding the purchase of a 5-star-hotel in the city of Mashhad for a price of US$28 million for the vacation of IRGC officers. The purchase was taking place in 2018 as the national protests broke out throughout Iran protesting the deteriorating economic conditions. In a video posted on YouTube, The Tapandegan released information concerning its claimed infiltration to Iran's computer systems and claimed that it has hacked the email accounts of senior managers and employees of all the airports in the country. Documents released by the group show that Iranian authorities are concerned about Tapandegan's ability to hack the computer systems of the government agencies, financial institutions, and the military and \\"called upon the relevant responsible personnel to check them out quickly.

A non-governmental organization (NGO) and a non-for- profit organization, it advocates for positive community change and peacebuilding initiatives in Afghanistan. The Institute works with local Afghan peace-builders and international partners to bring sustainable positive change in Afghan communities, particularly in the conflict zones. AFGIP has a nationwide local peace-builders team which works with international experts in a unique approach to build local capacity of community people and establish the foundation for positive community change initiatives. AFGIP works with the community people using community's available assets. AFGIP believes that scaling up the capacity of community people and the use of their available resources including human energy will lead to long-term stability and peace in these communities. They are conducting research studies to understand the roots and causes of conflict in conflict zones and simultaneously prepare a response strategy per district to react and to respond to the community level issues by using the early warning signs and data. Their mission is to promote positive community change initiatives and youth empowerment through the religious channels to bringing long-term peace in Afghanistan.  History AFGIP was officially registered with the Afghanistan Government as an NGO in 2015. However, the organization was heavily involved in peacebuilding initiatives long before this which was structured as a voluntarily mechanism where a number of like-minded peacebuilders were working on peacebuilding activities. The founder and CEO of AFGIP, Mr. Yasar Ahmadzai, was featured and recognized for his peacebuilding efforts by different organizations, including the United State Institute of Peace (USIP) and World Peace Center. In 2015 he was featured by USIP among the top 10 peace builders across the globe for the year 2015. Afghanistan Conflict and AFGIP Over four decades of violent conflict have fundamentally destroyed trust in peacekeeping and has built dangerous alternatives for the Afghan people to survive. While it’s not impossible, but also not easy, peace-building and peacekeeping can be built in Afghanistan. The question of how is contingent on how we preserve and build peace. The approach the AFGIP so far took has been focusing on youths and building youth peace ambassadors. They believe that youth extremism has become a serious challenge not only to the Afghan government but to the entire region and mainly to the families where these youths are coming from. To construct the efforts made in this regard by various stakeholder in the past, AFGIP is working on a bottom-up approach to raise awareness and conduct peace sensitization in the hot-spot communities. Looking back not undermining what has been achieved in regards to peace-building efforts in Afghanistan, the impact of what has been done is limited to the main cities where already peoples’ access to information and resources are high. So, to encounter peace in the hotspots AFGIP focused on the conflict zones and this became a priority for them since they are formally established. While all the provinces, but particularly the South, East, and South-Western provinces of Afghanistan are the main target of the insurgents that drives the youths to extremism and became the hot-spots in last decade and so. AFGIP by intervening in these hot- spots through its violence prevention activities work with religious networks and through families to provide alternatives to the at-risk youths in these communities. Previous interventions to address and prevent youth extremism in these provinces have been relatively unsuccessful, due in part, to poor targeting and unrealistic assessment of the true underlying causes of youth extremism in these hot-spots. So to not repeat the same mistake, AFGIP took a bottom-up approach which adopts a multi-prong approach to address at-risk youths and tackle extremism in a different but practical lens. Their approach allows for a broader engagement which provides an opportunity to gradually transform the targeted hotspots into a peaceful environment where youth will actively play their roles to build long-term peace in their communities.  Approach Peace is the most important element in any community and where it is lacking, it creates moments of anxiety that stifles growth. Drive the force of the community, especially the youths, in the wrong directions and can contribute to unstable environments that threaten everything in that community. In particular AFGIP: * Establish mechanisms and take preventative measure to work with at-risk youths * Build trust and communication opportunities in the communities by squeezing the gaps that often mislead the youths and drove them to the insurgency * Train and equip the community members to better communicate and address dispute issues with at-risk youths which will lead to positive change and long-term peace in the communities References Category:Think tanks ","title":"Afghanistan Institute of Peace"},{"id":"57769325","text":"Sir John Charles Hoddinott (21 September 1944England & Wales, Civil Registration Death Index, 1916-2007 – 13 August 2001) was a senior British police officer who rose through the ranks to become Chief Constable of Hampshire Constabulary.

Jason Miller is the Partnership’s Chief Executive Officer.  History  The Greater Washington Partnership is a civic alliance of 27 employers and entrepreneurs that represent businesses from the Baltimore- Richmond-Washington D.C. region. It was founded in 2016, and grew from an original foundation of a number of businesses working to bring the Olympics (Washington 2024) to the region. The Partnership focuses on creating solutions for the major issues of transportation, human capital, innovation and entrepreneurship in order to make the Capital Region a center for business growth and innovation. Jason Miller is the Partnership’s CEO. Board chairs include Russ Ramsey, Ramsey Asset Management; Peter L. Scher, JPMorgan Chase & Co.; Ted Leonsis, Monumental Sports and Entertainment. In May 2018 the organization advocated for higher tolls. Transportation and workforce development were two early goals of the organization. Developing the region is part of a strategy to encourage more companies to establish themselves within the region. The organization seeks to establish some standardization in regional educational credentials.  Activities  When Amazon announced a North American sweepstakes for the location of its second headquarters in 2017, the Partnership contributed 11 addendums supporting each of the first round of bids submitted by jurisdictions in the region. “When one wins, we all win,” was the theme used by the Partnership to show Amazon that the region had the businesses, talent, and infrastructure to support being selected as the second headquarters location. In November 2018, Amazon announced Arlington, VA as one of the locations for its second headquarters.  Regional mobility  The Greater Washington Partnership is a founding member of the MetroNow Coalition, which works for long-term improvements to WMATA, the DC Metro system. In May 2018, MetroNow worked with other organizations, including CSG, Federal City Council, Northern Virginia Chamber of Commerce, The 2030 Group, the Greater Washington Board of Trade and Fund It Fix to get DC, Maryland, and Virginia leaders to approve $500 million annual funding for Metro. In November 2018, the Partnership released its Blueprint for Regional Mobility, a comprehensive transportation strategy to improve commutes, increase transportation options, and provide better access to public transportation for people around Baltimore, Washington, and Richmond. It is the first-ever CEO- led agenda to improve the region’s transportation system. The Blueprint lays out four main priorities: connecting the super-region, improving the consumer experience, ensuring equitable access and integrating innovation as the keys to fundamentally transforming the way residents move around the region. A few of the Partnership’s recommendations include a commuter rail network for the region, an expansion of the regions toll-lane network, improving the region’s bus network, and growing programs for commuters at private employers. Dominion Energy CEO Tom Farrell, MedStar Health CEO Kenneth Samet, and EY global chairman and CEO Mark Weinberg are the co-chairs of the Greater Washington Partnership Regional Mobility Initiative and authored the Blueprint. The Partnership has also released several issue specific reports on buses, integrated mobility, performance-driven tolling, and Richmond’s transit revolution. This includes a case study titled “Richmond’s Transit Revolution: GRTC Ridership and Accessibility Analysis,” which was released in June 2019. The study analyzed the launch of the Pulse Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) line, a bus redesign in Richmond and expansion of service in Henrico Country. The Pulse was recognized by the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy with a bronze ranking for design and implementation.  Housing  In October 2018, the Greater Washington Partnership, together with the Urban Institute and JPMorgan Chase, launched the Regional Housing Framework, in an effort to address the Capital Region’s future housing needs. On September 4, 2019, the Urban Institute released \\"Meeting the Washington Region’s Future Housing Needs\\", commissioned by the Greater Washington Partnership and JPMorgan Chase. The report provides business leaders, policy makers, community members and advocates with evidence-based insights so they can join the collective push for solutions and help create a healthy housing market in which residents and businesses thrive.  Skills and talent  = Capital CoLAB = One of the Partnership’s main initiatives is to grow the region’s economic competitiveness. The Greater Washington Partnership created the Capital CoLAB (Collaborative of Leaders in Academia and Business), an alliance of educators and business leaders working together to develop talent in the region by providing them with enhanced digital technology education, to ensure people have the skills that employers require. CoLAB companies include Amazon, Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, MedImmune, Monumental Sports & Entertainment, Northrop Grumman, and Under Armour. University partners include: American University, George Mason University, Georgetown University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Maryland, University of Richmond, Virginia Commonwealth University and Virginia Tech. Wes Bush, Partnership board member and former Chairman and CEO of Northrop Grumman serves as the inaugural chair of the Capital CoLAB. = Digital Tech Credential = In March 2019, the Capital CoLAB launched the digital tech credential program with colleges and universities in the Capital Region. The announcement was made at an event hosted with the Business Roundtable, “Driving Talent and Innovation in the Capital Region.” The Digital Tech Credential brings together big employers and higher education institutions in a collaborative effort to develop a skilled workforce for high-tech jobs. The credential was designed with guidance from regional businesses to certify that graduates have taken a series of courses that cover knowledge and skills in certain fields such as statistics, data visualization, and cybersecurity. The CoLAB based the program on 44 types of “knowledge, skills and abilities” that businesses say they want their employees to have to fill high-paying jobs in the age of digital information. The credential program debuted in 2019 at George Mason University and Virginia Commonwealth University. American University, Georgetown University, the University of Richmond, and Virginia Tech launched their own programs in the fall of 2019. In addition to the generalist credential, the CoLAB plans to offer additional specialized credential programs in cybersecurity, data analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning.

History  The Harrogate Grand Opera House was designed by architect Frank Tugwell, whose other work includes the Futurist Theatre in Scarborough and the Savoy Theatre in London. The building opened on 13 January 1900 with a charity performance for soldiers fighting in the Boer War. This was followed by a run of Mr J. Tully's pantomime, Dick Whittington. The theatre still possesses many of its original front of house fixtures and fittings, as well as a modelled plaster frieze by sculptor Frances Darlington in the foyer that depicts the development of arts through the ages.  Harrogate Theatre Scenic Services  As was typical for a repertory theatre at the time, Harrogate Grand Opera house was home to an on- site workshop to build their sets. This was eventually set up as a commercial venture under the name of Harrogate Theatre Scenic Services (HTSS) and it is now a dedicated workshop located in Starbeck, Harrogate.

The name means \\"house of the farm labourer\\", and was borrowed from an earlier building on the site, although the new building was intended for royal use. It was designed to complement the Royal Palace, providing a place for the royal family to spend the day without some of the customary restrictions of court life. Architecture The initial design was by the royal architect, Juan de Villanueva for King Charles IV. Detail of facade showing date in Roman numerals A cartouche on the facade gives the date as 1803. The work was completed by Isidro González Velázquez. Decorations The French designer Jean-Démosthène Dugourc, who entered Charles IV's service after the French Revolution broke out, made an important contribution to the interior decorations. The marble floors incorporate some Roman mosaics found in Merida. There are murals by Zacarías González Velázquez. Access and conservation The Casa del Labrador is set in a park called the Jardín del Príncipe bordering the River Tagus. Access to the gardens surrounding the Casa del Labrador is free, but there is a charge to visit the house itself which is in the care of the heritage agency Patrimonio Nacional. The Jardín del Príncipe is also the home of the Faluas Reales Museum, a modern building containing pleasure barges from the royal collection. Entrance to park In 1993 the building was listed on the Spanish heritage register as a Bien de Interés Cultural under the name \\"Casita del Labrador\\".

It is not to be confused with integrated management, which deals with enterprises' environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance rather than with their organizational structure in particular. The most characteristic aspect of the IMC is its distinction between three particular management dimensions: normative, strategic, and operational management, which are held together by different integration mechanisms. The normative management dimension determines the general aim of the organization, the strategic dimension directs the plans, basic structures, systems, and the problem-solving behaviour of the staff for achieving it, and the operative level translates the normative missions and strategic programs into day-to-day organizational processes. The IMC was developed by Knut Bleicher and his colleagues originally as an element of the St. Gallen Management Model, introduced in the 1970s by Hans Ulrich and Walter Krieg at the Swiss University of St. Gallen. Thereafter, the IMC has been revised several times (e.g. with respect to its application within SMEs sectors ) and further developed by research institutions and management scholars, such as Johannes Rüegg-Stürm. Rüegg-Stürm, J. & Grand, S. (2014) Das St. Galler Management- Modell. 4. Generation – Einführung [Introduction to the fourth generation St. Gallen Management Model]. Bern: Haupt.  Dimensions of management   Normative management  The normative management dimension deals with principles, norms, and strategies which are aimed to ensure the surviving capabilities of a company through the preservation of its identity. Bleicher states that “because of its constitutive role, normative management functions as the basis for all activities of management”. Through vision, mission, and purpose statements, normative management codifies the norms, principles, and strategies that fulfill the company's general aim.  Strategic management  Strategic management focuses on achieving a company's competitive advantage. It utilizes the organizational experience in relation to its technologies, social structures, and processes against competitors in the market. While normative management functions as a foundation for activities, it is the task of strategic management to provide orientation for these activities.  Operational management  The operational management dimension is characterized by the processes and tasks that apply on practice the realization of organizational norms and strategies. It aims at optimizing process efficiency and effective social cooperation to enhance performance, both within the organisation and with external stakeholders. Thus, the operational management level facilitates the development of processes, products, and services.  Integration mechanisms  The IMC identifies three integration mechanisms that span the management dimensions and ensure the alignment between them. These integration mechanisms are defined as meta- integration, vertical integration, and horizontal integration. Meta- integration is based on the management and business philosophy which defines the company's consideration of and relation to its stakeholders’ values. Vertical integration is achieved throughout the three management dimensions by means of structures, activities, and behavior. Structures describe the translation of corporate governance into effective management and efficient processes. Activities refer to the development and application of corporate policies, strategic programmes, and operational tasks (e.g. marketing activities like acquiring customers or performing customer service). Behavior relates to defining roles that ensure that the company's culture and normative values are put into practice. Horizontal integration is about aligning the structures, activities, and behavior throughout the distinct management dimensions.  Application  The IMC has been adapted in various contexts, such as foresight frameworks or cybernetic theories for organisational intelligence. More recently, it has also been used as a foundation for an Integrated Business Model Framework that identifies normative, strategic, and operational business model elements. Breuer & Lüdeke-Freund adopted the basic distinction between management levels and integration mechanisms to develop a framework for values-based innovation management stressing the impact of normative orientations for research, design and management of corporate innovation. The IMC is closely related to systems approaches such as Stafford Beer's Viable Systems Model due to its systemic and cybernetic character.

Articulated Soft Robots are robots with both soft and rigid parts, inspired to the muscle-skeletal system of vertebrate animals – from reptiles to birds to mammalians to humans. Compliance is typically concentrated in actuators, transmission and joints (corresponding to muscles, tendons and articulations) while structural stability is provided by rigid or semi-rigid links (corresponding to bones in vertebrates). The other subgroup in the broad family of soft robots includes Continuum Soft Robots, i.e. robots whose body is a deformable continuum, including its structural, actuating and sensing elements, and take inspiration from invertebrate animals such as octopuses or slugs, or parts of animals, such as an elephant trunk. Soft robots are often designed to exhibit natural behaviours, robustness and adaptivity, and sometimes mimick the mechanical characteristics of biological systems.  Characteristics and Design  Articulated Soft Robots are built taking inspiration from the intrinsic properties of muscle-skeletal system of vertebrates, whose compliant nature enables humans and animals to effectively and safely perform a large variety of tasks, ranging from walking on uneven terrains, running, and climbing, to grasping and manipulating. It also makes them resilient to highly dynamic, unexpected events such as impacts with the environment. The interplay of the physical properties of vertebrates with the neural sensory-motor control makes motion very energy–efficient, safe and effective. Robots able to co-exist and co-operate with people and reach or even surpass their performance require a technology of actuators, responsible for moving and controlling the robot, which can reach the functional performance of the biological muscle and its neuro-mechanical control. The VSA-I, a variable stiffness actuator with an agonistic-antagonistic architecture, The most promising class of actuators for soft robots is the class of Variable Impedance Actuators (VIA) and the subclass of Variable Stiffness Actuators (VSA), complex mechatronic devices that are developed to build passively compliant, robust, and dexterous robots. VSAs can vary their impedance directly at the physical level, thus without the need of an active control capable to simulate different stiffness values. The idea of varying the mechanical impedance of actuation comes directly from natural musculo- skeletal systems, which often exhibit this feature.A. Albu Schaeffer, A.

Safety in physical human-robot interaction  One of the most revolutionary and challenging features of the class of articulated soft robots is Physical Human-Robot Interaction. Soft robots designed to physically interact with people are designed to coexist and cooperate with humans in applications such as assisted industrial manipulation, collaborative assembly, domestic work, entertainment, rehabilitation or medical applications. Clearly, such robots must fulfill different requirements from those typically met in conventional industrial applications: while it might be possible to relax requirements on velocity of execution and absolute accuracy, concerns such as safety and dependability become of great importance when robots have to interact with humans.Do No Harm To Humans: Real-life Robots Obey Asimov’s Laws https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/09/080908201841.htm Safety can be increased in different ways. The classical methods include control and sensorization, e.g. proximity-sensitive skins, or the addiction of external soft elements (soft and compliant coverings or airbags placed around the arm for increasing the energy-absorbing properties of protective layers). Advanced sensing and control can realize a “soft” behavior via software.G. Hirzinger, A. Albu-Schäffer, M. Hähnle, I. Schaefer, N. Sporer: On a new generation of torque controlled light-weight robots, Proc. IEEE Int. Conf. Robotics Autom. (ICRA) (2001) pp. 3356–3363 Articulated Soft Robotics realizes a different approach at increasing the safety level of robots interacting with humans by introducing mechanical compliance and damping directly at the mechanical design level.,A.

Bicchi: “Novel > Actuators for Soft Robotics”, Springer Handbook of Robotics, 2016  Resilience  Physical interaction of a robot with its environment can also be dangerous to the robot itself. Indeed, the number of times a robot is damaged because of impacts or force overexertion is rather large. Resilience to shocks is not only instrumental to achieve viable applications of robots in everyday life, but would also be very useful in industrial environments, substantially enlarging the scope of applicability of robot technology. Soft robotics technologies can provide solutions that are effective in absorbing shocks and reducing accelerations: soft materials can be used as coverings or even as structural elements in robot limbs, but the main technological challenge remains with soft actuators and transmissions.Albu Schaeffer, A. Bicchi: “Novel Actuators for Soft Robotics”, Springer Handbook of Robotics, 2016  Performance and Energy Efficiency  The dynamic behavior of the actuators with controllable compliance guarantees high-performance, lifelike motion and higher energy efficiency than rigid robots.S. Haddadin, M.C. Özparpucu, A.A. Schäffer: Optimal control for maximizing potential energy in variable stiffness joints, Proc. 51st IEEE Conf. Decis. Control (CDC), Maui (2012) The natural dynamics of the robot can adapt to the environment, and thus the intrinsic physical behavior of the resulting system is close to the desired motion. In these circumstances, actuators would only have to inject and extract energy into and out of the system for small corrective actions, thus reducing energy consumption.Albu Schaeffer, A. Bicchi: “Novel Actuators for Soft Robotics”, Springer Handbook of Robotics, 2016. The idea of embodying desirable dynamics in the physical properties of soft robots finds its natural application in humanoid robots, having to resemble the movements of humans, or in robotic systems realized for prosthetic uses, e.g. anthropomorphic artificial hands. A relevant example of use is in and walking/running robots:B. Vanderborght, B. Verrelst, R. Van Ham, M. Van Damme, D. Lefeber: A pneumatic biped: Experimental walking results and compliance adaptation experiments, Proc. Int. Conf. Humanoid Robots, Tsukuba (2006) indeed, the fact that natural systems change the compliance of their muscular system depending on the gait and environmental conditions, and even during the different phases of the gait, seem to indicate the potential usefulness of Variable Impedance Actuators (VIA) for locomotion.L.C. Visser, S. Stramigioli, R. Carloni: Robust bipedal walking with variable leg stiffness, Proc. 4th IEEE/RAS/EMBS Int. Conf. Biomed. Robotics Biomechatron. (BioRob) (2012) pp. 1626–1631 An emerging trend of use of VIA technologies is connected to the growing of a novel category of industrial robots connected to Industry4.0, the Co-Bots. Exploration of soft robots’ full potential is leading to more and more applications in which the robots overcome conventional- robot performance, and it is widely believed that more applications are yet to comeC.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. The building now houses the Brewery Becker. History Brighton was first settled in 1832, and became an established stagecoach stop and market center for southeastern Livingston County. In 1871, the Detroit, Lansing and Northern Railroad constructed a line through Brighton, which brought an economic boom to the city. To take advantage of the transient population brought by the railroad, Asa Rounsifer constructed the building in 1873 as a hotel near the depot. Rounsifer was a Dutch immigrant and local farmer. Possibly due to the Panic of 1873, the Rounsifer family suffered financial setbacks and in 1874 sold the hotel to Johannah and A.W. Smith, who renamed it the Western House and added a livery stable to the property. A few years later the hotel was purchased by Joseph B. Skilbeck, an English boot and shoe manufacturer. The hotel was later purchased by Sarah and LeRoy King and was a financial success as a hotel, restaurant, and social center for parties, until Brighton decided to go dry in 1908. The Western House remained in business as a boarding house with an occasional restaurant, although the halting of rail passenger service in 1948 reduced its customer base. In later years it was a bar and rooming house. In 1985, the building was rehabilitated to provide office space on the ground level and rooms for rent on the upper floors. In 2011, plans began to refurbish the building into a microbrewery. The Brewery Becker opened in 2014. Description The Western House is a three-story roughly cubical Italianate brick structure standing on a corner lot. It has a high degree of architectural integrity for a building from this time period, maintaining a simple cornice, and the original arrangement of doors and windows in the main facades. Pilasters run up the corners and frame the central bay of the five- bay wide front facade, and a belt course separates the first and second floors. The windows are symmetrically placed, with fully arched windows on the first floor, segmentally arched windows on the second floor, and rectangular windows on the third. The doors have fanlights above.

She is a professor and head of the anthropology department at the University of Connecticut.  Education and career  McBrearty studied at the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Illinois, Urbana, completing her PhD at Illinois in 1986. She joined the University of Connecticut in 1994, was appointed a professor in 2002, and head of the department of anthropology in 2008. Previously, she held positions at Brandeis University, Yale University, and the College of William & Mary. She was elected a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2007.  Research   Middle Stone Age in Africa  McBrearty's work on the Middle Stone Age (MSA) in Africa helped to revolution understandings of modern human behavior. With colleague Alison S. Brooks, McBrearty published \\"The revolution that wasn't: a new interpretation of the origin of modern human behavior,\\" one of the most-cited papers in the history of Paleolithic archaeology. This paper argued that behavioral modernity arose in Africa over a long period of time, and that it is visible very early in the MSA archaeological record. This view challenged European-centric models for human evolution that argued for a sudden appearance of behavioral modernity in Europe during the Upper Paleolithic.  Chimpanzee evolution  McBrearty and her colleague Nina Jablonski are credited with the discovery of the first known chimpanzee fossils. McBrearty collected the first fossil, a molar tooth, during her surveys at Kapthurin in the East African Rift Valley in 2004, and immediately suspected that it belonged to an ape. Joblonski, a specialist in monkey fossils, then examined the tooth and positively identified it as chimpanzee. She also found a second example, an incisor, in the same collection. The following year McBrearty's team returned to Kapthurin and discovered a further two fossil chimpanzee teeth. They believe that all four teeth belonged to the same individual. McBrearty and Jablonski announced the discovery in a paper in Nature in 2005. As well as being the first known chimpanzee fossils, the teeth were the first fossils of modern, non-human apes found in Africa. Dating to around 500,000 years ago, they were also discovered outside the range of modern chimpanzees, overturning a previous idea that the Rift Valley was a barrier to the species. McBrearty has proposed that fossils of chimpanzees are scarce because their preferred habitat—the wet jungles of Central and West Africa—experience poor conditions for preservation. Researchers did not expect to find the ancestors of chimpanzees in the drier savannahs of the Rift Valley, typically seen as the ecological niche of archaic humans, but McBrearty believes that there are more examples there because of the better preservation.  Personal life  McBrearty lives in Glastonbury, Connecticut. She was married to Andrew Hill, also a paleoanthropologist, until his death in 2015.

Biography Fridell was born the youngest of a large family (6 siblings, and 6 more half siblings by his father) living in a stream-side home in a woods in Lagan, Kronoberg County, Småland, in Götaland, Sweden. That part of Sweden consists of forested lakes and bogs, out of which arable patches had been carved. In the late 18th through early 19th centuries, the region had hemorrhaged emigrants to Minnesota. Fridell's mother was a public school teacher and seamstress and his father was a soldier, tailor, and postal carrier. The family was locally known for their intense reading culture, and Fridell's education mostly came through that family culture, the local library, and a book collection he found in a deserted house while he was shepherding. At age 13, he started working in a textile factory, and after a youthful spell of learning the masculine arts of card-playing, drinking, fighting, and generally being a roughneck, at age 19 he was shocked straight by his older brother's drowning. Thereafter he returned to reading, and in addition took up writing after factory work hours. Fridell married Hanna \\"Stina\\" Wahlberg (9 years his junior) in 1934, and together they raised two boys, born 17 years apart. He would remain at the factory until 1946, when he was able to quit and support himself on his writing. Despite his brief hard- living stint, at a young age, Fridell joined the IOGT, the Temperance movement. In 1921, the year of his brother's death, he participated in the formation of and was made secretary of a local branch of the Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden (Sveriges arbetares centralorganisation, SAC). In meetings, he was at first shy about the organization material he wrote. When the Syndicalist Workers' Federation (Syndikalistiska arbetarefederationen, SAF) broke from SAC in 1929, Fridell followed, as he admired the more radical politics of the founder, a Swede who had spent some years working and living in the U.S. Fridell became a member of SAC once again when SAF merged back into SAC in 1938. In the 1930s, Fridell started writing for Arbetare-Kuriren, the newspaper of SAF. After the reunion of SAC and SAF in 1938, he contributed frequently to Arbetaren, SAC's newspaper. Fridell is recognized as a theorist of syndicalism. He was also active as a lecturer and a delegate at several SAC congresses; from 1942 until 1946, he was a deputy in the organisation's central committee. Swedish Syndicalist archives include posters prominently advertising Fridell as the featured speaker at May Day demonstrations inviting \\"All peace- and freedom-loving people together.\\" Fridell's theoretical essay on industrial democracy Fridell debuted as a fiction writer with the novel Tack för mig – grottekvarn (\\"Thanks from me, treadmill\\") in 1945, and his breakthrough came with his second novel, the strongly autobiographical Död mans hand (1946). He was hooked and wrote a book nearly every year thereafter, winning labor and national awards for his writing every decade of his life after 1950. Although they were savagely denounced and dismissed by conservatives, his novels were widely read, in part thanks to their distribution by book ombudsmen in the factories. Fridell explained the reason behind his art: \\"As long as there are proletarians, there is a proletarian literature. And I would like to go a little further and say that as long as people are insulted in their work for so long, there must be voices that speak their language and take their case.\\" By his influential criticism of monotonous and soul-killing factory work in Sweden's modernizing era of Taylorist automation, Fridell become a renewer of the workplace as well as a champion of the right of the worker to defend his dignity and capacity for cooperative decision-making. Other frequent themes of Fridell's writing were juvenile delinquency, rural flight and dystopian views of the future. Fridell's work has been regarded as easy to read, conveying an ironic sense of humor. A prolific writer and editorialist, he often wrote in the voice of an alter ego. His play \\"One Man's Bread\\" was translated into English; the working class characters' dialogue was represented in British cockney accents. Fridell's novel Rikedom (\\"Wealth,\\" 1956) was made into a television film in 1978. In 2005 Swedish singer-songwriter (and orienteering expert) Erik de Vahl released a mellow song he composed and named after Fridell. The following excerpt from his novel Tack för mig – grottekvarn demonstrates Fridell's anarchist, but also very Swedish critique of the suffocating, crushing experience of intimate betrayal, excessively imposed upon workers as unfreedom cascades like a net from the controlling interest of the capitalist (concentrated wealth accumulation): \\"Imagine if I went to the employer tomorrow and said, 'I do not want to work today. I will snatch pike from the brook and laze me in the grassland, for I am a free person.' What do you think he would say? He would say I was mad, that I should be investigated or detained at a forced labor agency. I judge his judgment because he is a party to the matter and he loses financially if I celebrate but one day. But that's not the worst. Worse it is that everyone else becomes his avatar. My companions would say, 'Now Oskarsson has gone crazy again.' And in the barracks all the fools would huddle in the stairwells and pitch pointed words at my old lady, and the kids would ask my kids how it was with crazy Oskarsson! And the end of the whole thing would be my own wife crying, begging me to relent and, for her and the children's sake, to get back to work posthaste.\\" The dialogue suggests the character is struggling with the pain of betrayal, as he partially feminizes that traitorous net of inegalitarian social control. That associative feminization could work as a distraction from the inegalitarian distribution of sovereign agency that, Fridell also recognizes, directs that refracted, enveloping, and penetrating coercive power. Yet Fridell’s analysis, expressed in his creative work, does not point to human social interdependence—or even non-sovereign, delegated agency—as the root of unfreedom. Rather, the cause of unfreedom is the inegalitarian institution of ownership and control–as it dominates, enslaves, and turns against us our own human social interdependence. In capitalism, we are compelled to betray one another, and our own needs, usually for nothing other than the thoughtless maximization of elites’ relentless accumulation of wealth and rivalry with each other. In this way, our torturous social- and self- dissolution, our unmaking, is automated. That is one devastating price of absolute private property right and absolute elite liberty. Folke Fridell Conversely within this framework, heroism, which is not automated, consists in collectively devising and implementing interventions–deprioritizing capitalist and other rentier interests in control, exploitation, and appropriation–by which working people can regularly allow each other and themselves reasonable freedoms. Apart from fleeting, idiosyncratic moments of grace, heroic interventions cannot be uncontested, painless, or bloodless. But they restore to us our captured social network and ourselves. They restore to us our social human capacity to relieve our mortal, sentient suffering. Fridell died in 1985 at the age of 80 and is buried in the cemetery of Berga church in Lagan. Outside the library in Ljungby, a bronze bust of Folke Fridell commemorates his contributions to the development of literature, theory, working conditions, and human liberty in Sweden.

The walls of the medieval towns' marble with the gates were a common heraldic element that symbolized the city's independence, significance and power. In 1297-1330 when the Livonian Order became the Riga City Council, a new seal was created. The walls with the raised gates and the crossed keys remain from the old version, but with a different location. New heraldic elements, such as cross of the Livonian Order was inserted into the coat of arms to symbolize symbolising the dominance of the Livonian Order in Riga, and replaced the crossed staves. Other new element, a lion in the raised stone gates of the city, was added, which symbolises to the prowess of the townspeople and the growing independence of the citizens of Riga. This coat of arms was created in 1347 and has been preserved in a 1349 document stamp and is considered to be the basis for development of the Riga Coat of Arms. In 1554, the coat of arms of the city of Riga was supplemented with a new heraldic element, lions, as the shield holders of the coat of arms. In 1656, the city acquired the right to place the Swedish crown in its coat of arms as a form of gratitude from the for the heroic defense of the city during the siege of Russia. The color of the white coat of arms was changed to blue, but the order of the cross red color - with gold. Such coat of arms was kept in the Riga stamp seal until 1889. After the Northern War, when Riga was under the control of the Russian Empire, the Russian Tsarina Catherine II approved the coat of arms of Riga in 4 October 1788. The shield holders of the lions were replaced by the symbol of the Russian Empire - the two-headed eagle's, and the crown of the Monarch of Sweden with the Russian imperial crown. On October 31, 1925, with the approval of the President, Riga received a new coat of arms, the description of which is as follows: In the years of the Latvian SSR, there was little attention to the coat of arms of Riga, and the new coat of arms was approved on 15 February 1967, designed by Ivars Strautmanis. It had a coat of arms with a golden border in the color of the flag of the Latvian SSR, with a 2-tower-shaped silhouette of the city gate (the silhouette was added more details in 1987). Above the gate is 2 crossed keys and a yellow star. The establishment year of Riga, \\"1201\\", was added later in 1968, and was deleted in a 1987 revision, and was changed with the lions below the gate in 1988. Current coat of arms After Latvia regained independence, Riga regained its historical coat of arms, and the approval in 1925 was renewed in 1988.

Publication history It was first published in paperback in the United Kingdom by New English Library in October 1995. The first U.S. edition was published in hardcover by the Science Fiction Book Club in October 1999, with trade paperback and ebook editions following from Wildside Press in December 2003 and February 2014, respectively. The novel is an expansion of the author's 1991 novelette \\"To Become a Sorcerer,\\" which was nominated for the 1992 World Fantasy Award for Best Novella,D'Ammassa, Don. Review on Critical Mass. and was itself a preliminary nominee for the 1996 August Derleth Fantasy Award for Best Novel. Summary Young Sekenre lives in the marshes of the Riverland together with his sister and parents. His father Vashtem supports the family as the local magician—or so it appears. Actually, Vashtem is a sorcerer attempting both to deny his identity and hide from his enemies, and his children are pawns in his plot to cheat his dark fate when it ultimately catches up to him. There is a difference between magicians and sorcerers; the former merely channel magic, while the latter embody it, at a great price. Things come to a head when Vashtem inexplicably murders his wife and daughter, leaving his son Sekenre to seek vengeance and understanding with the aid of a Sybil who has her own agenda. A quest through the Underworld brings son and father to their reckoning, with justice meted out to Vashtem only at the cost of Sekenre taking on his curse. In killing a sorcerer, one takes on his power and immortality, absorbing his soul and knowledge, along with those of all those previously killed by that sorcerer and his predecessors. And one takes on their enemies, as well. Physically frozen at the age of a child, Sekenre may well live forever, if he can master his terrifying new powers, retain his sense of self and morality against the haunting spirits of his evil predecessors, and avoid being slain by foes inherited and newly gained. Relation to other works Schweitzer subsequently explored other events in the life of Sekenre in a cycle of short stories collected in Sekenre: The Book of the Sorcerer (2004), which serve as a sequel to the novel. Reception Don D'Ammassa rates the novel as \\"quite good fantasy adventure,\\" \\"truly inventive and fantastical,\\" in contrast to \\"[t]he latest pseudo-Medieval fantasy series.\\" He notes that \\"[t]he fantasy world isn't just a copy of one of the standard ones and there is actually depth to the characters.\\" The novel was also reviewed by Chris Gilmore in Interzone no. 105, March 1996, and Dan'l Danehy-Oakes in The New York Review of Science Fiction, February 2005.

He served in the Spanish–American War, Philippine–American War, and World War I, and he received the Distinguished Service Medal among several other awards. Biography Fasset was born on January 28, 1876, in Nashua, New Hampshire. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1897 and was commissioned into the infantry. Fasset served in the Spanish–American War in Santiago de Cuba, and he earned a Silver Star in that conflict. He then participated in the Philippine–American War. After serving in various positions in the United States, Fasset became the Chief of Staff of the 31st Infantry Division. After his promotion to the rank of brigadier general on October 1, 1918, Fasset assumed command of the 37th Infantry Brigade of the American Expeditionary Forces. In addition to receiving the Distinguished Service Medal for his performance, Belgium awarded him the Croix de Guerre and France awarded him the Legion of Honour. After reverting to his permanent rank of colonel, Fasset retired from the military in 1924. Congress restored his brigadier general rank in June 1930. As a retiree, Fasset raised citrus fruit in Florida, and he died in Orlando on March 23, 1958. Personal life Fasset never married.

He is currently Chair of the UK Government independent science advisory group on air pollution, the Defra Air Quality Expert Group.  Education  Lewis attended Sir Joseph Williamson's Mathematical School, Rochester, and then studied Chemistry at the University of Leeds followed by a PhD in atmospheric and analytical chemistry supervised by Prof. Mike Pilling CBE and Prof. Keith Bartle, awarded in 1995.  Research and career  He is known for his development of analytical chemistry methods that are applied to air pollution monitoring and atmospheric chemistry research, and particularly the use of gas chromatography to measure volatile organic compounds (VOCs). He was the first person to use comprehensive gas chromatography (GCxGC) to establish the complexity of volatile organic compounds found in urban air. He held a tenured academic appointment at the University of Leeds, as a joint appointment between the Schools of Chemistry and Earth & Environment before later moving to the Department of Chemistry at University of York in 2003. He currently works in the Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories at York. Between 2007 and 2012 Lewis worked part-time for the Natural Environment Research Council as their Theme Leader for research programmes in new technologies. In 2008 he was appointed as Director for Atmospheric Composition at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, and he remains one of three science directors, with specific responsibility for air pollution research. Lewis has been a member of the Defra Air Quality Expert Group (AQEG) since 2012 and has published a number of commentary articles on air pollution science and policy in the UK, US and China. He has also made a number of appearances on TV and radio discussing vehicle emissions and indoor air pollution. He has been widely quoted as skeptical about the value of air pollution removal schemes such as smog towers and roadside filter systems, and raised concerns about the wider environmental consequences of home air filtration. He has collaborated with Dr Peter Edwards at York to evaluate low cost air pollution sensor technologies and with Dr David Carslaw on diesel engine emissions. Although primarily an atmospheric chemist, he was named in a 2015 list of the World's 100 most influential analytical scientists. His research career was documented by the Science History Institute in 2011, part of series of interviews with atmospheric scientists.  Awards and honours  Lewis was awarded the Desty Memorial Prize in separation science in 2001, a Philip Leverhulme Prize in 'Earth Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences' in 2004, the SAC Silver Medal in 2007 from the Royal Society of Chemistry, and the John Jeyes Award of the RSC in 2012.
